rying to get the dead people to talk to 'em
With a little rigged up Bluetooth thing
With a feather kicking out of the back and you know

[Chorus 2]
They got Go-Gurts, 'cause this is America
We got some time to kill, and we need a thrill
So we die doing the dumbest of shit, here we go

[Verse 3]
We got a guy going sixty on a six-foot unicycle
Gunning down a road that is made of gravel
And he's barreling towards a hanging bag
That is full of flaming Go-Gurts and now he is dead

[Outro]
I said, "Hey now, this is America"

[Intro: Jaden Smith]
Crazy kids, understand
Out late, going crazy, kids innocent
Crazy kids, understand
Out late, going crazy, kids innocent

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
The girls just want fun
The boys, we make noise
The girls kiss the girls
I, thank God, ahh
The kids will be alright, just fine
I heard about all of the long trials in life
All the drugs on my mind
All the troubles I can find
Still, I smile
The kids will be alright, just fine
All the colors are alive
No longer black or white, ahh

[Verse: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, kiss the kids, call your baby daddy
Tell 'em who's daddy
Call your pappy, tell him that you happy
Shout it loud so they all know how you feel exactly
Inside sunny energize
Think about it like you feelin' alive
On the mama boy, she swear to God
Lady said that she ain't into guys
Brand new 'cedes with the intercom
Table made is for the dinner vibe
Ain't a killer so don't kill the vibe
Disrespect them, that's a different side
Adderall and alcohol (yeah)
The teachers called, the doctor called
The block too hot, the marshall called
See 'em grow and watch 'em crawl

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
Parents test the wine
The kids do the lines
Ahh, alright
Ahh, just fine
The kids turned out fine
The kids turned and run
I heard about all of the long trials in life
All the drugs on my mind
All the troubles I can find
Still, I smile
The kids will be alright, just fine
Smoke weed, pour a line
The kids turned out fine
I, pour a line
I, lose my mind

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, posted on the corner like a trapper, uh
Why he move his hands all around like a rapper? uh
Why he move his pants up and down like a scrapper? uh
(Testing, testing, uh-huh, listen)

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
My whole life I just wanted to be a rapper
Then I grewed up and the boy became a rapper
And my older sister made me wear the golden wrapper
She said, "Watch out, 'cause you know the hoes will trap ya"

[Break: A$AP Rocky & BlocBoy JB]
To the block—to—to—to the block
To the block, ayy, ayy, ayy
Don't know why
To the block—to—to—to the block
Word, word, word, word, word, word

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & BlocBoy JB]
Got my first pager, that was 1998
Sneaking, talking to my girlfriend way up late (Hello)
Mama on the mothafuckin' line, "Boy, you cray"
I was trappin' since a young nigga by the way
Back, way back then, boy, I was a different dude (Dude)
Standing on the corner like I ain't got shit to do (Do)
Nowadays (uh-huh) feelin' like I ain't got shit to prove (To prove)
All the beef is lookin' minuscule (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I modeled Dior, but I'm still a rapper (Yeah)
Took a little detour, but I'm still a rapper (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Used to be a D-boy but I'm still a rapper
My whole life I was livin' like a trapper (Trapper)
Shacked next to Casanova, locked up on the island
I don't brag about it 'cause it never really matter
Knew that I would never go back, don't hold back
Just shine my golden teeth
Just throw my dubs sack, that boof pack
That specimen, I could beef with OG beepers, nigga

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, posted on the corner like a trapper, uh
Why he move his hands all around like a rapper? Uh
Why he move his pants up and down like a scrapper? Uh
Uh, uh, uh-huh (testing, testing, testing)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky & BlocBoy JB]
All I ever wanted was some money and some jewels (Jewels)
Pray my YouTube reach a hundred million views (Million)
Pray I make a little extra cash for my dudes (Dudes)
Like all she ever wanted was some ass for her boobs
Sneaking, uh, why she freak you? (Freaky) uh, why she geeking?
Uh, when she see me (See me) why she kinky? Uh
Why she wanna be my— (I don't know why, nigga)
Twenty years later and God still ain't make no errors (Make it)
You could be authentic, it's just living trial and error (you gotta take it)
Sitting in the cell, just from snitching on your cello-phone
But cozy beeper all I needed (Hello) OG beeper all I needed (Hello)

[Outro: A$AP Rocky & BlocBoy JB]
My whole life I just wanted to be that nigga (Nigga)
All my ex-hoes, they was turning into strippers (Bitch)
Then the whole time they was fucking other niggas (What)
I paid no mind, I'm like fuck them other niggas (Fuck 'em)

[Verse 1]
Hold on, I thought that I could take it from here
Oh, I thought that I was calm in the clear
Now it's getting harder
Hold on, I thought that I was doing so well
Oh, like everything was under a spell
Now it's getting harder

[Chorus]
I never loved you fully in the way I could
I fought the current running just the way you would
And now I'm in the creek
And it's getting harder
I'm like falling water

[Verse 2]
Go on and tell me just what I'm supposed to say
As if it could be any other way
Oh, it's getting louder
Go on and tell me just how I could allow
All that's light to end up somehow
Where it's getting darker

[Chorus]
I never loved you fully in the way I could
I fought the current running just the way you would
And now I'm stuck upstream
And it's getting harder
I'm like falling water, falling water, falling water

[Bridge]
And I'm like falling water, set me free
You were like falling water coming down on me

[Chorus]
I never loved you fully in the way I could
And I'm like falling water, set me free
I fought the current running just the way you would
You were like falling water coming down on me
And now I'm in the creek
And I'm like falling water, set me free
You were like falling water coming down on me

[Outro]
I never gave you everything, I wish I could
And it was coming down on me
I should've seen it coming from where you stood
And I was standing in the creek
But now I'm in the creek
And I'm like falling water, set me free
You were like falling water coming down on me
And I'm like falling water, set me free
You were like falling water coming down on me
And it's getting harder
And it was coming down on me
And I was standing in the creek
You were like falling water
I was like falling water in the creek

[Verse 1]
Open your mouth wide
The universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
"So why does this still hurt?"
Don't blow your mind with whys

[Bridge]
Oooooh

[Verse 2]
I'm moving out of orbit (Turning in somersaults)
Turning in somersaults (A giant turtle's eyes)
A giant turtle's eyes (As jellyfish float by)
As jellyfish float by

[Outro]
It's what keeps me alive

[Verse 1]
The Moonies are up on the mountain
The lunatics have taken over the asylum
Waiting on the rapture
Singing, "We're here
To keep your prices down
Feed you to the hounds
To the Daily Mail”
Together, together

[Verse 2]
You made a pig's ear
You made a rude mistake
Paid off security
And got through the gate
You got away with it
But we lie in wait
Hey hey, hey hey hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey

[Verse 3]
Where's the truth, what's the use
I'm hanging around, lost and found
With your head in the sand
Fat chance, no plan
No regard for human life
Keep trying, you’ve no right
Fast and loose, win or lose
Jumped the queue, go back again
President for life
Lord of all the flies in the sky
The beasts of the earth, the fish in the sea
You’ve lost command
Hey hey, hey hey hey
Uh uh, uh uh uh
Uh uh uh

[Verse 1]
Turned so nasty now
The dark's there
The pillar of my soul
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell

[Chorus]
Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease, and you're such a flirt
Once you've been around you've been around enough
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never living earnest, never get judged
I don't know where it is I should look

[Verse 2]
Your clue on hold
The flag and pole
I’m curling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal

[Bridge]
Obligations
Complications
Routines and schedules
A job that killed you, killed you

[Chorus]
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never living earnest, never get judged
I don't know where it is I should look
Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease, and you're such a flirt

[Verse 1]
Sleight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fantasized
No one gets hurt
You've done nothing wrong

[Verse 2]
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear
And innocent
The water's clear
And innocent

[Chorus]
It's like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
The sweetest flowered fruits were hanging from the trees
Falling off the giant bird that's been carrying me
It's like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream

[Verse 1]
Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
I've my heart
In my mouth

[Chorus]
Like I'm fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

[Verse 2]
And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water
Fallen off a giant bird that's been carrying me
(Did so much, did so much)

[Verse 3]
I fell open, I lay under
At the tip I lost your number
I wanna slip over
And get back under

[Bridge]
And if you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over (Wake me up)
Then you're wrong (Wake me up)
If you think this is over (Wake me up)
Then you're wrong (Wake me up)

[Chorus]
Like I'm fallen out of bed (Wake me up)
From a long and vivid dream (Wake me up)
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying (Wake me up, wake me up)

[Outro]
When at last, you give in
When at last, you give in
Wake me up, wake me up
Wake me up, wake me up
Wake me up, wake me up
Wake me up, wake me up

[Verse 1]
I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove
And cut me off
And cut me off

[Refrain]
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
Tonight I'll set you free
I'll set you free

[Chorus]
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart

[Verse 2]
We will shrink and we'll be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want

[Refrain]
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I set you free

[Bridge]
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
Bird that’s flown into my room

[Chorus]
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around a pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart

[Verse 1]
A walk down the staircase, a magnetic pull
Back to the other place, where I cannot go
I'm sending a chopper, to steal you away

[Chorus]
The pot is full, let me take control
Let me take control
The pot is full of secrets to be told
Secrets to be told

[Verse 2]
I have always and always will

[Chorus]
The pot is full, let me take control
Let me take control
The pot is full of secrets to be told
Secrets to be told

[Verse 1]
You got some nerve coming here
You got some nerve coming here
You stole it all, give it back
You stole it all, give it back

[Chorus]
Good morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
And took my memory

[Bridge]
No no no no no no no

[Verse 2]
You know you should, but you don't
You know you should, but you don't

[Chorus]
Good morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
Took my melody

[Intro]
Don't hurt me, don't haunt me
Don't hurt me, don't haunt me
Don't hurt me

[Verse 1]
Gather up the lost and their souls (Don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
Gather up the pitiful (Don't hurt me, don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)

[Verse 2]
(Into your arms)
What seems impossible (Don't hurt me, don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
Into your arms
I think I have had my fill (Don't hurt me, don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
I think I should give up the ghost
(Don't hurt me, don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me, don't haunt me)

[Outro]
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)

[Verse 1]
Supercollider
Dust in a moment
Particles scatter
Coming up from the soup
Swimming upstream
Before the heavens crack open
Thin pixelations
Coming up from the dust
In a blue light
In a green light
In a half light
In a work light
I'm a B-spin
Flip-flopping
I'm a pulse wave
Outstepping

[Chorus]
I put the shadows back into their boxes

[Verse 2]
I am open
I am welcome
For a fraction
Of a second
I have jettisoned(Supercollider)
My illusions(Dust in a moment)
I have dislodged(Particles scatter)
My depressions(Parting out from the soup)

[Chorus]
I put the shadows back into their boxes
I put the shadows back into their boxes

[Outro]
I see angels hanging over the balcony
I see angels hanging over the balcony
I see angels hanging over the balcony

[Verse 1]
What is freedom but a fleeting notion
Is this reality or just emotion
I would rather be a giver then
Be apart of hurting you again

[Chorus 1]
I want to be conformed to love, show me what to do again
Show me to win your love
I want to be conformed to love
So I can perform love

[Verse 2]
My impatience is the part of me
That I realize you hate you say
It complicates the very art of you
Show me what ought to do
I want to be comformed to love
So I can perform love

[Chorus 2]
My Beloved is the greatest Love, yes!
I think of him all the time
My beloved is the greatest love
Please make up my mind
I want to be conformed to love
So I can make more love
I want to be pure pure love
So I can restore love
So I can make more love
So I can be sure love
Help me be secure love
So I can make more love
So I can restore love

[Outro: Talking]
That is the objective, to be conformed to love, to actually be love incarnate
Because that is what I was before, but ya'll got that I think
To be love incarnate, and to not listen to people who might say there's something wrong with being love, you know. I'll give you an example:

You talked about professionalism
But what does professionalism have to do with a real exchange
You are as professional as you have to be right now
You are as professional as you need to be
Your sincerity has offended me in any way
It hasn't confused or complicated things
If anything it's broken down and made the environment more comfortable for everyone else
What did it do, what was the cost of your lack of professionalsim, your so called lack of professionalism, because I don't call it that
I believe a world can exist on honesty, I just do, you know. I'm a believer

[Part I]

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & Devonté Hynes]
Look, I got a text from this girl I used to see
Sayin' that she chose this other guy with whom she wanna be with
Look, I apologize, but this message fucked me up
Then I would skeet-skeet every girl after replying, "Best of luck to ya"
Fast forward couple months I'm like, "Wassup witcha?"
'Cause somethin' changed I know ya feel it (Feel it)
But really it's been a lil' minute
Ain't nothin' changed but the address
My neighbors hate how I be livin' (Livin')
Mad it's a loud rich nigga in the buildin'
Like fuck all the other tenants (Runnin')
Bought mines, boy, you rentin' (Runnin')
Rich niggas in their feelings (Runnin')

Bags packed, knapsack packed like I'm leavin' home
They ain't wanna let me go, I guess you need me more
I was on the road on tour (Tour)
She just said I changed for the worst (She just said I changed)
Rain flags, rain backs, fact guess you need it more
Had to let your heart go, I guess you need it more

[Bridge 2: A$AP Rocky and MGMT]
I'm going through changes
Sweetest smile
Always changing phases
Upside down

I'll be cruel to you
I'm going through changes
Don't know if you love me or not

So far I done been and feelin' change, changes

[Part III]

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
My biggest distraction is that I get distracted
People suing me for shit that didn't happen
I wonder how the world would be if they didn't have me
(Fuck this shit)
Wake up to my explore page
See my exes engaged, or either gettin' married
Or had a baby with some nigga
Or either three months, post-natal, postin' up that little nigga papi
I wonder if they really happy or just gettin' at me

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & MGMT]
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me
Change, she could feel a change in me
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me
Change, she could feel a change in me
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me

To the cathedral, tux like I'm married (Like I'm married, yeah)

Ending

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
I've been busy (Busy, busy)
I've been fuckin' busy, I've been busy fuckin'
I've been all kinds of busy, or sorta kinda busy
Like shorty is we fuckin'? Well if not then fuck it
Apologies to the fam, we thought we ducked 'em
Said I was in a rush but I was busy rushin'
It's busy shit, busy that, busy this
And I need a minute (Hold on)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, A$AP Rocky, and Frank Ocean]
See this what that voice in your head says
When you try to get peace of mind
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Ooh, going to find)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (I'm going to find)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean & Lauryn Hill]
Spendin' time spinnin' out toward a desire that wasn't pure
Born before the virus was cured, pitch perfect, violins on the floor
Fast forward, linings on my skull (this what that voice in your head says when you try to get piece of mind)
This the type of design I could afford
Fast forward, bands out
Got they hands out like they acknowledgin' the Führer (I gotta f-)
I rewind, Nas track 6, rewind dance crazes
Read my mind, freed my mind, feed my mind, makes sense
Just like mirrors on the wall, just like sittin' on me (this what that voice in your head says when you try to get piece of mind)
Raw in mirrors seen it all, could make two, a piece of mind (I gotta f-)
Flickin' ash, pourin' a half, don't pour in a glass
Pour it in foam, this white got eggshells in my omelet
My earlobes, they yellow like the yolk is runnin'
Brain on drugs, I still ain't got no peace of mind, fuck
Woof, woof—dogs in the place, loose tooth—lost in the fray
Roof lost on the Wraith, roof lost on the way
Freeway, no Rozay, brute force, Brüt champagne
Tell the front desk to cut new keys
Reserved in the Mercer for two years, in two suites
Took out the bed like it's fuck sleep
I'll smack a bitch like it's hot hands
Fired the label like fuck brands
Comfortable low nigga, fuck Xans
Comfortable slow, who the fuck ran
Nothin' is sweet, nothin' in tank sweet, it's just a tank P
Salt on a slug, soda on slugged teeth, chewing on nothing
You're tweakin' or somethin', you're reachin' for somethin'
You're speakin', speak up then, you're thinkin', you’re overthinkin'
One blink and I'm pre-cummin'
That could turn every no one into someone

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Frank Ocean and  A$AP Rocky]
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Ohh, do do, do do, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Oh, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Oh, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (You make my desire pure)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (You make my desire pure)
I just need peace of mind for my purity
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky and Lauryn Hill]
Memories burn the roaches
Cheer Hennessy for my old heads
Amphetamines for the dosage
Keepin' me up and focused
Jewelry cloth, my gold caps
NY throwback like the old Fab (I'm undone because)
Lost in the Google Maps in your iMac, think my phone tapped
Hold up, hold that (Hold on, my nigga, hold that—) (I'm undone because) thought
Nigga, pour up soda, nigga, hold that cough, tryna hold back
The call had dropped when the FaceTime paused , (I'm undone because) don't call back
Can't cope when your heart broke
Soft-spoken, roll somethin', cop somethin', Narco
Saint like Joan of Arc, bro, ring barcode
Two of everything, should have been to blame when Noah's Ark broke (I'm undone because)
Two more drinks of everything before the bar closed
Face-to-face with my demons at a barstool
Haven't checked on my niece in weeks
Months past and months in between since me and my sister would speak
Not a call or visit in weeks
Lost nothin' since September
Last seen her September '16
Man it feels like (I'm undone because)
Lose someone every release, it feels like the curse is in me (A$AP)
Press is gone and I grief, I share with you my peace

[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
"I'm undone because—"
"I'm undone because—"

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
All year long bruh, stuck up in my zone all by my lonesome
Pay the hoe my dues, I brought my own funds
When it's time to war, I brought my own gun
Difference is I'm ghetto but I'm wholesome
Nigga say I switched up like I'm on some
Why you always treat me like I owe some?
Truthfully you only wanna hold some
Whip it like I've been a slave
Bucking from the twelve like I've been afraid
Motorola, burn out, couple minutes saved
Kept a pre-paid on my hip them days
143rd in front on Minisink, Cam'ron had us wearing pink
From the cradle to the grave, put in work
Hustled 'round the corner where my nana stay, couldn't work
Open up shop in front the corner store, make 'em renovate
Where the killers stand, fuck a lemonade
But they cook it by the Minute Maid, couple niggas hate
But the best form of flattery is when you imi-
When you imitate, ayy

[Chorus: Dev Hynes & A$AP Rocky]
Tell me how it gonna be
Get like me, tell me how it's gonna, how it's gonna be
Tell me how it gonna be

I'ma have a ball, I'ma cop it all, I'ma buy the store (Oh)
I'ma go ball, cradle to the grave (Tell me how it's gonna)
Busy gettin' paid, niggas don't shade, nigga I'ma have it–

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
With my back against the wall, nigga, I'ma ball
Show you how to mob, got it with the squad (Yeah)
Never had a job, but I kept a broad
When I went in Saks, went and copped it all
My cougars had me lit, kept a PYT
Your mama on my dick, prettier than a bitch
And I'm overseas, and I had a ball
Seein' overseas hoes (Really litty lit, uh)
We ain't counterfeit like we have face tats, how you name go when
Where your hoes? Why your chain don't spin?
Light them up, really like 'em all
Nigga like it all, nigga like it, tell her get like me

[Chorus: Dev Hynes & A$AP Rocky]

That sounds good and everything but the top of you changed
Look at your phone as tool not an obligation.    Would you walk around with a hammer in your pocket?    You would pick up a hammer when you needed it   you would never be addicted or obligated to it.  Use your phone like a hammer only pick it up when you need it.

there was a time when we completely operated without phones.  We're addicted to our phones.

Google dopamine

the century of self   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ3RzGoQC4s …        It’s 4 hours long but you’ll get the gist in the first 20 minutes      Basically Sigmund Frued’s nephew Edward Bernays capitalized off of his uncle’s philosophies and created modern day consumerism

before Edward Bernays Americans purchased things based off needs       There was a a time in the 20s when women didn’t smoke in public so Edward Bernays masterminded a campaign to make it culturally acceptable so that companies could sell more cigarettes..it’s that kind of vibe..

[Verse]
I put the feline in my hair, looking like a cheetah pet
And you know they getting green if a flower on they neck
If a flower on they neck hit Clancy on the text
I ain't tryna check a bag, can we get another jet?
I ain't gassin' niggas up, but that fuel is 50 grand
Passionfruit in D.R., had me drippin' in the sand
New nigga from New York, I'ma give him sticky hands
Sticky fingers from the green, Jasper playing with them grams
They was playing at the Gramm's, one nom ain't enough
I'm a make sure that that shit ain't happening again, yuh
Golf boys, it's them golf boys
In that 12 seater wings looking like a hawk boy
Getting to the paper better re-up on the chalkboard
'Cause the student turned into the teacher
Don't talk boy, class in session
1 through 5, I'm a 7
I'm a god, nigga, ask your reverend
And that crib in Bel-Air is heaven
Hot-coco outta chinas, nigga, pass the beverage, yuh
Comme Des on that hombre
Haters with the long face
New whip is Pirelli tired like a long day
Big dollars, the scent Prada
Skinny nigga also big poppa, women they adore me
If you see me out in public, no pictures, don't record me
I don't really fuck with y'all niggas, selfish at the orgy, uh

[Outro]
Bitch
One take
Yuh

[Chorus]
I'm not tryna
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car
I'm not tryna
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car

[Verse 1]
You're used to men
Tryna get in
Into your body
Before you're ready
I'm not quite like them
A conditional friend
Waitin' to unlock you
I'm not tryna rock you, no

[Chorus]
I'm not tryna
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car
I'm not tryna
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car

[Verse 2]
Your guard is up
Though you wanna be touched
So you play a little game
'Cause you don't wanna be shamed
You push me back
Then you tell me how much you "want me bad"
What about my desires?
I want more than fire

[Chorus]
I'm not tryna
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car
I'm not tryna
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car

[Verse 1]
I remember the days
That were so far gone
You don't seem to feel the way
I do, it sucks 'cause

[Verse 2]
When we've gotta leave this place
We're gonna miss it
Crazy you don't even know
That you've been distant

[Chorus 1]
So I made a quick decision
With friends all by the door
You stood there in the kitchen with your
Eyes fixed on the floor
The logical solution you'd ignore
You always wanted more than this

[Verse 3]
There wasn't a turning point
That I could think of
It was just another day
Where we all linked up

[Verse 4]
Now it's clear what's happening
And I'm so bummed out
Wasting all my energy
So you might calm down

[Chorus 2]
But you make the same decisions
And you left us at the door
You're sitting in the kitchen with your
Eyes fixed on the floor
The logical solution you'd ignore
You always wanted more than this
People try to bring you down
Before you're even off the ground
But keep rising, hmm, hmm

People try to bring you down
But know that you're on solid ground
And keep rising, keep rising

People say they'll do things for you
That they have no intention to
Just keep rising, keep rising

People will treat you so bad
And then get mad that you are sad
But keep rising

Keep rise on, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh

People try to be your friend
And leave you alone in the very end
But keep rising, keep rising
And people say they're with you
And then desert you
Just keep rising, just keep rising

Have a solid heart and a clear mind
And in time you will find
That you're rising

And just keep rise on, oh, ooh, ooh
Nah ah ah ah, ooh
No, hmm
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh

People try to bring you down
Before you're even off the ground
But keep rising, keep rising

People try to bring you down
But know that you're on solid ground
And keep rising

Ooh, ooh, keep rising

I gotta ball for my dead homies
I gotta ball for my dead homies
I count this bread for my dead homies

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar, SZA & Both]
Smoking dodo in your mama house
She get off work early, cussing at us, and kick us out
Popping wheelies on aqueducts in the summer
We stealing minibikes whistle when Gonzalez was coming
And I remember Shaniqua gave you the cold shoulder
Says she don't fuck with niggas that's chirping on Boost Mobiles
I'm laughing at you and praying that the choppers don't catch you (Never catch me, never
Never catch me, never
Never catch me, never)
We ditching third period just to fuck your school up
We know where you from homie, uniforms can't fool us
Chalk it up like you s'posed
Cornrows with the zags in the middle
Platinum FUBU jeans, rubber bands wrapped around the denim
I remember...
(Ooh, I remember)
I can feel when you around
You forever hold it down
I return the favor when I'm on stages
In love and memory, no enemy could separate us
And so I gotta say this
How I'm laughing, now I'm crying, I miss you (I miss you)
How I fought you, I hugged you, I remember (Oh, I remember)
I love it even if I get no bigger
You're forever my dawg, my nigga
I'm in this club thinking 'bout my boys
As I cry tears of joy like
Woo-woo-woo-woo
(Woo-woo-woo-woo)
Woo-woo-woo-woo
Pushing foreigns, flying cars
Poppin' trophies, by the mall
Bring back Derek, Stunna Deuce
Pat Dawg that's my cousin, love him too

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar, Kendrick Lamar & SZA]
Wishing I could reverse, us patrolling the turf
Tam's burger for breakfast, chili fries on my shirt
Granny said go to church, how often did we listen?
Sunday school wasn't cool, let's be getting at bitches
Aw man, I got weight on my shoulder
Aw man, I got
Aw man, I got so many angels to feed
Look to the heavens, they depend on me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar, SZA & Both]
This personal, I hope you know my loyalty
Will always run deep
So I put it down two times
When I'm on these beats
Put my candle in the street
Put my faith in where you at
Gone, but you're not forgotten
Chad, I promise I'll be back
I'm saying
I'm laughing, I'm crying, I miss you (I miss you)
I fought you, I hugged you, I remember (Ooh, I remember)
I love it even if I get no bigger
You're forever my dawg, my nigga
I'm in this club thinking 'bout my boys
As I cry tears of joy like
Woo-woo-woo-woo

Ba-Ba, bow-bow)
You can't change the world if you can't change yourself (I am)
You can please the world, but not God himself (I am)
You can have the world and still need some help (I am)
You outlast the world, if your heart is real (I am)
You can't change the world if you can't change yourself (I am)
You can please the world, but not God himself (I am)
You can have the world and still need some help (I am)
You outlast the world, if your heart is real (I am)

Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & FKA twigs]
Blunt smoke, smoke weed, codeine, cough
Tell that bitch that I'm awesome, better back the fuck up off me
Coco, Céline, Tiffany, she flossing (Oh)
Ain't concerned with who bought these
Can't forget that she bossy
When y'all was buying surfboards trying to ride the wave
I was cooking up another fucking tidal wave (Brrr)
Had to get entitled motherfuckers out the way
Had to take another title, sorry for the wait (Oop)
Barely ever took a break on, fashion like my time need
More hours in a day, I apologize if I'm late
Tap the vein, whoa, barely look like I'm awake
Darker shades, bluer veins, bluer money in the bankroll

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'

When I was young and living homeless

Eyes lookin' like he rollin'
Got new bags under my eyelids
New bags up in my closets
New bags like I went shoppin'
New bags on new bags
Mind's better at seeing two now (Ah, down)
Needing up on my downtime (Down, down)
Hit the waves with the new sound (Down, down)
House tunes but it's screwed down
That's dope (Sauce)
Take a sec to thank the Lord, 'nother one to call my folks
Hit my momma on the phone, she like "Son, you the boss" (Ah)
Focus, don't get caught up in the moment (Ah)
Can't forget that I'm golden, don't forget that I'm chosen

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it

[Verse 3: FKA Twigs]
They called me a bitch, burned me like saffron
My matter is golden, a child of the Odyssey
My touch is righteous, like virus my Midas
I'm golden
He told me when I'm present, chosen
So hold me tight, I swear, I'm golden

[Outro: A$AP Rocky and FKA twigs]
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin' (Golden)
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going (Ahh, yeah)

Got a warrant so I put that shit in sport, yeah (Sport, yeah)
I lost so many of my niggas on the off-street (Off-street)
I can't believe some of my niggas double-crossed me
Shit is hard and I'm broken, but I cope
I fit a 35 in the backwood when I smoke
And niggas askin' why I smoke so many blunts, huh?
Because these backwoods and these blunts are full of numb, huh
And all this Actavis and drank, it make me numb, huh
The only time I feel at peace is when I'm dumb high
I keep the flashy Jesus pieces when I stunt now
I keep a quarter-million pieces when I stunt now
Them dumb ass teachers and police said I'd be nothin', huh?
I ducked the Priest and chased my dreams and now his son's hot
That Wraith ain't rented, when I pull up man it's sun hot
I'm movin' geetchie with bitches, they be out buggin' now
Talkin' with opinions, all they got is opinions
I'm back and forth in millions, all y'all pussy niggas my minions
I spend days in Givenchy, Mama told me I would get it
I kept a .30 on me long and it had the extension
These niggas did me dirty, no I can't speak on friendship
I can't speak on this tension, spent most the year suspended
Bitch, I came from the bottom, finna head to the tippy
One thing a nigga noticed, I gotta get it, that's why it's a

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Lotta money talk, it's hard to understand me (Understand me)
Big bank, so I moved it to Miami (To Miami)
I done hit 100 licks in the Camry
Tryna make these pussy niggas understand me (Understand me)
Lotta money talk, it's hard to understand me (Understand me)
Big bank, so I moved it to Miami (To Miami)
I done made a lot of moves in the Cam'
You know gangstas don't die, they get chubby and they move to
Miami, Miami, Miami

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Oh, I done made myself a livin'
I been dodgin' the sentence
I asked God for forgiveness
Then I put rose gold on the tennis
I told 'em put a hold on the hearing
It's a 58 on the engine
Feel like I'm in a race for these millions
Put it in the safe for the business
Walk with a hundred K in the denim
I know why he got hate in his feelings
These niggas want the wave I invented
I'm gonna cop a Wraith and a Bentley
Dolce and Gabana, Gunna drippin'
Plus I'm getting this money independent
Top off in the summer 'cause we winnin'
Windows up and we breezy
VVS from Eliantte and my pearls came from CC
Bal Harbour shopping spree anytime I'm in Miami
Hope to see my people face when I make it to the Grammys
Park the Yacht next to the dock and we hoppin' on a Jetski
Bought the racks for my Rollie watch, see me shinin' from the nosebleeds
Pour the syrup in my soda pop, I hope I never OD
They steal the drip when my pictures drop, they lookin' like the old me
And I bought a jacket, M.I.A, I'm with my dog
I painted a picture, you can frame it on a wall, yeah
I made her my bitch and painted the insides of her walls, yeah
Got a bank account and fill it with M's so we can ball

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Lotta money talk, it's hard to understand me (Understand me)
Big bank, so I moved it to Miami (To Miami)
I done hit 100 licks in the Camry
Tryna make these pussy niggas understand me (Understand me)
Lotta money talk, it's hard to understand me (Understand me)
Big bank, so I moved it to Miami (To Miami)
I done made a lot of moves in the Cam'
You know gangstas don't die, they get chubby and they move to Miami

[Intro]
Yeah
Oh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Everybody said that you let me down
Hesitation bring the "you" around
Makes no difference what you used to do

[Chorus]
I could never be ashamed of you
I could never
I could never

[Verse 2]
Maybe you were reckless yesterday
I'm convinced you know a better way, I know it
Some would judge based on what you've been through but

[Chorus]
I could never be ashamed of you
I could never
I, I could never (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
You've told me things
Harsh truth to my face
I've been told to walk away (just know)
I could never
Things that I would choose to do with you if I had time though
Thousand times I fucked you in my mind, trust me I know

[Verse 4: Jorja Smith]
Everybody said that I let you down
And let the truth but I can still be found, yeah
Lost my way and only you were there

[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
Could you ever be ashamed of me?
Could you ever, yeah
Could you ever
Could you ever be ashamed of me?

[Verse 5: Jorja Smith]
Sometimes I ask how you could ever want me
How could you choose that you would ever love me
Yours were the truest eyes I'd ever seen
To be in a stare right back at me

[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
Could you ever be ashamed of me, yeah
Could you ever
Could you ever
Could you ever be ashamed of me, yeah
Could you ever

[Outro: Jorja Smith]
Why can't you ever

[Verse]
Uh, uh, it's twenty years of swag, y'all just witnessed
Let me remind everybody who Will Smith is
Rappers make it rain, let they money hit ya
If I throw my money up, shit, I'd probably kill a stripper
The illest, realest, Big Will-est
Down with the man in charge of where Uncle Phil is
Everybody wanna do Will Smith numbers
I don't know if your life got that many summers
I got inspired, quickly, I unretired, the Fresh Prince just re-wired
I'm slightly modified, but still
People dancing and shaking and moving and wiling
I feel like I'm an alien, really, kind of an island
I might fly to China for nothing, find a designer
Fix up a crib with me, my mom and Obama
Murder all over the globe, guilty, your honor
Rather become a Mormon, marrying Halle, Rihanna
I'm an anomaly, do drama or comedy
I could play Muhammud Ali or a white lady probably
Still, twenty years of swag y'all just witnessed
Stop the divorce rumors and mind your damn business
Rebirth of the click track, ridiculous
What I charge for a feature, man, that's expensive
Cause y'all be doing features, I be doing Features
So many tickets that theaters need bleachers
More information from me than from most teachers
More inspiration from me than from most preachers
But wait, wait, wait, wait, truly, just for the record
Directors make movies, I make directors
Y'all dinner table: "What y'all learn today?"
My dinner table: "What y'all earn today?"
The real life Incredibles, last name Smith
Jada, Jaden, Willow, Trey, shit, y'all ain't fucking with my clique

[Verse 1]
Head below the surface of a frozen lake
Let in the black water, let it seep into my brain
God around your neck, though he never did too much for you
I wish I knew him better, though I don't think there's much he'd wanna do

[Chorus]
I'm not yours
Know when I mean it
I'm not wasted anymore

[Verse 2]
Another night's impatience in an endless, perfect world
When morning bleeds into the golden dream just like before
Tomorrow I'll feel differently but my mind will be made up
In times when I could buy your love but I don't think that I have enough

[Chorus]
I'm not yours
Know when I mean it
I'm not wasted anymore

[Outro]
Stupid, stupid, stupid me, me, me, me

[Verse 1]
Don't even wanna fix it now
Should know better than to wait around
All in a haze
Couldn't shake it for the rest of the day

And if you shoot it down
You better get back up
You better get back up

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry babe, that's not where I'm at
Shouldn't be here when you get back
Just to stand in line
Wait for you and then waste my time

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you spill your guts
And try new clothes
And try new clothes

[Chorus]
I'm in full control
I'm not lost
Even when it's love
Even when it's not

[Verse 3]
Hold your breath when you hold the door
I never think about it anymore
Now when I lay back
It goes to nothing or it goes to black

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you spill your guts
I hope he's enough
I hope he's enough

[Chorus]
In full control
I'm not lost
Even when it's love
Even when it's not

[Outro]
Even when it's love
Even when it's love
Even when it's love
Even though it's not

[Verse 1]
Deep sea dive
Got down, but you stayed alive
It's only you down there
You and the bends
Lose your mind
Lose track of breathing in time
It's only you down there
Sleep with the tides

[Chorus]
We can be anyone
It took so long to know someone like you
And age in the dying sun
Wake only to bathe in greens and blues

[Verse 2]
Die, my love
Breathe in twos and fours
To know what's worth breathing for
Some days it's easier than falling asleep

[Chorus]
We can be anyone
It took so long to know someone like you
And age in the dying sun
Wake only to bathe in greens and blues

[Verse 1]
Go
Get it all
Let 'em watch
Let it fall
Nameless
Sweat it out
They don't love you
Do they?
And I
Carved your name
In the white
Dulling day
Couldn't believe
You were gone
Do you love me?

[Chorus]
And the passing phases feel the same
Though you've got so much to do
In the end you could waste your whole life anyways
And I want better for you

[Verse 2]
Grace
Born and raised
Cut you down
Still bleeds the same
As it is
Unusually
Are you hung up?
Or do you love me?

[Chorus]
And the passing faces look the same
Though they don't know you
In the end you could waste your whole life anyways
But I want better for you

[Outro]
And I'm not in love with your absence
'Cause I have fallen so hard for the space
And I've gotten to know the quiet
And still, for you, anytime
Still, for you, anytime
And still, for you, anytime

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Young man, brotha brotha, you gotta fight for somethin'
Stand for somethin', gotta understand, gotta make the plays
Stick to it, get through, write yours, ride your wave, just keep it true
We'll fight the blues, we'll fight the blues
Brotha man, young man, let me tell you somethin'
Young man, brotha man, brotha man
You gotta fight for somethin', stand for somethin'
That's what the poem told me
It was a greater poet like you know it but
I'd rather talk about how my neck is frozen and I
I'd write a song about the banging hoes and then
Stay up in the bitches while she dozing

[Chorus: French Montana]
When I went to my brotha, told him, "Help me please"
Now we hop out the PJs posted by the P
My old bitch yellin', "Come back, come back
Come back, babe
Come back (Come back) come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back) babe"

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky & Snoop Dogg]
Harlem nights, quick speed, Godspeed
Speed of light, Grease Lightnin', leather on my six-speed bike
Bicycle tires, icicle diamonds, popsicle stripes
Pop (Sicles) pop (Sicles) for the Klondikes
Pop-pop wheelies on the dirty bikes, 15 sellin' China white
Cops stoppin' if you opposite of white
Pop, pop like you opposite of right
Take heed, lil' nigga, lowkey, take lead on them niggas

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky & Frank Ocean]
Smooth dude riding 'round the boulevard
Back in the days was on the train
Ride the bus before I ride another nigga wave
Beautiful, the water's flat like asses pre-Onika (Yeah)
You the smaller version, you the baby sneaker

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Flacko, I wonder how it feel to live or be like you
Album number three and keep it G like Q
Heard you niggas get fly like G, like 2
Nah, more like 4, like 3, not 2
Shittin' on these niggas like P, like U
Drip Raheem and Q, got Hi-C like juice
Mama hubby got life, he got three strikes too
Real niggas bleed like me, like you
That's why I got a beam with a green light too
I don't even make a scene, I just swing right through
I'm just stayin' on my Qs and my Ps like soup
Walkin' in my shoes, follow me like suit

[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Brotha man, young man, let me tell you somethin'
Young man, brotha-brotha, gotta fight for somethin'
Stand for somethin', brotha understand, God don't make the plays
Take the truth, get through, ride your wave, just keep the truth

[Chorus: French Montana & Frank Ocean]
Remember when I went to my brotha, told him, "Help me please"
Now we hop out the PJs, posted by the P
My old bitch yellin', "Come back, come back
Come back, babe
Come back (Come back) come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back) babe"

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
You're a cornstar, all you fuck is corn broads (You fucking pop)
Frenchie faux pas 'cause you ain't had no pa
Your deal got catches like an outfielder
(Are you, are you, are you?)
Getting that God's view from towers
Lookin' downward like I'm Donald Trump

[Intro: Joba]
Baby child
Lift your head and free your mind
Open up your eyes, and you'll find you will fly
Just smile sometime
Welcome to the real world

[Verse 1: Joba]
Everybody pray for peace when they don't have the power
A disconnect of intellect
Know some people packing straps, you could call 'em cowards
The realest Gs I ever met
Not on the gangster shit, not on the paper shit
Just on that have to provide for my kids and shit
There's blood on the streets
And if I had a dream, I would do anything, I make mistakes
The shit that you hear about ain't just in movies
Dog, I've seen some shit
Bag 'em up in body bags, zip 'em up and send 'em
Away from the kids
I know good felons, good drug dealers, good people
Bad system, bad people
With power
If you gotta dream and you know what that means
You can do anything, just make a change

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Sometimes I think back to the ninth-grade campus
When that white boy made fun of my lips
I should've thrown a tantrum
But I remained cool 'cause he was way too handsome
Now I'm out in Beverly Hills using a mansion as my canvas
I bought a helicopter, threw that bitch on stage
RCA gave us money, we ain't throw it away
We took that shit, we flipped that shit
We made this company pop
They like me, I want 'em to love me like them niggas love Pac
I'm De La Soul meets Tribe Called Quest meets Oasis inside a G-Unit vest
I moved way out to the Westside
But still got the South in my heart
They murdered Selena, now them niggas looking for God
Dressed like a soldier, told ya, they don't know who we are
My vest is on, let 'em know we ready for war
In the club with my boyfriend
We paranoid 'cause, we might get popped
'Cause a nigga on some bullshit
Why you wanna hate me now or ask the skies to lay me down?
I hear my brother praying now, I really need an angel now
Some type of holy savior
Ayo, Dad, I need me a favor, could you pick me up later, later, later?

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I've been exploring through the Joyful
The Sorrowful and Glorious Mysteries
Historians romanticize notorious victories
The visions say the scorpion was born as a centipede
That partnered with the succulents to poison their enemies
I tap in time like telegrams with telepathy
To share the bare necessities of all my discrepancies
Can't save my Macbook pages spillin' onto the melody
'Cause the margins 'round the pen
Couldn't keep up with my head again, uh
I kept that devil in my sights to never fall behind
That's how we always stay ahead, the flaw of my design
The higher that you climb, the more destructive your decline
I’m well aware that all this didn’t have to quantify
So tell me if you really think it's unrealistic
Here at this point for me to not prepare and arm our district
They shouting, "Hands up," while they deploying their ballistics
We shouting, "Hands up," and kids who need it go ballistic
The difference in our League of Extraordinary Minorities
Against the identity, representing authority
Move between 'em accordingly, and clutch my rosaries
Before they try and send the lord for me, that's more for me
That's when the forerunners told me: "This is not your speed!"
While they repeated their beliefs from the Apostle's Creed
The most consistency I found in life has never come from people
Still looking for an equal, nobody will believe you

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
God ain't give me a penny, I made a million dollars
I got a thug for a father so I took care of my mother
God threw me in fire, I walked out with my brothers
You know the Shadow of Death?
I was born in the valley, but now I live in The Valley
God gave me a house, God gave me depression
God gave us life, but we ain't know it was cursed
I was hurt as a child, you know I still deal with it
Now I'm a grown-ass man with immature-ass feelings
All I wanted was money, just to get it and spend it
On strippers and weed, I ain't skip on the liquor
I can't talk to my niggas 'cause if I say it, it's real, and I ain't ready to face it
I've been flirtin' with Satan
I've been flirtin' with women that like to dance when they naked
And I throw all of my dollars, I throw all of my problems
To the back of my throat with weed smoke and klonopin
I'm ashamed of myself
About three days ago, I planned on killing myself
But I'm still here breathin', you know I'm still here screamin'
Screamin', "Fuck that shit," we signed for fifteen million
And I almost missed it, I know that y'all niggas hear me

[Outro: bearface]
We found a light
Will you still carry me?
When I fall
Let the hope and the joy
Rain down on me
Rain down on me (Ooh)
Raise me up
Carry, carry, carry me

[Verse 1]
Have you got color in your cheeks?
Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I wanna know?
If this feeling flows both ways?
Sad to see you go
Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
Baby, we both know
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you

[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp
Of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
We could be together if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I wanna know?
If this feeling flows both ways?
Sad to see you go
Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
Baby, we both know
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Swingin' burning tires leave a third degree
And I heard there's bouncin' niggas hatin' wanna murder me
They gon' have to take me straight to Satan 'cause I'm blessin' this
I feel distressed, then feel no stress, I built this trust
They won't come murder me, Hercules

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & Juicy J]
Mama warned me pop was on me as a shorty
(Shut the fuck up!)
Get-gettin' guap before when I was fourteen
Glock was forty kick-kick
Box ya jaw for plottin' on me hot bologna grits with
Problems copper hoppin' on me cheese from government-ment (What that mean?)
Prada on me, choppers on me, croc' on Mauri kicks-kicks (Word)
God was for me, locks was on me
Blew up ever since then (Okay, okay)
Grew up ever since then, screwed up ever since then
Two cups ever since then (Kill 'em Flacko)
Nah, big homie, took my time but now, big homie
Homies outta line, big homie
Money outta pocket, homie, all these niggas pockets, homie
Chopper let 'em live, I was only six, when I crept up in the crib
Found a Sig, what I did, what I did
Cock it homie, now it's in my p-pocket homie
I-I got r-rocket on me, dare you nigga, tr-try me, homie
For the love of spread, Mommas butter bread
Man, I prolly should be dead, was it 'cause of what I said?
What I-

I'm on this Hennessey and I'm quick to shoot dat thang
But fuck dat, one of my young niggas'll take the charge

Hold on, one second, bro
Ha, Rocky, it's Hector, bro

We gotta hold on, one second, bro
There's an issue goin' on back here

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Grandma was a Catholic, and mama was a Christian (Woo)
My papa turned to Muslim when he spent some time in prison 
(No cappin')
No Jehovah Witnesses where I'm from, kinda different (Woo)
They don't leave no witnesses so folks just mind they business
These days I just practice all the good from all religion
So plead the fifth amendment or you're gonna be the victim
So get up off my YKK, the President a a-hole (Fuck off)
Prayin' for a JFK, all we got was KKK
AKA AK that you target
Not from Target but from Walmart, then it's a-ok
Fuck them boys no KY with this SK leave them DOA
AR in the ER it's the state of mind of every state
Say your grace you better pray
Guns with the butter, guns for my brother
Came from the gutter, cocaine in the buttocks
Razor box cutter, blade under gumma
Gang in the Hummer, skate wit' your mother

[Refrain: Project Pat]
The fact of the matter she blow out the frizzame
I keep me some powder so I'm gettin' brizzain
The fact of the matter she blow out the frizzame
I keep me some powder so I'm gettin' brizzain
The fact of the matter she blow out the frizzame
I keep me some powder so I'm gettin' brizzain
The fact of the matter she blow out the frizzame
I keep me some powder so I'm gettin' brizzain

[Outro: Juicy J]
What's really butter?
The gun or the butter?
You hear me?
You understand what I'm sayin'?
What's really butter?
What's really butter?
What's really butter?
Guns, you can get that butter all day

Eyedrops, ("Fuckin' with the killas")
Teardrops
Droptops, ("Fuckin' with the killas")
Ice blocks (Beat drop, beat drop)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I was thinking to myself (Calldrops)
Maybe I should seek some help
Maybe I should blame myself ("Don't expect no money")
My mystique in stealth is gone away
("Don't expect no money")
It's going away, it's going away

[Chorus: Dean Blunt]
Eye drops
Teardrops
Droptops
Ice blocks

[Interlude: A$AP Rocky & Kodak Black]
You used to be so soft
This is a prepaid collect call from
("Fuckin' with the killas")
Beautiful teardrops on your cheeks
An inmate at Florida Correctional Institution
Beautiful things
This call is subject to recording and monitoring
This-this life situation and shit, you there?
Uh-huh
You ready right now?
Yeah, I'm ready, got you on speaker

[Verse 2: Kodak Black & A$AP Rocky]
All the pain I went through
Turned to a singer
I put it all on my tattoos
'Cause of where I came from
If I ain't ever learned before, then it's gon' change me
(This call is subject to recording and monitoring)
Sittin' in institution, I  done lost my baby
If nan' ain't ever woke me up, then it's gon' wake me
When them people ran up on my spot, and they took my baby
A random kind that's doing his time, but it's for no reason
A random kind that's ridin' the pine, something you free—something you free—something you free
(This call has dropped, to add more credits, please press 1)
(Free Kodak)

[Verse 1]
Take me in your fast car Mercedes
Kissing on your neck while you drive
He- he doesn't care, I'm always on my Blackberry
All the time, all the time, drinkin' liquor on the dime

[Verse 2]
I'm a flashy little lush, but he loves me 'cuz I'm fine
I party really hard, but I'm workin' overtime
He's just as bad as me, 'cuz he shine, shine, shine's
Like a light, but he's not that bright, but he's mine

[Chorus]
We're children of the bad revolution

We're gonna get free free free free free free free
Get free

Baby, you're a real star, look at me
I can tell a gem when I see, see, see
I don't mind you always think about money
All the time, all the time
In your mind, in your mind

[Verse 4]
I think you're really hot, I really love your style
You party 'till you drop, you make everybody smile
It's a perfect world, and you're my perfect guy
You wanna get too close to the edge
You're not afraid to fly

[Chorus]
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion

We're gonna get free free free free free free free

Get out of your life, break out of them chains
Run for your life, there's still time to change
Never give up, never forget who you are
Or what you wanna be

Be your own God, be, be your own God
Be your own
Get free, get free, get free

[Chorus]
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are, and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free free free free free free free
Get free

Sweet and bloody, my mafiosi

I don't care you always actin' shady
Late at night, late at night
It's alright, it's alright

[Verse 6]
I knew it when we met, knew how you lived your life
Livin' off the grid with a dream and a knife
You can do your thing baby, if I can do mine
You can watch me sing, and I can help you do your crime, crime

[Chorus]
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are, and what we're gonna be

In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are, and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free free free free free free free

I'm taking off my wedding ring

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave you everything
I gave you everything

[Chorus]
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights, yeah
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights, yeah

[Verse 2]
They named me Lana Rey Loreen
They named me Lana Rey Loreen
They named me Lana Rey Loreen
From when I was a beauty queen

[Pre-Chorus]
I wasn't anything
I wasn't anything

[Chorus]
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights, yeah
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights, yeah

[Verse 3]
I'm waving on the silver screen
I'm waving on the silver screen
I'm waving on the silver screen
The film is fading, look at me

[Bridge]
The film is fading, look at me, yeah
The film is fading, look at me, yeah
The film is fading, look at me, yeah
The film is fading, look at me, look at me, yeah

[Chorus]
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights, yeah
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights
Give me the bright lights, yeah

[Intro: A$AP Rocky & T.I.]
Gang! Gang
They tryna front on the gang!
They going to remember my name
Ayy, anybody ever took the time to ask Rocky what A$AP mean to him?
Well if so, he'll probably tell you, "Always Striving and Prospering"
A$AP, partna'! Free my nigga, Cap
R.I.P. Big Phil, R.I.P. A$AP Yams
Ya dig? (Gang!)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Come fuck with the Mob, shout out to the Lords and the Gods
In love with my bitch 'cause she bi
My ice like the stars, I tell that bitch, "Cover your eyes
'Cause fuckin' with me, you go blind"
She losin' her mind, we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark, I kill you, you open my blinds
On Yams and that's word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Like dominos, nigga, Geronimos
When it's my time to go, adiós, vámonos
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with plátanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
I guess it's called livin', shit, I suppose
I'm on my live alone, die VLONE
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose

[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky with Kid Cudi]
I put A$AP on my tat (Woo)
I put New York on the map (Woo)
I put the gang on the flames (Woo)
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains (Woo)
I got Goyard by the sack (Woo)
I got the boof by the pack (Woo)
I fucked your boo on her back

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky with Kid Cudi]
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang, it's time to fuck up the whole game!
Hmm

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I'm free as a bird, I wanted this shit my whole life
But had all this stress on my mind
Until I realized, things pan out when it's right
In the meantime I'ma grind
I think of them days when I was so young on my plight
Party and bullshit and play
Was up in the city, the one that's surrounded by lights
Wanted to burn it away
Get out of his lane, got no time, don't need no advice
Except for my momma
Ride for my daughter, she's all I need
She got her father, as I grow
Hell yeah, I did it, I'm on a roll
Thought I'd be up with my nigga, no
I'm just gettin' warmed up, let's start the show
I'm schoolin' these niggas, so in the zone and I'm rigged to blow
A$AP and Cud Life forever though
And I'm flossin' and bossin' these silly hoes
Learned the codes, serve up the magic for all of those
Kids that ain't had someone on they own
Hang on the words, you each have your song
Grab on and hold on, won't steer you wrong
Sing along, sing along, hmm

[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I put A$AP on my tat (Woo)
I put New York on the map (Woo)
I put the gang on the flames (Woo)
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains (Woo)
I got Goyard by the sack (Woo)
I got the boof by the pack (Woo)
I fucked your boo on her back (Woo)

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang, it's time to fuck up the whole game!
(Game, game, game, game)

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky & Khloe Anna]
Gang, gang
They tryna front on the gang, they gon' remember my name
True to truth somehow (Gang, gang)
But never truly lied at all, then and now
They tryna front on the gang
Truth somehow
Gang, A$AP boys come with the flame
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now

[Outro: Khloe Anna & Moby]
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
In my dreams, I'm dying all the time
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all
Then I wake, it's kaleidoscopic mind
But never truly lied at all
But never truly lied at all, then and now
I never meant to hurt you (Then and now)
I never meant to lie

[Verse 1]
I've been sleeping, barely dreaming
Through one year and one half
Found another, called him my lover
Helped me get my old self back

[Pre-Chorus]
It was you-ou-ou-ou
It was you-ou-ou-ou
Only you-ou-ou-ou
You remind me, oh, you bring me back

[Chorus]
And you said
"Let me help you wake you up
Let me help you break you up
Let me help you open up"
I'm in love, I'm alive
Oh, I'm burning

[Verse 2]
Oh, I was reckless, once was breathless
Running from that day I snapped
But I've got a feeling and keep believing
I'm never gonna give this back

[Pre-Chorus]
It was you-ou-ou-ou
It was you-ou-ou-ou
Only you-ou-ou-ou
Oh, I'm never gonna give this back

[Chorus]
And you said
"Let me help you wake you up
Let me help you break you up
Let me help you open up"
I'm in love, I'm alive
Oh, I'm burning

[Bridge]
And if you're giving up, would you tell me?
I'm gonna keep this love if you let me
And if you're giving up, would you tell me?
I'm gonna keep this love

[Chorus]
And you said
"Let me help you wake you up
Let me help you break you up
Let me help you open up"
I'm in love, I'm alive
Oh, I'm burning
"Let me help you wake you up
Let me help you break you up
Let me help you open up"
I'm in love, I'm alive
Oh, I'm burning

[Verse 1]
Would you believe me now if I told you I got caught up in a wave?
Almost gave it away
Would you hear me out if I told you I was terrified for days?
Thought I was gonna break

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I couldn't stop it
Tried to slow it all down
Crying in the bathroom
Had to figure it out
With everyone around me saying
"You must be so happy now"

[Chorus]
Oh, if you keep reaching out
Then I'll keep coming back
And if you're gone for good
Then I'm okay with that
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on (Light on, light on, light on)
And I am finding out
There's just no other way
That I'm still dancing at the end of the day
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on (Light on, light on, light on)

[Verse 2]
And do you believe me now that I always had the best intentions, babe?
Always wanted to stay
Can you feel me now that I'm vulnerable in oh-so-many ways?
Oh, and I'll never change

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I couldn't stop it
Tried to figure it out
But everything kept moving
And the noise got too loud
With everyone around me saying
"You should be so happy now"

[Chorus]
Oh, if you keep reaching out
Then I'll keep coming back
And if you're gone for good
Then I'm okay with that
And if you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on (Light on, light on, light on)
And I am finding out
There's just no other way
That I'm still dancing at the end of the day
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on (Light on, light on, light on)

[Bridge]
Oh, leave the light on
Oh, would you leave the light on?

[Chorus]
If you keep reaching out
Then I'll keep coming back
But if you're gone for good
Then I'm okay with that
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on (Light on, light on, light on)
And I am finding out
There's just no other way
That I'm still dancing at the end of the day
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on (Light on, light on, light on)

[Outro]
Oh, if you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on
Oh, if you leave the light on

[Verse 1]
The knife of insight tore its way in me
A brash collision without sympathy
And maybe when the Sun goes down
I'll come 'round, I'll come out
Maybe we could take some time
Unwind, figure out
When the knife of insight tore its way in me

[Chorus]
Hit me up if you're feeling down
Give a little, oh we'll figure this out
Keep me up, keep my mind around
After dark, after light
Let it go if you want get loud
Make a little fuss, oh it's all allowed
Beautiful how it all pours out
After dark, after light
After dark, after light
After dark, after light

[Verse 2]
Oh, the knife of insight brought me to my knees
Broke me down and taught me how to see
And I know and I know and I know
That maybe we should take some time
Get this out, make this right
Maybe when the sun goes down
I'll come round, tell you all about
When the knife of insight brought me to my knees

[Chorus]
Hit me up if you're feeling down
Give a little, oh we'll figure this out
Keep me up, keep my mind around
After dark, after light
Let it go if you want get loud
Spark a little, oh it's all allowed
Beautiful how it all pours out
After dark, after light
After dark, after light
Oh, after dark, after light

[Bridge]
And maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you know
But I've got this feeling it's all bout to blow
Maybe I'm crazy
Or maybe you know that
I've got this feeling it's all bout to blow
When the knife, the knife, the knife

[Chorus]
Hit me up if you're feeling down
Give a little, oh we'll figure this out
Keep me up, keep my mind around
After dark, after light
Let it go if you want get out
Love a little, oh it's all allowed
Beautiful how it all pours out
After dark, after light
After dark, after light

[Verse 1]
If I was who I was before
Then I'd be waiting at your door
But I cannot confess I am the same
So look at me and hear me now
With all my body screaming out
Oh, in my mind, I'm thinking of a place

[Refrain]
Where no one knows me
And no one knows you
You don't know me
And I don't know you

[Verse 2]
If you would open up your heart
Drop your weapons, drop your guard
Just a little trust is all it takes
Oh, I know that you've been around
But hear me now, I'm crying out
Let me be the light upon the lake

[Chorus]
But if you give a little, get a little
Maybe we could get to know each other
Give a little, get a little, give a little
And if you give a little, get a little
Maybe we could learn to love each other
Give a little, get a little, give a little

[Post-Chorus]
Give a little, get a little, give a little
Give a little, get a little, give a little

[Verse 3]
If only we could find a way
To leave all of our darker days
Soak in all the sweetness on our skin
And if you're waiting in the Sun
Then carry me on wings of love
To that brighter day where all begins

[Chorus]
And if you give a little, get a little
Maybe we could get to know each other
Give a little, get a little, give a little
And if you give a little, get a little
Maybe we could learn to love each other
Give a little, get a little, give a little

[Post-Chorus]
Give a little, get a little, give a little
Give a little, get a little, give a little

[Chorus]
But if you give a little, get a little
Maybe we could get to know each other
Give a little, get a little, give a little
And if you give a little, get a little
Maybe we could learn to love each other
Give a little, get a little, give a little

[Outro]
But if no one knows me
And no one knows you
You don't know me
And I don't know you
Everything's fresh and
Everything's new
But you don't know me
And I don't know you
I can feel it starting up now, yeah
I can feel it all just coming through
There's a whole new world just waiting baby
So much waiting just for me and you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Wait time is the worst
I can hardly sit
No one has the time
Someone's always late
I look for you
And you look for me
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground

[Bridge]
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is telling
You something that you would not like me to tell you

[Verse 2]
Wait time is to blame
Mat top frame's a trip
We all have the time
Someone's always fed
I look for you, and you look away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground

[Outro: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Waking up is so much fun to do
(Tell me, don't tell me, the hard part is telling me something that you would not like me to tell you)
'80 movie make out party with you
(Tell me, don't tell me, the hard part is telling me something that you would not like me to tell you)

[Intro]
I'm in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay

[Verse]
So if you rebuke me for workin' with someone else on a couple of Vs
What do you really think of the nigga that's makin' your beats?
I've done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours then let him repeat
Now you poppin' up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all puttin' pen to the sheets
Tired of sittin' quiet and helpin' my enemies eat
Keep gettin' temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Y'all are the spittin' image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
You're not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle
And hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous
I wanna see my brothers flourish to they higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learnin', yeah
Your brother said it was your cousin, then him, then you
So, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike and Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happenin' lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger workin' double time
Y'all actin' like he made the boy when I was tryna help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly makin' me hits
But then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it
My spirit did it, I'm fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you runnin' behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playin' with my name
And I'ma let it ring on you like Virginia Williams
I'm too resilient, get out your feelings
It's gonna be a cruel summer for you
I told Weezy and Baby, "I'ma done him for you"
Tell 'Ye we got a invoice comin' to you
Considerin' that we just sold another 20 for you

[Outro]
To be honest
Duppy

[Verse 1]
Every time you vap and I get tired
Spit some shit that's inspired
I love you but if you worked for me
Baby, you would be fired
You know you do it for me hard
Heavy metal superstar
I need you but if you worked for me
Baby, you'd be retired

[Pre-Chorus]
*unfinished and unwritten with just the melody*

[Chorus]
Shut up, shut up
I really don't care, I really don't care I
Shut up, shut up
I really don't care, I really don't care I

[Verse 2]
Every time you vap and I get tired
Spit some shit that's inspired
I love you but if you worked for me
Baby, you would be fired
You know you do it for me hard
Heavy metal superstar
I need you but if you worked for me
Baby, you'd be retired

[Pre-Chorus]
*unfinished and unwritten with just the melody*

[Chorus]
Shut up, shut up
I really don't care, I really don't care I
Shut up, shut up
I really don't care, I really don't care I

[Bridge]
*unfinished and unwritten with just the melody*
Boy, oh
Everything and more
Call me, everything and more

[Chorus]
Shut up, shut up
I really don't care, I really don't care I
Shut up, shut up
I really don't care, I really don't care I
Shut up, shut up
I really don't care, I really don't care I
Shut up, shut up
I really don't care, I really don't care I
Shut up, shut up
I really don't care, I really don't care I
Shut up, shut up
I really don't care, I really don't care I

[Verse 1]
Push, push, dance for the city life
Smoke, smoke, baby, like a motorbike
Take your trash to my junkyard site
In your skies I will fly my kite

[Pre-Chorus]
They keep saying West Coast weather is better
But it don't matter 'cause I love you and I'll never let go

[Chorus]
I'll never leave you, won't leave you
'Cause you were made for me
I'll touch each corner of you
My, my urban fantasy
It's not a question, it's obsession
You're the one for me

[Post-Chorus]
Me love you New York
Love you, New York
Me love you New York
Love you, New York

[Verse 2]
Run, run red, gonna beat the light
Hold your breath while we firefight
T.N.T 'cause we're dynamite
Where are the choo-choos running tonight?

[Pre-Chorus]
They keep saying West Coast weather is better
But it don't matter 'cause I love you and I'll never let go

[Chorus]
I'll never leave you, won't leave you
'Cause you were made for me
I'll touch each corner of you
My, my urban fantasy
It's not a question, it's obsession
You're the one for me

[Post-Chorus]
Me love you New York
Love you, New York
Me love you New York
Love you, New York
Me love you New York
Love you, New York
Me love you New York
Love you, New York

[Bridge]
Can't wear leather in L.A
Pump it baby, in the fast lane
Can't wear leather in L.A
Pump it baby, in the fast lane
Can't wear leather in L.A. (No, we don't)
Pump it baby, in the fast lane (In the fast lane)
Can't wear leather in L.A. (Yeah, we know)
Pump it baby, in the fast lane ('Cause I'll never leave you)

[Chorus]
I'll never leave you, won't leave you
'Cause you were made for me
I'll touch each corner of you
My, my urban fantasy
It's not a question, it's obsession
You're the one for me

[Post-Chorus]
Me love you New York
Love you, New York
Me love you New York
Love you, New York
Me love you New York
Love you, New York
Me love you New York
Love you, New York
Me love you New York
Love you, New York
Me love you New York
Love you, New York
Me love you New York
Love you, New York
Me love you New York
Love you, New York
Me love you New York
Love you, New York
Me love you

[Verse 1]
Tall buddy told me your name
And that you had no woman
High heel shoes and tight jeans
I could be your girlfriend
Can't you see us, superstar love
In between the sheets we go

[Chorus]
Oh baby
Oh baby
We've got music tonight
We're gonna make it happen this time, this time
Lets get physical
Ride her like a bicycle, baby
Oh baby

[verse 2]
Never met a man like you
Sugar pie gone real bad
Look for a whole lot of love
Song comes on, we sing "hell yeah!"
Can't you see us, superstar love
In between the sheets we go

[Chorus]
Oh baby
Oh baby
We've got music tonight
We're gonna make it happen this time, this time
Lets get physical
Ride her like a bicycle, baby
Oh baby

[Chorus: Sufjan Stevens]
I'm not trying to
Go to bed with you
I just wanna make out in my car
And though I'm dying to
Fall in love with you
I just wanna make out in my car

[Verse 1: Sufjan Stevens]
Love come to me
Sprouting like the living tree
Splendid in the stream of living water
Driven like the Sun
Commissioned by the holy one
Illuminating peace above the altar

[Chorus: Sufjan Stevens & Moses Sumney]
I'm not trying to
Go to bed with you
I just wanna make out in my car
And though I'm dying to
Fall in love with you
I just wanna make out in my car

[Verse 2: Sufjan Stevens]
Love come to me
Empowered by the living dream
Sacred as the sign of our sensation
Burning like the Sun
Considered by the holy one
Glorious in the feast of our creation

[Chorus: Sufjan Stevens & Moses Sumney]
I'm not trying to (I'm not trying to)
Go to bed with you
I just wanna make out in my car
And though I'm dying to (Though I'm dying to)
Fall in love with you
I just wanna make out in my car
I just wanna make out in my car
I’ve torn you apart like a vulture to prey
I’m struggling to get to the bone
I’m standing right here and you’ve nothing to say
I’ve given you all that I know

I do all I can to examine your mind
You can’t even spell understand
I give you my patience, I give you my time
At least you could give me your hand

At least you could give me your hand

I've taken your pieces and matched them to mine
There's too many left on their own
I forced them together one too many times
And still there's no puzzle to show

I'm begging, I'm praying, I'm hoping to God
That something inside you will change
I'm waiting, I'm wishing to see that you're flawed
I'm starting to think I'm insane
Starting to think I'm insane
Oh, I'm starting to think I'm insane

Now I'm your prey
Please, please stay far away
And now, oh, I am your prey
Please, please stay far away
'Cause now, I am your prey
Please, please stay far away
And now, I am your prey
Please, please stay far away

You're pulling me closer, you're reeling me in
You make it so hard to resist
You're stretching me out, babe, you're wearing me thin
I'm wondering why we insist

I question your motives, you answer with spite
But somehow you've beckoned me near
I've yelled of the solutions with all of my might
But somehow you still cannot hear

Baby, why can't you hear me?
Oh, baby, why can't you hear me?

You're holding me captive and shaking my cage
You've turned every table around
I'm begging for mercy, I'm begging for change
I'm begging to walk solid ground
A victimless love is a love I can't buy
But pain is a high price to pay
I've suffered enough and I just want your love
But baby, there's nothing left to save

Oh baby, there's nothing left for us to save
There is nothing left to save

Now, I'm your prey
Please, please stay far away
And now, I am your prey
Please, please stay far away
And now, I am your prey
Please, please stay far away
'Cause now, now I am your prey
Please, please stay far away

[Chorus: Moses Sumney]
I'm not tryna
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car
I'm not tryna
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car

[Verse 1: Moses Sumney]
You're used to men
Tryna get in
Into your body
Before you're ready
I'm not quite like them
A conditional friend
Waitin' to unlock you
I'm not tryna rock you, no

[Chorus: Moses Sumney]
I'm not tryna
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car (Do you wanna make out?)
I'm not tryna
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car

[Verse 2: Alex Isley]
You seek to find
A place inside
There's no room and yet it's vacant
My extraordinary acquaintance
Still, much more
More to explore
Please remember every minute
'Cause we almost reached our limit

[Chorus 2: Moses Sumney & Alex Isley]
I'm not tryna, I’m not tryna
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car
I'm not tryna, no
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car

[Verse 1]
We put down the top when we're drivin'
Don't take off your top while I'm drivin'
Might give you some top while you're drivin'
But no I'm not tryna drive in
Your imagination is wilin'
Though I'm hesitatin' to dive in
To your nether regions and thigh-land
An invitation I'm declinin'
Sirens blarin', flashin' in the back
Barin' this skin, better watch your back
Starin', but can we pump on the breaks?
I still want to want you after the day breaks

[Chorus 1]
I'm not tryna
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car
I'm not tryna
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car

[Verse 2]
It won't pop off on this drop-off
I ain't droppin' out of this ride
If you keep turnin' with cheeks burnin'
I'm u-turnin' these tires
I could stop off and let you hop off
If you keep offerin' rides
If I talk tough it's 'cause I been bluffin'
And I wanna come inside
And we were sittin' by the curbside
I couldn't really get the words right
Feels like I'm watchin' from the bird's eye view
When you turned away with curved eyes, you
Start to lean back when I lean in
Then turn your lean back with a mean grin
I spin the keys in the ignition
But then still wait for you to walk in

[Chorus 1]
I'm not tryna
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car
I'm not tryna
Go to bed with ya
I just wanna make out in my car

[Bridge]
You start to lean back when I lean in
You want it all or you want nothin'
You start to lean back when I lean in
You want it all or you want nothin'

[Chorus 2]
I'm not tryna
I'm not tryna
'Cause I, I'm not tryna
No, I'm not tryna
I'm not tryna
Go to bed with ya

[Outro]
Only leanin' in for a kiss
Hope it doesn't seem like a diss
Only leanin' in for a kiss
Hope it doesn't seem like a diss
Only leanin' in for a kiss
Hope it doesn't seem like a diss
Only leanin' in for a kiss
I just wanna make out in my car
Hope it doesn't seem like a diss
It's Britney bitch!
Every time they turn the lights down
Just want to go that extra mile for you
You public display of affection
Feels like no one else in the room (but you)
We can get down like there's no one around
We'll keep on rockin' (We'll keep on rockin')
We'll keep on rockin' (Keep on rockin')
Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin'
They keep watching (They keep watching)
Keep watching
Feels like the crowd is saying

We can get down like there's no one around
We'll keep on rockin' (Keep on rockin')

[Verse 1]
Winter's here and the wind's so chill
Wish I could go back when the heat was still
Stay inside of this pale white room
I feel trapped, my mind, the impending doom

Davy's lost in the deep blue past
All he wants to do is to breathe at last
Nights creep down so he sleeps all day
But the future just seems so far away

[Chorus]
Riding in the way down
Riding all the way down
Riding in the way down

[Verse 2]
Jessie grabs, she can't keep her flow
All the words hang there but she doesn't know
Icy dreams of the things inside
She can't keep her peace when her lover's high
Sadie thinks if she had the time
She could make it big living out her prime
The city once was a place to thrive
Now the city's gone, but her mind's alive

[Chorus]
Riding in the way down
Riding all the way down
Riding in the way down

[Verse 1]
When I was sixteen I learned to sing, I learned to sing
But every time I raise my voice inside I feel so tired
I feel like the world is filled with people who can't hear themselves speak
Somber silence over takes my mind, I can't find time to use my

[Chorus]
Chasing the daylight, I'm riding the train
Trying to stop but this feeling remains
Chasing the daylight, I'm riding the train
Trying to stop but this feeling remains

[Verse 2]
I can hear my voice inside me moving cracking every day
My mother told me it's not in your head, it's running through your veins
So get into the game she said, resist the pain don't go insane
But I'm already crazy don't you know, that's why I got to go down

[Chorus]
Chasing the daylight, I'm riding the train
Trying to stop but this feeling remains
Chasing the daylight, I'm riding the train
Trying to stop but this feeling remains

The California animal is a bear
Angeleno, but the devil may care
Summer time to talk and swear
Later maybe we could share some air
I’ll take you to the movies there
We could walk through Leicester Square
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

[Chorus]
London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it’ll feel all right

[Verse 2]
Hesitate but don’t refuse
The choice was yours but you said choose
The look she used was green and sharp
Stabbed that boy all in his heart
Come what may the cosmos will
Take me up and down on primrose hill
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

[Chorus]
London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it’ll feel all right

Down and out and it’ll sound all right
It’s all right now, it’s all right

[Verse 3]
The California flower is poppy, child
Felony sends me all the gold in your smile
Drift away from anyone you can
Nothing ever goes according to plan
Though I know that every river bends
Time to say hello to snow on the Thames
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

[Chorus]
London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it’ll feel all right

Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one

[Chorus]
I like dirt, I like dirt
I like dirt, I like dirt

[Verse 1]
The earth is made of dirt and wood
And I'd be water if I could
Live in a dream

Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one

[Chorus]
I like dirt, I like dirt
I like dirt, I like dirt

Must roll over when you're told

Space is made of everything

Do a, do a, do a fat dance

[Chorus 1]
One reason why I got you for
A woman is that you can do the moveable
Kitchen or bedroom or bathroom floor
Keep it moving because I need the hardcore

[Pre-Chorus]
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance

Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance

[Chorus 2]
Soft, she's off and left
Now I'm coming
I'm feeling in the ghetto because that's my trouble

[Verse 2]
I met her on the school yard and
She was such a cool card
She took me for a fool
Because I acted like a bodyguard
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
She was just the cutest thing
My God, that I have ever seen
Tearing up my seratonin
Messing with my dopamine
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
Just about the time
That I was feeling smart again
She walked into the room
Wearing nothing but a cardigan
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
She knew what she was doing
When she told me no she would
Never let the perfect message
In and get the perfect screwing
Oh Yohanna love, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance

[Bridge]
Number three reasons why I'm in your house
Hot butter melts across your mouth
Dancing and a dancing, And a dancing machine
Somebody move, Somebody scream
Yeah

[Chorus 1]
One reason why I got you for
A woman is that you can do the moveable
Kitchen or bedroom or bathroom floor
Keep it moving because I need the hardcore

[Chorus 1]
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?

[Verse 1]
I'll walk a water mile
Rest a while to kiss your smile
Laugh and roll and after a while
I'll begin to like your style

[Chorus 2]
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?
She turned me down this time
She turned me down
Lord, I can't believe she
She turned me down
She turned me inside out
She turned me down
All I ask of you
Is turn me up this time

[Chorus 1]
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?

Come on over show me your
Your glow soul I do adore

Give it up it's not that hard

[Chorus 2]
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?
She turned me down this time
She turned me down
Lord, I can't believe she
She turned me down
She turned me inside out
She turned me down
All I ask of you
Is turn me up this time

[Chorus 1]
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?

Tested life but that's alright
Darker than the darkest night
Living hell and pollocks at you
Getting new down your back

[Chorus 1]
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?

[Verse 1]
Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Drifting and floating and fading away
Porcelain
Do you smell like a girl when you smile?
Can you bear not to share with your child?
Drifting and floating and fading away

[Chorus]
Little lune, all day
Little lune

[Verse 2]
Porcelain
Do you carry the moon in your womb?
Someone said that you're fading too soon
Drifting and floating and fading away
Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Nodding and melting and fading away

[Chorus]
Little lune, all day
Little lune
Little lune, all day
Little lune

[Verse 1]
Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder to tell what came first
Under water where thoughts can breathe easily
Far away you were made in a sea just like me

[Chorus]
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything

[Verse 2]
Staring straight up into the sky
Oh my my
A solar system that fits in your eye
Microcosm
You could die but you're never dead
Spider web
Take a look at the stars in your head
Felds of space kid

[Chorus]
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything

[Verse 3]
Psychic changes are born in your heart
Entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same
Bless your heart, girl
Kill the pressure it's raining on
Salty cheeks
When you hear the beloved song
I am with you

[Chorus]
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything

Lock the bus undo the chain
Getting all to hot, gotta head on Fifth and Main
I look like you I feel the same
You don't know my name
I got this tied up to my cell
Well everybody's gone to the everybody shell

[Chorus]
Are you coming through, do you want me to, take your body
It would be so cool, to be cool with you, lordy lordy

[Verse 2]
I don't like blood into the chain
There ain't an element that stays off in my brain
A dirty sun will burn away
Do you want to stay

[Chorus]
Are you coming through, do you want me to, take your body
It would be so cool, to be cool with you, lordy lordy
Where'd ya get that bruise, do you want me to
Take your body

[Instrumental Solo]

[Chorus]
Are you coming through, do you want me to, take your body
It would be so cool, to be cool with you. I said lordy lordy
Where'd ya get that bruise, do you want me to
Take your body

[Instrumental Outro]
I said bone-crunching mayhem funk
Let me caroon you a tune, it's called the Brother's cup
'Cause we the Red Hot Chili Peppers
It'll rock your spine, and ruffle your feathers

Overshot my mark and
Put 'em down, on the ground
Fall away

Evil, good, understood
Enemy
The king and queen were sleeping
Industry, ecstasy
Sympathy
Sympathy

[Verse 1]
I'm leaving home today
I thought about it and I want to say
I will miss this
Land and its promise
I'm sticking next to you
Big amigo is it really true
When they say you should
Kill for your country?
Kill for your country

[Verse 2]
I've got three kids to feed
A fine woman and a need for speed
Far away from this
Land and its promise
I wave goodbye to you
And the peace that I wish I knew
Time to leave and go
Kill for my country
Kill for my country

[Pre-Chorus]
Put 'em down and hold your fire
Command that world that we inspire
Put 'em down and hold your fire
Set 'em up for quick release
This world of ours, the land of the frees
Set 'em up with quick release
Overshot and made a mess
This world is cold and I'm under-dressed
Overshot and made a mess
We consume and we digest
This world is born (alt: sold) on a dead man's chest
We consume and we digest

[Chorus]
Mow 'em down, mow 'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire
Mow 'em down, mow 'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire

[Bridge]
This is a message to you
This is a table for two

[Chorus]
Mow 'em down, mow 'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire
Mow 'em down, mow 'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire

You are my goldmine done dar a soulmine
Somebody satisfied her soul

"Remove it" and a ding dong ding
Got a skin beside her and I really don't fly thy
Shin division and a, poto

You beside me
Sometimes as she falls to the floor
You beside me

It's innovated by the ding dong slider
Shit a woman and I really don't fry now
Chester ring down and a wind don't fly down
Pip-de-whip and then-a oh snap

Open my goldmine and there for a soul inclined and
Said that out of sight is right beside

[Chorus 3]
Sometimes there's a reason to shine
You beside, oh
Sometimes there's a man on the pines
Tell me now

[Verse 4]
Ah-oh he said I'm-a right to goldmine
Let know that him the way I know
Lie like here through the night
Slide on in on a slide

[Chorus 4]
Sometimes there's no reason to turn
You decide, all alone
Sometimes there's no break turn
All alone
Sometimes there's a bed on the floor
Tell me lord, oh
Sometimes, I don't fall on a shard
You beside, they don't know-whoa-whoa

[Verse 1]
You learn a couple things when you get to my age
Like friends don't lie and it all tastes the same in the dark
When your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times
You're getting spiritually enlightened at 29

[Chorus]
So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

[Verse 2]
I found a grey hair in one of my zoots
Like context in a modern debate, I just took it out
The only apparatus required for happiness is your pain and fucking going outside
And getting STDs at 27 really isn't the vibe
Jane took her own life at 16
She was a kid who had the box tattooed on her arm
And I was 25 and afraid to go outside
A millennial that baby-boomers like

[Chorus]
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

[Verse 3]
And what would you say to your younger self?
Growing a beard's quite hard
And whiskey never starts to taste nice
And you'll make a lot of money, and it's funny
'Cause you'll move somewhere sunny and get addicted to drugs
And spend obscene amounts on fucking seeds and beans online

[Chorus]
So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

[Intro - T.I. and Ciara]
Police where did you find this
I'm so done

It's your fault
It's you

[Chorus - T.I. and Ciara]
Then you can never ever say I ain't game my love
And never say that I don't care
Since the beginning I've been here I ain't changed my love

Gave you my heart and my soul I gave everything
Spend so much time in the streets

And I stayed here with you
Don't wanna do this to my family
They wanna see us together living happily
But you are so unfair
You show no care
And that's why I am through

[Pre-Chorus - Ciara]
All the pain
All these years
I hate to walk away
But I gotta say goodbye my dear
I'm so done with you

[Chorus - T.I. and Ciara]
Then you can never ever say I ain't game my love
And never say that I don't care

Us breaking up today it would be a shame my love
Don't think it's such a good idea
But if you won't show me that you appreciate my love
I'll have to say goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear, my dear
Goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear

[?]
I don't mean no harm no
I've been trying hard yo
Hard to walk away
She got a hole in my heart yo

[Chorus - T.I. and Ciara]
Then you can never ever say I ain't game my love
And never say that I don't care
Since the beginning I've been here I ain't changed my love
Regardless of what you may feel
Us breaking up today it would be a shame my love
Don't think it's such a good idea
But if you won't show me that you appreciate my love
I'll have to say goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear, my dear
Goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear

[Bridge - T.I. and Ciara]
First we fuss and we fight and we break up
Then we kiss and make love and we make up
Do this over and over
But no more shorty this time I'm for sure
First we fuss and we fight and we break up
Then we kiss and make love and we make up
Do this over and over
But no more shorty this time I'm for sure

[Chorus - T.I. and Ciara]
Then you can never ever say I ain't game my love
And never say that I don't care
Since the beginning I've been here I ain't changed my love
Regardless of what you may feel
Us breaking up today it would be a shame my love
Don't think it's such a good idea
But if you won't show me that you appreciate my love

I be rep Chi-Lanta Ville
So get the fuck up off of me
Stacks On Deck, ENT
Whip doe with that palm tree
Man we got the pistol
'Cause you niggas wanna fuck with me
I'm gon' make it rain but I ain't talkin' bout no money
Got the choppa on deck, and I'm aiming at you, dummy
With da rubberband chain let it hang on my neck
When I get up on the mic, I puttin' all you hoes in check
Go for pussy ass niggas talkin' bout they want some beef
I got me some Bathing Apes, and they try to copy me
Man, sit yo ass down with the busted ass Jay's
I'm the realest in this ho, I steal my city if you break
Nigga ask about me in yo town, I'm the one who shut it down
From State to State, Soulja Boy do shows and do heavy weight
I don't give a fuck, 'cause my clique about that action
If you run up off me wrong, then my thumbs gon' get the blessin'
Ho, you diss Arab, so I gotta get you back
Nigga I heard all yo songs and every one I heard was wack
So if it isn't lust the night, then let it go
And when they cut the lights on, you other niggas on the flow
Bitch!

[Verse 2: A-Rab]
Yo I'm fresh up out da chain, with my colors rearrange
Too much ice around my neck it got a nigga feelin' strange
30/30, sixty mans, nigga whatever you call it
Standing in the top grands, say you know a nigga ballin'
16, just a little baby, you think it's a lie
Concrete through my hood watch and the red touch yo eye
Money comin' up, nigga I got five-to-five stackers
And I am the bomb, bitch, like a fuckin' firecracker
Who you think you supposed to be, blowin' in your fuckin' TV
And my clique will knock and down and stach ya Jay's up off ya feet
I got fans everywhere, lined up to take my picture
If you haters don't know me, you could ask yo little sister
Hair braided all right, and I'm finna hit the show
You might see me in yo city 'cause they Rab-it on the flow
All you haters, y'all ain't even gotta buy my new CD
You hear my name everywhere you go, even on TV, nigga

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Bitch ass niggas y'all muh'fuckers quit hatin' nigga
We goin' round us and get the fuck over
Yahh, bitch, yahh!
A-C-T-I-O-N
Oooh you don't want it ho
We bout da action, ho
We bout da action, ho
We bout da action, ho
We bout da action, ho

[Interlude: Soulja Boy]
Man I hope ya'll niggas love this shit
But I was just wondering
Do you want me to diss you so you could get a little bit more fame
Or you want me to diss you 'cause ya'll niggas really don't like us?
Take dat back, 'til then
You don't want it, ho
You don't want it, ho
You don't want it, ho
You don't want it, ho
You don't want it, ho
You could boo before a show as I'ma come to your city
And I'm a bring the whole mothafuckin' Mississippi River
Yahhh!

[Outro: Soulja Boy]

Niggas know I’m bussing, disrespect pinked off
And there’s going to be repercussions, Soulja tell 'em in public
I’m standing on the couch yes, go swag daddy

If I change fire rings

Niggas mad at me, it don’t make no sense
Cause I came with that forty clip on my fucking hip
And I still represent, bitch I make you take a swim

Disrespecting black Jesus and that shit is blasphemy
Got my nigga if right shy gunnin' that bentley coop

Young legend niggas young the ocean got we splashing
Man this shit is just like magic and my swag is all fantastic
You niggas think it’s tragic but I’m balling and you know

See sold out the cut signs all across the globe

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities

Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out

Something in you lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities

Hey, I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
You're not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone

Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you

Boy, I don't give a
So stop tryna' get to me

[Verse 5: "New Rules"]
(One, one, one, one...)

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em (Hey, come on!)
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself (Come on!)

Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't...
You're gettin' over him

Sweeps you and I
Honey don't you know we too will pulse in through this light
Honey don't you know we too will pulse

[Refrain]
I'll always love you, love you, love you I do
Love you, I love you, I love you I do

[Verse 1]
Hannah my darling
I will follow you into the sunrise under desert sky
We fly, rise together
With our hearts upon our sleeves for all to see
We two will breathe, aqua queen though vast distance between us
Heart sails with love for you

[Refrain]
I love you, I love you I do
Love you, I love you, I love you I do

[Verse 3]
Oh, it sets our hearts to fire
Sweeps you and I
Honey don't you know, it sets our heart to fire
Sweeps you and I
Honey don't you know we too will pulse in through this light
Honey don't you know we too will pulse

[refrain]
I'll always love you, love you, love you I do
Love you, I love you, I love you I do...
Yeah yeah yeah...
Part I: "Sphynx Gate"

[Non-lyrical Vocals]

Part 2: "The World It Softly Lulls"

[Verse]
Rarity glistened sharp
The memory of silver tooth bark
Bathed led light history
Fractured into pieces
And outside
Storm forks a snake tongue
Curls through my finger tips warm
A rouge streak ribbons around my skull

[Refrain]
The world it softly lulls
The world it softly lulls
The world it softly lulls
The world it softly lulls

[Verse]
Rarity glistened sharp
The memory of silver tooth bark
Bathed led light history
Fractured into pieces
And outside
Storm forks a snake tongue
Curls through my finger tips warm
A rouge streak ribbons around my skull

[Refrain]
The world it softly lulls
The world it softly lulls
The world it softly lulls
The world it softly lulls

[Verse 1]
Oooh, oooh, hmmm
Love is lost, where is it to be found?
My heart is still here and we have to go 'round and 'round
And all the time I was loving you faithfully
And you took my love and you turned it around on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I don't wanna fight with you
I've done everything I can do (everything I can do)
Don't you leave me like that, I just want my girl back
Can we work it out, or is it over?

[Chorus]
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'?
Why can't we seem to work things out
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'?
Did we forget what love was about?
(It feels like I'm losing)Feels like I'm losing
But when that was everything to me
But now I realize we are just better not together

[Verse 2]
It's hard to let go
Girl we've been through so many things
But for you to grow, it had to go and spread your wings
I see your tears, you're searching for a brighter day
Oh, you should've thought it through when you gave my love away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I don't wanna fight with you
I've done everything I can do (everything I can do)
I hate to leave you like that but I thought you had my back
We tried to work it out but it's over

[Chorus]
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'?
Why can't we seem to work things out (It was you and me together) (What are we doin'?) What are we doin'?
Did we forget what love was about?
(It feels like I'm losing) Feels like I'm losing
But when that was everything to me
But now I realize we are just better not together

[Bridge]
Girl it's just too much for me to say, for you to tell me that you love me
And then to watch you walk away
But girl the way we fight, it just ain't right
That's why it's better this way (hehey hehey yeah yeah yeah)
Now no what else to say, but girl you know that
(I) I (still) still (love) love (you) you (yeah) Yeaaah

[Chorus]
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'?
Why can't we seem to work things out
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'?
Did we forget what love was about? (Come on baby!)
(It feels like I'm losing) Feels like I'm losing
But when that was everything to me
But now I realize we are just better not together
I've realized we are just better not together

[Intro]
Hello
Hey
You at home right now?
Nah, not yet
Hit me up when you get home
Call me when you get home
Like 15 minutes
You busy later?
Just keep me posted
I’ll probably be at home honestly
Call me
Call me
Call me

[Chorus]
Know you wrong
But ‘sho you right
Home alone
For the night
I can turn you on
With my dirty mind
Say I won’t
Worth a try
Puppy love
Butterflies
Made you blush
You made me smile
What you want
Baby you decide
Why we grown
Wasting time

[Verse]
You’re beautiful babe
You’re really something
Stylin’ I gotta say
T-shirt, designer jeans
You got me open
Filled with emotion
Living in ecstacy
Just want you next to me
I’ll bring the champagne
Don’t turn me down babe
We can play Simon Says
Or watch TV in bed
Wake with the sunrise
Sleep in it’s alright
Ain’t even gotta sex

[Bridge]
Mmm but, I know what you like
Baby
Can I come over, come over?
You’re wasting your time
Baby

[Pre-Chorus]
If you just let me come over babe
If you just let me come over babe

[Chorus]
Know you wrong
But ‘sho you right
Home alone
For the night
I can turn you on
With my dirty mind
Say I won’t
Worth a try
Puppy love
Butterflies
Made you blush
You made me smile
What you want
Baby you decide
Why we grown
Wasting time
(Steve)

[Electric guitar solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
If you just let me come over babe
If you just let me come over babe

[Chorus]
Know you wrong
But ‘sho you right
Home alone
For the night
I can turn you on
With my dirty mind
Say I won’t
Worth a try
Puppy love

Made you blush
You made me smile
What you want
Baby you decide
Why we grown
Wasting time

[Interlude]
Ayy yo
You called yourself being rude to me?
Fuck you too, you little broke...you...

[Outro: Steve Lacy]
These bitches want diamond rings, Birk' bags and other bling
I just don't feel the same
Vanity's not my thing
These bitches want diamond rings, Birk' bags and other bling
I just don't feel the same
Vanity's not my thing
These bitches want diamond rings
These bitches want diamond rings

[Verse 1: Syd]
I move like the silent g in designer
Real talk, something to say
My groove right, I might snatch up your wife
Smooth like it's nothin' to me
Get out my way, talk if you wanna
Me, I'm a goner, peace
I'm a hard act to follow, keep up your autumn
Move your feet, enjoy my sweet soirée
Look at me, I'm so suave
Dancing like your name Sade
Hey, why you so worried 'bout me?
No, no, no sir, not today

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Syd]
I just came to dance
Wanna move
I can't with you
Sayin' la di da, la di da (la di da da da)
Said, I'm try'na dance (yeah yeah)
Catch a groove (yeah yeah yeah)
But not with you
We go la di da, la di da

[Verse 2: Syd]
I'm draped in designer, wage with the lineup
Face it, I'm out of your league
No, I'm right beside you, talk, I ain't try'na
Get back, I'm rollin' away
All in my face, chat with you later
Go find your posse, please
I'ma smooth operator, no, I'm your favorite
But let me enjoy my sweet soirée
I'm sorry that I'm so blasé
Why you dancin' like your name Sade?
Hey, why you so worried 'bout me?
I said no sir, not today

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Syd]
I just came to dance
Wanna move
I can't with you
Sayin' la di da, la di da (la di da)
Said, I'm try'na dance (la di da da da)
Catch your groove
But not with you (la di da da da)
We go la di da, la di da
I just came to dance (come on)
Wanna move (come on)
I can't with you
Sayin' la di da, la di da (la di da)
Said, I'm try'na dance
Catch your groove (hey man)
But not with you
We go la di da, la di da (wait)

[Matt Martians & Syd]
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies. Please. There's enough of me to go around. I don't bite. (I promise, I promise) Oh me? You already know what it is. To be honest, all I really wanna do is take you to the bridge!

[Bridge: Steve Lacy]
Ooh ooh

5, 6, 7, 8)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
There's another new love
I know you tryna do right
But maybe we should stay cooped up
Like we don't know what moonlight is
Lately I've been going crazy
Begging you to stay
'Cause I just want you safe
Anger, ominous behavior
Got you feeling anxious all the time

[Chorus]
Maybe you should stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Why don't you stay the night
Baby just stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Why don't you stay the night
You know it ain't safe outside
You should just stay tonight
Why don't you stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Baby just stay tonight

[Verse 2]
You've been feeling kinda juiced up
Seeing things in a new light
I know you've been through stuff, but
I wonder if you're too righteous
'Cause lately people going crazy
I think you should stay
'Cause I just want you safe
Baby, I know that you're angry
Feeling like your fate is on the line

[Chorus]
Maybe you should stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Why don't you stay the night
Baby just stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Why don't you stay the night
You know it ain't safe outside
You should just stay tonight
Why don't you stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Baby just stay tonight
Talk to ‘em Pat

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I just (I just)
Think you should (you should)
Stay the night (stay the night)
I just (I just)
Think you should (you should)
Stay the night (stay the night)
You should kick it babe

[Chorus]
Maybe you should stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Why don't you stay the night
Baby just stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Why don't you stay the night
You know it ain't safe outside
You should just stay tonight
Why don't you stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Baby just stay tonight

[Guitar Solo Outro]

[Verse 1]
My love, I thought you knew
This karma thing, don't pick and choose
So every time that you perform
I learn just a little more
What a waste, babe, what a shame
You were playing games

[Chorus]
Words come out your mouth
Look around, what a mess you made
Watching from the crowd, it's astounding
You're on your way
Thought that you had changed
I found out it's just a role you play
Well bravo, baby
Bravo, baby oh

[Verse 2]
My love let's get this straight
This ain't your show, this ain't your stage
So no more standing ovations, Broadway plays baby
Save it for the main stage, baby
Go back to where you came from, came from

[Chorus]
Words come out your mouth
Look around, what a mess you made
Watching from the crowd, it's astounding
You're on your way
Thought that you had changed
I found out it's just a role you play
Well bravo, baby
Bravo, baby yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Look

[Outro]
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
I'm saying
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Damn
Ooh yeah
My, my, my, my, my
Ooh yeah
My, my, my, my, my
Ooh yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You just a girl I came to know
I thought you were relatable
You ask me out, ok for sure
I make myself available
You say, "Ok, then it's a date"
I say I'll pick you up at 8
We take the fancy car valet
I'll wine and dine ya until it's time, girl

[Verse 2]
The conversation is a must
You look amazing, that's a plus
My crib is close, I just cleaned up
I text my bros, they wish me luck (Ay)
Stop for a bottle on the way
Twist up the trees that's on the tray
Put my intentions on display
Right now, I want you, can I get closer?

[Chorus]
I compliment you on the nice road
You wearing something kinda nice too
I'm trying to get you in the right mood
Let me get you in the right mood
If I hit it the right way
Can I get a night too?
Let me get you in the right mood
I could get you in the right mood

[Verse 3]
Now that I got you all alone
Let's crack the wine, let's call a toast
Please have a seat, get comfortable
I'll try not to fuck up the flow (Nah)
Right where I want you
I'll check my posture, come at you proper, girl
Something about you
Climbed onto cloud nine, you lay on my couch
Heart beatin' like

[Bridge]
You feel it right?

[Chorus]
I compliment you on the nice road
You wearing something kinda nice too
I'm trying to get you in the right mood
Let me get you in the right mood
If I hit it the right way
Can I get a night too?
Let me get you in the right mood
I can get you in the right mood

[Outro]
(Hey, you feeling good right?)
(Oh, I know)
Baby, next time I'll bring you flowers
Roses, exotic daisies
Next time I'll take you out
Girl, don't you keep me waiting
Next time I'll bring you flowers
Roses, exotic daisies
Next time I take you out
Girl, don't you keep me waiting
Next time I'll bring you flowers
Roses, exotic daisies
Next time I take you out
Girl, don't you keep me waiting
Next time I'll bring you flowers
Roses, exotic daisies
Next time I take you out
Girl, don't you-

[Part 1: Next Time]

[Verse]
You were nothing but a momental face
You were only five minutes away
Shoulda met you when I had the chance
'Cause I'll probably never see you again

[Pre-Chorus]
My, oh, my
I'm wondering if
She knows I
Was plottin' on her
Does she come here often?
If so I gotta
Make a move, quit stallin'
It's hard to gauge with my heart racing
This back and forth is energy wasted
But what do I say if I see hesitation?
But what do I do if she walks away?

[Chorus]
Next time, I'll just start by saying hi
Ask her what her name is
If she has the time
Start a conversation
No, we don't have to talk for too long
I just wanna know
That before she could leave
I walked over and said hello
I said hello

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, baby
Don't hate me
Scratch that, you probably gon' hate me
I'll probably drive myself crazy
My mind, the cloud is so hazy
But, shawty would you be mine?
But can I be the one you get wit' in the meantime?
I mean it
Tell me what you think
Say if you were me
Would you come and speak
Or tell me would you

[Chorus]
Stop by, saying hi (Hi)
Ask her what her name is (Wha'cha name, bae?)
If she has the time
Start a conversation
No, we don't have to talk for too long
I just wanna know
That before she could leave
I walked over and said hello
Said hello

[Part 2: Humble Pie]

[Verse 1]
Aimless dreaming
Tell me why you sleeping
It's yourself, you're cheating in the end
This shit ain't easy
Baby, please believe me
Don't know what you're thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
I think you need a real love (ooh ooo, aah)
You gotta love something (ooh ooo, aah)
You know it's still love (ooh ooo, aah)
But you ain't doing nothing (ooh ooo, aah)
Damn

[Chorus]
I've been clockin' in
Night and day (Night and day)
It's working out for me
And you wonder why
No, you ain't hungry yet
Me, I got a plate (got a plate)
But I don't want a piece of your humble pie (humble pie)

[Verse 2]
All this wisdom, but you never listen
Now you stuck just wishing for the best
Assume the system gave you special privilege
But ain't nothing given

[Pre-Chorus]
I think you need a real love (Love) (ooh ooo, aah)
You gotta love something (ooh ooo, aah)
And you know it's still love (Love) (ooh ooo, aah)
But you ain't doing nothing, nothing, damn (ooh ooo, aah)

[Chorus]
I've been clockin' in
Night and day (Night and day)
It's working out for me
And you wonder why
No, you ain't hungry yet
Me, I got a plate (got a plate)
But I don't want a piece of your humble pie (humble pie)

[Outro]
(ooh ooo, aah)
(ooh ooo, aah)
(ooh ooo, aah)
(ooh ooo, aah)

[Verse 1]
Is something wrong?
'Cause you seem mighty low
Tell me what's going on
Probably been there before
Sit up and fix your face
You see me, I'm okay
We ain't got time today
Throw on your darkest shades and
Smile for the camera
I want you to know

[Chorus]
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time

[Verse 2]
Keep it up
I see you holding on
But it was easy, no?
Now you feel all alone
Quit crying, ease your pain
Gon' be here either way
Nowhere to place the blame
So put your make up on and
Smile in the mirror
I want you to know

[Chorus]
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time

[Verse 3: Big Rube]
Your inner strength is the reason you haven't said a word
But your countenance reveals the bad day that you've endured
It's probably not the first and not the last to be assured
The past is fleeting the future
A promise present keeping us moving forward
With hope we seek true happiness
Throughout our lives with
Trials we face bring pain and sorrow, but resistance sires strength
The easy path rarely leads to what our heart truly desires
In this life we must face many a worthy challenge for the outcome to satisfy us
To win in spite of struggle implies much greater magnification
To ones honor which I value more than instant-gratification
So believe me when I say that time can heal most any wound
And ease most pain, yet the scars remain until the day we lay entombed
So please know nothing in this moment is the same as a moment ago
Each one that pass is a treasure lost.......

[Chorus]
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)

[Outro: Patrick Paige II]
Tommorrow's not in your hands
That's why I pray to the man
And I think it's arrogant to make plans in advance
One day at a time
I burn the sage for all the negative, pay it no mind
I'm at ease with the struggles, they're better with time
Need not I remind
Tomorrow's not in your hands, neither is control
Nigga, reap what you sow and pay it in full
Think before you burn the bridge, paying the toll
Just play your role
So much pressure in the world I started gnashing my teeth
Hit the gas so hard I blew a gasket and leaked
Drain me for what I got like a nasty leech
You'll find hard learned lessons just asking our teach'
Life is just what you make it, take it how you gon' take it
My ground is solid and no earthquake could not shake it
Ain't waiting on nothing, not even no reparations
Heavily meditating, but it gets better with time
And I'm sober now, no alcohol to hide behind
I grow older and grow bolder
I move mountains and move boulders
I cross borders, don't take orders
And thank God, that's important

[Verse 1]
(Why?)
Know you got it coming, babe
You took this shit from zero to a hundred, babe
I hope you finally get it on your judgment day
'Cause you're gonna pay babe, you're gonna pay babe

[Verse 2]
Given you enough of me (nuff of that, nuff of that)
But need you when you said you were in love with me
(loved you back, loved you back)
I heard that you've been tryna get in touch with me
What you got to say babe? you got to say babe?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you should ask yourself (hey)
Was- was it worth it?
Before you go and ask for help (hey)
Do you deserve it?

[Chorus]
Girl you know what you did
Look what you started
What's going through your head?
Are you sorry?
There's nothing left to say (say, say, say, say)
There's nothing left to say (say, say, say, say)

[Verse 3]
Don't know what you're going through
You blame it on your problems but it's no excuse
(It's no excuse)
You can't keep playing innocent, I know the truth
I know that you're crazy, I know all your crazy (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 4]
Falling out of love with you  (nuff of that, nuff of that)
Wasn't easy but I finally gotten over you  (nuff of that, nuff of that)
More power to the one that gets a hold of you
'Cause I ain't gonna take it, ain't gonna take it

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you should ask yourself (hey)
Was- was it worth it?
Before you go and ask for help (hey)
Do you deserve it?

[Chorus]
Girl you know what you did
Look what you started
What's going through your head?
Are you sorry?
There's nothing left to say (say, say, say, say)
There's nothing left to say (say, say, say, say)

[Chorus]
Girl you know what you did (did)
Look what you started
What's going through your head? (your head)
Are you sorry?
There's nothing left to say (say, say, say, say)
There's nothing left to say (say, say, say, say)

[Outro]
Look
That's just the way that I felt (Just the way I felt)
Told you this time it's for real
So say goodbye (goodbye)
To you and I
Meanwhile I'll try to forget (I'll try baby)
The way you treated me then, no
It wasn't right (wasn't right) but you'll pay the price
Bitch
Oh babe, why

[Verse 1]
Early in the morning
She's running through my mind again
Girl, you got me wondering
If we should be more than friends

[Hook]
Do you wanna be
Do you wanna be
Do you wanna be
Don't you wanna be
Would you wanna be my girl? (Girl)
(Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl)
My girl, girl
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Every single evening
She's telling me about her day
My feelings get to creeping
I wonder if she feels the same

[Hook]
Does she wanna be
Does she wanna be
Does she wanna be
I think she wanna be my girl
My girl, oh (girl)
Damn

[Bridge]
I don't know
Pretty sure though
Damn
It's like
I think she wants to be (Girl, girl, girl, girl)
At least I hope she does, shit
Girl, yea, ooh oh
Ta-da yeah, ooh ooh ta-da, ta-da hey

[Hook]
I think she wanna be
I think she wanna be
I think she wanna be
I think she wanna be my girl (Girl, girl, girl)
My girl

[Outro]
Girl (girl)
Girl (girl)
Girl (girl)

[Verse 1: Steve]
So restless
Just need time to think
So much pressure
If you want to be
My girlfriend
'Cause I'm on the road
I don't wanna hear you tell me you told me so

[Chorus]
If it was me who fell in love
With you, someone who won't be home
I feel so lonely just because
I want you all for my own
But if it don't work it's okay
Because I'll be here for you all day, baby
Ooh
But the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on

[Verse 2: Matt]
She's so alone
Scratch forward
I just want us to be alright
I hope she don't let go
And then I cause her to think twice, whoa

[Chorus]
If it was me who fell in love
Would you still want me, won't be home
I feel so lonely just because
I want you all for my own
But if it don't work it's okay
Because I'll be here for you all day, baby
But the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on

[Outro]
The beat goes, the beat goes, the beat goes on
The beat goes, the beat goes, the beat goes on
The beat goes, the beat goes, the beat goes on
The beat goes, the beat goes, the beat goes on
Yeah the beat goes on and on
Yeah the beat goes on and on
Yeah the beat goes on and on
Yeah the beat goes on and on

[Verse 1]
Thinking ahead of time
Why don’t you spend the night?
I know you love me
Pick up and roll the dice
Reading between the lines
I know you love me
We can book a flight
Wake up in paradise
Sun up above us
Tell me you down to ride
And you can bet your life
No one above you

[Chorus 1]
Said hold on, can’t stop love
Said hold on, can’t stop la (can’t stop, yeah, yeah)
Said hold on, can’t stop la (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said hold on, can’t stop la

[Verse 2]
And as long as you’re with me
I’m definitely
Yours for the takin’
Don’t be mistakin’
And as long as you’re wit’ it
I’ll be committed to you

[Bridge 1]
(Ay, aw, yeah) I’ll show you what I know
You’ll give me what I need
Not saying I’m a pro
But you could learn from me
We go another round
Before we fall asleep
You got me on a cloud nine, baby
Feels almost like a dream
Something ‘bout your body (yeah, yeah)
La

[Chorus 1]
(Yeah, yeah) Said hold on, can’t stop la (yeah)

You’re ready to explode

[Chorus 1]

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
Last chance to buy before you fly
Last chance to buy before you fly

[Interlude]
Okay
In the morning it came to me
Build a tunnel from Zurich to New York
I find it hard to share this with anyone
Because even to me it sounded ridiculous
But one morning
After a long complicated night
I made my mind up, to share my vision with the world
Everything that follows
I'm not responsible for

[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too
You like the bad ones, too
You like the bad ones

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Verse]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Post-Chorus]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game
Round your city
Round the clock
Everybody needs you
No you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody being honest with you
Breathe till I evaporated
My whole body see thru
Transportation handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some pussy have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working thru your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (biiitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin no I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up
Did you call me from a saiyonce
You are from my past life
Hope you're doing well bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal coming in and out
Hope you're doing well bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Oooh nani nani
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body
New beginnings ahh
New beginnings wake up akh
The sun's going down
Time to start your day bruh
Can't keep being late on me
You know you need the money if you gon survive the
Every night shit
The every day shit
Dropping baby off at home
Before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though
Could you come by
Fuck wit me after my shift
You know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit that's everyday shit
Shut the fuck up I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation

My everyday shit everynight shit
Night shit

Been waiting on you all my night

All my night
You been missing all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's getting me right

(Wet Wet)

Every night fucks everyday up
Everyday patches the night up
On god u should match it it's that KO
No white lighters till I fuck my 28th up
1998 my family had the acura
Aww the legend/
Kept at least 6 discs in changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city building mansions
All the reverends
Preaching self made millionaire status
When we  could only eat at Shoney's on occasion

After trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin on you when I didn't own a mattress
Working on a way to make it outta Texas
Every night
Dropping baby off at home
Before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though
Could you come by
Fuck wit me after my night shift
You know them boys wanna see me broke down
Bummed out
Stressed out
Everyday shit
Shut the fuck up I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit everynight shit
My everyday shit everynight shit

[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, there's no answer and you called twice
Nobody be at my house
I was at the studio all night
Last night I slept on the couch
I might wake up and do it all again
There's a world goin' crazy outside
But let's pretend that it's alright
We keep pretendin' that it's alright

[Verse 1]
Yeah, alright
Days get mixed up (Uh-huh), schedules get switched up (Uh-huh)
Can't be two places at once (Yep)
So, I take a hit of the spliff that I lit up (Lit up)
And forget I had to be anywhere at all
Goddamn, how the mighty will fall (Fall)
They wanna see me gone, but I'm here in spite of it all (All)
I never play along
You can keep the fear and self-pity (Fear)
I'd rather tell you who I am really, yeah
This is not the wake-up call
I am the hotel operator, I don't owe nobody favors
I don't know how the fuck I've been around so long
Busy as a escalator in a crowded mall (Uh-huh)
It's like, every year I realize my house too small
Get paid, upgrade, two cribs, new maids, more flights, few planes
Live out my suitcase (Suitcase), lose days like loose change (Loose change)
I swear my life is on Blu-ray, welcome to doomsday
The world needs a hero and I am your Bruce Wayne
Kind of like Luke Cage, well (Well, well, well, well)
You keep on runnin', we keep on pushin' your buttons

[Chorus]
Yeah, there's no answer and you called twice
Nobody be at my house
I was at the studio all night
Last night I slept on the couch
I might wake up and do it all again
There's a world goin' crazy outside
But let's pretend that it's alright
We keep pretendin' that it's alright

[Verse 2]
I run around with open scissors (Yeah), they takin' pictures
I could lose my head, it grow instead, gets only bigger
I put one foot in front of the other, I never settle
Waste yo' time with water and wine, I'm turnin' liquid to metal
Still the (Still the) same dude that used to never be sure (Yeah)
When I was way more insecure, did not feel better before, no
Umbrellas never could weather the storm
No sympathy for the devil, too busy buildin' a temple
I am lookin' beyond (Beyond), leavin' 'em lookin'
Hot as the grill I'm puttin' 'em on when I be cookin', shit
(Cooking, cooking, cooking)
I keep on runnin' if I have to
Medusa never turned me to a statue, no
I keep it movin' (Movin', movin'), but keep it low (Low, low, low, low)
You can do your thing, shit, to each their own (Yep, yep, yep)
But you better do somethin'
We keep on pushin' your buttons (Buttons)

[Chorus]
Yeah, there's no answer and you called twice
Nobody be at my house
I was at the studio all night
Last night I slept on the couch
I might wake up and do it all again
There's a world goin' crazy outside
But let's pretend that it's alright
We keep pretendin' that it's alright

[Intro]
Yep, yep, yep, yuh, yep, yep

[Verse 1]
I don't got a reason to lie, they gave me the key to the sky
But I'd rather open my eyes, 'cause that's what'll keep me alive
Somethin' that's easin' my mind (Mind), please do not fuck up my day (No)
Everybody wanna headline, I don't got nothin' to say
'Cept I'm comin' back with the freshness, you know I love makin' a entrance
Now now, don't get defensive, time is a matter of seconds, one, two, yeah
Off to see the wizard, lead the picture, me and liquor, evil mixture, demons glitter
Cleanin' whiskers, he be Mr. Fisherman, back on my shit again
Doin' my own dance, feel the rhythm that's no hands
I tell ya vision like programs, busy livin' on triple digits, young old man
Y'all dead wrong, I'm upper with the echelon
So butter when the bread long, I'm goin' strong 'til my head gone, and my head gone
Yeah, floatin' back up on the scene, I'm sayin' hello (Hello!)
Do my thing, I'm pullin' strings like Tom Morello
I keep it movin', you be doin' way too much
I ain't tellin' time, just tell you when it's up (Yep)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm only keepin' good company
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me
Yeah, one for you and one for me (Yeah, yeah)
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me (Love for me)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I mean wow, do not touch that dial, I've waited a while
Been around, just like word of mouth, you gon' hear me out, and I-
And I, and I, and I put that on my house
I'm always goin' overboard, I better swim before I drown (Drown)
I'm like rubber with the bounce, hundred be the count
Drummin' loud as thunder with the sounds, yeah
(Bang, bang, bang, bang)
I was younger, fuck around, every summer wild
Always had it jumpin' at the house
Yeah, clappin' for y'all (Y'all), I'm into havin' it all (All)
Feelin' like Shaq with the call (Call)
Stature is tall (Tall), rollin' around with the homies
A battery pack on my dawgs (Yeah)
Fuck with my thoughts (Yeah), havin' enough ain't a lot (Lot)
Puttin' a check in the box, straight to the top (Top), it don't matter
Never mind the pattern when you takin' your shot, woo!
Yeah, enough with the bullshit, enough with the bullshit
Enough with the extras, fuck all my money
I swear I been through it (Swear I been through it)
Fuck all the losin' (Yeah), that's just an illusion
Gotta keep them comin' back for more to keep it movin' (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm only keepin' good company
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me (Mmm, mmm)
Yeah, one for you and one for me
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me (Love for me)

[Outro]
Follow me, I know the way (Follow me, I know)
(Who do we appreciate?)
Yeah, you know you better stand
Goddamn, put yo' hands together
Everybody got money, get the band together (Uh-huh)
Movin' like you can't stand the weather
But it ain't gon' rain always
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
The world is so small 'til it ain't, yeah
I'm buildin' up a wall 'til it break
She hate it when I call and it's late
I don't wanna keep you waitin'
I hope I never keep you waitin', yeah

[Verse 1]
I think I know it all but I don't
Why you always at the mall when you're broke? Yeah
And I just wanna ball
Maybe dunk, but I never been tall, yeah
I might trip, I never fall
God knows I came close (Don't try this at home)
I know I probably need to do better
Fuck whoever, keep my shit together
You never told me bein' rich was so lonely
Nobody know me, oh well
Hard to complain from this five-star hotel
I'm always in a rush, I've been thinkin' too much, but
Keep it on the hush, no one need to know, just us

[Pre-Chorus]
That's really all it takes
We don't need nothin' but today (Day), today (Day)
Today (Day), today (Day)

[Chorus]
The world is so small 'til it ain't
('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
I'm buildin' up a wall 'til it break
('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
She hate it when I call and it's late
(And it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waitin' (I don't wanna keep you waitin')
I hope I never keep you waitin' (I hope I never keep you waitin')

[Bridge]
Woo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, got a bad attitude, playin' 'til I'm out of moves
No need for shame, I get mo' peace at slow speeds
Go beat the game, young control freak
It's cold in my veins, I'm below freezin', snow season (Made me)
They know that I so need my space
Don't wanna grow old so I smoke just in case
She say that I glow below the waist
And the stroke is just so PGA
All I got is a little bit of space and time
Drawin' shapes and lines of a world we made
Tomorrow may be right around the corner
But I swear it's gon' be worth it if I make you wait
There's somewhere above you, keep reachin' up

[Pre-Chorus]
That's really all it takes (That's really all it takes)
We don't need nothin' but today (Day), today (Day)
Today (Day), today (Day)

[Chorus]
The world is so small 'til it ain't
('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
I'm buildin' up a wall 'til it break
('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
She hate it when I call and it's late
(And it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waitin' (I don't wanna keep you waitin')
I hope I never keep you waitin'

[Outro]
Yeah, nine times out of ten I get it wrong
That's why I wrote this song, tell myself to hold on
I can feel my fingers slippin'
In a motherfuckin' instant, I'll be gone
Do you want it all if it's all mediocre?
Starin' at the wall and the wall full of posters
Lookin' at my dreams, who I wanna be?
I guess you gotta see it to believe
Ooh, I been a fool but it's cool, that's what human beings do
Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes
Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
But the sun comin' out now, clouds start to move
Don't tell me nothin' but the truth
I'm tired, I don't got a spare second
Win or lose, win or lose
I don't keep count, nobody checkin'

[Verse 1]
Come on, strap on your sex bomb
Yeah baby, with your left arm
It's right on, yeah baby, press it
One, two, three
We got a thing, we feel it naturally

[Pre-Chorus]
She's got that kind of fashion
Chemical attraction
Ruby red lips and her eyes real low

[Chorus]
You're gonna miss her when she go, go, go
Shakin' her hips in her mothers clothes
You're gonna miss her when she go, go, go
It's just a question of the girl's affection
Now watch her as she go

[Pre-Chorus]
She's got that kind of fashion
Chemical attraction
Ruby red lips and her eyes real low

[Chorus]
You're gonna miss her when she go, go, go
Shakin' her hips in her mothers clothes
You're gonna miss her when she go, go, go
It's just a question of the girl's affection
Now watch her as she go

[Verse 1]
I know where you were last night
I saw you with your hands on her
Rubbin' her like you love her more than me
And I cannot believe
What's she got that I don't?
Know how you could pass up
A night with me to drive 'round homegirl
When I've got a body you can feel
Boy she's not even real
Don't lie to me 'cause

[Chorus]
I don't understand it
Why you always with your freakin' car?
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car?)
I cannot believe it
You'd rather be with your freakin' car
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car)

[Verse 2]
You stayed home to repaint her
When I could use a hot wax, personal manicure
I need attention too
So you might have to choose
'Cause I can't take it
When I know that I'm more fine
And I got the interior love and it's genuine
My trunk is just as round
And I'll never break down
Babe, it's not fair that

[Chorus]
I don't understand it
Why you always with your freakin' car?
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car?)
I cannot believe it
You'd rather be with your freakin' car
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car)
I don't understand it
Why you always with your freakin' car?
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car?)
I cannot believe it
You'd rather be with your freakin' car
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car)

[Verse 1]
Babe, ain't no denying
That I've got you in my head
Girl, I'd be flying
If you stood yourself and said

[Chorus]
You're the one I want
You're the one I need
You're the one I had
So come on back to me

[Verse 2]
Babe, you're so young and pretty
But you're evil, you oughta know
Darling, ain't that a pity
Won't you stand yourself and show

[Chorus]
You're the one I want
You're the one I need
You're the one I had
So come on back to me
Yeah

[Bridge]
See, where we've been
Won't you hold my hand and stay awhile

[Chorus]
You're the one I want
You're the one I need
You're the one I had
So come on back to me

You're the one I want
You're the one I need
You're the one I, you're the one I had
So come on back to me
Yeah, come on baby

[Verse 1]
Calling the world from isolation
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained
And if you're coming back to find me
You'd better have good aim

[Pre-Chorus]
Shoot it true, I need you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you

[Chorus]
(Calling you) I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now?

[Verse 2]
Calling the hunter with the rifle
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained

[Pre-Chorus]
Shoot it true, I want you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you

[Chorus]
(Calling you) I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now?

[Bridge]
If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?
Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail
And let you down?

[Chorus]
I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
(If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?)
I don't want this isolation
(Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail)
See the state I'm in now?
(And let you down?)

[Outro]
If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?
Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail
And let you go?
Lyrics from Snippet

I know it seems
That you're not where you're supposed to be
Ah, uh, huh, but I get you here in my life

Maybe I'm thinking it's better if you drive (Oh)
'Cause girls like you

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars (Eeoow)
Know it's really real if I let you meet my mama (Eeoow)
You don't want a girl like me, I'm too crazy
But every other girl you meet is fugazi (Okurrrt)
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call? Cardi, Cardi
Come and rev it up like a Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden? (Huh?)
I'm coming to you now doin' 20 over the limit (Wooh)
The red light, red light stop, stop (Skrrt)
I don't play when it comes to my heart, let's get it though
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage (Carriage)
I'm thinkin' more a white Porsches and carats
I need you right here 'cause every time you're far
I play with this kitty like you play wit' your guitar, ah

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause girls like you (Girls like you)

'Cause I ain't going nowhere
I know everyone is enjoying the circus but I want to clarify this image in question. This was not from a clothing brand shoot for my music career. This picture is from 2007, a time in my life where I was an actor and I was working on a project that was about young black actors struggling to get roles, being stereotyped and type cast. The photos represented how African Americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment. Me and my best Friend at the time Mazin Elsadig who is also an Actor from Sudan were attempting to use our voice to bring awareness to the issues we dealt with all the time as black actors at auditions. This was to highlight and raise our frustrations with not always getting a fair chance in the industry, and to make a point that the struggle for black actors had not changed much

No husband on me since I blowed up

[Verse 1]
Oscillate yourself tonight
When you're in your bed
Assimilate the dopamine
Passing through your head

[Pre-Chorus]
When you get back on a Saturday night
And the room is caving in

[Chorus]
Do you look like me? Do you feel like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this forever?

[Verse 2]
See yourself in Cupid's lake
Chipped in your head
Do you indicate to satellites
Passing by the edge?

[Pre-Chorus]
When you get back on a Saturday night
And your head is caving in

[Chorus]
Do you look like me? Do you feel like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this forever?
Do you dance like this forever?

[Bridge]
Do you look like me?
Do you burn like me?
Do you look like me?
Do you burn like me?
Do you look like me?
Do you burn like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?

[Chorus]
Do you dance like this forever?
Do you dance like this forever?

[Outro]
(Do you dance?)
(Do you dance?)
(Do you dance?)
(Do you dance?)

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna cry
I've got more time to give
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

[Verse 1]
Am I incapable of healing
The memory of my fall from grace in your heart
I'm on my journey home
With no fuel alone
I think I'll coast a while

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna cry
I've got more time to give
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm about to solve it
Put my engine back into overdrive
So I can breathe again, (photo) photosynthesize again (synthesize)
With the green hills of my home

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna cry
I've got more time to give
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream
I'm not gonna cry
(Pave the way to me)
I got more time to give
(It's getting nasty)
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

[Bridge]
But if I got it right, you'd tell me
And if I was wrong, then I'd disappear
But I'm incapable

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna cry
(Pave the way to me)
I got more time to give
(It's getting nasty)
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

[Verse 1]
Hey
What is this drumming I'm hearing now?
All over me

[Chorus]
Everybody cool down
Everybody see yourself
Everybody on time
On time
Everybody hold on
Everybody hold on to your inner vision

[Verse 2]
Hey
What is this drumming I'm hearing now?
All over me

[Chorus]
Everybody cool down
Everybody see yourself
Everybody on time
On time
Everybody mining
Everybody mining their own inner vision
Everybody lie down
Everybody pool light
Everybody on time
All the time
Everybody hold on
Everybody hold on to your inner vision

[Outro]
(Inner vision)
(Inner vision)
(Inner vision)
Everybody (Inner vision)
(Inner vision)
(Inner vision)
Everybody (Inner vision)
(Inner vision)
(Inner vision)
Everybody (Inner vision)
(Inner vision)
(Inner vision)
Everybody (Inner vision)
(Inner vision)
(Inner vision)
Everybody (Inner vision)

[Verse 1]
I'm on the high ridge looking down
While we're evolving in it all
If I get back then I'll be grateful
Look there's a billboard on the moon

[Verse 2]
Let me take you this far
This crossing isn't much to me
There's lightning in the storm clouds
And I'll send you there to stay

[Chorus]
You got me lost in Magic City
You got me questioning it all
I hope that I make it home by Wednesday
And this Magic City lets me go

[Post-Chorus]
Magic City
Magic City
Magic City
Magic City

[Verse 3]
You put me up here in the penthouse
And painted me in red, white and blue
I filled the canyons with my ego
Look there's a billboard on the moon

[Chorus]
You got me lost in Magic City
You got me questioning it all
I hope that I make it home by Wednesday
And this Magic City lets me go

[Verse 1]
If you see me floating too many times
My face will be painted in these white brick lines

[Refrain]
'Cause all my fears invaded
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
Living on the limits

[Verse 2]
And if you say goodbye too many times
The sentinels will find me and switch me off this time

[Refrain]
'Cause all my fear's evaded
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
Living on the limits

[Chorus]
If all you ever get from the summit is the count of the fall of man
Every call and cost made to your heart
You were in the kind of game that put the force in me
I was ever chasing fireflies

[Bridge]
Sometimes I follow a firefly
It takes me into the night
Baby, I just survive
I'm love drunk, I'm sorry
Am I losing you?
Sometimes I follow a firefly
It takes me into the night
Baby, I just survive
I'm love drunk, I'm sorry
Am I losing you?

[Chorus]
If all you ever get from the summit is the count of the fall of man
(Takes me into the night)
Every call and cost made to your heart
(Sorry, am I losing you?)
You were in the kind of game that put the force in me
(Takes me into the night)
I was ever chasing fireflies

[Verse 1]
Every sound
Every sound from everyone, receiving you
Everyone, receiving you
Anyone
Not anyone of us who is in search
Everyone's receiving you

[Verse 2]
Come by the long way
Deep in the summer day
I'll be there with you
(That's where I heard it for myself)
On the training ground
For the new world
You heard it too

[Verse 1: 2-D]
LA why you're so complicated for me, twilight
Waiting on the planet to turn to me, dark side
If loving you's a felony now, then I'm a renegade, riding
Trying to find tomorrow ain't easy 'til you dive in
(Swimming pools)

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Why you rolling waves over me now, that's all I need, dreaming
Waiting on LA to come find me, be forgiven
I'll be a regular guy for you, I never said I'd do that
Why you looking so beautiful to me now when you so sad?

[Chorus]
I will always think about you
That's why I'm calling you back on my way through

[Verse 3: 2-D]
I wanna stay with you for a long time; I wanna be stone, love
I wanna see LA in your eyes when I'm leaving with your love

[Chorus]
I will always think about you
That's why I'm calling you back, 'cause I got to run soon

[Outro]
I will always think about you
That's why I'm calling you back on my way through
Why won't you be yourself?
Maybe your love is for someone else
You pushup like all the things you see
So maybe it's best that we just don't speak anymore
Anymore

Why won't you do the things you say?
Maybe I'll try some other day
You push up like all the things you see
So maybe it's best that we just don't speak anymore
Anymore

To feel this way (x4)

Why do I feel like my feelings matter more than yours?
They don't, they don't

Why do I feel like my feelings matter more than yours?
They don't, they don't

Eight million people in the city and I think my feelings matter
But they don't
Why do I feel like you're the one that matters
But I don't?

Push up like all the things you see
So baby it's best that we just don't speak

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
It's a lotta, it's a lotta sexy women in the room right now
Can we, can we get the lights a little more dim?
Can we get the lights dim?
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Tell 'em get the lights dim
Dependin' on how my night end
She give brains, and that's enlight'ment

I'ma ball just like it's a rider, man
She said she wanted to find a man
Now she lookin' like geroniman

How she love a nigga?
Yeah, I'm just thuggin', nigga
Yeah, uh, a few nights ago
Nights ago, nicer, nights to go
Lost out in the world
But I lost her soul
We is yours, yours is ours
Now it's yours, so make a choice
So make a choice
I wish I had Miguel's voice
So I could sing, ayy, ayy
So I could sing
So I could sing (Hahaha)

[Break: A$AP Rocky & Miguel]
Na, it was no melody
I tried to catch somethin', there's nothin' in it
Fuck you, fuck you
Yeah, straight up, yeah, easily

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Fuck you and all them hoes that you came with
You been on the same shit
Huh, would you come and roll with a real one?
I know you seen a real one
Oh, million dollar style now
Uh, I know that you tied down
Huh, oh, won't you take the top off?
Come on, girl, we could cruise it side-out
Ah, on the west, on the east side
Hey, you know how we ride
Uh, we're the reals
Come through on the field
It's been as long as I can tell you, baby
I gotta whole lot to show you now
Make your next choice, your best choice, bitch
With the voice, the best voice, with the best voice, bitch
It's time to go away, go away
I know you want to stay, hold up
Wait, we on the east, right?
New York never had 

[?] like this
We've been on a 

[?] all night
Come through if you wanna ride light
Oh, we on it all night, all night
Come in, all night, alright, ohh

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky & Miguel]
Rocky with realest
Rocky with the business, I ain't even finished
Beat the pussy up and now she need the dentist
I'll just get replenished, I'll just love it
I don't know how she don't get it
Never with the winners in the inners
And she ridin' in the sprinters, lookin' business
You ain't need your friends, tell 'em, "Hop on it"
Bitch, ayy, bitch, ayy, ho (Hahaha)
Suck my fuckin' dick when I come to the floor
When I come through the door
Big-ass nigga with a muthafuckin' pimp cane
What's my nickname?
Hey, sugar-free on the muthafuckin' mic
I grab it tight, I smack a bitch in the face
With a pen and then I do my thing again, yeah
And you know a nigga gettin' on the muthafuckin' dope
You cross your t's and dot your i's
Do everything the magazine say
But somehow now you find yourself
Unhappy again
Pour all your dreams into the tube
And let it dictate life for
But no you find yourself wanting more than you're looking for
A fantasy love all along like the movie star
A fantasy love, oh a love
Maybe you'll find it someday

That real pollen, sweet pollen
Bought the house and played the part
But something still don't feel right
The pressure building on your chest
Maybe it's just the routing stress
A restlessness you've always know
But when you close your eyes at night
The feeling keeps you wide awake
That maybe something's out there
Greater than the life you've made
A fantasy
A fantasy
Don't fall
Don't fall
Don't fall

[hook]
Look in my eye's, we not the same nigga
Look how far i came, from trapping out of public housing to a mansion

[Intro: Francis and the Lights & Kanye West]
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it

[Spoken Word: Kanye West]
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say "don't say this, don't say that"
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

[Verse: Kanye West]
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none
Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say "He died so young"
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we Old Bay
We was all born to die, nigga, DOA
Niggas say they hero, mm, I don't see no cape
Mm, I don't see no, mm, yeah, I don't see no, mm, mm
If I wasn't shinin' so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay
Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (Ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Kanye West]
I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin
And I don't feel like
And I know you wouldn't leave

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They say, "Build your own"—I said, "How, Sway?"
I said, "Slavery a choice"—they said, "How, Ye?"
Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
Now I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls
My wife callin', screamin', say we 'bout to lose it all
Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't leave

[Bridge: Jeremih]
And I sometimes wish
We doin' such things
We could wait longer than this
Yes, you know you're one of these
We can run through with the top chopped, yeah
And the sundress down, ooh

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't...

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental
You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental
Every time somethin' happen they want me sent to mental
We had an incident, but I cover incidentals
You want me workin' on my messagin'
When I'm thinkin' like George Jetson
But soundin' like George Jefferson
Then they questionin' my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts again
Then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two, but me and you, that's infinity

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't...

[Chorus: Choir, PARTYNEXTDOOR & Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't feel like she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up (Why?)
Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin (Out of my skin)
And I don't feel like (Uhh)
And I know you wouldn't leave (Love me or hate me)

[Outro: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
For any guy that ever fucked up (Love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they girl (Love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they wife (Gone when you miss me)
She told you not to do that shit (Ohh)
She told you you's gon' fuck the money up
But you ain't wanna listen, did you?
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Now you testin' her loyalty
This what they mean when they say
"For better or for worse", huh?
For every down female that stuck with they dude
Through the best times, through the worst times
This for you

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't leave

[Intro: Slick Rick]
Believe it or not
Believe it or not

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Kid Cudi]
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you

[Verse: Kanye West & Slick Rick]
Take the top off, let the sun come in (The Lord still shines on you)
Whoa, for all my dogs that stayed down, we up again (Again)
Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard
I had debt on my books, it's been a shaky-ass year
Let me make this clear, so all y'all see
I don't take advice from people less successful than me
Hah? Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off
And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
Had to tell the dogs, "Turn the snubs off"
Plus they already mad that the Cubs lost
(Believe it or not) These two wrongs'll right you
(Believe it or not) I was too grown in high school
(Believe it or not) The true soul of Ice Cube
Too close to snipe you, truth told, I like you
Too bold to type you, too rich to fight you
Calm down, you light skin

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Kid Cudi (Slick Rick)]
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (Make no)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (No way)
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (No way)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you

[Intro: Shirley Ann Lee]
Someday, someday
Someday I'll, I wanna wear a starry crown

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Someday, someday, someday
I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
Hold up, hold up
Someday, somedays, I remembered this on a Sunday
Backway, yeah, way, way, burning, mhm-mhm
Uh, somedays, I wanna tell everybody
Somedays I wanna hit the red dot on everybody
Somedays, ohh (Heatstroke)
Now that I'm livin' high, I'm smokin' marijuana
Now that I'm livin' high, I do whatever I wanna, oh, yeah

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Someday we gon' set it off
Someday we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Someday the drama'll be gone
And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what they had in mind
But maybe someday

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

[Outro: 070 Shake]
Woah, once again I am a child
I let it all go, of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free

[Intro: 070 Shake]
Fallin', dreamin', talkin' in your sleep
I know you want to cry all night, all night
Plottin', schemin', findin'
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me you will see

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (Night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Verse: Kanye West]
Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

[Chorus: 070 Shake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (Night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
I'm saying it like...
"I want a daughter like Nicki, aw, man, I promise
I'ma turn her to a monster, but no ménages"
I don't know how you saying it but, let 'em hear this

[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare, myself, myself

[Verse 1]
Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2C-B, huh
Is he gon' make it? TBD, huh
Thought I was gon' run, DMC, huh
I done died and lived again on DMT, huh
See, this a type of high that won't come down
This the type of high that get you gunned down
Yeezy, Yeezy trollin' OD, huh
Turn TMZ to Smack DVD, huh
Russell Simmons wanna pray for me too
I'ma pray for him 'cause he got MeToo'd
Thinkin' what if that happened to me too
Then I'm on E! News

[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself

[Verse 2]
Ayy, hospital band a hundred bands, fuck a watch
Hundred grand'll make your best friends turn to opps
I hear y'all bringin' my name up a lot
Guess I just turned the clout game up a notch
See, y'all really shocked, but I'm really not
You know how many girls I took to the titty shop?
If she get the ass with it, that's a 50 pop
I still bring the bad bitches in the city out
Uh, just a different type of leader
We could be in North Korea, I could smoke with Wiz Khalifa, uh
Told my wife I've never seen her
After I hit it, bye Felicia, that's the way that I'ma leave it up

[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
See, this is why all the bitches fuck with Ye!
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout!
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
They take me on meds, off meds, ask yourself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Ask your homegirl right now, "Look, you had a shot at Ye?"
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
You'd drop everything!

[Verse 3]
Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2C-B, huh
This is why your bitches fuck with me, huh
Smash, she gon' end up on TV, huh
Last thing that you ever wanna see, huh
I can feel the spirits all around me
I think Prince and Mike was tryna warn me
They know I got demons all on me
Devil been tryna make an army
They been strategizin' to harm me
They don't know they dealin' with a zombie
Niggas been tryna test my Gandhi
Just because I'm dressed like Abercrombie

[Outro]
You see? You see?
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!
That's why I fuck with Ye!
See, that's my third per-
That's my bipolar shit, nigga, what?
That's my superpower, nigga, ain't no disability
I'm a superhero! I'm a superhero!
Agghhh!
Your demeanor is cold as ice
And your heart—hard as stone
You’re not very nice
And you don’t care who knows

But beyond the mask
Something lies
A dark and hurtful past
Somebody wronged you long ago
And now you don’t know what to do

Just let it go, babe
Let it go, baby
Let it go (x2)


You go though life living a lie
Drowning truths in the hidden tears you cry
Why won't you let it out?
‘Cause deep down, you just want to be free
But you sit right there with a pathetic stare
While the world just passes you by
Be human and show some love
Don’t hurt yourself anymore
Just let it go, babe
Let it go, baby
Let it go, go
Let it go


Refrain:

Baby won't you let it go
Baby won't you let it go
Baby, baby, baby
Won’t you let it go
(Repeat 8x)
She's cheekbones and shade (4x)

I'll never forget her
She was one of the first to ever love me
And I can't replace
All the memories that I have of her

And though they are fleeting
Be it so
For they never lie farther than the stars (stars....stars)

She's cheekbones and shade (4x)

And sometimes she smiles
But not that often
I said, sometimes she smiles
But not that often

Cheekbones and shade
She brightens up
My day, she does, oh yes, she does
(6x)
She's cheekbones...
(repeat x3)
Things aren't quite what they seem
Is life a nightmare or a sweet dream?
Are we at the beginning
Or have we reached the end?
To start over again
Start all over again
Over again
To start over again
Start all over again
Are we at the beginning
Or have we reached the end?
To start over again
To start over again
Start all over again
Over again
I've been traveling for so long
Looking for someone to bring along
And I thought I'd settle down for one like you
But I can't stop even if I wanted to

Traveling
Traveling
Traveling
Oh lord

Traveling
Traveling
Traveling
Oh lord

Turn back, no
Let's not pop the question now (?)
Cus I've always made it through
Someway
Somehow
Now's the time to focus
And move away (?)
But I still think
Always of her

But I'm traveling
Traveling
Traveling
Oh lord

Yes, I'm traveling
Traveling
Traveling
Oh lord

Yes I'm traveling
Traveling
Traveling
Oh lord

Yes, I'm traveling
Traveling
And I can't slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down

Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down

Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Traveling

I can't slow down
Even if I want to
I can't slow down
Can not wait for you
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down

Down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down

Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Pacing ‘round the room
I realize
That I no longer have that much time

As it slips away
Your face reveals itself
And I realize you were just trying to help

But time runs out
But time runs out

Now I’m left to contemplate this fail
And drown my sorrows in this wishing well
I really haven’t traveled off too far
But I’ve burned out like the death of a star

Ooh, ooh
Death of a star
A star

Death of a star
A star
(I’m losing it….losing it)


I like watching you
You shine like diamonds at night
(diamonds…diamonds)
And I like watching you
Work so hard day and night

Oh I wanna take you to see
One of my favorite bands play
But this city always takes you away from me


You hold the key to my heart
But what you keep losing it?
You hold the key to my heart
But what you keep losing it?

Lying here with you
As we push away the blues
We let the embers blow
Freeze time and never let it go
You hold the key to my heart
But what you keep losing it?
(let it go love)
You hold the key to my heart
But what you keep losing it?
(losing it)

Ooooh,ohhh

Im losing it over you
Can't find time to be with you
Anymore
This city takes all our time away
Time away
Slips like sand through my fingers

[Verse 1]
You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

[Chorus]
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh, you don't know you're beautiful

[Verse 2]
So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

[Chorus]
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful

[Bridge]
Nana nana nana nana, nana nana nana nana, nana nana nana nana
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful

[Chorus]
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Finally, we can be alone all by ourselves
You and me, nobody better, can't get you wetter (Oh)
Girl, I'm the greatest, and you're mine (Oh)
It's so right, you know why?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I got that dirty money, put it right in front of her (Yeah)
She ain't even worried 'bout her come up (Oh)
She want me to fuck up the summer (Yeah)
Flex, yes, checks keep coming (Oh)
Best sex just keep coming
Me? I only need one woman
The truth will set you free, I'm being honest
The only thing I need from you is one night

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So I gotta be ready
Girl, I gotta be prepared for whatever it is you don't like
Oh-oh
I'ma do this your way, whatever you say
I'ma take your side

[Verse 2: DaniLeigh, Chris Brown, Both]
Yeah, if I was your baby (Baby, baby), never let you go
I'm just your lady (Lady, lady), I won't let you fall (Fall)
Anytime you call (Call), no worries at all (All)
We can risk it all, please to make you all mine (Yeah)
I'm the baddest, you already know (Yeah)
Had sex at all my shows
Ain't no limits that I'd go for you, ooh (Oh)
Tell me I'm your favorite (Favorite)
Specially when you taste it (Taste)
Ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I got that dirty money, put it right in front of her (Yeah)
She ain't even worried 'bout her come up (Oh)
She want me to fuck up the summer (Yeah)
Flex, yes, checks keep coming (Oh)
Best sex just keep coming
Me? I only need one woman (Yeah)
The truth will set you free, I'm being honest (Yeah)
The only thing I need from you is one night

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So I gotta be ready
Girl, I gotta be prepared for whatever it is you don't like
Oh-oh
I'ma do this your way, whatever you say
I'ma take your side

[Outro: Chris Brown & DaniLeigh, Chris Brown]
Your side, your side
Whatever it is, baby girl, I know that you'll ride
You'll ride, I'm on your side
Ain't gon' lie, tell you one more time I'm on your side
Your side, your side
Whatever it is, baby girl, I know that you'll ride
You'll ride, I'm on your side
Ain't gon' lie, tell you one more time I'm on your side
I'ma take your side

[Intro: Eddie Kendricks + (The Temptations)]
It's just a lonely world without you, baby
(A lonely world without you)

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks + (The Temptations)]
When I had your love, I guess I was just too blind to see
How empty life would be without the love you've given to me (oh yeah)
Selfishly, I hurt you, baby; thoughtlessly, I made you cry
Now I'm the one left alone to cry (left to cry)
Since you said goodbye (said goodbye)

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks + (The Temptations)]
It's just a lonely world without you, baby
(A lonely world without you)
So sad (Lonely, lonely world without you)

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks + (The Temptations)]
Now, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, I need you (Baby, I need you)
Really got to have you (Really got to have you)
No good without you (No good without you)
Baby, I know that I'm the blame, and life won't be the same
I'm a lonely man (lonely man) in a lonely room (lonely room)

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks + (The Temptations)]
It'a just a lonely world without you, baby
(Lonely, lonely world without you, oh yeah)

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks + (The Temptations)]
With all my heart and soul, every night I kneel and pray
Find some plan, some schemes for me, I'll get you back one day
Baby, I should have known, I'd miss your loving when you were gone
Now I'm a lonely man (lonely man) in a lonely room (lonely room)

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks + (The Temptations)]
It's just a lonely world without you, baby
(Lonely, lonely, world without you)
Now baby, Whoa baby (Lonely, lonely world without you)

[Outro: Eddie Kendricks]
I'm so sad, baby; so lonely, baby
Can't live without you
No good without you, baby
And I'm so lonely
So lonely

[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Verse 1]
You know I'm hittin' you up this late at night 'cause I'm tryna fuck
I'm tryna start with the conversation
You actin' scared of a real nigga screamin', "Thug life"
Got that pussy wet, drippin' with the condensation
I know that Henny got you stuck, but it's bottom's up
I tried to cheat her with the love, but she by the book
And when I show that girl my mattress, she kinda shook
I'm tryna feel up on that ass, not designer clothes
Girl, the way you play, then that shit don't get to me
Fuck the finish line, already got the victory
And we 'bout the time to make history
And you know that she called

[Chorus]
She called me on the late night
Baby wanna make love
Want me to get into somethin'
And she don't even wanna realize that I'm hittin' her up
It's late at night, girl, I'm tryna fuck
I'm horny, baby, horny, baby
So baby, freak me tonight
Jump on my pony, babe, pony, baby
Fuckin' up a rich nigga vibe, oh

[Post-Chorus]
You spend all day missin' me (Missin' me, ha)
Late at night, you be kissin' me (Oh)
Act like that pussy don't get to me
Act like your love ain't shit to me

[Verse 2]
Baby, you ain't listenin' (Yeah)
Spendin' too much time, face down and that ass up
Fuckin' me, beg your pardon
Don't give a damn if you mix it with molly, just put your glass up (Yeah)
I get that pussy, I'ma man up
I love it when you give my dick the double standard
I'm in Miami with your bitch in a cabana
By the time you land, I can ghost up in a Phantom
And you know I'm never talkin' to the popo
My niggas follow that street code
You know it's East Side on the West Coast (Woo!)
I been lookin' at your body, baby
And I can't keep my hands to myself
Get it any way you want it, baby
You a bad motherfucker, yeah

[Chorus]
She called me on the late night
Baby wanna make love (Oh, oh)
Want me to get into somethin'
And she don't even wanna realize that I'm hittin' her up (Oh)
It's late at night, girl, I'm tryna fuck (Yeah!)
I'm horny, baby, horny, baby (I'm horny, babe)
So baby, freak me tonight (Ooh)
Jump on my pony, babe, pony, baby (Oh-whoa)
Fuckin' up a rich nigga vibe, oh (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
You spend all day missin' me (Ha)
Late at night, you be kissin' me (Ha)
Act like that pussy don't get to me
Act like your love ain't shit to me
Here's to the tour that taught me that your real friends really don't care about the "he said/she said." Here's to the moments when we've forgotten all about the things that scare us, the things we're insecure about, and in spite of them, we jumped around together under flashing lights, fireworks, and confetti.

To the times I learned, by watching you sing along to every song, that my greatest triumph in life has been finding the ones who like me for me. And that even in your worst times, they can see the best in you.

Here's to the musical family I get to share the stage with and all the things they've sacrificed in their lives to be able to sing, play, and dance as well as they do. Here's to our extraordinary crew and the days they spend away from the ones they love so that we can stand under the lights and play for you. Here's to the people who work at these stadiums and help clean up the glitter on the floor after the party.

Here's to getting smarter and harder in the nick of time, but still remaining delicate enough to care deeply for the ones you can trust, and brave enough to stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes. Here's to life teaching us lessons, and us learning, growing, dancing, and changing together. Everything I've learned about a "reputation" and how little it really means when defined by those who do not know you, I've learned from the fans whose spirits lit up these stadiums.

Thanks to you, I'm doing better than I ever was.

Love,
Taylor

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I gave you the best that you ever had
Gave you one dose and got you addicted
I could own that, all night and all day
Get you on my plate, girl, you so delicious
Last night we had a real good time gettin' faded
I wake in the morning you gone
It's been on my brain all day replayin'
Like it's on record
I don't miss any minute
I'mma take plenty chances
My love for you is bigger than a mansion
More than you can imagine
I want all of your kisses
Mistletoe before christmas
If you ain't got it, don't get it
If you got time, it's no limit

[Chorus: Jeremih & Chris Brown]
Baby, won't you give me something
That I wanna do?
When I see the sun set
Yeah, I think of you
I think of you
You're all I want too
Left panties by my nightstand
Now I think of you, I think of you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Loving my baby, yeah, you giving me that sweet talk
Love's up and down, it's like living on a see-saw
Do me a favor, baby, why you blaming me for?
All I wanted was love, baby
Last night we had a real good time, we was naked
Bumping and making love
Got me with all these games you playing
It's time for us to grow up
Don't care 'bout winning (yeah, yeah)
Come on, baby, I got the answers (yeah, yeah)
You ain't gotta be a dancer (yeah, yeah)
All I need is your love
Girl, you won't change my mind
And I can see you hesitating
So, baby

[Chorus: Jeremih & Chris Brown]
Baby, won't you give me something, ooh yeah
That I wanna do?
When I see the sun set, oh, girl
Yeah, I think of you, baby
I think of you
You're all I want too
Left panties by my nightstand
Now I think of you, I think of you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I think of you
Girl you been on my mind
And all I think of is you, can I have it baby?
(Can I have it baby?)
Can I have it baby? Gotta have it babe
And girl I need a bit of your love (Yeah)
And you know we gon be all night, girl take your time
I'mma take a chance with your heart baby girl
It's a reason why, I'm in love (Love)
Girl you know I'm in (Love)

[Verse 1]
Come to me
I'll take care of you
Protect you
Calm down
You're exhausted
Come lie down
You don't have to explain
I understand

[Chorus]
You know that I adore you
You know that I love you
So don't make me say it
It might burst the bubble
Break the charm

[Verse 2]
Jump off
Your building's on fire
And I'll catch you
I'll catch you
Destroy all that is keeping you down
And I'll nurse you
I'll nurse you

[Chorus]
You know that I adore you
You know that I love you
So don't make me say it
It might burst the bubble
Break the charm

[Post-Chorus]
So don't make me say it
It might burst the bubble
Break the charm
So don't make me say it
It might burst the bubble
Break the charm

[Intro]
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
My friends say you're so into me
And that you need me desperately
They say you say we're so complete
But I need to hear it straight from you
If you want me to believe it's true
I've been waiting for so long, it hurts
I wanna hear you say the words, please

[Chorus]
Don't, don't let me be the last to know
Don't hold back, just let it go

(I don't wanna wait another day)
And I don't wanna wait another day
I wanna feel the way you feel, oh, c'mon

[Chorus]
Don't (Don't), don't let me be the last to know
(Just let me be the one)
Don't (Don't) hold back (Hold back), just let it go (Just let it go)
I need to hear you say (I need to hear you say)
You need me all the way (You need me all the way)
So baby, if you love me
(Don't, don't, don't) Let me be the last to know

[Intro]
(He's a shady character, what's his name?)
Ah wait a minute , I've got his card
Oo yes! here it is (DOOM... I see)
It ain't nuttin' like, Hip Hop music

[Verse: MF Doom]
It Ain't nuttin' like a fist full of cash or a bliss full of the hash
That twist like a mustache, from end to end, spread it like a rash
From talking through your Walkman or at your disco bash
Give me the Timbs Rumpelstiltskin brown
A metal face mask with a built in frown
A mic to tilt down, a hundred thousand pounds
And see how kilt sound like spilt milk clown
Cocoa butter on very ashy day fam
With Ray-Bans out on the islands of Cayman
Or I'll break it down for the layman
Bain De Soleil for that Saint Trope... tannnn
A can a ole gold too cold to hold, slow ya roll
Keep on moving like Soul II Soul, hold the dough
Like a fool who stole pity y'all
From tryna' go up against city hall titty bar
The black mic is like a red violin
Ok, everybody back to the lab, try again
Bloody rap game like Leviathan
Leave a bad taste, killin' my high like Niacin
Stop kiddin' middlemen need Ritalin
Hit me with the full tin of gin and I'm a kid again
Keep the bong lightin' straight through the song writin'
The Supervillain AKA the thong bitin', that's inviting all
To the reciting that's dope and raw
Hoping all y'all come in peace and its open bar
Tear the roof off this Bumba Ras Clot
By the end of the night spazz like Shazbot
Spilt a shot made the pen lines runny
A ill plot that's ten times Ben Stein’s money, funny
How he rips the scripts with a straight face
With more rhymes than is lines in ya database
Placing rappers in endangerment, who's reckless
With this food for thought sorta' like breakfast
You could mark it off as wreck on the checklist
Wear gold fronts, can't afford no necklace
Shit, that there, could go to help buildin' daycares
Somebody say yeahh.. (yeahhh!)
Pay ya fares,... give the Herbalizers their shares
And y'all could pay DOOM in beers... Cheers!...

[Intro]
Keep your hoes in check...
(Super!)

[Verse]
I got this girl and she wants me to duke her
I told her I'd come scoop her around 8, she said ("Super!")
That sounds great, shorty girl's a trooper
No matter what I need her to do, she be like ("Super!")
Own his own throne, the boss like King Koopa
On the microphone he flossed the ring ("Super!")
Average emcees is like a TV blooper
MF DOOM, he's like D.B. Cooper
Out with the moolah, I let her get a outfit
Just to cool her off she said niggas ain't about shit
I wonder if she meant it, I doubt it
The way it be in her mouth she can't live without it
And can't live with this, handle your business
Villain'll stay on a scandalous ho's shit list
One pack of cookies please, Mr. Hooper
It's fun smacking rookies, he is the ("Super!")
Look like a black wookie when he let his beard grow
Weirdo, brown-skinned'd, always kept his hair low
Rumor has it it's a S-Curl accident
DOOM was always known to keep the best girls' backs bent
Some say it's the eyes, some say the accent
A lot of guys wonder where they stacks went
I call her thunder thighs with the fatty swolla
Only mess with high rollers, do what daddy told her
No matter the city she with me to do the thang-thang
Work in the coochie, hooptie chitty chitty bang bang
Same name on the titty as on the name ring
Pretty like Baby D off "All in the Same Gang"
Keep my eye on her, really don't trust her
But I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut
And the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa
Teach her how to hold it, of course he is the ("Super!")
See most cats treat her like Foofur
Or beat her to a stupor, take it from the ("Super!")
You need to make her feel cuter
And lay down the G like Luther, everything'll be ("Super!")
Do for her, keep her in a new fur
So she look sweet when she go to meet the ("Super!")
Got the buddha get the Grenadiers, twist it
Put it in the air, come here, kiss it
Listen here scooter, let her try to bag you
When she's on the rag, never let her fry the Ragu
Which'll have you under some type of spell crying "dag boo"
Her name on your back in a tattoo
Whether a bougie broad, nerd ho, street chick
Don't call her Wifey if you met her at the Freaknik
You don't want her don't waste her time, I'll dupe her
And be a father to your child like the ("Super!")
He keep his hoes in check
Sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks
Tell 'em take his clothes, leave him posing naked for real
Better yet, get him for the check off the record deal
Find out where he keep the Tec and the blue steel
Make sure for extra wreck, let him know how you feel
And while he's running down to All-Star Weekend to ball
I'm coming with the U-Haul ("Super!")
("Super! Super!")

[Intro]
Mmm, Ladies

[Verse]
Mary, you make me wanna eat you
Everytime I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Fragrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be seafood
Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich like a magazine-y model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, complexion like Acapulco Gold
If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer-load (trailer load)
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit it while you would've sold to the highest bidder, like
Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute, and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight and letting everybody hit it (Ally)
Unlike Ally (sometimes she gets bitter)
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her until to this day and never did abuse her
I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably could've been, if I'd never meet Evie
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though
Kept a shorty, man, find 'em much thinner
If caught, I get mad time just for touching her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds (Lucy)
Little young thing, she liked to do the tongue thing
At times she would play hard to get, fronting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling
Met her out in Central Park--that's one sign
Had the God mentally sparked, reflecting sunshine
She said "you need to stop messing with that white girl
She fucking with your head and got your heart in a tight curl" (cookie)
We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the dunce price OT
Plus she from Colombia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish
And Miss Hazy, older woman, mature black
Everytime she sees me, I end up gettin towed back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is that she make me too lazy
Sugar-mommy laced me with the butter navy Avi
Just her way to make up for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on

[Outro: MF DOOM]
Mmm, Ladies
My favorite ladies

[Part I]

[Verse 1]
A modern day marvel, but terrible—better—horrible
When he grab the mic from son, he crushed up all his metacarpals
He said he ain't mean it—totally by accident
After the show, he didn't follow where y'all taxi went
Will this be available on wax? Ask Max Mill
They on the opposition to his ass-wack tax bill
But will it pass the senate? Slum lord tenant
And super like 1-A, have a fun stay
One day, he plan to put in a runway
With enough land for his own projects and gun play
Section 8 penthouse, maid look like Faye Dunaway
Alotta y'all ass out like gay runaways
It's how they say "semi-risque"
All day everyday, give out Emmy's the quick way
Have the average MC say, "Gimme a sick day!"
They really ain't got shit to say like Timmy McVeigh
Get a hunch, a real rag tag bunch
In school, he kept a doo-rag in his bag lunch
Just to eat heads on some breakdance shit and spit
He writ this skit in Sanskrit
If the pants fit, sport 'em, but rock 'em low
Your man like Rollo on the slow, can't knock it though
It's like the same hustle, bro, two knuckles glow
Tucked-in Le Tigre—just let the name-buckle show

[Part II]

[Verse 2]
Good googly moogly—see that loogie?
Yeah—but keep it on the D.L. Hughley
You don't watch her, he might house her like Doogie
Just to cut her loosie like, *swoosh*—Mitsurugi
Gooey gum drops—who he got his style from?
—his pops—you gotta give the bum some props
Ask ya sister—her beat box is more-thicker
DOOM that nigga detox with more liquor

[Part III]

[Verse 3]
Villain for hire—admire the sound
Make sure the price is right before he come on down!
Rappers be on some "You, you, you!"
Forgot who they talking too, too much pork stew
They need to not come out with nothing new
Blew the whole shit up on some "What this button do?"
Doom cheat the game like walk-thru
Run 'em, son 'em like Mr. Rourke do Tattoo
The way alotta clowns get down is unnatural
This flow flip like oranges, apples
Rhymes like limes to a Lemonade Snapple
Leave her at the chapel, don't eat scrapple
First thing they notice when they come to is they bling is gone
Then they start remembering the Klingon with the rings on
In came the Villain with their own gear like, "Hi, there
Y'all play the rear, this whole year—my year."
Metal face beard like Brillo pad
Y'all know his steelo so don't feel so bad
Seed call him, "Ol' dad," the one the ol' ho had
Knew he was a winner since a swimmer in the gonads
Okay pal, pay him like Paypal
So we could be A-OK not OK Corral
I think today I'll make the ladies say, "Ow"
And maybe fuck around take a bow, now

[Part IV]

[Verse 4]
Who made his first mill and still carry razor blades
Used to be straight A's and still made the grade
'Tarded ass, how he get cash so fast?
Year after last, left back in the retarded class
Shoulda went to Boces
Watch him all closely, who he think he supposed to be
Villain who always win, at least he stay consistent
Find out where that bitch went, get a room, pitch a tent
Yo—yo, Max—yo, change the beat, yo
You got another one?
I got this girl and she wants me to duke her
I told her I'd come scoop her around eight, she said (super)
That sounds great, shorty girl's a trooper
No matter what I need her to do, she be like (Super)
Own his own throne, the boss like King Koopa
On the microphone he flossed the ring (super)

The way it be in her mouth, she can't live witout it
And can't live with this, handle your business
Villain'll stay on a scandalous ho's shit list
One pack of cookies please, Mr. Hooper
It's fun smackin rookies, he is the (super)
Look like a black wookie when he let his beard grow
Weirdo, brown skin'ded always kept his hair low
Rumor has it it's a S-curl accident

Only mess with high rollers, do what daddy told her
No matter the city she with me to do the thang-thang
Work in the coochie, hooptie chitty chitty bang bang
Same name on the titty as on the name ring
Pretty like Baby D off all in the same gang
Keep my eye on her, really don't trust her
But I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut
And the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa
Teach her how to hold it, of course he is the (Super)

Listen here scooter, let her try to bag you
When she's on the rag never let her fry the Ragu
Which will have you under some type of spell crying dag boo
Her name on your back in a tattoo
Whether a bourgie broad, nerd hoe, street chick
Don't call her Wifey if you met her at the Freaknick
You don't want her don't waste her time, I'll dupe her
And be a father to your child like the (Super)
He keep his hoes in check
Sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks
Tell 'em take his clothes, leave him posing naked for real
Better yet, get him for the check off the record deal
Find out where he keep the Tek and the blue steel
Make sure for extra wreck let him know how you feel
And while he's runnin down to all star weekend to ball
I'm coming with the U-Haul (Super)
(Super)
(Super)

[Verse 1]
Smack it up, flip it, pulled out, 'bout to fell
Sunday in the ATL and I'm all outta ale
Like a bat out of hell, tripped on a cat tail
Mutt drinkin out a pail, who let the rat out the cell?
Got all the ingredients and recipe, might as well
Since last week, the bootlegger been in jail
If all else fail, inhale the L
Makin' sure they can't see your sale via snail mail
Mind like a sewer, servin' rhyme on a skewer
DOOM'll step to a fine dime like he knew her
"My black sister!" She said, "Step back!" before he kissed her
She did the dipper and the smack just missed her
There go a list of politics like Henry Kissinger
99% of rap's just a friendly listener
I'm like, "These dudes must have some screws loose to hate y'all"
Or a couple of ounces short of deuce-deuce or 8 Ball
Y'all know it's time for the end when the day come
Buy a album, get rudely insulted over fake drums
Same CDs you get for free, you break 'em
Wa-alaikum, make 'em eat they food like Steak-umm
Why she wanna ask me if I could pass the paprika?
One hand on the mic, the other on the beaker
Every week or so, peeked out the lab though, eureka!
A technique to keep somethin' uniquer in ya speaker
For yo' information, I didn't do the beat, y'all
It ain't my fault if she didn't move her feet at all
Skeeter, robbed Peter to pay Paul
So he could trick it on Mary so she can play ball

[Chorus]
She better have my scrilla
Cut it out with all that funny hand jive, will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast and make you haul ass slowly
Remind me to remember what you told me
Holy moly, did you get a load of her roly-poly?
Yo, G, remind me to remember what you told me
Whoever don't feel him, feel balls like a goalie

[Verse 2]
One for the money, two for the better green
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine
Told the knock-kneed ghetto queen, "Get the head fiend"
Tell him it's for Medellin and use oxyacetylene
Who needs airplay? It's all just hearsay
Leave a wig like it was having a bad hair day
Miracle glide master, asked him what's his secret
He said Shasta and turned to formaldehyde faster
When I'm home with my lady, I try to duke her daily
One night, she tried to flail me with her ukulele
Pack your heat, the Villain on the cover of Black Beat
With a bunch of crackers and some snack meat

[Chorus]
They better have my scrilla
Cut it out with all that funny hand jive, will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast and make you haul ass slowly
Remind me to remember what you told me
Holy moly, did you get a load of her roly-poly?
Yo, G, remind me to remember what you told me

[Verse]
It's the beat, he hear it in his sleep sometimes
Blare it in your jeep so your peoples can stare at them rhymes
Real rhymes not your everyday hologram
Even when ribs was touchin', never swallowed the ham
He'd rather eat a sand sandwich salad
It might need salt like your man's bland ballad
A lot of stuff happens that the news won't tell you's
Blues on L juice, snooze, all hell loose
Rake it, take it like the good, the bad, the ugly
Break it, rollin' through ya hood in the caddy buggy
Butter softly, leather flossy, fatty juggy
Always threw me off when she told me, "Daddy, funk me"
I'm like, "Anywho's"
Seeds walkin' all out in street with out any shoes
I guess it's better than some funky socks
You need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pox
Instead she wanna hear the beatbox
Take pills and make fake krills as sheetrock
Sing it, bring it, back to your laboratory
While he's in his oratory, glorious like a horror story
The mask is like Jason
They told the place not to let the basket type case in
He could be some kind of wacko
Waitin' for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack ho
He busted in, blessed be the Lord
Who believe any mess they read up on a message board
If so, I got bridges for the low low
Same bitch a-go dry snitchin' to the popo
Here, orange peel stogs for the whole tier
Feel like I've been gone over a year, came home to old gear
It was the shit when I first scooped it
At least I get to sit out in New York and curse stupid
Plead the fifth, sip wine stiffly
Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy
Gift for the grind, criminal mind shifty
Swift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty
Well edumacated, he heard it when he meditated
In deep theta, let her hate the creep later
Dedicated cheap skata who keeps data
Say he stay self medicated to sleep later
Side effects is similar to sugar pill
Whoever go next on the mic he put a booger, ill
And made his exit on some calm shit
Begged him on the regular for kegs of more vomitspit
("Doom!")

Remove worry

We can shape our future. I'm an optimist at my core. I know there will be harmony

energy is contagious

Art is the threat to authority

Art is the escape hatch from oppression

what makes kids so important to learn from psychologically is that they are not afraid to fail

What would you do today if you are not afraid of the consequences of failure?

We’re all kids

or at least we're dying to be kids

Or we’re dying because we've lost our inner child

we're dying to be ourselves
we’re in this so-called information age but we're starving for wisdom

we're being starved and anyone who starts asking unpopular questions gets demonized. Only free thinkers can change the world

There's a silent majority of people that have been silenced for too long

[Chrous]
I wrote this song to tell you how I feel
Oh, the feeling is too real
Don't give a fuck 'bout your apparel I wanna peel
Our first date was cool 'cause you promised a sequel
It's all for you, it's all for you-ou-ou, all for you
It's all for you-ou-ou-ou
Girl, there's gotta be another way
I'm runnin' outta time, to tell you my favorite line
I need to know if you would like to be-e mine
Girl, it's gotta be another way, oh-oh-ohh
And girl, I cannot wait another day

[Bridge]
I wrote this song for you, I wrote it for you-ou-ou, all for you
I promise I do-o-o
I do need you to come and stay, oh-oh-ohh

[Chrous]
I wrote this song to tell you how I feel
Oh, the feeling is too real
Don't give a fuck 'bout your apparel I wanna peel
Our first date was cool 'cause you promised a sequel
It's all for you, it's all for you-ou-ou, all for you
It's all for you-ou-ou-ou
Girl, there's gotta be another way
I'm runnin' outta time, to tell you my favorite line
I need to know if you would like to be-e mine
Girl, it's gotta be another way, oh-oh-ohh
And girl, I cannot wait another day

[Verse 1]
If you ever wondering where I am
Anchor to my own wonderland
These different time zones
How do I ever land by you
By you?
Yeah, all these days go by and it feels like I'm counting sand
I want you around me to fill up this emptiness
Girl, help me write the story with a happy ending with you
(Oh yeah) For you

[Chorus]
I want you close, closer, baby
'Cause this long distance ain't working for me (No)
Why do you have to be overseas?
'Cause this technology, you know it

[Post-Chorus]
It don't do it for me (Hey, yeah)
For me (No, it don't, it don't)
It don't do it for me (No, it don't, hey)
For me
(It don't do it, baby, no)
It don't do it for me

[Refrain]
Baby, you know I'm in love
Your body, I got the answers (For me)
Why you teasing me all the time?
'Cause it don't do it for me
Baby, you know I'm in love, yeah
Your body, I got the answers (For me)
(Oh yeah)
It don't do it for me

[Verse 2]
I've been drinking way too much
Time goes so slow, an orbit around the sun
Is there any chance you could fly to me?
To me, please?
Don't hang up your cell phone, don't give up on me
I'm tryna make this FaceTime last
Actin' like any time, innocent free
Oh-oh, I need you here with me, yeah
To write these songs, oh-oh, about you

[Chorus]
I want you close, closer, baby
'Cause this long distance ain't working for me (No, whoa)
Why do you have to be overseas? (You have all this water)
'Cause this technology, you know it

[Post-Chorus]
It don't do it for me (Hey)
It don't, it don't do it for me
It don't, it don't do it for me (Hey)
It don't, it don't do it for me (Oh)
(It don't do it baby, no)
It don't, it don't do it for me

[Verse 3]
Girl, I need all of your love
Sun down to sun up, yeah (For me)
For me, oh baby
It don't do it for me (It don't do it for me)
Give it here, give it here (Yeah)
Girl, I know you've been waiting (For me)
And you know that
It don't do it for me

[Refrain]
Baby, you know I'm in love
Your body, I got the answers
Why you teasing me all the time?
(For me)
Baby, you know I'm in love
Your body, I got the answers
Why you teasing me all the time?

[Verse 1]
Matthew claimed he heard
Gunshots in the morning
We had been at home
Snow covered the city
Later on that day
Katie came in screaming
She said there's somebody
Laying in the alley

[Verse 2]
Five of us gathered around
Mary Helen's front porch
We walked over slowly
And found a man in all black laying face down
I walked over slowly (Slowly)
And I prayed that he was sleeping
Tapped his foot three times
But nobody answered
Nobody answered

[Outro]
Vincent
Vincent
Vincent
Vincent (Ooh)
Vincent (Ooh)
Vincent (Ooh)
Vincent (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

[Pre-Chorus]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

[Chorus]
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still running, dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

[Pre-Chorus]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

[Bridge]
Looking at you, I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless of my objection, yeah, yeah, yeah
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin
Just come over, pull me in, just

[Chorus]
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle, oh-oh-oh
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle, oh-oh-oh
'Yeah'
'Yeah'

Ladies and gentlemen, now I'm going to do a song
Taken from my album, 'The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie'
The name of the song is called, umm, 'Fingertips'

Now, I want ya to clap yo' hand, come on
Come on!
Yeah!
Stomp yo' feet
Jump up and down, do anything that you wanna do!

Yeah!
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare?
Is there still longing there?
Oh, I hate myself and I feel crazy
Such a classic tale
Current girlfriend, ex girlfriend
I'm trying to be cool
I'm being paranoid, am I seeing things?
Am I just insecure?

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

[Chorus]
So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume

[Verse 2]
I wanna fill the room, when she's in it with you
Please, don't forget me
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments?
I know you got history
But I'm your girlfriend, now, I'm your girlfriend trying to be cool
I hope I'm paranoid, that I'm just seeing things
That I'm just insecure

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

[Chorus]
So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory
So I, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory
I gotta mark my territory

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume

[Intro]
Ohh, I swear I'll never change
I swear I'll stay the same
No matter how much that I make

[Chorus]
Ohh, I swear I'll never change
I swear I'll stay the same
No matter how much that I make
No matter how much that they hate
Jump out, still saucy
I know they can't stand me, they stare at me
They can't catch me, I'm too damn fast
I'ma hop out that bird to the Seven Series

[Verse]
I can see the money with a blindfold
Every joint I'm on, bitch, I gotta go
I remember sleeping in my buddies home
Now them hunnids in the rubber, bitch, it won't fold

[Refrain]
Bitch, you so cold, I'm so cold, ooh
Bitch, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
One motherfucker tryna play me like a console
No way, no way

No way, no way

Ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Bitch, you so cold, I'm so cold, ooh

Ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh

"Damn!" ("Oh!")
"You see that dunk? Nigga that shit was off the chain"
"Now that's what I'm talkin' about, looks like your boy Twan is about to get paid"
"Nigga go head home"
"Tell 'em, Sylvester, that shit was furious"
"Nigga, you see this razor to my head? You better back up, it ain't that serious"
"Oh my bad"
"Now man, sit down, T"
"And talk to me, what was that shit you was sayin' to me about a mysterious phone call?"

While Twan sits down in the chair, and gives Sylvester what he calls the script
Let's take it out to the streets where Pimp Lucius is with his hoes, on the strip
"H-huddle, I say, bi-bi-bi-bi"
"Bitches, huddle"
"Listen to me now"
"Somebody grab Nocea, and turn her ass around"
"Now, Pimp Lucius is at a loss. And somebody gotta pay the cost"
"One of you bitches been comin' up sh-sh-short"
"A-a-and I ain't no dummy"
"Bitch better have my m-m-m-m-m"
"Shit, y'all know what I'm sayin'"
"Y'all gon' m-m-m-m-m-mess around and make me slap your ass like I did Tina"
"And I ain't playin'"
"Somebody better talk to me"
Woah, meanwhile, betweeenwhile, let's go back to the barbershop
Where the game is over and Twan done won, and it looks like he done won a lot
"Well my man, how much is it gon' be?"
"Hol' up Sylvester, you ain't gotta pay for nothin', G"
"Mm"
"Haha, 'cause I got you and me, yeah, fools"

Now Sylvester and Twan is leavin' up out the barbershop
Continuing the conversation about the mysterious phone call that they both got
"So I'm like, how much am I gettin' paid?"
"You know what I'm sayin'?"
"After that, what did they say?"
"Man, they was on some all 'answer some questions about some people'"
"Did they say my name?"
"Man naw, why?"
"'Cause I got the same phone call, some guy"
"Yeah sound kinda like he funny"
"Yeah"
"But I don't care, as long as I get this money, you know what I'm sayin'?"
"Nigga, you already know"

"Wait a minute"
"What?"
"Oh, look at this here"
"Pimp Lucius"
"You know I gets my pimpin' on"
"Oh shit, ain't that your dude?"
"Yeah, I be pimpin' all these hoes"
"Fool, that was way back in high school"
"You knows I get my pimp- wait. Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait."
"Sylvester, is that you-you-you-you?"
"What up, Lucius?"
"That's Pimp Lucius, don't get it twisted"
"Man, he can call you whatever the hell he wants"
"Twan"
"Ain't nobody talkin' to you, macho man"
"Man, you Don Juan knockoff, man, I will bust a cap in yo-"
"Twan"
"Haaaaaaa"
"You don't want none of this, motherfucker"
"I will kick your face off, hit you in your face with your face, nigga"
"Twan"
"Now back up"
"Twan, let me holla at ya"
"Yeah, that's right, you better tell 'em"
"I'm a pimp, never been a wimp"
"Daddy, are you okay?"
"Don't touch my arm, bitch, you're gon' make me lose my balance"
"Ooh, Sylvester man, I started t-"
"You started to what? Catch another case?"
"Now what did you promise me?"
"What did you promise me?"
"Alright, alright, alright"
"I was gon' chill"
"That's right"
"L-l-look like they 'bout to kiss or somethin'"
"Man, I will-"
"Now man, never mind that fool"
"Besides I'm hungry, let's go get a meal, on you"
"Hm"
"What? You the one with all the money"
"Yeah but I paid for your haircut"
"Yeah, I'ma call you Donald Trump right now"
"Yeah Sylvester, you real funny"
And then they start to walk off
But Pimp Lucius calls 'em back
He says "Sssylvester, I need to holla at ya if you got a s-s-sec"
"Hold on, Twan"
"Man, tell that fool to go head home"
"Man, I said hold on, Twan"
"Yeah, hold on, Twan"
"This won't be long"

"Wassup?"
"You know, me and you go back"
"Chasin' these hoes around in high school"
"To doin' time in the joint"
"Lucius"
"That's Pimp Lucius. Now Sylvester, respect my profession"
"Man, whatever, just get to the point"
"Alright, I need to borrow a couple o' racks"
"What?"
"N-n-now don't worry, I'ma pay you back o-o-on the first"
"And what's the first?"
"The first chance I get"
"Man, I'm good"
"W-w-w-w-wait a minute, playa'"
"Help a pimp out, I keep gettin' the strangest phone calls"
"And now I think they watchin' my house"
"Why don't you ask your mother and father?"
"No"
"For a couple of days, can you come and stay with them?"
"Man, they don't wanna have nothin' to do with me ever since I became a pimp"
"Man, I don't blame 'em for that"
"Twan"
"I just can't see 'em actin' like that"
"I mean, them bein' Christians and all"
"And besides, that's your mother and father"
"Man, I think you should give 'em a call"
("He's right, Lucius")
"What?"
"What was that?"
"Did you hear that?"
"Did I hear what?"
"Shh"
Yeah, ever since Pimp Lucius went to church and got a word from Reverend Moseley, it's been kinda hard
'Cause ever since that day, things ain't been the same
'Cause outta nowhere, he gets a scare, and here's the voice of God

"You're goin' crazy, man"
"What?"
"Call 'em up"
"Now Sylvester, you know good damn well I can't do that"
"Call 'em up, Lucius"
"Wait a minute, where ya goin'?"
"How you gon' play a pimp?"
"Call 'em up"
"Didn't I tell you I was gon' pay your ass back on the first?"
"Call 'em up, Lucius"
"Sylve- Mr. Incredible?"
"Call 'em up, Lucius, yeah, haha"
"Let's get the hell outta here, man"
"Daddy"
"Lemme go"
"Daddy, you okay?"
"Lemme go"
"It's gonna be alright, Daddy"
"Now just stop it"
"And go get the car. Go"
Rufus begins to pray
"God, if you can hear me now"
"Please change impossible to somehow"

"Mrs. Longs, wait"
"I've waited long enough"
"But your husband's in there in pieces"
"Yeah, well I'm tired of pickin' 'em up"
"Oh, you don't wanna be like that"
"Where's this damn elevator?"
"In fact, I don't think you really mean that"
"Yeah, I don't, and what do you know?"
"I know you're pressing the elevator"
"Yeah, and?"
"And we on the first floor"
"Well I'll just take the stairs"
"That would be the basement, Cathy, wait"
"Now, sometimes we all make mistakes" ("Mmm")
"But that doesn't mean we can't get better, no"
"Don't run away"
"Now you got a man in there, fightin' for y'all marriage, on his knees"
"Yeah, well what am I supposed to do about it, when that man hurt me so deep?"
"Yeah, but that's why you both are here"
"To work it out"
"Yeah, but what is there to work out, when he s-" ("Shh, shh")
"When he said he was still in love with that man, ooh oh"
"I know, now listen to me"
"See, once upon a time I had this couple"
"And they both were 

[?] about their struggle"
"And I just couldn't get them to understand, the purpose for a woman and man"
"Side to side, better or for worse, a marriage"
"Yeah, but what's that got to do with me and Rufus?"
"With you and Rufus? Everything, Cathy"
"'Cause that same couple broke up fifteen years ago and to this day, they still not happy"
"Haunted by their past, and what if" ("Oooh")
"And I just think you guys got a real chance here"

Now meanwhile, Rufus is prayin' real hard, goin' in
On his knees in the doctor's office askin' God to forgive him for his sins
"God, help me, I'm so confused, and I just don't know what to do"
"And you know that I love my wife, but Chuck is so hard to lose"
"Help!"
"I really, really wanna forgive him but it's the hardest"
"I know"
"Help!"
"But in all fairness, Cathy, you did have a man in your closet"
"Help!"
"Look, you can do this"
"You said if I called on you, you would be there, now what are you gonna do?"
"Rufus, I, baby I forgive you"
"We'll work it out"
"Yes"
"We'll work it out"
"Oh"
"We'll work it out"
"I love you"
"I love you too"
"I, uh. I mean I really don't know what to say here, what-"
("Talk about your life")
"Huh?"
("Chuck, your wife Cathy")
"What?"
("You know, talk all about you having an affair")
"What?"
("With another man")
"Wait a minute, that wasn't the plan"
("Did you sleep with Chuck?")
"Sir, if you want to talk about the church and what it's doing for the community, you talk to me"
("But the paper said-")
"I am a pastor and I'm not here to put my family's business out on the streets"
("Yeah that's right, you a pastor, so why is confession so hard?")
"It's not, it's just that the only one I need to be confessing to is God"
("Sir, will you be-")
"This is over"
("Will you be appearing on the show-")
"God bless you, and thank you"
("You can't do this. Does Chuck have AIDS? Is that what the package is?")
("Sir? Sir, are you gonna answer the question?")
Rosie and Randolph in the bed, tryin' to get some sleep
But something's heavy on Randolph's heart, and he can't sleep a wink

"Hmm. Hmm"
"Shit. Did you really mean that?"
"Did I mean what?"
"Hm. Did you really, really mean that?"
"Did I really, really mean what?"
"That night you said what you said"
"And what did I say?"
"You know what you said"
"You the one that said it"
"You called me Mr. Can't-get-it-up"

"You ain't gettin' me"
"Didn't I get you?"
"No"
"I got you"
"Get the door"
"I got yo' ass"
"Oh hell"
"Oh hell is right"
"Who this ringin' my bell?"
"Ever since I called Randolph Mr. Can't-get-it-up, he been outta his mind"
"Walkin' around the house, grabbin' his stuff, who does that at eighty-nine?"
"Damn it, I'm sixty-nine"
"Oh shut up and wait your turn"
"You see what I mean?"
"Got somethin' to show me? Well ain't nobody tryna see that little thing"

"Well first of all, let me tell you about Rosie"
"And it ain't 'gon be much to say"
"But since we tellin' the truth, she jealous of me and that's twenty-four hours a day"
"She called me Mr. Can't-get-it-up, shit, she done went outta her mind"
"Eighty-nine? I'm sixty-nine, and I can still pump and grind"
"Woah, woah, let me get some of this"
"No, wait a minute, god damn it, you done already had your turn"
"Randolph, I got somethin' to say"

"Hallelujah"
"Thank you, Jesus"
"An old buddy of mine, Al Green, said it best"
"Can I get a amen up in here? Haha"
"Now some of y'all don't know I used to sing background for that man"
"'Til God came in and swooped me up off my feets"
"And he, oh he could do the same for you"

"Well I got somethin' here that'll change your very life"
"Thank you, God"

"And that's a discount, so do it now"
"And this Trapped in the Closet book is yours"

Tina and Roxanne at the restaurant
Roxanne says "Jackleg preacher, he's so full of shit"
Then Tina says "Don't say that, girl, he's a preacher"
Roxanne says "I know a preacher when I see one"
"And he ain't no preacher"
"Tina, there's so much I've got to teach you"
Then Tina's eye start blinkin' again like it did before
She throws the broom on the floor

"And it's time for Tina to make her own damn decisions"
"Yeah, I slept with Roxanne a couple of times, and I gotta admit it was cool"
"I needed a job and a place to live but I'm tired of playin' by the fuckin' rules"
"So anyway, we both got a phone call to come on some TV show, to talk about the shit"
"At first I said no, but you know what? I think I'm gonna go"

"I don't know who the hell she think she is if she think she can talk to me this way"
"She got another thing comin', let me tell you somethin', she gon' fuck around, make me catch a case"

And then he opens the door
"Come on in, Lucius"
"Mama, that's Pimp-"
"Mmhm"

"Now, what you come round here for?"
"I-I need a favor"
"We ain't got no money"
"Now, Randolph"
"Yeah?"

"Now what's goin' on, honey?"
"We- I need to borrow a few racks, and a place to lay my head"
"Honey, what's racks?"
"You ain't layin' that head in none of these beds"
"Douglas"
"Damn it, don't call me by my nickname"
"It ain't your nickname"
"Hm?"
"It's your middle name"

[gasp]
"Now go on, Lucius"
"I-I-I-I-I-I"
"Hey, now just calm down, and take your time, baby"
Lucius starts to explain to his mother
How he's been gettin' the strangest phone calls
And then the doorbell starts to ring again, Randolph's like:
"What the hell is goin' on?"
Then Pimp Lucius says "Mama, I'll pay you back the first, if you do this"
"Baby, what's the first?"
"The first chance I get"
"Don't tell me you 'bout to go for this shit, Rosie"
"Randolph"
"Rosie"
"Mama"
"Lucius"
"That's Pimp Lucius"

Now everybody's screamin', goin' insane, while the doorbell's ringin' off the chain

"Shut up!"
"Now didn't I tell you h-h-hoes to wait in the car?"
"Yes, but Nocea wanted to se-"
"Shut up!"
"Now don't utter another goddamn word"
"You see this fist?"
"Mhm"
"Now whose idea was this?"
("Hm, pigeon gon' shit on you, this time")
"Bitches"
"Didn't I ask you a fuckin' question?"
"Well we were all sittin' in the car, and it was just takin' too long"
"And then Nocea got worried and she said to us: 'Let's get out and see what's goin' on'"
"And that's-"
"Shut it up!"
"Now just shut your goddamn mouth!"
"You can't bullshit me, Nocea my ass"
"Hell, this bitch can't even see"
"Now get yo' ass back on in that car"
"Daddy, let me explain"
"I can explain"
"Help her! Guide her!"
"Call my bitches En Vogue, ain't that some shit"
"Coat!"

"All I wanted was to borrow a few racks and a place to lay my head"
"But Pappy Douglas know he be trippin'"
("Trippin'!")
"He ain't wanted to have nothin' to do with me, yeah"
("Ain't that a bitch")
"Ever since I dropped outta high school and started pimpin'" ("Pimpin'!")
"I'm blingin', oh, I'm the meanest"
"You'd have thought I was a drug, the way I keep these hoes

("Daddy, you the-")
"Sh!"
"Y'all shut the hell up"
"This my confession"
"Now what kind of father would put his son out on the streets?"
"Call me a pimp or thug, I'm still his blood, how could he do this to me?"
"Church!"
While Sylvester and Twan is walkin' down the alley, Sylvester is tellin' him more
And as they get closer, you hear the rap music beatin' through the door
And then

"What the fuck?"
"Bankhead, it's me, yo"
"I say what the fuck, niggas?"
"Man, just calm-"
"Dude, I'm just here to see Beano"
"Tell Beano"
"It's Sylvester and some strange lookin'-ass nigga out here to holla' at him"
("He said bring 'em in")
("He said bring 'em in")
("He said bring 'em in")
"Bring yo' ass in"
"Hmph"
"Wait"
"Don't 'hmph' me, nigga"
"I'll pop yo' nugget"
"Get yo' ass on in there"
"Damn, you gotten grumpy in your old age"
"Yeah, yeah, whatever, motherfuckers move"
"Alright, alright, have a cigar"
"Man, the only thing I'ma be smokin' around this bitch is you two fools"
Then Twan and Sylvester, they walk in
And then they make a left (Left)
And then a right (Right)
And downstairs (Stairs)
And keep straight (Keep straight)
Then they make another left (Another left)
And another left (And another left)
Then up the stairs (Then up the stairs)
Third floor (Third floor)
Elevator (Elevator)
("Come on motherfucker")
("Move yo' fat Italian ass on outta here")
("Yeah, message from Beano, bitch")
("Yeah, whatever, move it fatass")

And through some doors, and then
Next thing you know, Sylvester says
"My man, Beano"
"What up, playa'?"
"Don't come in here with that sweet talk, nigga"
"Now just sit yo' ass down in these chairs"
Beano mean mugs 'em both and says
"Now who is this motherfucker?"
"My brother-in-law, man he's cool"
"Beano, should I pop his nugget?"
"Bankhead"
"Sylvester, you know the rules"
"Yeah that's my bad, Beano, but after this we got some place to be"
"So can we get right down to business? It's all good, baby"
"Yeah, it better be"

[grunting]
"Can he get a water?"
"Shut up, motherfucker"
"Nigga talk to me"
"Well I'ma make it quick, there's some real heavy shit comin' outta Miami"
"And I know some niggas in it 

[?] gonna move it for me"
"Yeah and just what kinda heavy shit are we talkin' about here?"
"Heavy shit. Now Beano man, let me tell you the lick"
Now Sylvester tries to whisper through it, but it's hard to talk over all the rap music
"We can get this money, it's a in-and-out, baby I could buy one of these stallions"
"Haha, haha.. ha"
"Shit ain't funny, you think I'm a dummy? I know you doin' deals with the Italians"

[grunting and choking]
"Look Beano, man, it ain't-"

[laughing]
"That's fun-"
"So tell me, how Joey doin'?"
"Fuckin' rattin', spaghetti and meatball eatin' motherfucker popped me on the Chicago deal, way back"

Now Twan look at Sylvester, Sylvester look at Twan
Then they look at Beano and all of his goons
Then outta nowhere, Twan stands up and says
"Man ain't nobody tryna play you"
Then Bankhead says "Sit the fuck down, before I bobble yo' head"
Then Sylvester remembers Twan's gun is in a holster on his leg
Beano screams "You motherfuckers come up in my establishment? And disrespect me?"
"Bankhead, take 'em out back"
"Now wait a minute"
Twan hits one goon, and then he kicks another
Then Sylvester pulls the gun on Beano and says
"Don't make me shoot you, my brother"
"Now back up"
"Motherfuckers back up"
Then Twan takes Bankhead's gun and says
"You heard what he said, motherfuckers don't act up. Wooo!"
And then Beano says "Your families, friends"
"They won't live to see the weekend"
Sylvester keeps the gun at Beano's head, they all can't do nothin' but stare
They backed up to the door, Twan say "Let's go"
Then they ran the fuck up outta there
"Oh shit"
"Come on, Twan, run!"
"Sylvester this is the way we go"
"No, we gotta get to the show"
"This way"
"Them motherfuckers better not make it a block"
"Or all you motherfuckers gon' get shot"

"Get them motherfuckers!"
"Wait, there they go!"
Twan, Sylvester, on the run, gotta get away from goons with guns tonight, yeah (Get away, get away)
Runnin', divin', bullets flyin', 

[?], Beano wants their lives, oh

[scatting]
I run, I dive, 

[?]
I run, I dive 

[?]
I run, I dive 

[?]
Oh!
"Hold up, wait right here"
"Man, why we gotta wait right here, when these motherfuckers chasin'-"
"Shh, shh"
"Sylvester when these motherfuckers chasin' us with all these guns"
"Twan, I know what I'm doin'"
("Come on out, punk-ass motherfuckers")
"Man, let's just keep runnin'"
"Nigga, no"
"Besides, we at the backstage door"
"Backstage door of what?"
"The backstage door of the show"
"You shittin' me"
"Let's go"
"Sylvester, you mother-"
"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Out of the Closet Show"
"Now give it up for your host, Larry"
I mean usher is this what it come to man
This is how we gon' do it
I mean I making grass grow baby, ya know
Seeds become plants
Boys become men
Want we gon' do
Wrapped around our girls like pashminas
Whats my demeanor
The grass is always greener on the other side
To think of I can't give her a ring up
I couldn't give a fuck
I could I give a finger
Let alone half baths and closets
So claustrophobic if there were close objects
Now its sort of like two door garages
Its like two broads minagin'
Your the best mama!
Is there any chance
That you remember me being any more than just a horrible man
And would you consider
Pullin' this trigger
And taking a second shot at romance
Oh Babe
I want the days when you were my girl
And I was your man
Know I took you for granted
But…

[Verse 1]
Oh, I sold my fortune, I gave up my claim
I traded sunshine for the pouring rain
I found wise men but I turned the other way
And some day I'll up and fly this gilded cage

[Chorus]
Well, they say only a fool would throw it all away
And some day I'll up and fly this gilded cage

[Verse 2]
Oh, everybody works just like a slave
All full the softest coffin that they made
But I say "why bother coming if you got to leave that way?"
And some day I'll up and fly this gilded cage

[Chorus]
Well, they say only a fool would throw it all away
And some day I'll up and fly this gilded cage

Oh, oh

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Well, they say only a fool would throw it all away
And some day I'll up and fly this gilded cage
Well, they say only a fool would throw it all away
And some day I'll up and fly this gilded cage
Some day I'll up and fly my gilded cage

[Intro]
Inside

[Verse 1]
I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

[Chorus]
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

[Post-Chorus]
Ni-ni-night I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
Guaranteed, I can blow your (mind) mind, mwah
Guaranteed, guaranteed, I can blow your (mind) mind
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah
(I can blow your mind) I can blow your mind
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah
(I can blow your mind) I can blow your mind

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're diggin' the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside

[Post-Chorus]
I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, (I can blow your mind), mwah
Guaranteed, guaranteed, I can blow your (mind) mind, mwah
Guaranteed, guaranteed, I can blow your (mind) mind
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, (I can blow your mind), mwah, mwah
(I can blow your mind) I can blow your mind, mwah
(I can blow your mind) I can blow your mind, mwah

[Chorus]
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

[Post-Chorus]
Tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(I can blow your mind)

[Intro]
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

[Verse 1]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

[Post-Chorus]
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

[Verse 2]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
("Who he think he is?") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (So crazy, your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Oh, your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Yeah)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Hey)
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love
I'm looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

[Post-Chorus]
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no (No)
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no (Oh, no)
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no (No, no)
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

[Bridge]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby, you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby, you got me, you got me
You got me so crazy, baby (Hey!)

[Chorus]
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Looking crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Baby, your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Yeah, babe)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Oh)
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Yeah)
Got me looking so crazy in love (Whoa)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
Afro (Afro) Afroman (Afroman)
Afro (Afro) Afroman (Afroman)
Afro (Afro) Afroman (Afroman)
Can I sell my dope? (Yes ya can)
Let me floss my flow, floss my ho
Run my own campaign like I'm Ross Perot
As the turntables spin easily
I reminisce on Easy-E

When I first started bangin
Jheri curl started hangin
9mm rangin
If you wasn't playin Cube, or Sir Too Short
The homeboys might grab you by your motherfuckin throat
And choke yo ass, choke yo ass
Drag you round the corner and try to smoke yo ass
But anyway
I'd like to thank all my cluckheads that contributed
My rap tape just got distributed

Can a get a quarter? (Quarter)
From all the Mexicans down on the border (Border)
I oughta get me a pound (Pound)
Even if its on the wrong side of town
Is you down?
Get a gallon a water (Water)
So I can smoke a loopstick with ya daughter (I oughta)
Get me a 40 (40)
Get drunk befo I get to the party (Oh lawdy lawdy)
I can't wait till I get my welfare check
So I put me a fat sack of yay on deck
Make a run for the border in my blue Caprice
And order me a quarter piece
Mafucka!
East side ruler known well cause I thump
Let my system bump
While I wait for the chump
They put the dope on the scale
This bomb ass yayo
I know it's gonna sell
Back in Palmdale

I ain't afraid, it's time to get paid
Pass me the baggies and a razor blade
Ladie, dadie, I chop the rocks just like karate
Punk ya better ask somebody
Stop bitching cause I'm able
Put the dope on the kitchen table
And watch me hook it up like cable
Wham! Bam! Baseheads like Goooooood damn!
Buy yo dope from me!

If you a loner or a stoner
My rocks way bigger than them low budget niggas round the corner
And they won't give you no love
If you don't buy a dime, dub, or above
So come to me when you need a fat nickle
And you can hit the pipe in my stolen vehicle
They don't want yo pennies? That's alright, I want em
I even take the pennies with the green spots on em

For the East Palmdaler being a dope seller is hard
I accept your credit and your Versateller card
AFDC, your food stamps too
I'm a baller but bitch I gotta eat like you
You think I'm smokin, but I ain't jokin
You can get a fat rock for a gang of bus tokens
How you doin baby? I need a soulmate
Your cuz told me you had Section 8

I know you ain't got no money in your pouch
Take a piece of this yay, and let me sleep on the couch
Bitch I'm for real, I'll go half on a bill
Your garage just right for my Coupe de Ville
Tell your badass kids, them hoodrat bitches
Don't be jumpin in my car and fuckin with my switches
Hip, hop, chop the rock
Let the beat stop, it's time to re-cop

We can go to Compton, we can go to Watts
We can go to Long Beach I know a gang of dope spots
I'm neutral, from the old school
I be buying dope from a different gang of fools
Buy my drip from my Crip, pound of bud from my Blood
Then I buy some yay, from my ese
On my way back to Palmdale
Got stopped by the sheriff but I'm calm as hell
They pulled out heat
Put me face down in the street
Handcuffed me, threw me in the back seat
They searched my car with a microscope
Stupid ass white boys couldn't find the dope
They took the handcuffs off but you know they still hate me
Racial remarks just to intimidate me
Write a ticket since I can't go to jail
Whatever they didn't find the yayo, uh!
I don't Blood, I just Crip
I don't tag I put the rocks in a Ziploc bag
I'm lookin too shady, me and JD
Hit you with the .380
So gimme gimme what you got
Hangin at the dope spot
Try to jack and get got
Fuck around and get shot (In the parking lot)
Be cool, fool, don't be uptight
Money first, dope second, everything's alright

I don't have the mentality of some fool in a gang
It's the principality of the whole thing
If you wanna get high, get high
But don't fuck around and die
Mafucka!
I just wanna sell a rock, I don't wanna pull the Glock
And lose the clientele on my block
Mad cause I shoulda been more selective
Hiding in the bushes from the homicide detective
Trigger finger itchin on me
All my homeboys snitchin on me
Everybody that's a friend of me lookin like the enemy
Now I need to change my identity
Afro mothafuckin m-a-n bucaaaaw!
Yeah! If you just bought this tape cuz you made the right choice mafuuucka
Everybody say, 'Yeah'
(Yeah, yeah!)
Say, yeah!
(Yeah!)
Say, yeah
(Yeah!)
Yeah?
(Yeah!)
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Stevie Wonder

[Intro]
Hi everybody, how you doin?
Yeah, very sexy
Um, my band left to Montreal, so I'm going to play alone
And I'm going to play some old songs and some new songs
Maybe you guys don't know either, doesn't matter to me

[Verse 1]
Mommy's in the kitchen, cooking up something good
And daddy's on the sofa, pride of the neighborhood
My brother's in the ballet, it seems he's got it set
And I'll be up at midnight with my cigarette

[Chorus]
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go

[Verse 2]
Daddy's in the basement, cooking up something fine
While Rick's out on the pavement, flipping it for dimes
If there's anything redeeming, I haven't seen it yet
And I'm still up at midnight, chewing nicorette

[Chorus]
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go

[Outro]
Thank you, that song is about my dad's methamphetamine habit
Okay-

[Intro]
This song is called, Annie

[Verse 1]
Oh Annie, knows when it's me
Knows how I'm feeling and gives me her healing
Oh Annie, sit down beside me
Let me confide in you, you know when I'm blue
You know when I'm lonely and, honey, I'm lonely

[Chorus]
I'm going down, going down, going down, going down

[Verse 2]
Annie, daddy won't let me
Daddy won't let me go and that's why I feel so low
Oh Annie, sit down beside me
Let me confide in you, you know when I'm blue
You know when I'm lonely and, honey, I'm lonely

[Chorus]
I'm going down, going down, going down, going down

[Outro]
Thank you

[Intro]
My girlfriend and I moved to New York by accident, this summer
And this song is about that, and how she's not allowed to live here

[Verse 1]
I was made to love her
Been working at it
Half of my life
I’ve been an addict

[Pre-Chorus]
And she’s been good to me
Far as I can tell she’s happy
Livin’ with her Macky

[Chorus]
So please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay
Please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay

[Verse 2]
And where would I be
Feeling lonely
Separated from my one and only

[Pre-Chorus]
And what’s there left to say
Far as I can tell that day
Could be on its way

[Chorus]
So please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay
Please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay

[Scat Singing]

[Outro]
Gotta switch it up

[Burps]

[Verse 1]
Only you, only you
Only you treat me like you do
And only she, only she
Only she shows me where I be
So sorry, blue, we're through

[Chorus]
Cause I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
My hands hurt
I think I'll go lay down
Since I'm done crying over her

[Verse 2]
Here I am, brand new day
Now there's you, let me show you, blue
That only she, only she
Only she shows me where I be
So sorry, blue, we're through

[Chorus]
Cause I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
My hands hurt
I think I'll go lay down

[Outro]
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down

Thank you, that song was called Sheryl Crow's pussy lips
I think that I'm only going to do you guys one more song tonight
And we've been in our set in this song for a long time
It's for sweet Keira, who's standing right over there
It's a tender number
If you've got anybody you love, out there, at the bar
Um, give em a kiss or a hug for me

[Intro]
Anybody have a drink I can borrow
Aqua, can I have a bit of your aqua?
Burps (crowd cheers)
Thank you
This song is called together

[Verse 1]
In time she'll see that her and me
Were meant to be, together
And time will pass, it may go fast
But we'll still be together
And where I go she's at my side, half of my life, together
It's easy love, fits like a glove from up above, together

[Chorus]
Together
Together

[Verse 2]
I've had my share, it's just not fair
That we should be together
But if it's fine, that I've done my time
Her and me are gonna walk the line together
And when she's low, I'll always know
We'll always gonna go together
It's easy love, fits like a glove from up above, together

[Chorus]
Together
Together
Together
Together

[Outro]
That's it guys, Mac Miller's up next
This has been Mac number one of the evening
God bless you, and see you later

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Just testing my new lil mic that I got
You know what I'm sayin?
Got this new mic from Guitar Center
So I'm just gonna bless it one time, put a little verses on it
You know what I'm sayin?
Uhh Ramadan Mubarak to everybody out there fasting, you know what I'm sayin?
This just a lil something, it's safe (feel me)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Sights and sounds write em down like football plays
Shang Tsung, gang ton, how I took ya'll ways
Far from rap, might as well write a book on stage
Carbon that, ID's cuz I look off age
Enemies, energies, tight shook off sage
Some of these symphonies, life took all days
Where the popos white as ghost clothes
It ain't good always where Jane Goodall stays
Coolest little black kid, livin' in the ghetto
Hmm, feelin' like livin' in Soweto
In the 80s, apartheid babies
Another dark side hope the hard drive saves me
Been diggin' in the archives lately
Reminiscing of a car ride, ain't he?
Collective plot, how I connect the dots
Like I'm making pepperoni pizza, for the seekers
Leap of faith, it's zabiha
It's okay, you can eat it with your mates
How Sway? You ain't got the answers
Like Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
(Waves, waves, waves...)

[Outro: Lupe Fiasco]
Ahh man, that's good right there, that's a good mic
Oh we gonna have a nice, nice lil' career together, me and you lil microphone
You know what I'm talking about? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Another story of girl meets boy, and gets destroyed
Another promise broken in two, the lucky view of fiction

[Pre-Chorus]
Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story of girl meets boy

[Drop]
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean waves, she's chokin'
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it

[Verse 2]
So picture perfect, it can't be real and all you feel is numb
You see them talking but hear no sound to hit the ground
And fade

[Chorus]
Another story
Another story of girl meets boy

[Drop]
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean waves, she's chokin'

[Intro]
Go for it

[Verse 1]
Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody, being honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporate
My whole body see-through
Transportation, handmade (G!)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some pussy, have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working through your worst night
If I get my money right, you know I won't need you
And I tell you (Biiitch!)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that, I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation, can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You were from my past life, hope you're doing well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first, signal coming in and out (Huh?)
Hope you're doing well, bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Oooh, nani nani (Ooh, nani, oh)
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body, ugh!

[Pre-Chorus]
New beginnings, ahh
New beginnings, wake up, akh
The sun's going down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep being late on me
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every night shit, everyday shit

[Chorus]
Dropping baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend-the-night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that nana, though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don’t want your conversation
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, every day shit
Every night shit
Night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit

[Verse 2]
Bubble goose down, blue punch
Pocari Sweat, ghost sweat
Her wet wet, her mouth wet, two things I don't regret
My dick long, memory long, two things she don't forget
Game drives so wet, my Black friends just wear black
But only fly in black jets, if it's roulette, black's best
Niggas ain't sold crack yet
Flyin' private, ain't wasting seats
Niggas lapped up in that bitch
Black bodies in the summer breeze
Runnin' four flats, tryna get in the lead
Tryna get in the league and play wide receiver
Nigga, pass the sticks, call winners winners
Up-seat, gotta walk it off
Winners hate to lose, gotta run they mouth
Sets thrown, now they lockin' up
We ain't break it up
Tryna see who face getting knotted up
That was Monday, we was back friends on Tuesday
Still talkin' 'bout it 'til this day
Need fifty hunnas, that's 5 racks
Hit Costco, keep the fam fat
Fuck a weed-man, grow your own plants
Tell the cashier give you five blacks and the purple packs
Some loud burnin' out on the grill
Black Adonis on the diving board
Gainers only, I'm bringing Guinness
Jordans floatin' on the deep end of the pool (Yes)
Somebody got thrown in again, y'all are fools
Phone drown on the concrete in the summer blaze
Blaze too, blaze too
And it better work when the morning breaks through

[Break]
Oh we gon' line it up? Nah, nah
I just... What?!

[Pre-Chorus]
New beginnings, ahh

[Inaudible talking]
New beginnings wake up, akh
The sun's going down
(I just got these shoes man)
Time to start your day, bruh
(Look at 'em... Look, they're fucked)
Can't keep being late on me
(Some more fuckin' shit)
Know you need the money if you gon' survive

[Inaudible talking]
The every night shit, every day shit

[Chorus]
Dropping baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend-the-night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that nana, though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don’t want your conversation
Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit, every night shit, everyday shit
Every night shit
Night shit, night shit, night shit

[Post-Chorus]
I'm buck now, I'm peaked out
I'm in the red like chyoon-chyoon-chyoon
On they heads like chyoon chyoon chyoon
Remember that, them hands yea
Them strokes, oh, don't watch that
We both know
You used to be my everyday, every night shit
I'm buck now, I'm peaked out
I'm in the red like chyoon-chyoon-chyoon
On they heads like chyoon-chyoon-chyoon
Remember that, them hands yea
Them strokes, oh, don't watch that
We both know
You used to be my everyday, every night shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You leaving with me
Girl, I know you got a man though
And you know I got a girl so
Let's get up of the club
Don't none of that matter tonight
You leaving with me
Valet grab the Benzo
Girl, please let your friends know
But don't none of that matter tonight

[Verse: T.I]
Girl, right, I know what the girls like
Heart right and big bank will change your life, that's it for life
Got a man, well he ain't tonight
And something tells me your man ain't laying it right
So here we go, take a shot of this to make sure your mind open
Smoke this, it's hard to focus and keep your eyes open
Infatuation a waste of my time and your emotion
You been with them suckers too long, time for a promotion
When there's a strong attraction, my huge advantages
What she don't do in the van, she'll do in the mansion
Just imagine, me and you and a moment of passion
Overlooking the city on a circular mattress
Know that ass too nice just to be used for dancing
Tell me how could something so sweet be so nasty
And baby,I don't mean no harm, I'm just asking
Got ya hands in my pants with my belt unfastened, so I guess that means

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You leaving with me
Girl, I know you got a man though
And you know I got a girl so

Purple rain, purple rain

I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
Frightened by the devil
Drawn to those who ain't afraid
Remember when you told me you're not that lost you said, baby
I had you girl

Part of you pours out of me
Come on, baby, let's go

[Chorus]
You are in my body like holy wine
So bitter, so sweet
I drink a case of you
Still be on my feet
Still be on my feet

[Verse 1]
I guess you know me well, I don't like winter
Seem to get a kick out of doing you cold
Oh, what the hell, you always surrender
What's this strange relationship that we hold on to?

[Chorus]
Honey, I just can't stand to see you happy
Oh baby

Huh

[Verse 2]
Bet you wish this was a movie
Then you could rewrite my every line
Oh baby, I'll take the blame, girl, but I want you to know

Baby I just can't stand to see you happy, yeah

Girl, let's lose it, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby, I swear

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Verse 2]
Let's start with them Luccheses
Baby, kick 'em to the floorboard
Them bobby pins holdin' your hair up
Girl, you don't need 'em no more
That dress hangin' off your shoulder as you move a little closer
Yeah, let's lose it tonight
Yeah girl

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doin' to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Bridge]
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby I swear
Um

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Outro]
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
This is the story 'bout the face on the cake,

It belongs to Buster Baxter.

Baby boy bunny, Buster Baxter was born eight years ago.

At first all he did was cry and eat and eat and eat and grow, eat and grow. That's all he did!

He met Arthur, they became friends. It was an historic day!

They always had lots of fun, they liked to read and play!

Hey! Then one day, Buster found out he was gonna go. Gonna go, bye-bye.

He went around the world a couple of times.

We'd thought he left the show.

Buster Baxter went away and left his friends.

He went traveling, this is what he found.
Buster ate his way from north pole to south.

He had soup in Sookatoppen

At some biscuits in Bombay and carrots in Khartoum

While he was eating, Arthur played checkers in his room, his room. That's what he did!

All the kids thought Buster would act strange. He'd be a man of the world!

But wasn't it a nice surprise to find he hadn't changed?!

Hey! That's the lesson Buster taught us in the end, when you go bye-bye.

Just 'cause you see the world a couple of times

You still can be good friends!

Buster Baxter went away then he came back

When he did, his friends are what he found.

Checkers
Arthur didn't wanna leave Buster out, of that he can be proud!

But when you're playing checkers,.......
Three's a crowd.

Next Day (Tree House)
1.
This is the next day, that's all I have to say, hey!

2.
Buster Baxter, went away and he came back.

He was starting to feel like things had changed.

Kresblamania
Kresblamania, it's insane-ia! How could Arthur catch Kresblamania?

Kresblamania, it's insane-ia. How could Buster not catch Kresblamania?

Snails (In the Cafeteria)
Life can be tough as nails,

When your friends think you're a guy,

Who likes to eat snails.

Square Dance
The kids forgot they learned a dance when Buster wasn't around,
But boy did Buster know it, he couldn't do-si-do.

He decided to get out before he knocked everybody down.

Change partners!

Promenade!

Quack like a duck!

Spoken: Look! He thinks he's too good for square dancing, too.

Supermarket/Backyard
Buster was feeling more left out, with every passing day.

Even when he found something cool....

Someone else had found it first, when he was away.

Buster's House
He's a sad, sad bunny, a sad, sad bunny.

TV isn't funny when you're a sad, sad bunny -- Yee-haw!

Spoken: Hey! That's not very sad music!

Somberly: He's a sad, sad bunny.. a sad, sad, sad, sad,............. bunny........

(Sighs)

Arthur's House, Conclusion
1.
Buster Baxter and his friends got a brand new start.

It was just like they never been apart.

2.
That's how it happened, you can see!

To Buster and the kids in Elwood City,

Now they know when, you're close friends,

You can always get back, together again.

Spoken: So how long has the singing guy been around?

What? I thought he came here with you.

Buster Baxter, went away and he came back.

Buster Baxter, (scat singing)

Spoken: That was weird!

Yeah. Mom! There's a singing moose in front of the house!

Buster Baxter...

[Intro]
Oooh, I fall apart
Mmh oh yeah, mmhmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
She told me that I'm not enough (yeah)
And she left me with a broken heart (yeah)
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault (yeah)
She cut too deep now she left me scarred (yeah)
Now there's too many thoughts goin' through my brain (yeah)
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Drop]

[Bridge]
Down to my core, oooh
Down to my core, oooh
Down to my core

[Post-Chorus]
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Verse 2]
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it, no, you said it
No, you said we'd be together, oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Verse]
That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe I wanna catch on fire
It’s buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn’t find

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Dreams of you and me are in the dirt
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Verse 1]
Wish I could, I could've said goodbye
I would've said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew, it would be the last time
I would've broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Ooouuu ooou oou
Oh

[Verse 2]
When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself
Lying in your arms
And I want to pretend that it's not true
Oh baby, that you're gone
'Cause my world keeps turning, and turning, and turning
And I'm not movin' on

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love

[Bridge]
I don't wanna know this feeling
Unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment, ooh
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Hoooo ouuu

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips
Don't want to give my heart away to another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
Oooo I'll never love again
Love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again

[Outro]
I won't I won't I swear I can't
I wish I could but I just won't
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again
Who oo oo oo oo
Hmmm

[Stevie Wonder]
I was sitting in my classroom the other day
Playing my harmonica in a mellow way
Some teachers seemed to have gathered 'round
Trying to figure out what I was putting down

I call it pretty music
But the old people call it the blues

[Harmonica solo]

They were looking at me sitting there all alone
Mumbling to each other in a real low tone
I couldn't figure out what they were saying
They couldn't understand what I was playing

I call it pretty music
But the old people call it the blues

[Instrumental break]
Well, I call it pretty music
But the old people call it the blues, oh yeah
I call it pretty music
But the old people call it the blues

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus 1]
Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
But don't worry about a thing, hey
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, oh

[Chorus 2]
Rise up this morning, smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds, by my doorstep
Singing sweet songs, of melodies pure and sure
Saying, "this is my message to you"

[Chorus 1]
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing, oh-oh
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, yeah yeah
But don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright", yeah

[Chorus 2]
Rise up this morning, smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds, by my doorstep, oh
Singing sweet songs, of melodies pure and sure
Saying, "This is my message to you"

[Chorus 1]
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing, oh
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, yeah yeah
But don't worry about a thing, oh
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright", yeah

[Outro]
Baby, don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, yeah
Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, yeah
Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, yeah

[Verse 1]
Laughing loud out with the crowd
Is just one way I try
To hide my blues
But in my room
When I'm alone I cry

[Verse 2]
I confess I do my best
To show them I'm the guy
I weigh a smile
But only while
When I'm alone I cry

[Verse 3]
Pretending I don't miss her
It's all, it's all that's left to do
Somehow I'm sure she'll come back no more
The rest is up to you dear
Smile my heart and play the part
Though deep inside we know
It's all a game but just the same
The truth must never show
On you I rely my heart you know why
When I'm alone I, I cry

[Intro: Nicki Minaj, Brinx Billions & Lil Wayne]
Full blown, run rich, Brinx
Yo, Mula, yo, yeah
Ayo

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I know what these niggas like, and it ain't my charm
I ain't stupid, this $250 on my arm
I like money more than dick, nigga, that's a fact
You think pussy's everything? Well, let's have a chat
A-a-ass out, pussy fat, point me to a rich nigga
Who gon' Rico, Ace me, pay in full my money, Mitch nigga?
I'ma help him fuck the check up, I'ma run the business
If your girl don't get it poppin', put me on your wishlist
Hitlist, now he sendin' gifts like if it's Christmas
He said, "Baby, everyday we ballin'," I say, "Swish, swish"
Got him callin' nonstop 'cause he don't wanna miss this
I said, "Don't panic, keep the faith, nigga, B.I.G.'s bitch"
(Real rich nigga sex)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you know your pussy worth a Benz truck (Rich sex)
Don't let homie fuck unless his bands up (Rich sex)
Go to DR, get that fat transfer (Rich sex)
It ain't such a thing as broke and handsome (Ri-Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Lil mama said she only fuckin' on a rich dick
I cum in her face and tell her, "Now you lookin' rich, bitch"
Her friend in the other room, can I get a witness?
We could have some rich sex, cannot have no rich kids
Facts, all my bitches have no limits
Fucked her in a helicopter, now she screamin', "Sky's the limit"
Fuck her in a drop top, now she screamin', "Sky's the limit"
Sent her back to who she with, now she screamin', "Why I'm with him?"
Damn, lil mama said she only suckin' on a rich dick
Make you put your money where your mouth at, that's some lipstick
Let's fuck on the money 'fore we count that, that's some rich shit
Pussy smell like money when I'm down there, that some Nic shit
(Real rich nigga sex)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you know your pussy worth a Benz truck (Rich sex)
Don't let homie fuck unless his bands up (Rich sex)
Go to DR, get that fat transfer (Rich sex)
It ain't such a thing as broke and handsome (Ri-Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj]
Rich who? Got bricks, too
The rich get richer, that's my ritual
Rich crew, link my bitch, too
Mack took the Wraith, me and Tune flew

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Brinx Billions]
I don't even know where we going these days, where we landing
Queen, where we going again?
To the moon, Alice, the goon palace
We don't get fly, we take flight, haha
Woo! Haha, ahh-haha, ahh!
You mad, doggie? You mad, doggie? Haha
(Next stop: New York)
Hahaha, rrrrr!

[Intro]
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Ow, this little girl
Got my head in a whirl
Got me so mixed up inside
Every time she struts by
She makes me feel like I'm almost grown
And this feeling I feel alone
Every time she holds my hands
I get a feeling I don't understand

[Chorus]
I get this feeling when she talks
I get the same old feeling when she walks
I'm in love
And it's really alright now
Now clap your hands

[Bridge]
My heart feels Lordy, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lordy
(Lordy, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lordy)
A-Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord-Lord, Lordy
(A-Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord-Lord, Lord, Lord-Lord)

[Instrumental Break]

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 2]
You may be young, you may be old
But when old love gets down
In your soul
It makes you wanna shout, ow
It makes you wanna clap your hands, yeah
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)

[Bridge]
My heart says Lordy, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lordy
(Lordy, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lordy)
A-Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord-Lord, Lordy
(Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord)

[Outro]
It's love this time (Time)
And a feeling down in my heart (Heart)
That's about to tear me apart (Apart)
Yeah, it's alright, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah
Oh (Lord), yeah (Lord), yeah (Lord)
Yeah (Lord)
Lord, Lord, this little girl (Little girl)
Yes, she got me where she wants me (Little girl)

Now, this little girl

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Murder, murder, uh

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
It don't get no realer
Sixteen with a body of your killer
Running round with a stick like Donatello
These niggas out here tryna' murder for that cheddar
I'm tryna tell you niggas came for that green paper
Homies killin' homies over

[Verse 1]
Little man you've had a busy life
Guess I've had my share of joy and stride
They gave me the rules
And I really tried
But somehow I'm not satisfied

[Verse 2]
So my way, this time it's gonna be
My way, this time it's got to be
Just what I feel just what I chose
Mine if I win, mine if I lose

[Verse 3]
But my way no more the shy little guy way
No more uncertainty
This time it's me without a doubt
I'm gonna see what I'm all about
And I'm gonna do it my way

[Bridge]
Stop the music
I wanna lead the band
Maybe I'll waste and fall on my face
But I wanna be in command

[Verse 4]
My way they'll be no compromise
My way I'm gonna fall or rise
I got the plan and I got the drive
I'll be a man whose glad he's alive
Glad to live my life my way

[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder & Clarence Paul]
I don't wanna love you, but I do
And I just can't help it
You bring me happiness, and then pain
Are these nights I spend
Crying over you really worth it
Really, really, really worth it
Or am I shedding tears in vain
(Tears in vain)

[Bridge: Stevie Wonder & Clarence Paul]
You know every guy has got to have
Someone he can depend on
Someone to trust in
And I depend on you day by day
It's always been that way

[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder & Clarence Paul]
When you kiss me
Tears of joy I shed
Makes me wonder
It really, really makes me wonder
Wonder am I shedding tears in vain
(Tears in vain)

[Outro: Stevie Wonder & Clarence Paul]
Makes me wonder am I
Wonder am I
Shedding tears in vain
(Tears in vain)

(She put her arms around me)
She puts her arms around me, and holds me tight
I’m talking about nobody but my baby

[Outro]
She makes me feel all right (nobody but my baby)
And I love her with all my might (nobody but my baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no (nobody but my baby)
Nobody…

[Verse 1]
Oh, girl, you're not my type
Oh, 'least it's how it used to be
Oh, never stayed the night
Oh, 'til you took one look at me

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
I don't go a mansion
I'm still in the same house as before
I meet a lot of girls now, uh
But not the kind I'm lookin' for

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Posner]
See I don't need a ten to impress all of my friends
Had myself enough of those
And it doesn't bother me if she doesn't cook or clean
I really just wanna know

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Do you wanna, get down
Get down, with me?
Do you wanna, get down
Get down, with me?

So we could, get to hmm, hmm

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Do you wanna, get down
Get down, with me?
Do you wanna, get down
Get down, with me?

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
I don't pop bottles

I copped a couple models
But I'm just lookin' for love

And I don't need a ten to impress all of my friends
Had myself enough of those

[Verse 1]
Ayo, as the world turns, the blunt burns
(Who you gettin' at, Nicki?)
Watch them cunts learn
Fashion icon, Audrey Hepburn
I move keys, but you hoes get one turn
Yeah, you get one turn, and one urn
I straighten all these bitches out with one perm
Who ever gassed 'em ain't none of my concern
But, see, the Lord showed me dreams to confirm
They done went to witch doctors to bury the Barbie
But I double back, kill bitches, bury the body
And that go for anybody, you'll be thoroughly sorry
I could wage war or I come in peace like Gandhi
All my powers back, now I'm scary to zombies
Bring the heat to her, sizzle, I ain't talking Kalonji
I done fasted and prayed, had to cleanse my body
Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body
I ain't givin', so don't ask, I don't lend my body
Gotta be king status to give men my body
(He gotta be king status to get in ya body?)
Fuck yeah, 'cause a Queen is what I embody, uh

[Chorus]
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah

[Verse 2]
Yo, you can't wear a Nicki wig and then be Nicki
That's like a fat nigga thinkin' he can be Biggie
One rough ride, now you DMX and Swizzy
One hot video, you Hype? Nah, you just giddy
You made one dope beat, now you Kanye?
You got a nigga named JAY, now you 'Yoncé?
You got about three stacks, now you André?
You put a part in your fade, yeah, you Nas, bae
You gotta have real skill, gotta work for that
If it's really your passion, would you give the world for that?
Unlike a lot of these hoes, whether wack or lit
At least I can say I wrote every rap I spit
Put my blood, sweat, and tears in perfectin' my craft
Still every team's number one pick in the draft
You could bring anybody, weatherman, pick a day
I’m Kobe, KD, Kyrie, pick a K

[Chorus]
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn

[Interlude]
I see ya, I see you
I see ya, I see you

[Outro]
To my surprise, I saw you in my eyes
The nights I cried, repented of the lies
To my, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
To my, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Oh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Ooh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Ooh, burn, baby (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

[Verse 1]
Don't turn nasty now
The dusts of hell
A pillar of my salt
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell

[Verse 2]
The glue won't hold
The thread unpulls
Uncurling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal

[Chorus 1]
Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
Once you've been 'round you've been around enough
Ooh
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I'm no idiot, I should look
Ooh

[Outro]
I'm no idiot, I should look
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove
And cut me off
And cut me off

[Refrain]
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
Tonight I'll set you free
I'll set you free

[Verse 2]
We will shrink and we'll be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want

[Refrain]
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I set you free

[Verse 1]
You got some nerve coming here
You got some nerve coming here
You stole it all, give it back
You stole it all, give it back

[Chorus]
Good morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
And took my memory

[Verse 2]
You know you should, but you don't
You know you should, but you don't

[Chorus]
Good morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
Took my melody

[Intro]
Don't hurt me, don't haunt me
Don't hurt me, don't haunt me
Don't hurt me

[Verse 1]
Gather up the lost and their souls (Don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
Gather up the pitiful (Don't hurt me, don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)

I think I have had my fill (Don't hurt me, don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
I think I should give up the ghost

Into your arms (Don't hurt me, don't haunt me)

[Outro]
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't haunt me)

[Verse 1]
Open your mouth wide
The universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
"So why does this still hurt?"
Don't blow your mind with whys

[Bridge]
Oooooh

[Verse 2]
I'm moving out of orbit (Turning in somersaults)
Turning in somersaults (A giant turtle's eyes)
A giant turtle's eyes (As jellyfish float by)
As jellyfish float by

[Outro]
It's what keeps me alive
Open your mouth wide
The universal sigh

I'm moving out of orbit
Turning in somersaults

And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive

A giant turtle's eyes

[Chorus]
It's like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
The sweetest flowered fruits were hanging from the trees
Falling off the giant bird that's been carrying me
It's like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream

[Verse 1]
Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
I've my heart
In my mouth

[Chorus]
Like I'm fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

[Verse 2]
And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water
Fallen off a giant bird that's been carrying me
(Did so much, did so much)

[Verse 3]
I fell open, I lay under
At the tip I lost your number
I wanna slip over
And get back under

[Bridge]
And if you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over (Wake me up)
Then you're wrong (Wake me up)
If you think this is over (Wake me up)
Then you're wrong (Wake me up)

They can say whatever, I'ma do whatever
No pain is forever, yup! You know this
Tougher than a lion, ain't gon' need to try it
I live where the sky ends, yup! You know this
Never lying, truth-teller
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades, blacked-out Maybach
I'ma rock this shit like fashion, as in going til they say stop
And my, runway never looked so clear, but the hottest bitch in heels right here
No fear, and while you're getting your cry on, I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal, I better let you know

[Chorus: Rihanna]

All up on it, know you want to clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely
Who think they test me now, run through your town, I shut it down
Brilliant, resilient, fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that, all on me like that
Yeah, I see you aiming at my pedestal, so I think I gotta let you know

[Chorus: Rihanna]
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard

[Verse 1]
The leaves were falling, I was seventeen
We'd been locking lips, grabbing hips, smoking cigarettes
We took a drive in your 1990 the hand me down
From out of town, I was California
Oh, my legs were not shaved
And you had dirt between your fingers
They told us to behave, but hey

[Chorus]
It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite
It's not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like taking a bath
It's not like having a laugh
It's not like reading a map
It's nothing like the first time

[Verse 2]
I had seen it in the magazines
We would change the channel on the TV screen
'Cause it's such a sin what ya did to me
Straight to hell is what they sell if you done the deed
Oh, but what could be so bad?
Oh, if everyone is guilty
I guess we want what we can't have
'Cause I've heard...

[Chorus]
It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite
It's not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like taking a bath
It's not like having a laugh
It's not like reading a map
It's nothing like the first time

[Chorus]
It's not a walk in the park
It's not a shot in the dark
It's not a juvenile crime
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like tying the knot
There's no connecting the dots
And in case you forgot
There's nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time

I be the ace when the cards shuffle
It go pity-pat-tonk {?)
Apes and gorillas Got from grape to vanilla
A lake or a river Play with a nigga
I make it a slumber party you can lay with your nigga
Mr. Tough Thug don't start with me
I am a painter and blood is an art to me
I piss on you guys you's a wart to me
And your girlfriend still report to me

[Verse 1]
I will not philosophize about the meaning of life
Let's take no time 'cause the teasing isn't right
Let's skip the foreplay
We know were gonna do it anyway
Cause all I'm selling is...

Sex, sex
On your radio, selling is
Sex, sex

When I wanted you, you would not reciprocate
When I needed you, you would always show up late
But things have changed, and I've got the upper hand
You can run and I've got you eating out of my hand

That's more like it
Make my dinner, bring it to me

When my birthday came, you would not remember it
When I got my period, you were inconsiderate
But tables turn, and it's great to be on top
Got you trained to appreciate the good that you've got

That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it

That's more like it, that's more like it

(Yeah, that's more like it)

There's a bottom to the top of a moment
You won't always be around
Catch a nigga coming quickly behind you
People want you underground
Do you misbehave?
Haunt you to your grave
I'm going to eat you alive
Please don't find me rude
But I don't eat fast food
So don't run too fast

I’m rattled life in pieces

Like Seattle nights and sleepless

I’m grieving, I’m speechless

I’m dying not faecitious

I was drinking, she was drinking

We was dancing wasn’t thinking

It’s not excuses

Look the truth is

I just cut loose is
Just what grey goose produced this?

I swear if we get through this

I’ll never ever do this again

Baby let me prove it

Please don’t throw me deuces

Look at me

Boo pleas look at me

My words keep coming out crookedly

But they can’t capture look and see

I’ll do anything

Abstinence

I’m passionate

I’ll be an activist
Against other assholes who act like this

But let’s not end cause of an accident

-Chorus-

Freak... Accident

I don’t know how I got into this

She was a freak... accident

I'ma be a half an hour, but I told him, "Gimme five"
I'm tryna dance on him, blow my advance on 'em
I like him better when he got some sweatpants on him
I like his hang time, he said his head right
I said go all the way down and then head right
I watch him fuck it up, look at him luckin' up

He go insane on it, I put my fame on it
Coulda put ZAYN on it, but I put your name on it

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I got a bed wit' your name on it

[Verse 1]
Old pirates, yes, they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly

[Chrous]
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

[Verse 2]
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds!
Have no fear for atomic energy
Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book

[Chrous]
So won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
These songs of freedom
Redemption songs
Songs of freedom

Ride on home to Samoa
Or wherever they come from
They're takin' our jobs
Eatin' our hamburgers
Takin' our jobs
They takin' our jobs!
I see them in the field
I'm takin' their head off
I hate my job

That the Cowboys win
Fuck yeah Romo!
And the Cowboys win
That's right, that's right, that's right

C'mon, everybody

If you love our country
If you love our land
That's right
And if you're not clapping your hands
You're a terrorist

The day Bin Laden comes to town

And I pray to the lord the Cowboys win
And beat the hell outta them damn Redskins

But you're still two mavericks in my book
Don't worry about it
And listen Palin

I don't have a 6 pack
But I got a beer bong in my pants
What do ya' say we go get shit faced
In a helicopter and kill a moose

You don't like it? We exploit you!
Pop a pill, get a boner!
Hell yeah

And ride him broke back
All the way to Wyoming
No homo, psych!
Hey I said no homo

Guys I'm kidding!
I like Romo
I don't "like" Romo
I said fuck terrorists
Not I wanna fuck a terrorist
You wouldn't, if you caught Bin Laden
You wouldn't give him one in the butt?
For America?
If you said "no homo" right after you did it?
It doesn't count if it's terrorists

Hey little Aberdeen

Hey hey!

And I live in America
Dad and I live in America

[Verse 1]
All the fear and the fire of the end of the world
Happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl
Happens great, happens sweet
Happily, I'm unfazed here, too

[Chorus]
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you

[Verse 2]
All the things yet to come are the things that have passed
Like the holding of hands, like the breaking of glass
Like the bonfire that burns, that all words in the fight fell to

[Chorus]
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby

[Verse 3]
And that day that we'll watch the death of the sun
That the cloud and the cold and those jeans you have on
And you'll gaze unafraid as they sob from the city roofs

[Chorus]
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby

[Bridge]
When the stench of the sea and the absence of green
Are the death of all things that are seen and unseen
Not an end, but the start of all things that are left to do

[Chorus]
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you

[Outro]
That's it
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Uh, uh huh
So what I keep ‘em rolled up
Saggin’ my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day I’m with you bitch smokin’ grade A
You know what? It’s like I’m seventeen again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I’m on the chase
Chevy, its gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keep slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Up front four blunts, like “Khalifa put the weed in a J”
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Uh, and now I don't even care
'Cause me and my team in here
There's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin'
And now ya knowin'
When I step right up
Get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are looking up
From the ground up
Pound up
It's Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up
And mount up
And do my thang
Now I'm chillin'
Fresh outta class feelin'
Like I'm on my own
And I could probably own a building
Got my own car
No job, no children
Had this science project
Me and Mac killed it
T-H-C
M-A-C
D-E-V
H-D-3
High as me
This is us
We gon' fuss
And we gon' fight
And we gon' roll
And live our life
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Verse 1]
Well, I'll be doggone if I wouldn't work all day (baby)
And I'll be doggone if I didn't bring you my pay (baby)
But if I ever caught you running around
Blowing my money all over this town

[Chorus]
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, hey! I'd be long gone
Then I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone, mmm-hmm
Now hey, hey, hey!

[Verse 2]
I'll be doggone if you ain't a pretty thing (baby)
And I'll be doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring (baby)
If we live to be a hundred years old
If you ever let that spring turn cold

[Chorus]
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, hey! I'd be long gone
Oh, I wouldn't be doggone
Baby, I'd be long gone, mmm-hmm

[Bridge]
Now did you hear me? Well, then what I say?
Oh, believe me
Well, every woman should try to be
Whatever haer man wants her to be
And I don't want much, all I want from you
Is for you to be true to me

[Verse 3]
I'd be doggone if love ain't a man's best friend (baby)
And I'll be doggone if you ain't the loving end (baby)
Though I know you make me feel like no baby could
If I ever found out that you're no good

[Chorus]
Then I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone
Well, I wouldn't de doggone
I'd be long gone
I wouldn't be doggone, I'd rather catch me a train
I'd be long gone
No baby, I wouldn't be doggone, I'd rather catch me a plane
I'd be long gone

[Chorus]
I’m LeBron James, I’m LeBron James

[Verse 1]
Balling on you fuck niggas, you fuck niggas (Don’t know you) I know you suck

I stay off in some new Louie danced in em
Goddamn I’m paid, rich gang
Stacks on deck (Stacks on deck), money game (Money game)
I’m in the hood with 'bout six chains (With 'bout six chains)
Riding with that 6 I’m hard in the paint
James, swaggin like I’m James
Ten gold chains, your bitch know my name, my name, my name
So much money off this plane
I’m in the trap, you know I’m sellin cane

[Chorus]
I’m LeBron James, I’m LeBron James

[Verse 2]
Ridin round the set, you know that I’m the king (King)
Iced out, got a brand new ring
You knowing what it be, niggas can’t see me
Stacks on deck bitch, I’m repping SOD
Bitch I’m coming with that heat, leave you 6 feet deep
What you know bout Dre, jerk that k off in your face
I’m riding through the hood, Lambo juicy case
It’s Soulja Boy for real, I flip that script I’m paid
Bitch call me James, you niggas lame
Coming through the hood, flat like Novocaine
Flexin on you lames, shitting on you lames
You fuck niggas broke, all my fucking niggas paid

[Chorus]
I’m LeBron James, I’m LeBron James

[?]

[?]
Play your heart like a violin
You pull the strings and you pull me in

[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

[Hook]
Jam
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t too much
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t, don't you
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam

[Verse 2]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brother don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you preach to me, don't scream and shout
She pray to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I've found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

[Hook]
Jam
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t too much
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t, don't you
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam

[Verse 3: Heavy D]
Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man cause Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, 3 and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan, first I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
Cause it aren’t too hard to

[Hook]
Jam
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t too much
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t, don't you
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam

[Verse 1: Jake]
Calico, you'll always chase a pedigree
A better half, so contrary
Why are you so jealous?
Why are you so jealous?

[Verse 2: Jake & Nathan]
Say you won't
Say you will attend to me
Space is all the light we need
Why are you so jealous?
Why are you so jealous?

[Chorus: Jake]
We ran like fools
To chase our blues down
It seemed reminiscent
Patience growing thin
I'll sing for you again in the morning
In the morning baby

[Bridge: Jake]
Passenger, I'm clinging to the driver's seat
But you've got all the fight we need
In your room, so selfish
In your room, so selfish
Ahh

[Chorus: Jake]
We laughed like fools
To chase our blues down
I thought it familiar
Patience growing thin
I'll sing for you again in the morning
In the morning baby

[Interlude: Jake]
I was always awake
(I was always awake)

[Outro: Jake]
I was always awake
Spry to your feels
Keen on the way we were
But I fell ill like our friends
Corrupted by youth
And those who wanted more
If we ever became
The things we lost
The things we left behind
I would wish for the past
When we were pure
Suffering intertwined
Oh, there's a lull in my life
It's just a void, an empty space
When you are not in my embrace

Oh, there's a lull in my life
The moment that you go away
There is no night, there is no day

The clock stops ticking
The world stops turning
Everything stops but the flame in my heart
That keeps burning, burning
Oh, oh, oh

There's a lull in my life
No matter how I may pretend
I know that you alone can mend
The ache in my heart
The call of your arms
The lull in my life
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do to you

You’re in love, your heart's a-flutter
And all day long you only stutter cause
Your poor tongue it will not utter the words
Ooh , what a little moonlight can do

Wait a while til that little moonbeam comes peepin' through
You’ll get bold
You can't resist him and
All you'll say
When you have kissed him is
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, what a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do to you

You’re in love, your heart's a-flutter
And all day long you only stutter cause
Your your tongue it will not utter the- words, uh
Ooh, what a little moonlight can do
Wait a while til that little moonbeam comes peepin' through
You’ll get bold
You can't resist him and
All you'll say
When you have kissed him is
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do to you
You’re in love, your heart's a-flutter
And all day long you only stutter cause
Your poor tongue it will not utter the words
I love you
Ooh, what a little moonlight can do

Wait a while til that little moonbeam comes peepin' through
You’ll get bold
You can't resist him and
All you'll say
When you have kissed him is
Ooh, what a little moonlight can do!
A fool did sing of sweet love
And everything that spring could bring
But what of days gone by?
And what of all the silence?
That feeling with no name
Deep dark blue
Blue
Blue
Love appears just like the fog
Sometimes I try to recall
The feeling that I could fall
All at once
I see
I’m alone
I’m free
Who knew that I’d miss the mist
The mist must have evanesced

But, oh
That distant calling
That yearning to yin
That longing to lean in
Someone to call my own
It's now returning
And how bizarre that it's for someone new
For someone who really seems to be the one someone to
Somehow remind me of you

Pitter patter, pitter patter
Rain on my window, my world was very small when I had you
What's the matter, what's the matter?
Tears on my pillow
Why would I be surprised?
He tells me pretty lies
I tried to find a man who's just like you
Heartaches like these
Are trite and true, he's just like you
He comes and goes
He never knows he's in midair
He doesn't care
What subterfuge what ruse
To hold him and keep him beseeching
But why try to catch a fog disappearing into sky?
Look at me
Why don't you look at me
The way you look at all the other girls you see
I'm your friend
I guess I'll always be, but I'm in love with you endlessly
All the time
All of the time I've lost trying to make you come to me at any cost
All I was, all that I'll ever be, is just a clown for you when you're blue
Blue as the nights I'd wish we'd spent together what a lovely time together blue
As that glimpse of light when I almost think you might just look at me

All I’ve done, all that I hope to do
Is spend my lonely life loving you

[Verse 1]
It happened not long ago, as crazy as it seems
A girl I didn't even know came to me in my dream
And although I don't know her name
I was so sorry when the morning came

[Chorus]
And I, I, I, I said I
'Cause I know by the way I feel, she's got to be real (fa-la-la-la)

[Verse 2]
Imagine the Mona Lisa mixed with a girl from a Playboy book
Imagine Venus with arms, and then you'll know how she looks
She's the prettiest little girl that I've ever seen
She comes to me always in my dream

[Chorus]
And I, oh I, said I, oh I
'Cause I know by the way I feel, she's got to be real (fa-la-la-la)

[Bridge]
I told the Sandman, 'help me if you can, man
Get me her address, and I'll do the rest'
'Cause only in my dreams do my arms enfold her
I'm sleeping on my job just so I can hold her

[Verse 3]
Everywhere I go, I'm searching here and there
And every girl I see, I just have to stop and stare
'Cause I need her love, both night and day
So I can stop sleeping, sleeping my life away

[Chorus]
And I, I said I, oh I, oh I
'Cause I know by the way I feel, she's got to be real
(she's got to be real)
Yeah, she's got to be real, yeah
'Cause I know (she's got to be real)
Yeah, by the way I feel...

[Verse 1]
Honey, you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain?

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Peculiar as can be

[Verse 2]
Oh, you tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you, baby, 'til I don't wanna see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you
Makes all your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger)

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity, hey, hey

[Bridge]
Ah-ah-ah (ah-ah-ah), hey hey (hey hey)
Ah-ah-ah (ah-ah-ah), hey hey (hey hey)
Ah-ah-ah (ah-ah-ah), ah-ah-ah (ah-ah-ah)
Woo...

[Verse 3]
I cried so much just like a child that's lost a toy
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears (tears, tears, tears)

[Chorus]
Now ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiar-arity
Ain't it peculiar, honey?
Peculiar as can be

[Outro]
Said I don't understand it, baby
It's so strange sometimes
Ain't it peculiar, darling?
Oh, baby

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Got up in the club, posted in the back
Feeling so good, looking so bad
Rocking this skirt, rocking this club
Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck
Rocking these diamonds, I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture, I'm rocking my fame

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

Six-inch walker, big shit talker
I never play the victim, I'd rather be a stalker
So baby take me in, I'll disobey the law
Make sure you frisk me good
Check my panties and my bra
Wild'n out, a crazy house
With my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

[Verse 1]
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
I thought you would go then come back home
I thought the cold would leave by summer
But my quiet nights will be spent alone

[Verse 2]
You said there would be warm love in springtime
That is when you started to be cold
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find myself all alone

[Verse 3]
You said then you'd be the life in autumn
Said you'd be the one to see the way
No I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find my love has gone away

Why didn't you stay?

[Verse 1]
Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

[Chorus]
Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior

[Verse 2]
Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself they belong to you
They're the start of a coming race
The earth is a bitch
We've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

[Chorus]
Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior

[Intro: Ninja]
I've seen it all (Sien alles)
Face carved out of stone, unreadable
Pretty wise and ugly on the skin
Lovely from within (Mooi, man)

[Chorus: Yo-Landi]
Baby I love you, and my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this material shit for you
If you're sad I cry for you, if I have to I'll die for you
Baby I love you, and my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this material shit for you
If you're sad I cry for you, if I have to I'll die for you

[Verse 1: Ninja]
I am the man, the myth, Ninja dominator (Salut, Ninja!)
Fuckboy come sneak this, bitch
Fuck you, I'm the danger (Pagamisa, ja!)
I do this thing called whatever the fuck I want (Duidelik!)
I'll show you that I can if you tell me that I can't
The fucking thunder pound, with the underground
Crack, dope, banana whippin'
One life, two wives, 'cause I fuck it up when I slam
We don't explain, we don't complain
Just stick to the fuckin' mission
Set the standard, take the lead, eliminate the competition
I seen it all (Sien alles!)
When you comin' up and all the motherfuckers wanna see you fall
I don't ever drop the ball, and I'm popping off
So fuck 'em all (Fokkol!)
I'm on a mission impossible, yo fuckin' unstoppable
Baby, let's rock and roll (Let's roll!)

[Chorus: Yo-Landi]
Baby I love you, and my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this material shit for you
If you're sad I cry for you, if I have to I'll die for you
Baby I love you, and my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this material shit for you
If you're sad I cry for you, if I have to I'll die for you

[Verse 2: Yo-Landi]
Motherfuckers feelin' my passion, others feelin' my pain
(Has you met me?! Huh?!)
Got a lotta real fucked up shit goin' on in my brain
I walk the ledge and I'm on the edge and I'm really tryna maintain
(Ja! Bite fist! Hosh!)
All I wanna do is bust out and go muddafokken insane
I crush it up and I roll it up and I spark it up and I bam
Yo pump it up, I been comin' up, 'cause I fuck it up when I slam
I'm all about that sick hit, I'm all about that rush
Yo an untouchable, try me bitch, and you're gonna get touched
I seen it all
Been through hell and back, but I beat 'em all (Jou ma se poes!)
I do this thing called whatever the fuck I want
I'll show you that I can if you tell me that I can't
(I'm in your face)

[Bridge: Ninja]
I'm a zef African American
Big guns, we carry them
Our baby mamas, we marry them
Fake motherfuckers, we bury them
I'm a zef African American
Big guns, we carry them
Our baby mamas, we marry them
Fake motherfuckers, we bury them

[Chorus: Yo-Landi]
Baby I love you, and my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this material shit for you
If you're sad I cry for you, if I have to I'll die for you
Baby I love you, and my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this material shit for you
If you're sad I cry for you, if I have to I'll die for you

[Outro]
Hi-Tek five-thousand
give without pride

be great without pride

your pride can be and will be used against you

I killed my ego

Who or what is Kanye West with no ego? Just Ye

this is new for me but it’s just how I feel now. I don’t know why. I thought my ego protected me from doubters so that I wouldn’t doubt myself but there has to be a better way to do this

sometimes I have trouble saying no because I want to help everyone

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I want you by my lonesome, above this crowded space
It's easier to hold some, when no one's in the way
Well if no one's in the running for the part
I'd love to pick a day
To show you the main room (Whenever's a good time)
I don't need a bouquet, I just need proper space
Homie three blocks away, I got bottles for days
I got tropical haze, go ahead and wave bye
Let me help with your coat, grab a hold of my arm
Tell them niggas to move, tell your sister you fine

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Cause baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
As crazy as it may seem, it's not too hard to read
It's too many ifs and maybes, and not enough certainty
Well if no one's putting numbers on the board
I'd love to take a swing, might even graze you
But I don't mean any harm, I'm just speaking my mind
Take a look at that moon, 'bout as bright as your eyes
We got plenty of space, go ahead and recline
Take a puff of that, get a sip of this wine
Yeah, feelin' good?

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Cause baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

[Verse 3: The Game]
She had a bright smile, big white teeth, I mean
Whiter than her white T, remind me of wifey
Met her at the studio, sort of like a high buyer
She told me she had game so we connected like the wifi
She had this Asian swagger ‘bout her, so I call her mai tai
Started followin' her, she was the only thing on my timeline
And there was this one picture, her in the swimsuit
That made a nigga want to beat it up, and I intend to
But I'ma have to put in work, baby girl then drink it all
Face like Mona Lisa, I'm just tryna be the wall to hang on
I ain't got no patience, I can't wait long
She come and see me, but she don't stay long
And that's the problem, she a good girl
Maybe it's too much smoke in the room
And she don't want that Mary Jane in her Vidal Sassoon
So I'mma take a minute, and walk her to her Uber
Got a bullet in my heart, and she the shooter
Ay, .Paak

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

[Verse 1]
Everything I say only seems to complicate it
Every little fight is just another night wasted
Are we gonna lose? Is this gonna last?
Worry about the future, worry about the past
Think we're gonna break before I get a chance to say this
Don't wanna live without you

[Chorus]
Staring in your eyes
Everything simplifies
Leave it all behind
Everything simplifies
All we need is nothing more
When everything simplifies
You and I need nothing more
Everything simplifies

[Verse 2]
Stressing over this, stressing over that, we're falling
Like the whole world is banging on the door calling
Are we gonna lose? Is it gonna last?
Worry about the future, worry about the past
Filter out the noise, focus on my voice and fall in

[Chorus]
Staring in your eyes
Everything simplifies
Leave it all behind
Everything simplifies
All we need is nothing more
When everything simplifies
You and I need nothing more
Everything simplifies

[Bridge]
Why must we complicate
Every breath we take?
Why can't you see we'll be alright?

Nothing disappears
Even the pain we've been through
But all I need is here
Don't wanna live without you

[Chorus]
All we need is nothing more
When everything simplifies
You and I need nothing more
Everything simplifies

[Intro: Pitbull]
They're dying to kill
And living to die
Snub nose, headshots
If you touch anything that's mine
Respect, Loyalty
Dan la vida para la familia
They live for the honor
They'll kill for the honor
They'll die for the honor
Wise guys take life from the box
Look judge in the eyes
Put they hand on the bible
And lie to you, only to leave something to the coroner

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
From the law, from the feds
Fuck cops, pop pop
Catch you at your favorite spot
Well dressed little men but dangerous
Go-getters, hustlers, gangsters
Everything organized
And if they hit us its a prize
One to the heart and two to the brain
Looks like he lost his mind, let's ride
There's rules and codes
You don't break them for no one
Unless you're a fool like that fucking prick
Sammy the Bull

[Hook: Leona Lewis]
Amore, mio, Amore
I've waited for you
To save me tonight
But you left me dying
Slowly Inside
Amore, Amore, mio, Amore
I've waited for you
To bring me to life
But you left me dying
Dying inside

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Three piece suit with a piece by the waistline
Just in case a motherfucker wanna take mine
Imma get mine, get theirs, get yours
Cock back, click-clack, gimme that fat line
Mob royalty, walk out that court not guilty, filthy
But yet so fresh, so clean
So gentleman, so mean
So loved, so hated
Yeah I killed, yeah I extorted, yeah I robbed
But I'm the God of the mob, fuck it I made it
From nothing to something, scum to thugs
Thug to gangster, gangster to mobs
To no pot to piss in the pasta and lobster
Bitch I'm a rockstar
The king from Queens
That killed and died for his dreams
The rotten apple from the Big Apple
The realest gangster you've ever seen
John Gotti (Teflon Don!)
The rotten apple from the Big Apple
The realest gangster you've ever seen
John Gotti (Woo!)

[Hook: Leona Lewis]
Amore, mio, Amore
I've been waiting for you
To bring me to life
You left my dying
Dying Inside
Amore, Amore, mio, Amore
I've been waiting for you
To bring me to life
You left my dying
Slowly Inside

If you heed the call
And you go outside, and wander off
Then home is there
Wherever you will make it
You can always say, "Who's laughing now?"

[Verse 2]

If you need a friend
Come right over
Don't even knock
And I'll be home
The door is always open
And we both can say, "Who's laughing now?"

And we both can say, "Who's laughing now?"

Somebody's got a stinky booty
Her name is Luna and she made a poopy

Somebody's got a stinky booty
His name is Arlo, dad's on diaper duty

Somebody's got a stinky booty
And daddy's gonna clean it up

From a lotus flower
Somewhere in the South Pacific
Corner of my studio

From up in the clouds, the enemy of your seed
Performs a righteous deed

It looks a little gray to the atmosphere
That's been corrupted by the impure
Cleansing all the airways

Don't fret
It's done at this point
Over
All right

What?

How are the plants?
And the lotus flower
Somewhere in the South Pacific
Corner of my studio

Watch yourself up in the realm
Watch yourself up in the front
You didn't come up with nothing
These are fuckin' liars
Holes in your pocket, and
Now you're a department store buyer
Put some more leaves on the fire
You're not the wheat you're just the chaff
Your whole operation makes me laugh
No Class
You never had money now your whole Op's about cash
Come on find a new topic
You got kids in the street listening to this SHIT
You going to kill them just to make a profit
You're real short term
You don't see the big picture
Just look at the news
I don't need to quote scripture
At you, but I can do that to
Bad boys what you going to do when the come for you
I don't mean the Coppers (Cops)
I mean the Tormentors
A little ackward
They going to pop you in a padded lock
You know you had it coming

[Chorus]
Where you gonna go now? What you gonna do now? Where you gonna go now? What you gonna do now? Where you gonna go now?
Getting money (x8)

They report him on the news they would say it's a blackberry
Kush mixed with purple
Don't you smell the odor
Fuck with me and get your head popped like a soda

In high school I was a senior but I had to stay fresh man
They doubted me in person now they feeling like dummies
But I never gave a fuck 'cause I was always getting money (ooh)
Jbar:

Getting money on the east side (gettin' money), on the west side (gettin' money), on the south side (gettin' money), on the north side (gettin' money) (x2)

Your chain looking faded like some mutha fucking copper
He's dry snitching talking to the damn coppers
Have his ass scared leaking red like a lobster
2 million dollars cash in front of me like I'm a mobster
Their comments keep me entertained so shout out to the bloggers
Soulja, spit that hot shit like Ether
He don't like me I don't like his ass either
When the beef is on, we will pull a all nighter
Send his head shot like I ma damn sniper
My nigga can't follow bitch I can go further
Rest in peace to this track cause this shit had been murdered

Jbar:
You get money damn right I get money yah (x4)
Getting money on the east side (gettin' money), on the west side (gettin' money), on the south side (gettin' money), on the north side (gettin' money) (x2)

Scab ass niggas fucking up all the deals
I got niggas tryna slander me, I knew from the start
But I can't do it back to them, it ain't no hate in my heart

And I feel so free, the cheetah print in my hair (woo!)
Rainbow on the belt, gang shit yeah yeah
I hopped out that bitch, had to make some room for my furs

Tell the engineer to turn me all the way up on the faders
Because everything I'm dropping hot as fuck like clumsy waiters

I'm a real live wire
But I don't play games
If they waste my time
I'ma cut them out the frame
When it comes to you
It's like you hold the key
You get the strongest girl acting like she's weak

[Pre-Chorus]
Come through when you're lonely
Always throw stones out on my street
I know you only want my skin
But still I let you in
You should come through in the daylight
Let me show you how to do right
Promise I'll give you everything
But you've got to let me in

[Chorus]
Hit me with your heartbeat
Hit me with your heartbeat
Come on baby put it on me
Gotta give me all or nothing
Hit me with your heartbeat
Hit me with your heartbeat
If you wanna get my something
Gotta give me all or nothing

[Verse 2]
Making up your mind
It should be easy
Feel you by my side
Then you feel so far away
I just want your love
I would treat you royal
Let me play your queen
And you play king today

[Pre-Chorus]
Come through when you're lonely
I was so stoned out on my street
I know you only want my skin
But still I let you in
You should come through in the daylight
Let me show you how to do right
Promise I'll give you everything
But you've got to let me in

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east

[Verse 2]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Oil wasted on the ocean and upon our seas
Fish full of mercury

[Verse 3]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Radiation under ground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby are dying

[Verse 4]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land
How much more abuse from man can she stand?

[Sample from the movie "Ms .45"]:
"Every day, on every street...in every city...women are insulted. Abused. Bred."

[Samples from "Mama Said Knock You Out" by LL Cool J, A.W.O.L. by RBX]

I can rock a beat
Plus rock around
But I think it's time to show my full range
Pull out the Glock
Hit him at close range
Knock their socks off, and call me fucking close-change
'Cause I'm sick of these cat-calls
I got a gat-ful
It's not a metaphor if it's actual
One on my ankle, one on my belt
And I like 'em so much I'ma shoot myself
'Cause mace is great, a knife is fine
But I like the peace of mind that I get with my nine
M80, the queen of thieves
Not talking bamboo when she shoots some leaves
And this is going out to every skeeve
On every street that made me ill at ease
They want sex, but I've got what they need
Cock back, aim it at their jockstrap and squeeze
(Make it pop)
Make it pop
(Make it pop)

One night I was all alone just walking
Minding my own, but then this dude kept stalking
And every girl knows just what I'm talking
I could call the cops but I've got another option
I said, "I bet you're in the mood for love,"
"Let's go around the corner and have some fun."
He just grinned and he grabbed his prick
And said "What's up, bitch, now suck my dick."
But I said "not yet" 'cause I practice safe sex
Not talking 'bout pills, not talkin' latex
I got this method that's totally effective
My weapon, a nine-millimeter Smith & Wesson
And this is my idea of dome
Shove it in his mouth, make him taste the chrome
Baby, baby keep going
'Til you hit the spot
And make it pop

(Make it pop)
Make it pop
(Make it pop)

[Sample from the movie "A Gun for Jennifer"]:
"We hear that was quite a shot you made. You're a regular Dirty Harry. How'd you get to be so good with a gun?"
"Well I've been around guns my whole life. My daddy was a Green Beret. Good old Dad. Wanted to make sure I learned how to shoot properly. Even if I was just a girl."

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Spanish lullaby
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
La Isla Bonita
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Spanish lullaby
¿Cómo puede ser verdad?

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, te amo
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

[Bridge]
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

[Outro]
La-la-la-la-la-la (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Te dijo, te amo (La Isla Bonita)
La-la-la-la-la-la (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Él dijo que te ama (Spanish lullaby)
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
La Isla Bonita
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Spanish lullaby
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Pa-pa-pa

[Intro]
Think We Found A LoopHole

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Please don't cut me off, know you got the sauce
You've been fuckin' with me so long that it's rubbin' off
Please don't cut me off, know I did you wrong
You've been fuckin' with me so long that it's rubbin' off

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Baby, I'ma pull up on ya late night, you know I'm crazy
Pull up in that brand new thang, you know it's Swayze
Say it's something cliche, fuck you, pay me
Playin' with that, I'ma fuck you crazy
Don't you cut me off, just love it off
Fuck you on and off, hit the gym and run it off
He so clean, shawty wanna suck me off
Ooh, we done done it all
We done done it all

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Please don't cut me off, know you got the sauce
You've been fuckin' with me so long that it's rubbin' off
Please don't cut me off, know I did you wrong
You've been fuckin' with me so long that it's rubbin' off

[Verse 2: NAV]
She say I do too much drugs, got too much tings
Cut the bitch off and cut the lean
Kick the bitch out, tryna keep my rings
Switchin' my line, my phone don't ring
Bad bitches wanna be my ting
Drop-drop top, give the top to the king
Post straight drop while poppin' with the bean
Racks so big, can't fit in my jeans
Turn into the boss I want to be
Bitch, you ain't heard? Don't play with me
One phone call, three casualties
I spend 20 racks casually
There's nobody I'd rather be
I don't wanna hear compares 'bout me
There's a couple girls I'd rather see
Better cut me off while you count on me

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Please don't cut me off, know you got the sauce
You've been fuckin' with me so long that it's rubbin' off
Please don't cut me off, know I did you wrong
You've been fuckin' with me so long that it's rubbin' off

[Samples from "Better Dayz" by 2Pac, "Watch Roger Do His Thing" by Main Source]

You know the place
Echo Park Lake
Back, way back, we used to hang in '08
And I would watch as you watched as I played guitar
Blowing smoke rings out the window of your car
Wishing on a star
Kissing on a mattress and wearing your jacket
Sleeves falling past my hand
Just a few beautiful kids with no plan

And those were the reasons
And that was LA
We may have been stupid
But we were never untrue
And I just thought you were cool

And as the summer turns to fall
I won't even care that it all went wrong
I'll recall drinking wine from your backpack
And holding your hand in the back of a taxi
And the question you asked me
When summer fades and we go back to school
But I just let the answer flow
Kind of like the "O"s of smoke that you taught me to blow
'Cause it's you who taught me silence is sexy
And it's you who said it's kind to be cruel
Wherever you are, I hope that you knew
That I just thought you were cool

[Sample from "Un Petit Baiser" by Gillian Hills]:
(Da la la la la)
(Un petit baiser pour moi)
(Da la la la la)
(Un petit baiser pour moi)
(Da la la la la)
(Un gentil baiser pour nous)

(Da la la la la)
(Un baiser pour ton amour) 

[x4]

It ain't fun
Unless it hurts some
But y'all couldn't pull a trigger on a squirt-gun
Black eyes and loose teeth
Killing all your sons like Lou Reed
I'm vicious
Hit you with a flower
Smash your grill with a daffodil
And every motherfucker that be actin' ill
Use a sledgehammer just to smash a pill
I chop lines with a hatchet
It's why they call me "Acid"
But keep my name off your tongue
'Cause I've been known to go off in a rage
And do it in cold blood
Like Capote
Hand me the pipe so I can smoke peyote
'Til I start seeing blue coyotes
Until I come up with a new emoji
The slit throat
'Cause life's a sick joke
That's why I smoke cigs and sniff coke
I saw you at the disco
You tried to grab the microphone but your wrist broke
That's my two cents
Don't you give up on your rhymes for Lent
Before I grab a wrench
And hit you upside the head 'til you speak French

(Da la la la la)
(Un baiser pour ton amour)

[Sample from "Qui Sème le Vent Récolte le Tempo" by MC Solaar]

[Sample from "Penny and the Pennies" by Blossom Toes]
(Saturday, Sunday, for miles around)
(Saturday, Sunday, not much sound)

Maddie the villain, I keep it surreal
Twist my mustache make it bend like steel
Get the fuck back 'cause I pack the steel
Seems fake but it's real, like electric eels
So what the heck's the deal with these fake-ass foes
Keep acid on my tongue, make it decompose
You see my clothes, I'm draped in paisley
I sniff the rose, y'all push the daisies
And when I blow smoke y'all know what it's laced with
You fools want a tool, take fifty paces
If you think I'm cool, that's cool but face it
You couldn't be me even if we switched places
Shit talk sounds inaudible, the way that I lick shots
I call my fucking pistols my popsicles
M80, I aim to please
They try to aim at me, but only in the land of make-believe
(Living in a chocolate ice cream land)
(Living in a chocolate ice cream land)
(Living in a chocolate ice cream land)
(Down, down the road)

Love goes where Madison goes
I'm at the shows, I don't rap, I just float and glow
They ask how she does it, but no one knows
Like when the wine-glass shatters and there's no one's home
I got a crystal pistol with amber trim
Wrap it in my fist, bullets that can cut through rims
The velvet grip, the ruby scope
I'm not talking 'bout drugs when I shoot the dope
I'm not talking 'bout drugs when I drop the acid
Rappers act hard but they melt like plastic
They talk sheets like a bunch of fabric
And when there's no beats, they just rock the static
They freak at black magic
The laugh the track and tip a line to stop the fragments
But that was just a dream
They try to fuck with me, but only in the land of make-believe

(Living in a chocolate ice cream land)
(Living in a chocolate ice cream land)
(Living in a chocolate ice cream land)
(Down, down the road)

[Samples from "Beat-Bop" by K-Rob vs. Rammellzee, "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" by DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]

[Verse 1]
You said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "that's a lie"
Just a boy in a pickup truck
That had a funny way of getting stuck
On backroads at night

[Pre-Chorus]
I was right there beside you all summer long
Then in time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
The one you said you liked best
Next to my old faded pair of jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
Thanking God that you weren't here
To see me like that
In a box beneath my bed
Sits a letter that you never read
From three summers back

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard not to find it all bittersweet
But looking back on all of that it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
The one you said you liked best
Next to my old faded pair of jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think me

[Bridge]
Been back a couple times since then
And I didn't look you up
But some trains you can't catch again
You gotta leave it as it was

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
The one you said you liked best
Next to my old faded pair of jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
When you think Tim McGraw
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think me

[Outro]
You said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "that's a lie"
Acid, my name and reputation
Just a foot soldier in the fated nation
Dealin' dope to these no-hope kids
And living life like a paid vacation
I don't advertise, I just patch addictions
They all wanna rock like Twisted Sister
But no prescriptions, I got what they need
From the top CEO to the lowliest fiend
I make a lot of money off of so-called junk
And they don't give a fuck if it's too much cut
Nah man they would crawl through the mud
Just to get a little taste, coughin' up blood
In the land of the waves, weak kids waste
Dragons get chased
You know what they say
You take one for the pain, two for the sorrow
Take three more if you don't wanna see tomorrow

[Sample from "MC Hustler" by Prince Paul, "Push It" by Salt-N-Pepa, "Love's Gonna Get'cha (Material Love)" by Boogie Down Productions]

From grass to ash, dust gets puffed
And these fiends get killed by the things they love
But I don't got time to get too philosophic
I don't make friends, I make a profit
Still got a brand that's on my pocket
The Feds can't stop it
When the block gets hot, I retreat to my yacht
It's hard to eat with these fucked-up streets
That's why you do what you can to make these dead ends meet
I've seen rich girls cop X pills on their dad's credit
I've seen priests get high and go to heaven
Cops pop molly, grannies smoke crack
They got one thing in common: they always come back
I just back up the alley, pull up on the canvas
In a black Caddy 'til they kick the habit
I've got 'em hooked and I don't care if they kick it
I invested drug money in that rehab clinic, bitch

[Sample from a 1950s anti-marijuana commercial]:
"Lookie here."
"What's that?"
"It's heroin."
"Will it make me sick like the reefers did?"
"Well go on and try it. I dare ya."
"How much does it cost?"
"This one ain't gonna cost you nothin', it's free. Go on. I dare ya."

Tabs, dabs, big bricks of hash
Big chunks of wax, big shards of glass
Coke with no crash, too bad it don't last
Flip the mattress, see my stacks of cash
Say "one more hit then you'll quit it"
Bitch, who ya kidding, pick up the phone, come and get it
Catnip, jenkem, whatever you desire
If I say I didn't have it then I'm probably a liar
But I can take you higher
Higher than a bird on a wire
Hair on fire like Richard Pryor
Peace to sand, giving some smokin' a little bit of ritalin
Have you feelin' like an upstanding citizen
Candy is dandy, but crystal's king
Got that shit that'll make you sing
Got that shit that'll flick your bean
'Til your skin turns green
And your hair falls out like you're Mr. Clean
Got tar so black it absorbs the light
Got lines so white they distort your sight
Got leaves so green that they're almost blue
Plus I pack a MAC-10, and my aim is true
Got these psychedelic pills, the best of all
One makes you large and one makes you small
One makes you crazy, one makes you sane
And I don't care which you get, I get paid the same
"It was just a business matter to Duke, though Marty didn't find it out until later."
"But that stuff costs too much to waste it."
"That's right, kid. You oughta go on the needle."
"That oughta hold me for a while. I hocked my camera to get this stuff."

[Sample from "Pocket Full of Posies" by Ó]
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)

Hey boy, has it really been so long?
Just wanted to talk and ask how you're doing
Not what went wrong, or who you're screwing
Just to kick it for a second kinda like we used to
Don't know about you but I think it's kinda strange
How we would stay inside and just hang for days
And everything else would just fade away
How we'd our change our names and move to Spain
Yeah, if we only had the guts
Instead we just laughed and smoked and stuff
And after all we did, and all we said
Now we have to act like we're almost friends
And like you're not a part of me
So pardon me if I kept watering the flowers that you left behind
When you left and you left me only
A pocketful of posies
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)
Pocketful of posies
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)
Pocketful of posies
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)
Pocketful of posies
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)

And whoever said there's one true love
Then I guess that I'll always love you
But people just up and leave
And love grows cold like a cup of tea
But it still takes good on ice
So don't think twice, it's all right like the singer once said
The one you used to play while we laid in bed
And now I just stand and I'm playing pretend
But who's gonna drive you home
Who's gonna write you poems
Who's gonna crack the jokes
Who's gonna make you laugh
With these silly-ass rhymes that you thought were dumb
And I was having fun just for a minute
Making love because we were in it
Making up another ending
I said it, I meant it
I guess it's only
A pocketful of posies
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)
Pocketful of posies
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)
Pocketful of posies
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)
Pocketful of posies
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)

[Sample from "Steady Fucking" by MC Lyte]
(Ring around the rosie, pocketful of posie)

[Verse 1]
I had a dream it was on my ceiling
I had a feeling it was in my head
If I walk outside every time it's freezing
I have to wonder if it wants me dead again

[Chorus]
And it's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over

[Verse 2]
I'm not afraid to walk without a way
If I close my eyes I'm scared I'll never get to leave the grey
I wanna sleep and never leave my bed
And then I won't hesitate to call it my friend again

[Chorus]
And it's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over

[Outro]
Oh, never sleep again
Oh, never sleep again

[Verse 1]
I thought I was dreaming
’Til the light came through the door
It was more than just a dream
I believed I was drowning
So what’d you wake me up for?

[Verse 2]
I don’t see anyone
Standing in front of me
There’s a voice in my ear
Sees what they’re not supposed to see
I thought I knew better
Feeling like so much more
Now that I feel so much better
I know that I don’t feel any different

[Verse 3]
I’ve been anxiously staring at walls for days now
Just waiting on a reply
Oh god will you tell me that I’m not just screaming into silence
So I can know when I’ve tried

[Verse 4]
I don’t see anyone
Standing in front of me
There’s a voice in my ear
Says that I’m not all I’m supposed to be

[Verse 5]
And all the silence
Cause I’m the only one asleep
It’s all dying down
And I know cause I don’t feel any different

[Verse 1]
Oh, sweet voice
Where have you gone now?
I know if it were your choice
I would be beside you

[Chorus 1]
I am alone in this room
There is no you
I am alone in this room

[Verse 2]
Do you feel trapped in being your own shadow
I don’t see it like that but what would I know

[Chorus 2]
I am alone in this room
There is no you
I am alone in this room
There is no you

[Verse 3]
Ghost in my wall
Do you see you wither to no one at all
Guide me to nothing
To places where there is no one
The world will lead your body
To create the ground that binds you
So you’ll fall above your shoulders
And now I can’t even remind you

[Chorus 2]
I am alone in this room
There is no you
I am alone in this room
There is no you

[Verse 4]
Headfirst now
Go on turn around
Leave it to yourself
No one’s gonna help you now

[Verse 5]
Headfirst now
Leave it to yourself
No one’s around
No one’s gonna help you now

[Verse 1]
Quiet hours
Nothing now
Always an absence
Drowned out
What if instead
No one hears what’s unsaid
No one can take away
Only the blue lights
Nothing but green sky
Glow of the bug light
How they always fly
To fluorescent heights

[Verse 2]
I can’t see me in my own my eyes
Only boxes to run and hide
Five AM and I know it now
I need to find a way out
No one can take away
Only the blue lights
Nothing but green sky
I lose myself every night
To fluorescent heights
I want to be alright
Fluorescent heights

[Intro:]
Wake up, motherfuckers!
And smell the Cuban coffee
Una coladita, ha, ha, ha
You ain't gotta worry about MIAMI being represented no more
'Cause it gets represented thoroughly throughout the world
By who? By yours truly
Mr. From nothing something, Let's ride

[Verse:]
I'm here now, alive in the flesh
Burning shit down like David Koresh
Except Imma walk out and wave bye to the press
Yes, you heard me correct
Pit's like the I-R-S, I'm here to collect
On taxes that bitch life owes me
Now it's time to pay back
It's either that or run in some cribs
Strapped with the K
Asking, where them K's at
I flow special, like that K
All my smokers, light that J
If you think you're that hot, hell's right this way
I see you took the first step
You already pressed play, and
That there impressed me
And I'm truly flattered, I'm truly thankful
Money I'm not worried about
Cause Imma have a bank full
I'm not trying to brag, I'm not trying to floss
But it's hard to find yourself living
In the land of the laws
A lot of these cats would sell their souls to the devil
No matter the cost, for a piece of success
Not knowing the consequences, and the constant tentions
I'm a monster playing, monster's ball
When I'm telling y'all, I'm on, ready for it all (RRR-all)

[Outro:]
So sorry, I'm so sorry and
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry and
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry and
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry and
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry and
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry and
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry

[Verse 1]
Takin' it back to when we were gone
I was so young and dumb
We were livin' so loud, yeah
Breathin' it in, the smoke from the gun
I was so young and dumb
Can't stop thinking about how

[Pre-Chorus]
We were such a pretty little picture 'til it went wrong
It went wrong
Old photographs are burning but the memories will live on
They live on, we'll never be the same

[Chorus]
I stopped counting at a thousand times
All the lies to my face
All of the summer nights
You would leave, I would say (Uh-huh)
I love you, I love you, I love you
I hate you, I hate you, ah, yeah (Uh-huh)
I love you, I love you, I love you
Goodbye, a thousand times
I stopped counting at a thousand times
All the lies to my face
All of the summer nights
You would leave, I would say (Uh-huh)
I love you, I love you, I love you
I hate you, I hate you, ah, yeah (Uh-huh)
I love you, I love you, I love you
Goodbye, a thousand times

[Post-Chorus]
Times, times, times
Times, times, times

[Verse 2]
Sat on the bridge, gettin' so drunk
Mixin' that coke and rum
Fingertips on the edge, yeah
We never knew who we would become
Feeling so low and numb
Still, I'll never regret how

[Pre-Chorus]
We were such a pretty little picture 'til it went wrong
It went wrong
Old photographs are burning but the memories will live on
They'll live on, we'll never be the same

[Chorus]
I stopped counting at a thousand times
All the lies to my face
All of the summer nights
You would leave, I would say (Uh-huh)
I love you, I love you, I love you
I hate you, I hate you, ah, yeah (Uh-huh)
I love you, I love you, I love you
Goodbye, a thousand times
I stopped counting at a thousand times
All the lies to my face
All of the summer nights
You would leave, I would say (Uh-huh)
I love you, I love you, I love you
I hate you, I hate you, ah, yeah (Uh-huh)
I love you, I love you, I love you
Goodbye, a thousand times

[Post-Chorus]
Times, times, times
Times, times, times

[Bridge]
Yeah, we on some high school shit
It's cocaine when we kiss
Caught feelings way too quick
Our love went black like liquorice
I wanna drift, Pacific Highway
4AM, fucked up like a Friday
In my head, pop pills like a migraine
Stopped fuckin' you, but I kinda like it, yeah

[Chorus]
I stopped counting at a thousand times
All the lies to my face
All of the summer nights
You would leave, I would say (Uh-huh)
I love you, I love you, I love you
I hate you, I hate you, ah, yeah (Uh-huh)
I love you, I love you, I love you
Goodbye, a thousand times
I stopped counting at a thousand times
All the lies to my face
All of the summer nights
You would leave, I would say (Uh-huh)
I love you, I love you, I love you
I hate you, I hate you, ah, yeah (Uh-huh)
I love you, I love you, I love you
Goodbye, a thousand times

[Chorus]
Diamonds on my neck, they look like cotton candy
Ridin' in the Rari with the ice on me
Gucci on my feet, I got designer on me
When I whip the pot, she said I'm outstanding
Diamonds on my neck, they look like cotton candy
Ridin' in the Rari with the ice on me
Gucci on my feet, I got designer on me
When I whip the pot, she said I'm outstanding

[Verse]
Whip, whip, whip, whip, one more time (whip)
Skrrt-Skrrt with the thirty and I let it slide (blaow)
Porsche Panamera when I pull up in new ride
Slide with the draco, those niggas can't come outside
Yeah-Yeah, I'ma just cash out the bank
Yeah, I'm puttin' the racks in a safe
I'ma just go catch a play
I'm pullin' up with K's, all of my niggas gon' spray
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, just wiped out the bank

[Chorus]
Diamonds on my neck, they look like cotton candy (uh)
Ridin' in the Rari with the ice on me
Gucci on my feet, I got designer on me
When I whip the pot, she said I'm outstanding
Diamonds on my neck, they look like cotton candy
Ridin' in the Rari with the ice on me
Gucci on my feet, I got designer on me
When I whip the pot, she said I'm outstanding

[Verse: Ezra Koenig & Steve Lacy]
Flower moon cursed the night
If the sun don't make things right
Then it's gonna take a year
Gonna take a year
Flower moon, sacred sign
Coca-Cola and red wine
Now's the time to disappear
Gonna take a year

[Chorus: Steve Lacy, Ezra Koenig & Steve Lacy]
It was the right place, wrong time
Another night at the borderline
Another night in the sway of the flower moon
It was the right week on a cursed day
Another chapter was underway
Another year in the light of the flower moon
It was the right place, wrong time
Another night at the borderline
Another night in the sway of the flower moon
It was the right week on a cursed day
Another chapter was underway
Another year in the light of the flower moon

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig & Steve Lacy]
It was the right place, wrong time
Another night at the borderline
Another night in the sway of the flower moon
It was the right week on a cursed day
Another chapter was underway
Another year in the light of the flower moon

[Bridge: Danielle Haim]
A shift in weight
A simple twist of fate
Suddenly, it's much too late
The rising tide's already lapping at the gate

[Verse: Ezra Koenig & Steve Lacy]
Flower moon cursed the night
If the sun don't make things right
Then it's gonna take a year
Gonna take a year
Flower moon, sacred sign
Coca-Cola and red wine
Now's the time to disappear
Gonna take a year

[Outro: Steve Lacy]
Flower moon cursed the night
If the sun don't make things right
Then it's gonna take a year
Gonna take a year

[Intro]
*Laughter*
Hey
What?
Hey
Listen

[Verse 1]
I've had other guys, I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before until you walked through my door
I've had other lips, I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go, you're the one for me, baby
This I know, 'cause it's...

[Chorus]
True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm going to be true blue, baby, I love you

[Verse 2]
I've heard all the lines, I've cried oh-so-many times
Those teardrops, they won't fall again, I'm so excited, 'cause you're my best friend
So if you should ever doubt wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear, those words whispered in your ear
I said...

[Chorus]
True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm going to be true blue, baby, I love you

[Bridge]
No more sadness, I kiss it goodbye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

[Refrain]
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's true love
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's true love

[Verse 3]
It's true, so if you should ever doubt wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear, those words whispered in your ear, I said

[Bridge]
No more sadness, I kiss it goodbye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

[Chorus]
True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm going to be true blue, baby, I love you

[Interlude]
I love you
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
And I'm going to be true blue, baby, I love you
H-hey
H-hey
What?
H-hey
H-hey
Hey you guys
*Laughter*

[Outro]
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's true love
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's true love
It's true love, oh baby, true love it's true love
It's true
La la la la la la la
True love, it's true
La la la la la la la
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's true love
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's true love
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's true love
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
Waking up in the morning gotta thank God
I don’t know but this place seems kinda odd
No meters on the block and no blogs
Hyping up corny bitches with no clothes on
No labels with bad taste
Signing wack rappers just to sell a little ad space
Peruse the reviews from my mixtape
Everyone agrees Maddie rocks and her shit’s great
I tell you it’s a beautiful world
When they say you rap good not just for a girl
And right then I got a text from Brad
He was working on a beat and it wasn’t half bad
And so I hit the streets
Felt something in the pocket of my ripped-up jeans
A $20 bill with my face on it
Said "in Maddie we trust, bitch" now go and put some bass on it

[Sample from "Poor Georgie" by MC Lyte]
(Like an angel from the heaven above)
(From the heaven above)
(From the heaven above)
And so I head into the caffeine spot
And grab an iced Americano with the extra shot
I found some cigs
Like half a pack
So I lit a couple up and I wrote these raps
I went to the cute barista
I said “I’m Maddie and it’s nice to meet ya
And maybe when you get off we can catch a feature, or go to your crib and just smoke some reefer"
We did like I said so
We got some milkshakes but we drank them in her bed though
She plucked a cherry off the top
She put em in her mouth and tied the shit into a knot
We made out for a while
Watched X-Files on mute while we did the deed
That’s the script y’all fill in the scene
Maddie on the mic and it’s good to be queen

I cruised to Brad’s and everything was fine
He had the beats I had the rhymes
I had the kief he had the wine
He passed me the mic
So I said check two let me kick it one time
We did the song in a single take
We knew it was a hit so we took a break
But the booze got me juiced up
Started fucking around
Freestylin’ like we used to
But the cypher kept going forever
I never choked I always thought of something clever
We rocked ‘till the cops came
And when they got out the car
The beat hit ‘em like a shockwave
And they just couldn’t resist
Grabbed their microphones and started to riff
And for one fly second everything was right
And that was called heaven
Just a girl and her mic

[Sample from "Let's Dance" by Sweet Tee]
(I'm in the midst of a rappin' blitz)
(Of a rappin' blitz)
(Of a rappin' blitz)
(I'm in the midst of a rappin' blitz)
(And you ain't never heard a girl rock the mic like this)

[Intro]
Oh, yeah
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
I'm about to try and give you one more chance
Baby, can you promise you won't break my heart?
All my friends are saying that I'm being so stupid
I can't help that you're the only drug that I'm using

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I keep using, I keep using
And you're using me too
It's useless, I keep using
No, I never pull through, it's useless
So go on, break my heart
We were broken from the start
So go on, break my heart
Oh, yeah

[Drop]
We were broken from the start
We were broken from the start
(We were broken from the start)
We were broken from the start
(We were broken from the start)

[Verse 2]
I'm about to try and give you one more chance
Even though I know I'm gonna fall apart
All my friends are calling me, but no, I'm not listening
I can't help that you're the only drug in my system

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I keep using, I keep using
And you're using me too
It's useless, I keep using
No, I never pull through, it's useless
So go on, break my heart
We were broken from the start
So go on, break my heart
Oh, yeah

[Drop]
We were broken from the start
We were broken from the start
(We were broken from the start)
We were broken from the start
(We were broken from the start)

[Outro]
20 steps forwards and 20 steps backwards
Runnin' in circles and kissin' disaster
20 steps backwards and 20 steps forwards
Runnin' in circles, I'm runnin' back toward ya
I take 20 steps forwards and 20 steps backwards
Runnin' in circles and kissin' disaster
20 steps backwards and 20 steps forwards
Runnin' in circles, I'm runnin' back toward ya

[Verse]
You think you got it all right, all right
But baby, yeah, you got it all wrong, all wrong
Thought that I was losing my mind, my mind
But baby, I'm the one who's been creepin’ on the low, yeah

[Chorus]
You don't mean a thing to me
You were just a body in between my sheets
I was using you 7 days of the week
I can't believe that you thought you were using me
Ha, ha, ha
You don't mean a thing to me
I don't even know you and you don't know me
I was using you 7 days of the week
Can't believe that you thought you were using me
Ha, ha, ha

[Post-Chorus]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

[Verse]
You think you got it all right, all right
But baby, yeah, you got it all wrong, all wrong
Thought that I was losing my mind, my mind
But baby, I'm the one who's been creepin’ on the low, yeah

[Chorus]
You don't mean a thing to me
You were just a body in between my sheets
I was using you 7 days of the week
I can't believe that you thought you were using me
Ha, ha, ha
You don't mean a thing to me
I don't even know you and you don't know me
I was using you 7 days of the week
Can't believe that you thought you were using me
Ha, ha, ha

[Post-Chorus]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Gather ‘round folks while I tell you about my man
I’m talkin’ about Growlin’ Dan
He’s got roly-poly eyes
And he’s just about my size
He ain’t no sheik, not a gigolo
But just like they do, he takes it nice and slow
In fact whatever he does, I think is grand
I’m talkin’ about Growlin’ Dan

Minnie the Moocher she met my Growlin’ Dan
She shook her hoochie coochie tried to steal my man
She told him of the dream she had of the King of Sweden
And how he was givin’ her everything she was needin’
Yea, my Dan is mean, but he’s on the square
So he told old Minnie to take the air
He said Ho-de-ho-de ho ha ha!
Minnie, I’ll see you in the sweet by and by

Mmm, when a dog gets mad he howls
When my mad gets mad he growls
He says “What are you doin’?
Where you been?
Where you goin’?
When did you come in?
Is my bath ready?
Did you turn the water on?”
Oh oh, sometimes I wish I was gone
But he handles my affairs and that takes a real good man
I’m talkin’ about Growlin’ Dan
Wah, wah, Growlin’ Dan
Wah, wah, wah Growlin’ Dan
Wah, wah, Growlin’ Dan
Wah, wah, talkin’ about my Growlin’ Dan

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I got crows at my window, dogs at my door
I don't think I can take any more
What am I doing wrong?
I don't know

[Verse 2]
My brother told me, "life's not a pain"
But that was right when it started to rain
Where am I going wrong?
I don't know

[Chorus]
But it's alright, sleep tight
I will take the strain
You're fine, love of mine
You will feel no pain

[Verse 3]
Well, I see trouble at every turn
I've got so many lessons to learn
What am I doing wrong?
I don't know

[Bridge 1]
Now what's the matter with me?
Am I right? Am I wrong?
Now I started to see
I must try to be strong

[Verse 4]
I try to love you best as I can
But you know that I'm only a man
Why am I going wrong?
I don't know

[Bridge 2]
Mmm, yeah, mmm
Oh, woah, woah, woah, mhmm

[Chorus]
But it's alright, sleep tight
I will take the strain
Yeah, you're fine, little love of mine
You will feel no pain

[Verse 1]
I got crows at my window and dogs at my door
But I don't think I can take anymore
What am I doing wrong?
I don't know

[Outro]
Now what's the matter with me? I don't know, I don't know
What's the matter with me? I don't know, I don't know
What's the matter with me? I don't know, I don't know

[Verse 1]
I saw you flash a smile, that seemed to me to say
You wanted so much more than casual conversation
I swear I caught a look before you turned away
Now I don't see the point resisting your temptation

[Chorus]
Did you come on to me?
Will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?

[Refrain]
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do-do, do

[Verse 2]
I don't think I can wait like I'm supposed to do
How soon can we arrange a formal introduction?
We need to find a place where we can be alone
To spend some special time without an interruption

[Chorus]
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?

[Refrain]
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do-do, do, yeah
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do-do, do

[Verse 3]
Before you grab your coat, I'll try to be discreet
You know we can't be seen exchanging information

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
Well, I saw you flash a smile, that seemed to me to say
You wanted so much more than casual conversation

[Chorus]
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you

[Bridge]
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will now
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will now, uh-huh

[Chorus]
If you, if you come on to me (yeah), then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll come on to you
Whoo!

[Chorus]
I wanna be a theater kid
We draw all over them
And they just erase it

[Verse 1]
My perceptions too narrow
To know who I want to be
Maybe if I'd been somewhere else in my life
I'd be more than what you see
And we have been told all our lives
That our colors must be seen
I just want to hide some colors away
Some colors just for me

[Chorus]
I wanna be a theater kid
We draw all over them
And they just erase it

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna be another slice
Off the high school pie of sacrifice
Another wrong, another right
When we're all the same, there's no need to fight
Don't wanna be another slice
Off the high school pie of sacrifice
Another wrong, another right
When we're all the same, there's no need to fight
Don't wanna be another slice
Off the high school pie of sacrifice
Another wrong, another right
When we're all the same, there's no need to fight
Don't wanna be another slice
Off the high school pie of sacrifice
Another wrong, another right
When we're all the same, there's no need to fight

[Chorus]
I wanna be a theater kid
We draw all over them
And they just erase it

[Pre-Chorus]
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Chorus]
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Pre-Chorus]
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Chorus]
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse 1]
Am I on your side, or just on mine?
Are you still there in every way that you were?
Am I on time?
I don't want to watch you fall in love
I don't want to watch you fall in love
Unless you're in my arms the whole time
Unless you're in my arms

[Chorus]
I've been waiting to say that
I want you so bad
I want you so bad
Let's leave it at that
Let's leave it at that

[Verse 2]
You don't like to see me this way
Cause I'm still without you and I'm doing okay
All the memories, they are wasted
They are all just copied and pasted
Honey, I could choose you
If you chose him
The choices are for those to let happen

[Bridge]
I know there is no chance for restoration
But girl won't you be my frustration
A little while longer, a little while longer

[Chorus]
I want you so bad
I want you so bad
Let's leave it at that
Let's leave it at that

Whoooo, whooooo
Whoooo, whooooo

[Verse]
There is not, much for me to say
But I will find a way
To spit my words in your ears
There have been times
We've hidden in your bedroom
The shaking hands have held you
Now they're steady as the rain

[Chorus]
I don't know where to go if I don't stay
I don't want to be myself
So, I'll be someone else
For a while, for a while, for a while
For a while, for a while, for a while

[Bridge]
Hello female
I'd like to get to know you
Machine gardens I'll show you
I hope they haven't died

[Chorus]
I don't know where to go if I don't stay
I don't want to be myself
So, I'll be someone else
For a while, for a while, for a while
For a while, for a while, for a while, for a while

[Intro: Marc Anthony & Pitbull]

[Verse 1]
I sat around all day
I used to get stoned
I liked to get wasted
But these days, I don't
'Cause I'm happy with you
I got lots of good things to do, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I walked around angry
I used to feel bad
But nowadays, my days
Don't have to be sad
'Cause I'm happy with you
I got lots of good things to do, ooh yeah

[Bridge 1]
Like hear the high clear robin sing
Walk a bluebell carpet
Watch the children playing games
Catch a moon and drop it
Hear the gentle mantle roll
On a frosty morning
See the mighty ocean break
Like a sailor's warning

[Verse 3]
I used to drink too much
Forgot to come home
I lied to my doctor
But these days, I don't
'Cause I'm happy with you
I got lots of good things to do, oh yeah

[Bridge 2]
Throw a pocketful of coins in the Trevi Fountain
See an ice-cold running stream
Rushing down the mountain
Hear a newborn baby lamb
Calling for its mother
Watching reunited friends
Loving one another

[Verse 1]
I sat around all day
I liked to get stoned
I used to get wasted
But these days, I don't
'Cause I'm happy with you
I got lots of good things to do, ooh yeah

[Outro]
Mmm, happy with you
I'm happy with you
Happy with you

[Verse 1]
Ladies and gentlemen
I'm standing before you with something important to say
With some trepidation I crave your attention but
I'm not gonna let anything get in my way

[Verse 2]
The message is simple, it's straight from my heart
And I know that you've heard it before
But what does it matter, we're in it together
And I'm not quitting while people are crying for more

[Chorus]
People want peace
People want peace
A simple release from their suffering
People want peace
People want peace

[Bridge]
Nothing in life is as sad as the lonely soul
Searching for peace
Only to find disappointment is waiting
Behind every door that we open
Every catch, we release

[Verse 3]
A-brothers and sisters, I beg you to listen
I know that it isn't too late
For we as the people, the voices of freedom
And we're all perfectly clear that we don't wanna wait

[Chorus]
People want peace
People want peace
A simple release from their suffering
People want peace
People want peace

[Outro]
People want peace
People want peace
Yes, we want peace!
People want peace (Yeah, yeah!)
People want peace
Part I

[Verse 1]
Despite repeated warnings
Of dangers up ahead
The captain won't be listening
To what's being said

[Verse 2]
He feels that there's a good chance
That we have been misled
And so the captain's planning
To steam ahead

[Bridge 1]
What can we do? What can we do?
What can we do to stop this foolish plan going through?
What can we do? What can we do? (Yeah, yeah!)
This man is bound to lose his ship and his crew

[Verse 3]
Despite repeated warnings
From those who ought to know
Well, he's got his own agenda
And so he'll go

[Bridge 2]
(What can we do?)
Those who shout the loudest (What can we do?)
May not always be the smartest (What can we do?)
But they have their proudest moments
Right before they fall
(What can we do?)
Red sky in the morning (What can we do?)
Doesn't ever seem to faze him (What can we do?)
But a sailor's warning signal
Should concern us all, whoa-oh

Part II

[Chorus]
How can we stop him?
Grab the keys and lock him up
If we can do it
We can save the day

[Verse 1]
The engineer lives with his wife and daughter, Janet
But he misses them so
Although he's working with the best crew on the planet
(We're the best crew on the planet!)
They never want him to go
He had a premonition
He senses something's wrong
And by his own admission
He knew it all along

The captain's crazy
But he doesn't let them know it
He'll take us with him
If we don't do something soon to slow it

[Chorus]
How can we stop him?
Grab the keys and lock him up
If we can do it
We can save the day

[Bridge]
Below decks, the engineer cries
The captain's gonna leave us when the temperatures rise
The needle's going up, the engine's gonna blow
And we are gonna be left down below
Down below

Part III

[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus]
Yes, we can do it
Yeah, we can do it now
Yes, we can do it

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Yes, we can do it
Yeah, we can do it now
Yes, we can do it
Yeah, we can do it now
Yes, we can do it
Yeah, we can do it now
Oh yeah

[Verse]
If life would work out the way you plan it
That'd be so fine for the wife and Janet
Sometimes you might have to battle through it
And that's the way you learn how you've got to do it

[Bridge]
Yes, we can do it, whoa-oh
Yes, we can do it, whoa-oh-whoa
Yes, we can do it, whoa-oh-whoa
Yes, we can do it, whoa-oh-whoa

Part I reprise

[Verse 1]
Despite repeated warnings
Of dangers up ahead
Well, the captain wasn't listening
To what was said

[Outro]
(What can we do?)
(For those who shout the loudest)
So we went to the captain
(What can we do?)
(May not always be the smartest)
And we told him to turn around
(What can we do?)
(But they have their proudest moments)
But he laughs in our faces
(Right before they fall)
Says that we are mistaken
(What can we do?)
(Red sky in the morning)
So we gather around him
(What can we do?)
(Doesn't ever seem to faze him)
Now the ropes that have bound him
(What can we do?)
(But a sailor's warning signal)
Prove that he should have listened
(Should concern us all)
To the will of the people
It's the will of the people
It's the will of the people

[Verse 1]
Used to love a libertine
Man, I miss him so
We used to run wild on the brink of seventeen
We lost it all

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All on our own, eyes off the road
Reckless when we in love
Kiss me and go, I was a fool for you, ahh
Burn down my house, fuck up my head
Reckless while we in bed
Kiss me and go, I was a fool for you, ahh

[Chorus]
Yeah, we didn't care
When we were younger
No, we didn't care 'bout a thing
We made it rain all over London
We made it rain so we could swim
We were different people back then
Wanna feel that feeling again
'Cause we didn't care
When we were younger

[Verse 2]
I used to be your libertine
Something like a high
We go to sleep at 4AM out on the beach
Not thinking twice

[Pre-Chorus 2]
All on our own, eyes off the road
Reckless when you're in love
Kiss me and go, you were a fool it's true, ahh
Burn down your house, fuck up your head
Reckless while we in bed
Kiss me and go, you were a fool it's true, ahh

[Chorus]
Yeah, we didn't care
When we were younger
No, we didn't care 'bout a thing
We made it rain all over London
We made it rain so we could swim
We were different people back then
Wanna feel that feeling again
'Cause we didn't care
When we were younger

[Bridge]
Remember that summer
When we made it rain over London
Lay together under covers
We were different, we weren't like the others
Remember that summer
When we made it rain over London
Lay together under covers
We were different, we weren't like the others, nah-nah

[Chorus]
Yeah, we didn't care
When we were younger
No, we didn't care 'bout a thing
We made it rain all over London
We made it rain so we could swim
We were different people back then
Wanna feel that feeling again
'Cause we didn't care
When we were younger

[Intro]
(Way, way, way, way)

[Verse 1]
Drifting away, should I leave and let us break?
Torn, torn apart, left a hole in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we might shatter in time, I lost my mind
They say that I should let you go
Tell me I shouldn’t throw

[Chorus]
Bricks at my own window
Love in a tornado, bullets in a barrel cage
Roses in a fire, screaming into silence
Diamonds back to coal again
But I wouldn't have it any other
Way, way, way
Staying beside ya, roses in a fire

[Verse 2]
Stone, stone cold
Only you can warm my soul
Bones turn to dust
Locked away, left untouched

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we might shatter in time, I lost my mind
They say that I should let you go
Tell me I shouldn’t throw

[Chorus]
Bricks at my own window
Love in a tornado, bullets in a barrel cage
Roses in a fire, screaming into silence
Diamonds back to coal again
But I wouldn’t have it any other
(Way, way, way)
Staying beside ya, roses in a fire
Roses in a fire

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we might shatter in time, I lost my mind
They say that I should let you go
Tell me I shouldn’t throw

[Chorus]
Bricks at my own window
Love in a tornado, bullets in a barrel cage
Roses in a fire, screaming into silence
Diamonds back to coal again
But I wouldn’t have it any other
(Way, way, way)
Staying beside ya, roses in a fire

[Verse 1]
God came down, and it asked me, “Are you trusting?”
And I didn’t know what to say
I cannot decide
Lead ‘cause it's what they want
And it’s what they need
But for me, it's not

[Pre-Chorus]
All and all, I want to trust that we are not alone
Comfort in believing, guiding hands are leading
Overly skeptic, I'm isolated
I'll never prove it, so it seems
Crosses for freedom
Suffocate syndrome

[Chorus 1]
God showed up to tell me what it thought
“And even if you don’t believe
There are those who still need me.”
I reply, “The safety of your name
Isn’t something I deny, but I may not feel the same.”
Then silence set

[Verse 2]
We are the people that cannot be trusted to lead
Like we want, like we need
But for me, it’s about whether I can
Agree that the skies are watching
Eyes up above always judging

[Chorus 2]
Telling me its thoughts
“And even if you don’t believe
There are those who still need me.”
I reply, "The safety of your name
Isn’t something I deny, but I may not feel the same."

[Bridge]
As we have the conversation, I express my indecision
Living now instead of living for an afterlife

[Outro]
Crosses for freedom, suffocate syndrome
Crosses now freed of the suffocating syndrome
Remove this thing from my chest
Controlling cerebral cortex
All the major obstructions from then to now generate a hex
Still my lust for pain's genetic

So I need to treat the cause of internal bleeding
Of hope that's misleading, my rational complex

Replace and take what you need from every part of me
Mix and match what you will
If I fight, hold me still
Take the piece of me that now berates the peace I seek
In myself, in myself
If this procedure can't reroute my twisted thinking
I will chase the torture that I secretly need

[Verse 1]
Emotion, inflammation, calloused and abound
Emotion, agitation, scarring of the soul
Nervous system challenged, parts of me invalid
In a dream I embody it, scenes hyperbolic
Sensing what's left to come
I know it’s bad when I look back
And I see my arms drag me along
Getting stabilized, get it sterilized

[Chorus]
Brace while they cauterize
There’s no fight in a lesion that can’t heal itself
I prep the mental knife
We cut and we tear what we’re wanting to part with

[Verse 2]
Emotion, inflammation, calloused and abound
Emotion, agitation, scarring of...
Stitch the laceration, yeah
Trauma setting in

[Bridge]
I see myself on the bed, seething from post-surgery
And I keep saying this dream isn’t real, I’m sure
While I’m looking up at me
Suture it up, suture it up
Suture
The trauma never should have left the room
Never should have wandered, never, never

[Pre-Chorus]
Separate the damage from
Separate the damage from

[Chorus]
Brace while they cauterize
There’s no fight in a lesion that can’t heal itself
I prep the mental knife
We cut and we tear what we’re wanting to part with

[Outro]
Emotion, inflammation, calloused and abound
Emotion, agitation, scarring all around

[Intro]
Depart when the building lights go out
Depart when the doors are locked (Oh, oh)
Depart when the building lights go out, depart...

[Verse 1]
Always in motion
Distant devotion cuts through time zones away
City by city, I come just to leave
And I just want to be like a bed bug
And live in your sheets
Two in the morning, I call to see if you're awake
The car is stopped and for a moment I can think

[Chorus 1]
How can I be what you need
And who you believe when I'm always gone?
I'm in debt with your understanding, girl

[Verse 2]
Remember when we first would talk?
I think what I loved most about you was your thoughts
When you call, I will just listen
If you want I can talk
As you speak, I will just listen
I don't want it to stop
I'll stand close to you so we're an easy target
The arrow, stabbing through, holds us both in place
If we were to then become a separate unit
We would have to rip where it grew in us

[Pre-Chorus]
Distance, distress
I don't say enough
How I treasure this but

[Chorus 2]
How can I show that I care
And always be there when I'm never home?
I'm in debt to your love
Most of all I just want to be

[Bridge]
Right by you in perfect silence
City by city, I come just to leave
But for now let me be like a bed bug
And live in your sheets
Two in the morning
I'm in your room, our nest
My muse up on a perch

[Outro]
White line repetition
Dotted line infestation
In a distant desert town
That's where I'll go

[Verse 1]
Tension flowing through my veins and I can feel it
I want to cut it out so I can see it
But that’s the way I always know
Even now, this uncertainty soon will pass

Hours spent inside the room that got me sober
Praying the dopamine would find me sooner
But that’s the gash I had to sew on this road
I just have to own where it goes

[Chorus]
Soft manipulating, hot and cold
Kept my family waiting long enough
Careless and self centered ways I behaved stained our home
I found a photograph my father took of someone I don’t know
I don’t recognize

[Verse 2]
Lovers, and everyone who fought for me to beat it
How could I commit when I didn’t feel it?
I wish that I could give you back stolen time
Maybe in the end, you’ll get mine

[Bridge]
I'd kill the light when everyone was home
I didn't want them to know where I was
Alive at night
I snuck around to be the very thing you tried preventing
Maybe in the end, I’ll give it back
Maybe in the end, you’ll get it back
You’ll get it back

[Chorus]
Soft manipulating hot and cold
Kept my family waiting long enough
I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know
Careless and self-centered ways I behaved stained our home
I found a photograph my brother took of someone I don’t know
I don’t recognize anymore

[Intro]
Shape to me
The human puzzle piece
Do it like I dreamed
Eager
It's not right to let this go unchecked
Deviation only helps it all confect

[Chorus]
In a fucked up way I'm happy
For the dirty way you make me act
In all the ways we lust, the sense of touch is capable
I want to feel the way I felt when I was high

I want you begging; I'm inclined to do what you like
The way you're bending says it all to me

[Verse]
Let's indulge in this all night
Let's engage in bliss now
Our eyes will lock right before you turn around
Pressure gets placed on the wall, yeah

Coming down I feel unnerved
Burden
Is it healthy to be so involved?

[Chorus]
In a fucked up way I'm happy
With the fucked up way you're mine
Now, you're mine!

I want you begging; I'm inclined to do what you like
The way you're bending says it all to me

[Bridge]
Years from now will I reflect on this as a lesson?
Was I right to give it time?
But for now I'm living like death could come today
So what it is I want, I can't not take anymore
It's a privilege we have just to crave it
And I can't not look anymore when it's there
It's a rush for skin to touch
Only human 'cause I just can't help what I love

[Outro]
See all this as it grows
Feel all this as it grows
See all this as it grows
Feel all this as it grows
So many ways to live
So many ways to live
So many ways to live
All the ways
I'm cold, conscience numbing from the windchill
Unfold, words start flowing
There's a lot to say

Now should I step away?
How could I anyway?
I've traced it back right to the days
I hate the guilt but love the taste

My eyes should be gouged
This can't resolve
Those eyes were too much
For the walls my soul created
In the frigid arms of winter
We burned the wick at both ends
Then tricked ourselves but didn't know

Feels good, knowing no one isn't out there
The reach casts across the sea
When the feeling passes, another casualty
I've traced it right back to the day
I hate the game but love to play
Those eyes are gouging
This can't be good
My eyes saw too much for the mind my skull protected
In the frigid arms of winter
We burned the wick at both ends
I felt the heat but couldn't let go

[Intro]
Stark compunction
Found salvation
Forged contrition
Shame cessation

[Verse]
Steal it from me, I should have known
Make it hurt then leave it alone
My moral operating system is off
The incapacity to care is so strong

Send help
Save our souls
I need something to go wrong

[Chorus]
Fractured system
All of my roots are dead to me
Detach from me
Severed all the way
And all of my wounds are scars to be
The depth of me
So long, swan song

[Verse]
Listen, it's not your fault
I've dragged some then been dragged along
My moral operating system is off
My incapacity to care is so strong

[Bridge]
When I learn a new part of me
I forget something else
On the set of who I've become
I always wanna look back
Always wanna stall
When I show different parts of me
I don't sleep where I live
Leave debris when I act alone
Thinking in the moment
Consequences form

[Verse]
Send help
Save our souls
I need something to go wrong

[Chorus]
Fractured system
All of my roots are dead to me
You're dead to me
Severed all the way
And all of my wounds are left to be
The death of me
(So long)
Fractured system
I just want you to die for me and detach from me
Severed all the way
All of my wounds arrange to be
The depth of me
So long, Syrah

[Intro]
To the predators at bay
I've got ways to make you pay
Lessons taught by peeling skin
And I love it when you...

[Verse]
Beg for the time, I'm about to take
Like your rogue entitlement
Skin your sins away
Karma comes to say
Who will care anyway?

[Pre-Chorus]
I was thinking that this time together
Might just cleanse your slate

[Chorus]
You'll scream: Stop, stop, stop!
That's the irony
It's like deja vu, right?
Are their faces resurfacing?
Do you see what they have to see?
There are remnants of ways you forced yourself
In the traces of everything you've touched

[Verse]
Your own weapon is
Ten more pieces to take
One at a time is a lot to accomplish but
I know that I'll get it done

[Bridge]
You might call this Arcane Justice
I'll enforce it with my hands
With my hands
Power coercion
Goes around, comes around
You can't escape it
You're gonna feel it
Own it

[Verse]
Beg for the limbs, I'm about to take
You have stolen innocence
Skin your sins away
Pliers help to say
This is what you deserve

[Chorus]
You'll plead: Let this stop...
That's the irony
It's like deja vu, right?
All the faces resurfacing
Do you see what they have to see
There are remnants of
Ways you force yourself
In the traces of everything and everyone you love

[Refrain]
I don’t know how it happened but something came over me
Separate what I have to do from where I want to be

[Verse 1]
Backed up against the wall
I do it to myself
Always wanting more even when I get it
So I beg and plead for the unattainable
Once I have it, I lose interest just as fast

[Chorus]
Fuck this anyway
Do I have to learn to live craving more than I'm given?
Fuck it all anyway
I will never be appeased
I don’t know what’s wrong with me
I will never be appeased

[Verse 2]
Panic in a post-apocalyptic state of mind
Manic mending severed satisfaction all the time
I always think there’s more to find
One day I’m a wreck the next I’m fine

[Chorus]
Fuck this anyway
Do I have to learn to live craving more than I’m given?
(Not enough!)
Fuck it all anyway
I will never be appeased

[Refrain]
I don’t how it happened but something came over me
Separate what I have to do from where I want to be

[Bridge]
Can’t get away from this space
Can’t rip away, I'm displaced
Displaced

[Outro]
Once again, was it meant?
Everything feels different
Never sure, does it last?
Everything goes too fast
In the back of my head I become embedded long before I know
Should I want to be around you and the roller coaster virtues?
I don’t want to know what you do when I’m gone
'Cause I’m gone…

[Verse]
What measures truth?
Is my life something I'll afford?
And I just have not yet figured out
My tendons hurt as the paper gets matted with ink
Now the right words are just on the brink
I swear that they're testing my patience

Run 'til my gut pumps inspiration
And I think I might now have figured out
Run 'til this rut feels insufficient
To the voice on the wind: Are you real?
Is it my intuition?
Are you still into it, into this?
Have I been robbing myself?
Running away with the time
So I might just now have figured out

[Outro]
I startle you
When I'm dreaming, I talk in my sleep
Saying things that I'm not sure I mean
I still believe in things that I can't see
And I might just now have figured out that
I'm just a vessel, I'm just a vessel (Energy flowing)
I'm just a vessel, I'm just a vessel (Energy flowing, energy flowing)
I'm just a vessel (Energy flowing)
And I might now have it figured out

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse]
You layin' sexy, yeah
I make you want it now (Yeah)
I got it all for love
I wanna make you numb
You're in a sober life
You've gotta pour it out
You lookin' good tonight
I've gotta an ordinary life (Yeah)
You lookin' you

Tell me, babe, if you call my name
I wanna take you numb, before
I wanna take you, before
I wanna hold you, hold you, hold you, before
I wanna lay you down, before
I wanna take you

[Chorus]
Don't give your love away
'Cause girl, I give a fuck about you
Oh, don't let go of your heart
Gotta let go of the pain you feel
Pain you feel
'Cause I know what's in your heart
In your heart

[Verse]
Yeah, yeah
This the same old bullshit
Yeah, yeah
This the same damn thing (Thing)
Grabbin' on your body tryna get you loose
You done make mistakes, but I
Who making love, girl? I see the truth
It's the best, I got you rolling eyes
In the back of the head now
You think that I'm a thug nigga
Misery loves company
So I'ma stay with you
You're playing hard to get
Damn, like girl, you won't forget
More liquor with no niggas
Up in my crib with no extras
No clothes, just your necklace
Work it out, I bowflex it
And I hope that you gon' stay long
Roleplay, just play along

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, just keep them heels on, yeah
I hope you ready for them body shots
You been playing dumb with me all night
It's time to give it to me, girl, all you got

[Chorus]
Don't give your love away
'Cause girl, I give a fuck about you
Oh, don't let go of your heart
Gotta let go of the pain you feel
Pain you feel
'Cause I know what's in your heart
In your heart

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (Slow)
I'm gone on them once I get going (Gone on them, oh, gone on them)

[Chorus: Drake & Young Thug]

Howisha, you need a... (Ow!) baby with me, uh

Yeah, vacation is done, but I'm not finished, no

[Pre-Chorus: Drake & Young Thug]
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning (Pour it up!)
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (Slow)
I'm gone on them once I get going (Gone on them, gone on them, gone on them) (Ow!)

You need a younger to give you guidance
She say I'm the youngest, but I treat her the nicest

[Chorus: Young Thug]
She tryna take it all off for me

I plan on fuckin' every girl in the world, but I'm takin' it

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I raised change for you, I gave all my stain to you
You know I bang for you
Even my main know I got a thing for you
Walked in a aisle, anyday for you
I'll go under maintainin' for you
Jump when you say, like a kangaroo
Cryin' over you, and it ain't nothin' new

[Bridge: Young Thug]
You let me wear your watch, then I fucked your girl in it
We danced drunk, then we hurlin'
She presented a gift with a shit-face
I'm tryna fuck every girl in the place, but I'm takin' it

[Refrain: Young Thug]
Easy, easy, breezy, easy
Easy, breezy, easy, breezy

[Intro: bearface]
And mother, I am sorry, I never pick up, mm-hmm
Because I'm afraid to disappoint ooh, ooh-ah, ooh, no

[Chorus: serpentwithfeet]
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to

[Verse 1: bearface]
We were sat outside on the Harvard floor
With our feet in dirt, and our hearts in awe
I be losin' sleep thinkin' 'bout missed calls
And I see the names circling our thoughts
And I think about if we lose it all
And I turn to shit that you'd never want
Like the smoke, the drink, anything at all
And I'll say again, "Sorry I don't call"
There's no money on my mind
But my money or my mind
What's the first to fall?
I never wanted this shit, yeah

[Chorus: serpentwithfeet]
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Sometimes, it be so spot on it hurts
Like when Auntie couldn't decide between going to work or church
I've been in my feelings on an island in the dirt
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
I said, "I'll try vacation, I'll try to run away"
I deleted Facebook, I'll trade fame any day
For a quiet Texas place and a barbecue plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for you, is that good for you?
My ghost still haunt ya, my life is I, Tonya
A big-eyed monster, only face to conquer
I hated songs about fame 'cause that stuff meant nothin'
Until them headlines came, then first flight I'm stuck in

[Bridge: Joba]
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I took a plane to somewhere that I've never been
Too many times without my sister and my brother
Dad or mother by my side but they're in spirit
I always hear it, I know they feel it
My momma always had these dreams that used to keep her up at night
I smoke to keep them all away and make use of the time
I'm void of feelin'
The reasons I'm so out of touch now start revealin'
But I'm not ashamed, I'm not afraid of who I am
Or how I trust my mental, yeah, it's not perfect
But I guess that's just the shit I'm into
I fantasize about a time when everything was simple
My shelter sheltered me from things I needed to commit to
The way it stands to me
A victim of Stockholm in my friendships and family

[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood]
What's costin' your time? What's the reason that you whine?
What's in your wallet? Dead whites in mine
So sour, in this light of lime
Daddy said "Study or get that cash"
Mommy said "Your career ain't gon' last"
Loose change, call a cab, move out their pad
I just need a chance to move past my past
Don't think too fast, private jets still crash
And I'll still fly coach, and I'll still hit a roach
And I'll still see roaches at the crib where my folks at
Touch your dreams 'fore you touch me and provoke a man
(Somebody's gonna have to tell the truth and I'm gonna tell it!)

[Outro:  serpentwithfeet & Matt Champion]
I will
I will
(I don't matter)
I will
(Ahh)
Can I tell you how?
Can I tell you now?
I will

[Verse 1]
Why I got this gel in my hair for no reason?
Sitting in my bedroom with my headphones bleeding
Staring at my posters of these Japanese women
Dreaming of a day when it's worth what I'm seeing
Should I get my trophies out the box?
Should I hang my ribbons even though I lost?
Cross country was that fastest on the team
Cross country when I was only seventeen
Now the only thing I got are these memories
And a lot of time on my hands

[Chorus]
Camo print depression
I keep my feelings hidden
No pills, no thrills
I'm not used to winning
But that's life, that's life
Camo print depression
I keep my feelings hidden
No pills, no thrills
I'm not used to winning
But that's life, that's life

[Post-Chorus]
Somebody told me that I wasn't good enough
Somebody told me that, fuck that

[Verse 2]
What's gonna be my reputation?
Camera phone too close to the bunk bed
One on top and one on the bottom
Is that a flip cam? (Yeah man)
I got two (Oh shoot)
One for the B-roll, and one for the docu'
These numbers mean nothing to me
My mama saw me on TV
Said she didn't recognize me

[Bridge]
Mama saw me on TV
I'm not saying I'm a ride or die
Mama saw me on TV
Who's to say what's wrong or right?
Mama saw me on TV
Mama saw me on TV
Mama saw me on TV
Mama turned the TV off

[Chorus]
Camo print depression
I keep my feelings hidden
No pills, no thrills
I'm not used to winning
But that's life, that's life
Camo print depression
I keep my feelings hidden
No pills, no thrills
I'm not used to winning
But that's life, that's life

[Post-Chorus]
Somebody told me that I wasn't good enough
Somebody told me that, fuck that

[Outro]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't get in my way, get in my way now
Don't you go out your way on your way down
Don't gotta be partying, ain't tryna keep up
Just don't look for me, end of story
It's the major leagues, I swing my dick like batter up

A director and a soundtrack
Sippin' on some Malbec
Where you get that style from?
Let me get my style back
Never been camera shy
Mug shots, no Clayton High
Potato on the barrel, turn your ass into potato pie
Every letter in the alphabet a G (G)
My favorite rapper that I wanna see is me
You can't compete
I'm out your league
Check your receipt
The dick ain't free, yeah
Okay, on my fourth Patek

Give her everything except another chance and respect, yeah

[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller]
I took the 95 to get from West Palm
Think I need a break from everything
Yes, I'm stressed way more than usual
I'm gettin' things back in order
Getting things back to how they used to be
Back to when the scrutiny had no effect on you and me
I miss driving with you in the passenger (Driving, yeah)
Feet up on my dash, we would see the sun lapse
Take you home, you would come see me before class
Makes more sense for you to crash with me but you never ask, oh why
Told you there's no need to be shy, oh why
I be waiting in the meantime, oh why
You always got me on stand by
When you know I need love
I'm missing when we was us
Miss when I wasn't famous, that's when we could be us
Kiss right in the street, fuck if anybody sees
Just friends, I don't think anybody believes
Hard to keep it PG with a nigga like me, goddamn

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
I fell in love with you, I fell in love, girl
I miss us
Nah, I won't front, got me so sprung
'Cause you, you're one of one (Hey)
It's no rush (Yeah, miss it)
I'm missing your touch (Your touch)
I'm missing your touch, oh
Missing when you kept in touch, oh-woah-oh (Oh, yeah)
When you kept in touch

[Interlude]
Phone ringing

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
I took the 401 to get from Yorkdale
You're still looking like the baddest thing I done seen
Deflated before it started flattening
Way before the singer-rapper thing started happening
We were playing checkers, I was just tryna get back to king
I miss black tinted windows on your whip looking Amish
I'm just tryna put it down
You can put it on my tab
I'm putting you on your back
Then putting it in you slow
Then putting it in on a track, oh yeah
And I always tried to fall through
Ain't no Ws and dubbing me when I call you
I'm in first class
Thinking 'bout how you would get me right
Damn near made me miss the flight
Fucking you and get it right, yeah
You gon' bring me to that first time we fucked on the futon
Back then, I would do anything to get you alone
You would know me, all bullshit aside
So hit my line, I miss us

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller & Tory Lanez]
I fell in love with you, I fell in love, girl
I miss us (Baby, oh yeah)
Nah, I won't front, got me so sprung
'Cause you, you're one of one (You're one of one)
It's no rush (Yeah, miss it)
I'm missing your touch (Your touch)
I'm missing your touch, oh
Missing when you kept in touch, oh-woah-oh (Oh, yeah)
When you kept in touch

Gotta be the bad guy
I had a bad day at work
Don't wanna have a bad night, ayy

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Woo! Told my wife I need a threesome
Woo! Be out all night until three somethin'
Woo! Yeezus Christ, I need three nuns
Woo! They gon' suck me off like a Capri-Sun
Haan? You see this coat? Mothafucka ask where I got the fleece from
Lookin' for the competition, I don't see none
They tell me be humble, tell 'em be somethin'
My two balls make her bust three nuts
Drink it out the bottle then I poured it on her D-cups (haan)
Ball so hard, went D1
Jumped over the Jumpman, just stumped the tree stump (woo)
Breakfast at the SOHO, give her FOMO like a mofo
Ooh, say she want gold, though what would she do for some logos?
Black girl want me for my Benz
White girl want me for my skin
Yeezy Season resurrected again
Who you with when it's me verse them, haan?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Somebody
Gotta be the bad guy
I had a bad day at work
Don't wanna have a bad night, ayy

[Refrain: Young Thug & Kanye West]
I ain't new to this shit, fuck-nigga
I'm trappin' from the other side
So get outta your seat, stand up (wooooo!)
Stand up
A fuck-nigga hate me while his old lady participate
Please tell that lil' nigga man up (lil' nigga, stand up, woo)
Stand up (lil' nigga, stand up)
Stand up (hey, hey)
Hey, hey, stand up, stand up, stand up

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
First of all, let me tell you somethin', boy
I don't give no fuck 'bout no niggas (Woo)
I don't give no fuck, I'm not givin' two fucks (Woah)
Roll up and pop one of these niggas (Blat)
I do this shit for my woadies (Woo)
You do this shit for your shorty, you bitch
Shut the fuck nigga, fresh out of the bottle
The hood be callin', sell the plug
I'ma wipe a nigga nose, shatter like a picture
I'ma fuck his ho like these bitches up on this missile
I'ma get a whole lotta lead for these pistols
And my money long like the nose on a prince
But she gon' fuck, she write, no pen
But you know I'm gon' suspend her

[Refrain: Young Thug]
I ain't new to this shit, fuck-nigga
I'm trappin' from the other side

[Verse 3: Tyga]
I might have to jump from the three-point line
I might take a piss on the Hollywood sign
She always bite her lips every time she lyin'
She bite her lips every time she say she mine (woo, sheesh)
Can't be my baby with no "Maybe"
I'm always more truthful when I'm angry
I can't go to dinner with my lady
This fame shit's crazy
Nigga got more whips than slavery
My shit in Barney's sellin' like it's Macy's
Been two months since I talked to Jay-Z, this fame shit's crazy

[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we gotta celebrate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse: Drake & French Montana]
If you need me, you can call me, I stay busy makin' money
You know what is on my mind, all I think about is hunnids
I stay busy (Bzz!) workin' on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
I see the future when I get wavy (Wavy God!)
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne (Haan) when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes
When I was with Ms. Creighton, that lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favourites, it feels amazin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Drake]
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This a life bid we can never separate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah, I can only tell you shit in pieces
As it happens to me, I begin to write the thesis
Franny got the Aria setup like it's a Freaknik
Vegas like Marineland, that big whale treatment
Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend
I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin'
My mood is changin' this summer, I'ma be tweakin'

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

Ayy, well, look I love my baby and I love my baby mama
But, it's like every time I see her, it be crazy drama

[Chorus]
Yeah, Audemar wrist, tat on my neck

You not my bih', you did me wrong
Feel like I can’t even call you my ex

How you gon’ shit on the kid when you know I used to love you?
(Gimme a sec)
Check, went to jewelers to fuck a Patek
Wildin’ out for respect

[Refrain 1]
Shawty, why can’t you love me?
Five bands, spending lovely

You cannot trust me
I cannot trust me

[Chorus]
Yeah, Audemar wrist, tat on my neck

'Cause I can’t make you love, and I can’t make you love me

[Bridge]
Damn, I wished you loved me
Damn, I wished you loved me
Wasn’t it so lovely? Wasn’t it so lovely?
When you used to love me?
And do you still love me?
Why can’t you love?

[Refrain 2]
Why don’t you love me?
Why don’t you love me?
Why don’t you love me?
Why don’t you love, yeah

[Verse 1]
Went to the trenches, came back to a nigga
You flew away and came back to a nigga
You used to keep it so thorough, then when you would come around you wouldn’t even dap all my niggas
I loved myself when I was in the trap
I loved myself when I was in the trenches
I love my love for people when I used to see 'em walk beside me sleeping on them benches
But one day you saw me and you held me down
Kept it real and shawty you held it down
Wasn’t nothin’ niggas could tell me now
Wasn’t nothin’ that I couldn’t sell out
I just had to get the money and get it
Got the product, stack it, flip it and split it
With my niggas in the trenches
Baby, you the one that held a nigga down and I will not forget it, yeah

[Refrain 3]
You loved, you loved me
You loved, you loved me
You loved, you loved me

[Verse 2]
Back to my ways, I’m going back to my ways
Audemar, Patek, the face
I can’t go back to your place
It bring me back to the days
Back in the day
How the fuck you let him kiss on your face?
How you had him all up back in your place?
Had another nigga sit in my space
Tryna give another nigga my place, oh no

[Outro]
No, no, no, no, no

Drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip (Oh)

[Verse 1]
I'm under your spell
Pulled me in, took me down with your poisonous touch
You brought me to hell
Watched me burn with the fever that I love so much
You're watching me crawl
You get your kicks
Take your fist, put it right through the wall
The drug that I crave
You're so clever, you're the devil, watch you slither away

[Chorus]
See, I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predictYou were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

[Verse 2]
Your truth is a lie
Bitter fruit, bitter sweet
But oh, so divine
Now that I've had a taste
Like a moth to the flame
I'm addicted to pain

[Chorus]
See, I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted
To the one that got away

[Chorus]
See, I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
See, I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

[Refrain]
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Verse 1]
I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
That's why I wrote this song

[Break]
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?

[Verse 2]
So, I went into a bar
Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said
It's always been the same

[Break]
This type of modern life, is not for me
This type of modern life, is not for free

[Chorus]
American life
I live the American dream
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream
American life

[Verse 3]
I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more

[Break]
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?

[Refrain]
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Chorus]
American life
I live the American dream
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream
American life
American life

[Verse 4]
I tried to be a boy
Tried to be a girl
Tried to be a mess
Tried to be the best
Tried to find a friend
Tried to stay ahead
Tried to stay on top

[Refrain]
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I going to be a star?

[Break]
Do I have to change my name?
Am I going to be a star?
Do I have to change my name?
Am I going to be a star?
Do I have to change my name?

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
You want, I've got
You take, have not
Your loss, my gain
We're all the same

[Chorus]
You're in a game, but you don't know it
Get in control or you're gonna blow it
Find out his name, find out where did it come from
I wanna know if he's really God's son
Is he really God's son?

[Verse 2]
You have, I lack
We fade to black
Your move, I take
You win, checkmate

[Chorus 2]
We're all sick, but we just can't see it
Call it a trick, 'cause you don't wanna be it
Try to break through all of your defenses
How would it feel to let go of your senses?

[Verse 3]
Don't forget to ask him his name
If you knew what I knew, you'd be doing the same
Ambiguity does us no good
I want everything to be understood

[Bridge]
You want, I've got
You take, have not
Your loss, my gain
We're all the same
You have, I lack
We fade to black
Your move, I take
You win, checkmate

[Chorus]
We're in a game, but we don't know it
Get in control or you're just gonna blow it
Ask him his name, find out where did it come from
I wanna know if he's really God's son
Don't forget to ask him his name
If you knew what I knew, you'd be doing the same
Ambiguity does us no good
I want everything to be understood

[Verse 1]
Down, down, down in your heart
Find, find, find the secret
Turn, turn, turn your head around
Baby we can do it, we can do it tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you believe in love at first sight?
It's an illusion, I don't care
Do you believe I can make you feel better?
Too much confusion, come on over here

[Chorus]
Can we get together?
I really wanna be with you
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you feel the same way too

[Verse 2]
I searched, I searched, I searched my whole life
To find, find, find the secret
All I did was open up my eyes
Baby, we can do it, we can do it all night

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you believe in love at first sight?
It's an illusion, I don't care
Do you believe I can make you feel better?
Too much confusion, come on over here
Come on over

[Chorus]
Can we get together?
I really wanna be with you
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you feel the same way too
Come on over
Can we get together?
I really wanna be with you (Be with you)
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you feel the same way too (Same way too)

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you believe in love at first sight?
It's an illusion, I don't care
Do you believe I can make you feel better?
Too much confusion, come on over here

[Chorus]
Can we get together?
I really wanna be with you (Be with you)
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you feel the same way too (Same way too)
Come on over
Can we get together?
I really wanna be with you (Be with you)
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you feel the same way too (Same way too)
Come on over
Can we get together?
I really wanna be with you (Come on over)
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you feel the same way too (Come on over)
Can we get together?
I really wanna be with you (Come on over)
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you feel the same way too

[Outro]
Too much confusion, come on over here

[Verse 1]
If God is love and love is God
Then why we actin' like it's not?
Everyone's afraid to change
Different doesn't make it strange
Who decides what's right or wrong?
Religion shouldn't separate
Or tell us who we're supposed to hate
We can't deny the way we're made

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, in what
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
The truth is like the air you're breathing
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, what you
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
Never stop, never stop

[Chorus]
If God is love and love is God
No magician sitting in the clouds
Never let us set our rules
Determine what you say or do
Red's the color we all bleed
Let's all agree to disagree
It's in every holy book
Love your neighbor like you should

[Post-Chorus]
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, in what
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
The truth is like the air you're breathing
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, what you
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
Don't you ever stop

[Bridge]
Moses had to lead the people
Couldn't be slaves forever in Egypt
Jesus didn't die for your sins
So you could treat other people like shit
Mohammed heard, give me your call
And have to save the people from falling
All the prophets say the same words
God is love and love should come first

[Outro]
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, in what
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
The truth is like the air you're breathing
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, what you
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
Don't you ever stop

[Verse 1]
Needing, needing
All at once comes the silence
Begging, pleading
No more emotional violence
The withdrawal into pain
The result to never need again
Is this love? I think not
I want out

[Chorus]
This love affair is over
Gone, gone, gone
This love affair is over
Gone, gone, gone
(This love affair) It's so sad
(This love affair) What we had
Gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2]
Bleeding, bleeding
Then comes the recognition
Anger seething
I don't need your permission
And I don't know who you are
And this thing has gone too far
Is this love, I think not
I want out

[Chorus]
This love affair is over
Gone, gone, gone
This love affair is over
Gone, gone, gone
(This love affair) It's so sad
(This love affair) What we had
Gone, gone, gone

[Verse 3]
You're in too deep
You cannot keep
The promises you made
Our happiness was free
The end of love
The end of the dream
Gone, gone, gone

[Bridge]
And I don't know who you are
And this thing has gone too far
Is this love, I think not
I want out

[Chorus]
This love affair is over
Gone, gone, gone
This love affair is over
Gone, gone, gone
(This love affair) It's so sad
(This love affair) What we had
Gone, gone, gone
(This love affair) Gone, gone, gone
This love affair is over
Gone, gone, gone
This love affair is over
Gone, gone, gone
This love affair is over
Gone, gone, gone
This love affair is over
Gone, gone, gone

[Intro]
Yeah yeah
One time
Yeah
Two time
We don't stop
We don't quit
No bluff

[Verse 1: Phi Life Cypher]
You know we shine like the stars in the heavens above
Night and day it's Gorillaz who'll be showing you love
When they read into the track from the dub reggae rap
When it comes to the Gorillaz we got stars in stacks
From the mental to the physical, we're tough and very lyrical
We shine, like the sun performing many miracles
Starshine, this is our time
We combine the design music that be standing on the frontline
The rough neck showing up our respect
Live and direct, we connect with a positive intellect
Starshining, Gorillaz be designing
The maddest and baddest with the music that's masterminded
Dazzling and rhyming with the music that's be defining
Gorillaz Starshine is so bright it's like you be blinded
Shining, me and the rest of Gorillaz stars
Our songs be lastin' past the existency of the last star
Strummin' guitars and flippin' lyrics bizarre
Gorillaz hotter than lava in the centre of the hottest star
The starshine, with the hard rhyme
Magical rhymes that's intertwined with the lines on the hard times

[Hook: 2D]
Starshine, when you gonna find me?
Starshine, they ain't gonna find me
Starshine, when you gonna find me?
Starshine never gonna find me

[Verse 2: Phi Life Cypher]
Supernaturally we travel to intergalactic galaxies
Lighting up the universe
With verses of reality
From Jupiter to Neptune
We flex with the next tunes
Soon back to earth in a rocket, we won't forget you
We're entertaining your brains, we're keeping it real
Our lyrical skills, our spiritual vibe is what you feel
One time, two times, three times
So we shine
Flipping lyrics from our powerful minds
Intertwined with your sanity
We teachin' you reality
I'm rapping rapidly
Linking with people telepathically
My starshine, it's too bright for the blind
Music that's like the best ever treasure that you could find
When I rhyme, it's like you just stick to the gold mine
With music we're allowed to do madness
This 

[...] your spine
'Cuz we rhyme, my lyrics is hypnotising his mind
'Cuz we shine brighter than stars

[...]
Gorilla rap running the track with no rehearsal
Ruling the universe with this universal dispersal
We disperse the rap through informative formats

[...] viciously like African ridgebacks
They get back on the track and react like a bushfire
Gorilla rap tracks are made with burning desire
We strike back
Like the empire
'Cuz lyrically
It's the gorilla dynasty so in the home of life's mysteries
We goin' down in history like dinosaur fossils
The rap 

[...]
It's so big and total colossal
Musically generated and viscerally animated
Gorillaz rule from when the planet was first created
Gorilla rhymes, it's Gorillaz time
Until the next time
We'll just continue to shine
Gorilla rhymes, it's Gorillaz time
Until the next time
We'll just continually shine (shine)
(Yeah yeah)
(One time, one time)
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
(Gorilla time)
(One time)
(Gorilla ryhme)
(Check it out from the mind)

[Hook: 2D]
Starshine, when you gonna find me?
Starshine, they ain't gonna find me
Starshine, when you gonna find me?
Starshine, never gonna find me

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Problem]
Up in this bitch and we all faded
Fuck 'bout a bitch, no we don't save her

Only on Gin and them drugs, I walked in, in the club
About three of them, dawg I'm not kiddin'
When I tell you if you came with your bitch
Then it's the end of my car, push-start the engine
Let's start from the beginning
With a young nigga from the 'Burgh
Smokin' weed, gettin' money, fuck what you heard
Know they hate 'cause I'm flyer than I ever been
High off a medicine
Bitch bad, her ass fat, I'll probably let her in
Ball so fuckin' hard I need a letterman
Know a couple niggas that I'm better than
Pussy, I don't sweat it or the money 'cause I get it
Taylor Gang on top, just remember that I said it
Fuck this nigga bitch, grab my shit, then I jetted

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Problem]
Up in this bitch and we all faded

Baby it's fuck day, who wanna bang?
Even though I had some, right 'fore I came
It's lit though!
Girl you ain't fuckin' what you here for?
Got at least 3 zips rolled, all ready
Wiz brought another jar with him
Gin and drugs got me feelin' like a car hit him
'Round 6 a.m once I hit my DM
Didn't have a rubber so she got to feel this skin
Money stacks stack high, bruh this don't bend
What's up with your friend? Biatch!
Ho, yeah-yeah-yeah
Feeling like Mitch when the light hit him
Married to the money, let the rice hit him

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Problem]
Up in this bitch and we all faded
Fuck 'bout a bitch, no we don't save her
Nothin' to a boss, do my own thing
It's money over hoes, no I'm no stranger

[Intro: Meek Mill]
How I keep from goin' under?
It's like a jungle outside
Sometimes I wonder how I keep from goin' under

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
We scream, "Black Lives Matter," but we still toting ladders
Watching our own brothers trying to get at us
Dreams get shattered when a scene full of crackers
And they charge you with some shit you ain't do
You like, "what happened?"
We go get lawyers to say shit, we don't know how to talk
They told us to hate each other before we learn how to walk
Mama taught you how to fight, fight, before she taught you how to write, right
And daddy locked down in the cell, can't kiss you night, night
Monsters under the bed every night, feel like it's fright night
Coke fumes in the air, mama holding on that pipe tight
And you catchin' contact, but never mind that
In a world where Black is wrong and white right, it's like a combat
We go to war for our freedom, they say we equal
I used to wanna play like Randall and be an Eagle
I used to play the quarterback, my dog would go receiver
That was 'til the ball got flat by a dope needle on the pavement
It's amazin', this environment we was raised in
On them papers, one mistake and I'm gettin' caged in
You gotta feel me, feel like the system tryna kill me
Got arrested and the charges F1 for popping wheelies, stay woke

[Chorus: Miguel]
It was designed for us to fail
We still prevail through the hell
Yeah, can you believe it? We're still undefeated
Though it was designed for us to lose
We'll still make it through, nothing's impossible
Can you believe it? We're still undefeated

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Picture me ten years younger with some tats on my face
Takin' a bunch of Xannys with the strap on my waist
Pointin' it at the camera like mama ain't teach me manners
Tryna see mo' bills like I'm headed to Alabama, no, wait
I can't judge them, I'm just trying to understand them
'Cause I used to pop Percs, pourin' purple in my Fanta
Had me swerving in my Phantom like I'm runnin' from my dreams
I was headed for the slammer, I was plantin' all the seed
For them to bury me, I had my whole family mad at me
Fell deep in love with the game and it married me
Judge said, "I'll give you a chance, just don't embarrass me"
Motivatin' these little niggas is like a charity
Community service even though they knew we was workin'
They did this to me on purpose, 'cause I ain't movin' too perfect
I stay away from them clowns, watch how I move through the circus
'Cause they be weighing you down, even some of them dudes in your circle, stay woke

[Chorus: Miguel]
Though it's designed for us to fail, yeah
We still prevail through the hell, yeah
Can you believe it? We're still undefeated
Though it was designed for us to lose
Nothing, nothing, nothing's impossible, no
Can you believe it? We're still undefeated

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
How can I pledge allegiance to the flag
When they killin' all our sons, all our dads?
I come from a place, when you kill your own brother you can brag
Like he got bodies, but that's a fad, no, that's a fact
I'm screamin' out at your corner, nigga, that's a trap
Screamin' out at your homie, nigga, that's a rat
Catch a case with him, bet he crack
The odds against you and they double stacked, stay woke
Bought my mom a new crib, that's some gangster shit
Niece and nephews walking around wearing minks and shit
Kept the hood motivated, this the thanks I get?
Try to Ja Rule the kid on some Wanksta shit
But that's impossible 'cause I'm unstoppable
The label can't drop me, nigga, I'm too valuable
You thought I would lose but I won and that bothered you
Still movin' 'round in Philly just like the mobsters do
When I talked to Em and Hov, they said, "I'm proud of you
You stood tall back when everyone doubted you"
My reply is, "I did what I gotta do
And I need that verse 'fore you retire too"
Jumping all the obstacles, I'm way too wavy
Said I would lose boy you way too crazy
Pick and choose either fame or the money, fame will make you crazy
And the money will make them bad bitches say, "Thank you, baby"
You're welcome

[Verse 1]
If graffiti on the wall changed anything at all
Then it would be illegal
As the skies go away, what would your body say?
Don't ever hide your feelings

[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh
Don't ever try to take my freedom
Oh, oh, oh
Your imperfections, this world needs them

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you got? Show me your Basquiat
He didn't keep it all to himself
Even with Keith out on the street, he died
Fighting so you can do it as well

[Chorus]
Love is pain and pain is art!
Show me your graffiti heart
Love is pain and pain is art!
Show me your graffiti heart
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, yeah
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Frida showed her feelings, painting from the ceiling
Back in the beginning
Nothing's what it seems, she didn't paint her dreams
Just do her own reality

[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh
Don't ever try to take our freedom
Oh, oh, oh
Your imperfections, this world needs them

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you got? Show me your Basquiat
He didn't keep it all to himself
Even with Keith out on the street, he died
Fighting so you can do it as well

[Chorus]
Love is pain and pain is art!
Show me your graffiti heart
Love is pain and pain is art!
Show me your graffiti heart
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, yeah
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, yeah

[Outro]
If graffiti on the wall changed anything at all
Then it would be illegal

[Verse 1]
I looked all around the world
No one has it better than we do, uh, huh
Uh, huh
One thing I don't understand
Why don't we help more people 'cause we can, uh, huh

[Chorus]
Why are we separated?
I thought that we were related
Why aren't we all united?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting
Why aren't we all together?
Let's end this fight forever
Why are we still divided?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

[Verse 2]
How many tragedies
Will we see before we come together? Uh, huh
It's easy to forget
We have the power to make things better, uh, huh

[Chorus]
Why are we separated?
I thought that we were related
Why aren't we all united?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting
Why aren't we all together?
Let's end this fight forever
Why are we still divided?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

[Bridge]
I have a dream
But dreams are not for free
We all need to change
Or just repeat history
If we were one
Well, it's easier said than done
You can play a part, make a brand new start
Come together, live forever

[Chorus]
Why are we separated?
I thought that we were related
Why aren't we all united?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting
Why aren't we all together?
Let's end this fight forever
Why are we still divided?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
A million miles later
We walked through the valley of the darkest night
We made it through the fire
Scarred and we're bruised, but our hearts will guide us
Together, I know our love's gonna last forever
We're gonna be alright tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what the world throws at us
We'll get back up again
Again

[Chorus]
Hold tight
As long as you're by my side
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
I know we'll find a way
Push to the limit with no end in sight
I know we'll find a way, tonight, hold tight

[Verse 3]
We'll live with no limits
We'll dance in the middle of the freezing rain
With you and I in it
We'll survive the eye of a hurricane
Us together, we gotta make this better
We're gonna be alright, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what the world throws at us
We'll get back up again
Again

[Chorus]
Hold tight
As long as you're by my side

I don't wanna breathe air that you're not breathing
I don't wanna hear if your heart's not beating
If you hurt, then I wanna be the one that's bleeding
It's alright so, so hold on tight

[Chorus]
Hold tight
As long as you're by my side
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
I know we'll find a way
Push to the limit with no end in sight

Hold tight

Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
I know we'll find a way
Push to the limit with no end in sight
I know we'll find a way, tonight
Hold tight

[Verse 1]
A million miles later
We walked through the valley of the darkest night
We made it through the fire
Scarred and we're bruised all over
But if we stick together, I know our love's gonna last forever
Yesterday won't matter
So baby, let me tell you, just...

[Chorus]
Hold tight
As long as you're by my side
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
And if we light this fire
We'll find our way through the darkness
My love will take you higher
Tonight, hold tight
Hold tight

[Verse 2]
We'll live with no limits
We'll dance in the middle of the freezing rain
With you and I in it
Survive the eye of a hurricane
If we stick together, I know our love's gonna last forever
Yesterday won't matter
So baby, let me tell you, just...

[Chorus]
Hold tight
As long as you're by my side
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
And if we light this fire
We'll find our way through the darkness
My love will take you higher
Tonight, hold tight
Hold tight

[Post-Chorus]
Hold tight
Hold tight

[bridge]
If you hurt, then I wanna be the one that's bleeding
If you're breaking down, I wanna be the one you're needing
And if you feel lost, I'm gonna be the one that saves you
Its alright, so hold on tight

[Chorus]
Hold tight
As long as you're by my side
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
And if we light this fire
We'll find our way through the darkness
My love will take you higher
Tonight, hold tight

Hold tight
Oh, woah, oh
Hold tight

Oh, woah, oh

[Chorus]
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

[Verse 1]
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up
I don't know what to do

Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done
I'm hanging up on you
I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day
But it'll be too late

We were bad kids missing inhibitions
Kisses just like superstar collisions
Met you for the first time under black skies
We were running from the trouble
At the right place at the right time

[Pre-Chorus]
Now he was my baby
Every night and day we
Jump on it! Jump on it!
Like a trampoline
This lovin' is amazing, it came from outer space
We jump on it! Jump on it!

You make me so crazy, you make me so lazy
And I will never be alone, never, never be alone
My supernova

[Verse 2]
Cruising through the sky
Yeah, we're shining so bright
Lovin' so hot, burnin' like the sunlight
They say that what we've got is wrong
But we're feeling alright
Walk the world like a warrior, doing just fine

[Pre-Chorus]
Always say you love me, keep on having fun
We jump on it! Jump on it!
Like a trampoline
We're so high above the clouds
Yeah, we never touch the ground
Jump on it! Jump on it!

[Intro: Soulja Boy]
Swag
No instruments

Cash everywhere
Sushi, truck

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Forty million salary, just like the NBA
All white everything like I’m in the KKK
Came with the throwaway, no instruments, I’m swimming
Young Soulja Boy gives a fuck, I keep it pimping
Hate on me, shootin' at my enemies
Ridin' down Ocean Drive and Agoff is with me

[?] 'til it's empty, looking like I’m on it
Everywhere I go, splash cash like I want it
Fuck what you heard, on my turf, that’s the west side
I came out the ground just like the oil
Niggas don’t want that motherfucking turmoil
Five hit your necklace, tell the hoes we’re 

[?]
Ocean Gang 2012, I’m splashh
What the fuck you heard?
Came with that cash, bro, money on my chain, bro
Easy, everywhere is easy
Yellow diamond bezel, make that shit look easy
I’m freezing, I’m frozen, third eye open
Came with the forty clip like I 'posed to
On your sister while my face on the poster
Got swag on my shoulder, that case hits, you’re gone

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Nigga, I'm hustlin', hustlin', grindin', juugin'

Plug it, plug it, it’s nothing, it’s nothing

I don't got to talk about the money 'cause I got it boy
Five star general, Ocean Gang got the money niggas can’t fuck with
Now I’m on some other shit
Cali life, live it, hustle everyday
Do this shit, bitch is pimping
Man, I’m from a whole 'nother motherfuckin' dimension

I'm a maniac, for love, maybe I'm crazy, yeah, I'm crazy, yeah
I guess I'd have to say this album is dedicated to you
Although perhaps you may not be happy
This is what you want, so I've conceded
I hope it makes you happy
There's a lot of truth in it, babe

I don't think I'll have many regrets, baby
Things didn't have to be the way they was, baby
You don't have the right to use the son of mine
To keep me in line
One thing I can't do without
Is the boy whom God gave to both of us
I'm so happy, oh, for the son of mine

So here it is, babe
I hope you enjoy, reminisce, be happy
Think about the kisses and the joy
But there were those other moments too
The times that were cloudy and grey
Bad
But you taught me that was life
May love ever protect you
May peace come into your life
Always think of me the way I was
Ha, I was your baby
This is what you wanted
Here, dear, here it is
Here, my dear, here it is
I met a little girl, sure was fine;
Pretty little thing just about blew my mind
She took me home, and, ahh, made love to me
I knew right then and there, this is where I wanted to be
Most of my life I had been all, all alone
And you're so sweet to me; don't think I'll ever roam
And then one day as time will pass
I had this feeling that our love would last

Nothing could go wrong, and it seemed everything I did
Seemed to please you; all the heartaches you hid
Then one night after we made it, and we were through
That's when I decided I wanted to marry you
Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife;
To love, hold, and cherish, for the rest of your life?
I do, yes I do, I do darlin'
Cause I love you

Nineteen sixty-four
Once you really loved me
Once I really loved you
Nineteen seventy-six
Then time would change you 
As time would really change me
We thought our love would stand the test of time
And, as I sing this song, right now, I wonder today, today
If you're a friend of mine
Cry, cry, cry, I have done some crying
Woman, you have caused my tears to flow
Cry, cry, cried; you cry about me?
Do you think about the kind of love we had?

I told you I'd do the honorable thing
Take care of you and the baby best I could
But times was really hard and I had to try a new way, a new life

Hal, le, hallelujah
Hal, le, lu, I'm free
Hal, le, hallelujah
Hal, le, lu, I'm free

But I wish you happiness and lots of sunshine
And a new life and a new love
Oh, this is my goodbye, baby
God bless you, baby
You know, when you say your marriage vows, they're supposed to be for real. I mean, if you think back about what you really said about honor, loving and obeying till death do us part and all. But it shouldn't be that way, it should, it should, it should be lies because it turns out to be lies. If you don't honor what you said, you lie to God. The words should be changed

Ooh now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again and again and again, and that isn't all
I gave my love to you each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can't make it

Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health's sake
What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won't say those words again
Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you
With all my heart as long as you want me to baby
Ooh if I love again I'm gonna try a new way this time

Memories of the things we did; some we're proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger

Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby?
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me will all of your heart
You'd never take a million dollars to part
I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin' but lies
I really tried, you know how hard I tried
All that rehearsing, baby
We really lied, didn't we baby?
And on top of that you have scandalized, my name

What I can't understand is if you love me
How could you turn me in to the police
Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best I could, you were so divine and your love was like mellow wine

Pains of love, miles of tears, enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years, so break away to the new-day sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend; I'll never be back again
But I'm not really bitter, babe
I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world
Good luck in the world
But I know you'll never be satisfied
No, you still want me standin' by your side

Memories haunt you all the time
I will never leave your mind
Got judgment on your side;
You've said bad things and you've lied
Still I remember some of the good things, baby
Like love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I'll not forget in my life

I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared baby
I'd rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was
To love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight

It don't matter baby
Take a lesson from it all (come on)
I never thought I'd see the day when
You'd put me through what you put me through
You tried your best
You say I gave you no rest

When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?

Please, please
Please let me back in, let me back
Baby, baby
Baby, baby
Baby, babe

[Marvin riffing]
Anger
Anger gets the best of me, baby
Anger
I have lost my head
Anger
Often say a lot of things
Anger
Wish I had not said
Oh, baby

(Anger repeats in the background)
When reason gets beyond control
Things I do for spite (makes me ashamed for my meanness)
Makes me ashamed for my meanness
Help me do things right
Somehow, someday soon I hope and pray
I'll soon reach a wiser age
Learn I'll never profit, baby, oh yeah
For things I do in rage
Anger is a flame when it's flaming hot
It burns to a bitter end
When it cools, I find out much too late
I have lost the love, love friend

I don't know why I ever let you unlock
The devil out of me, babe
Why don't we use love, peace and happiness
'cause we control the key?
God made us for a reason
Oh, let me be what I'm supposed to be

Rage, there's no room for rage in there
There's no room for rage in here
Line up some place to go to be mad
It's a sin to treat your body bad
When anger really gets the best of us
I've really lost my head

Often say a lot of things, oh darlin'
Wish I'd never said
Know it's the truth
When reason gets beyond control
And the things we do spite
Makes me ashamed
For my meanness, sugar, never helps me do things right
Someday soon I hope and pray, oh Jesus
I'll reach that wiser age
Yes, I will
I never learn, I never profit
From things I do in rage
One more time-anger, more anger
When it's flaming hot
Anger burns to the bitter end
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
When it cools I find out too late
I have lost the love, love, love, dear friend
Let's get it

I ain't gonna let you get the best of me, babe
I'm gonna go somewhere and cool
This is not the way my head's supposed to be, babe
Got me feelin' like some silly fool
But I know a real nice place where I can go
And feel the way I'm supposed to feel

I don't want to be mad at nobody
I don't want to be feelin' bad
Up and down my back, in my spine, in my brain
It injures me, baby
Anger, can make you old, yes it can
I said anger will make you sick, children, oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul
Anger
Anger

[Intro: Lil Yachty & Valee]
Huh
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, ayy
Pussy, pussy
(ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney)

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I just talked to Sam
He just told me he stuffed 30 birds inside a ham
Drove it in a ram
Told that bitch to hit my phone when I come back in town
He want smoke online but in person didn't make a sound
Money on his head, shit shine brighter than a crown
24 inch rims got my truck sittin' off the ground
Teryaki bitches, send no swishes, doin' dishes
I just changed the paint on my whip, it look vicious
Shawty in my head, said my hair look like liquorice
Then she saw my smile, said my diamonds is ridiculous
My bitch hate my friends, said they all act so niggerish
But she gon' stick around 'cause I got more green than a Celtic
More green then an Irish, boogers in my bracelet
Look like I just caught a virus, can you dig it like Osiris?
Made a couple million and it only made me childish
Call me Pedi Peter gettin' a pedicure out in Panama
Been backstabbed so much, should've played for Razorbacks out in Arkansas

[Verse 2: Valee]
(ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney)
All-white two door S, that's a Montecarlo
And I got 90 racks stashed at the condo
And I rock Off-White sneakers like Aldo
Police pulled me over, I told 'em, "Ion know"
Black and white two seater, look like piano
Yellowbone live on a 

[?] back in commercial
Hope you don't run up, my nine gon' hurt you
Percocet 15, I took it, I'm dizzy
She choosin', I'm picky, can't fuck if it's fishy
I got a new boo and she yellow like Jiffy
I hit from the side and I leave her, she miss me
Yeezy 700s, I might rock 'em mismatched
Smokin' exotic, it sound like a dispatch
I go to Spondivits to get surf and turf
I don't stay at Four Seasons, I stay at the Trump
Outside the spot, I parked on a speed hump
Watch 'em face up in my flat, got my feet up
She givin' me neck off a Addy, she be up
Cleanin' her face off like she got a bump
I'm in a old school, so my bitch got a rump
I had to restore it, it took 'em two months
I'm steppin' on gas, but not at the pump
I bought her designer, but not from the jump

[Intro]
Hah, go
Marii Beatz, turn me up
Guwop (Hah, Gucci)
It's Gucci (Gucci)
(Gucci, hah)
Dun D-D-D-Deal (Ayy)
Hah

[Chorus]
My bitch came off a boat, boat, boat, boat (Mwah)
I'm never goin' broke, broke, broke, broke (Hah)
It look like we sellin' dope, dope, dope, dope (Wow)
Fur coat on, I'm the goat, goat, goat, goat (Burr, burr, burr)
My foot on niggas' throat, throat, throat, throat (Hah, pussy)
Diamond cross on like the Pope, Pope, Pope, Pope
Jewelry really cold, got me really froze
Like J. Cole, I think my neighbors know I'm sellin' wholes

[Post-Chorus]
Me and the white girl just eloped (Hah)
Same day, my bricks came off the boat, boat, boat, boat
I think I'm Pablo on the low (Pablo)
But free El Chapo he the goat, goat, goat, goat (Chapo)

[Verse 1]
All these similarities (Huh?)
I donate to charity (Yeah)
I'm a good Samaritan (Mmm)
My bitch ain't American (Mwah)
This is not a parody (No)
Gold dope, that's a rarity (Gold)
Gucci Mane's a murderer, you sure you wanna marry him?
Big rock clarity, your jewelry's embarrassing (Hah)
LIV on a Sunday 'cause the load came Saturday
They call me Runway, I'm wearin' it
Skip da Flip', I'm havin' it
I'm Rich the Kid, I'm dabbin' it
And fuck your clique, we darin' it (Fuck 'em)

[Chorus]
My bitch came off a boat, boat, boat, boat (Mwah)
I'm never goin' broke, broke, broke, broke (Hah)
It look like we sellin' dope, dope, dope, dope (Wow)
Fur coat on, I'm the goat, goat, goat, goat (Burr, burr, burr)
My foot on niggas' throat, throat, throat, throat (Hah, pussy)
Diamond cross on like the Pope, Pope, Pope, Pope
Jewelry really cold, got me really froze (It's Gucci)
Like J. Cole, I think my neighbors know I'm sellin' wholes

[Post-Chorus]
My plug from Mexico-co-co-co (Gato)
But all my folks on Gresham Road, Road, Road, Road (Gato)
Bouldercrest and Candler Road, Road, Road, Road (Gato)
I had them bricks right by Flat Shoals, everybody know

[Verse 2]
He's a huge music exec, never been exposed (Whoa)
Sold that boy a brick, like to treat his nose
Gettin' skinny as a stick, like to treat her nose (Mwah)
Let her snort it on my dick 'cause I'm really gross
All these lights, all these lamps, points, they really glow (Whoa)
Want one-quarter mill' a verse, I'm like "Really, bro?" (Hah)
Gave my bitch five million dollars, hold it, hold it, ho (Mwah)
All these snitches gettin' exposed 'cause they really hoes

[Chorus]
My bitch came off a boat, boat, boat, boat (Mwah)
I'm never goin' broke, broke, broke, broke (Hah)
It look like we sellin' dope, dope, dope, dope (Wow)
Fur coat on, I'm the goat, goat, goat, goat (Burr, burr, burr)
My foot on niggas' throat, throat, throat, throat (Hah, pussy)
Diamond cross on like the Pope, Pope, Pope, Pope
Jewelry really cold, got me really froze
Like J. Cole, I think my neighbors know I'm sellin' wholes

[Verse 1]
I came here without a choice
I'm sorry I could never thank you
For saving me more trouble
I didn't want any trouble
If you were given one more chance
Would you bring me back to life?
Bring me back into the light
Into the light

[Pre-Chorus]
But let it shine on, let it shine on us

[Chorus]
And if I say I love you, well then I love you
And if I say I love you, well then I love you

[Verse 2]
The innocence in your face bled out without a trace
You've won without an enemy, you're ill without a remedy
As night bleeds into night, and I know I came off better than you
It doesn't mean that I feel better
It doesn't mean that I feel better

[Pre-Chorus]
And let it shine on, let it shine on us

[Chorus]
And if I say I love you, well then I love you
And if I say I love you, well then I love you
And if I say I love you, well then I love you
And if I say I love you, well then I love you

[Bridge]
Show me your hands
Are they cleaner than mine?
Show me your face
Did you cross the line?
Show me your eyes
They any drier than mine?
Your soul survives
But peace, you'll never find

[Chorus]
And if I say I love you, well, then I love you
And if I say I love you, well, then I love you
And if I say I love you, well, then I love you
And if I say I love you, well, then I love you

[Verse 1]
I know I've had you troubled
And I know I've seared your mind
But you know that I love you
And that our love's not blind
And sure my dreams lie with you
But I've many more besides
And if I can't see them through
Our love will slowly die

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you doubt for the time that you're spending
And if you doubt for the love in your heart
Think of London and the girl you're returning
And the days you defend will turn to gold

[Chorus]
So love with your eyes
Love with your mind
Love with your—dare I say forever
Do it for yourself
Do it for the girl
Do it for your—dare I say forever

[Verse 2]
And I've known pious women
Who have led such secret lives
Shameless in the dark, so shameful in the light
And you may not be pious and I may not be saved
But we could live quite happily and quietly unfazed

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you doubt for the time that you're spending
And if you doubt for the love in your heart
Think of London and the girl you're returning
And the days you defend will turn to gold

[Chorus]
So love with your eyes
Love with your mind
Love with your—dare I say forever
Do it for yourself
Do it for the girl
Do it for your—dare I say forever

[Break]
I was dreaming of the Liffey
I was thinking of the Thames
And now the East River flows by to the same end
Are we too sentimental to not look back and stare?

[Chorus]
So love with your eyes
Love with your mind
Love with your—dare I say forever
Do it for yourself
Do it for the girl
Do it for your—dare I say forever

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator & Jacquees]

Ooh, mm, mhm
Yeah
OG Parker

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator & Jacquees]
What's the dealio? Ain't gon' lie, I'm feelin' you
You got me on tippy-toe, so who's Oliv, who's Elio?
It don't matter, negative niggas gon' say, this don't add up
But fuck they math up, shit, we subtract 'em
Ayo, tell me what's the prolo, I just pop models
Boys or girls these days, shit, it don't matter
We can fuck Sunday 'cause I don't read Bibles
But I'm faithful to this money and these Céline goggles
I don't pop bottles, I just cop automobiles full throttle
New engine can't follow, get a jet to Lake Como
We can try some new gelato, shawty, I'm for real
Like my role model, hm
So let's—
Shawty, I listen
Unlike my father, I can give you attention (Ayy!)
You won't feel empty like pocket that lint in
So pack a few bags I got space in my mansions (Plural)
Hurry with decision
'Cause I'm looking for a parrot and you looking like a pigeon
Better That's So Raven and get another vision
If you wanna be my newest edition like Bivins, woah

[Chorus: Jaquees]
Feel like you need some validation (Yeah, yeah)
I got a plan 'cause you're more than that
No better situation, girl
No, no,  girl you all for that, and I 'magine that
Feel like you need some validation
While I'm grippin' your waist, we move to your pace
No better situation (come on)
Girl, I'll be your escape, come and swing my way

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Jacquees]
You think niggas full of lies
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Golf Wang, Golf shit man
Shout-out Jacquees
Switch it up, pick my car up in, in a hour
This view is beautiful

[Intro]
Hey!
Mmh, yeah
Ooh-ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Why should I go and settle for glitter
When I could shine like gold?
Why should I wait around and just sit here
When I could save my soul?

[Pre-Chorus]
So tonight
I'mma breathe you in 'til I'm high
I'mma lose myself to the light
'Til I'm seeing stars in my eyes
I, I

[Chorus]
I do, I do what I like
Let's go have some fun tonight

But you can bet I'll try it twice
Hold my hand, it's alright
We'll be good for tonight
'Cause we're high and we're wild and we're free
Hold my hand, it's alright
We'll be good for tonight
'Cause we're high and we're wild and we're free
Hey!

[Verse 2]
I know it all could be gone in a minute
I wanna live out loud, no, no, no
I gotta get what I want when I want it
And you can't hold me down

[Pre-Chorus]
So tonight
I'mma breathe you in 'til I'm high
I'mma lose myself to the light
'Til I'm seeing stars in my eyes

Maybe twice if I like it (just, just, just wanna have fun)
'Cause I wanna have fun
Yeah, whatever the price is (just, just, just wanna have fun)
I'll try anything once
Maybe twice if I like it (hey)
Just wanna have fun (do what I want, when I want, when I want it)
When it comes to my vices

Oh my God, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed

When you read my mind, get down and discover me
I'm an open door, let you come inside of me
Want to put my hands around your neck
Gonna take you to a place that you will not forget

[Chorus]
Sex, what you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh my God, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed
You got a bad attitude, I like to grind it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want, baby
Oh my God

[Verse 2]
Oh my God, let me clean your wound
I can be your nurse, got the antidote
Please show me where it hurts
Can you be my father? Tell me what to do
You can punish me and maybe I will punish you

[Chorus]
Sex, what you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh my God, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed
You got a bad attitude, I like to grind it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want, baby
Oh my God (God, God, God)

[Bridge]
There's no shame in feeling
As long as it feels right (oh my God)
Our love, this is natural
There's nothing wrong with, nothing wrong with

[Chorus]
Sex, what you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh my God, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed
You got a bad attitude, I like to grind it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want, baby
Oh my God

[Outro]
What you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex

[Verse 1]
How can I be sure you're telling me the truth?
In this house of games, you never you show your cards
You claim madness, it's become convenient
I don't wanna hear your angry words again

[Pre-Chorus]
You hear voices taunting you to leave me
Then you're sorry you hold me in your arms
You have demons, nothing can control them
Who can blame you if you're not in charge?

[Chorus]
Is this love? I think not
I wanna get off this merry-go-round
History will repeat itself
And I won't let you take me down

[Verse 2]
Treat me like a curse then tell me I'm your saviour
I'm living with the stranger I used to know so well
Waiting for your answer is a kind of torture
Could I grow accustomed to this kind of hell?

[Pre-Chorus]
You hear voices taunting you to leave me
Then you're sorry you hold me in your arms
You have demons, nothing can control them
Who can blame you if you're not in charge?

[Chorus]
Is this life? I think not
I wanna get off this merry-go-round
History will complete itself
And I won't let you take me down
I'd like to get to know you
You could warm up your hands on my heart
I've got so much to show you
But for now it's just Bon d' Accord

[Verse 1]
It's alright to be unright
It's alright to be unright
It's so cool to be uncool
It's so right to be unright
It's so good to look so bad
Isn't this the best thing you ever had?

[Verse 2]
Save your soul, little sister
Save your soul, dear little brother
You need hope, says the preacher
Learn to cope, says all my teachers

[Verse 3]
Do you really know God's intention
Do you ever ask what it's all for
We need love, love and love
We need more, more and more

[Chorus]
It's so right to be unright
Isn't this the best thing you ever had?
It's so cool to be uncool
It's so right to be unright

Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
You look familiar
You wanna dance?
Yeah

[Chorus]
Come join the party
Yeah
Let's get this started
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I think you wanna come over
Yeah, I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk? Are you sober?
Think about it, doesn't matter
And if it makes you feel good, then I say do it
I don't know what you're waiting for

[Verse 2]
Boy, you got a reputation
But you’re gonna have to prove it
I see a little hesitation, am I gonna have to show you
That if it feels right, get on your mark
Step to the beat boy, that's what it's for

[Pre-Chorus]
Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot we can go outside
But for now just come here, let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance of life

[Chorus]
Come join the party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

Let’s get it started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

[Verse 1]
It's so hard to be someone
It's so hard to be unknown
In your heart, you are to blame
In your heart, you play the game

Do you realize you pay the price?
Do you know the cost of all your vice?
Save your soul, it's all a test

[Intro]
Skrt.. skrt... Soulja! Yeah.Soulja..Soulja Stacks on Deck! Money Gang!

[Chorus]
Ice, ice, water shining, diamond VVS, blinding
Play with that pack and you finding
Pull up with water, ice on me shining
I might just hop out the Tesla
Drip, drip, all on me flex
Hundred K on my necklace
Pull up with water, ice, young nigga be flexin'

[Verse 1]
Walk in I step in the VIP
Young nigga drip, I got that thang on my hip
Young nigga empty the clip
Stay with a bad bitch you know she gon' strip
Walkin' around with a 50, I show you no pity
Young nigga I swerve through the city
I keep a draco and you know it's extended
I scrape the Ferrari, I push to the limit
Big backwood,(ugh!) big backwood got cookie in it
Ridin' two door, drop-top in the Continental
Slidin' in the Porsche and it got a lot of money it
Might cop the new Rari, might cop the new Bentley
Might VVS flood my neck and the whole city
Standin' in the trap tryna stack up a million
For M&M's I throw my wrist in the skillet

[Chorus]
Ice, ice, water shining, diamond VVS, blinding
Play with that pack and you finding
Pull up with water, ice on me shining
I might just hop out the Tesla
Drip, drip, all on me flex
Hundred K on my necklace
Pull up with water, ice, young nigga be flexin'

[Verse 2]
Hundred K all on my necklace
Call on my cellular, I get a brick on the regular
The way that I flex on niggas it's irregular
Hop out the coupe, etc.. etc...
Gucci my shoes, Balmain on my jeans
I'm that young nigga, made Xan With That Lean
We take your bitch then we play tag-team
Walk in the mall with a 50, buy everything
Took your bitch, we out to Celine
I just be rockin' the Robin Jeans
I play with nine and the beam
I pull with in Bentley's, skrrt, I'm murkin' the scene
Pull with cash, me and the team
I'mma go VVS everything
She said that she feel like that she in a dream
I'm the young richest nigga she done seen
My money stand tall, Yao Ming
Pack touched down, I had to leave the scene
Run up on Soulja, get shot like a sling
Play with that money like nigga what you mean
A hundred K on me, nigga you know that's no thing
I play with the racks and the straps with a beam
Stay in the city serving pints of lean
Pull up straight drop, nigga that heat

[Chorus]
Ice, ice, water shining, diamond VVS, blinding
Play with that pack and you finding
Pull up with water, ice on me shining
I might just hop out the Tesla
Drip, drip, all on me flex
Hundred K on my necklace
Pull up with water, ice, young nigga be flexin'

Living for love, living for love, living for love, living for love
Living for love, living for love, living for love, living for love

[Verse 1: Madonna]
First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong
I let down my guard
I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was
I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees
Alone in the dark
I was blind to your game
You fired a shot in my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Took me to heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

[Chorus: Madonna]
Living for love
Living for love
I'm not giving up
I'm gonna carry on

[Drop]
Oh love, love, love, love

[Verse 2: Madonna]
I could get caught up in bitterness
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best, and it's not you
I've picked up my crown
Put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Took me to heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

I think it's almost 4 AM but baby I'm still feeling just fine
Don't think that I can feel my legs 'cause baby I've been tripping all night, yeah
I might've kissed a thousand lips but maybe that's just all in my mind
Some people never understand the way we live but we're living life

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh huh, hey, uh huh, Monday to Sunday, it's never too late
So everyone say, "We don't wanna stop!"

'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna keep it goin'

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're all in love
We're all in love

[Verse 2]
I'm hangin' on my best friend's couch and my clothes are all on the floor
Mascara runnin' rogue again, I got the heroin chic look on, yeah

[Verse]
Yeah, mama, yeah, mama, I'm daddy, no, I'm not
You're a lot of fucking problems, you gon’ prolly show true colors
By the time we tie the knot up, Tyler, Tyler, he got caught up
Now they taking my ricotta, bunch of lawyers and ‘your honors’
I mean, no mama, more father but my fanbase that's from Goblin
Don't believe me, I been saying since '13 but they blinded
But whatever, I'm reminded that I slightly got off topic of this song, shit
Shout out Prophet, okay
Could you tell me how far in the future do you see us?
You can make decisions while your lips graze on my peach fuzz
Pull out the guitar and learn some new chords from Anita Baker
Baker got some acres out the window when you wake up
I'm a fish sign, my b-day March and put it's knee up
Bunch of yes sergeants 'til we barge in on them tea cups
But guarantee that I will get my stripes just like Adidas
Nah, we don't wear those, it's UNOs when we put feet up, yeah

[Chorus]
You said keep it short, this is peach fuzz
Contact, couple months, then we out
You said keep it short, this is peach fuzz
Contact, couple months, then we out
It's nothing serious (I wanna be your man)
It's nothing serious baby (I wanna be your man)

[Outro]
Yo, shout out Stones Throw man
Shout out Prophet
Album's beautiful
Summer flings and shit
It's nothing serious, just, you know

[Chorus 1]
There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Then the power of good-bye

[Verse 1]
Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no
Walk away

[Verse 2]
You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress, you had to burn
Pain is a warning that something's wrong
I pray to God that it won't be long
Walk away

[Chorus 1]
There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Then the power of good-bye

[Verse 1]
Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no
Walk away

[Chorus 1]
There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Then the power of good-bye

[Chorus 2]
There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Then the power of good-bye
Good-bye

[Interlude]
Learn to say good-bye
I yearn to say good-bye

[Chorus 1]
There's nothing left to try
There's no more places left to hide
There's no greater power
Then the power of good-bye

[Chorus 2]
There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye
Good-bye

[Outro]
God help me
Learn to say good-bye
Please give me the power of good-bye

[Intro]
Rebel heart
Rebel heart

[Verse 1]
I lived my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say
"Told you so, told you so
Why can't you be like the other girls?"
I said, "Oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever be"
Thought I belonged to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said, "Oh no, I want more
That's not what I'm looking for"

[Chorus]
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart

[Interlude]
Rebel heart
Of my rebel heart
Rebel heart

[Verse 2]
I spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say
"Look at you, look at you!"
Trying to be so provocative
I said, "Oh yeah, that was me"
All the things I did just to be seen
Outgrown my past and I've shed my skin
Letting it go and I'll start again, start again
Never look back, it's a waste of time
I said, "Oh yeah, this is me
And I'm right here where I wanna be"
I said, "Hell yeah, this is me
Right where I'm supposed to be"

[Chorus]
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in my rebel heart
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart

[Outro]
Rebel heart
(Of my rebel heart)
Rebel heart
(Of my rebel heart)
Rebel heart
(Of my rebel heart)
Rebel heart

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Seemed like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin' to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the lower east side
I threw my tag around, let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became the news

[Chorus: Madonna]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

[Verse 2: Madonna]
I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say a little prayer
Had me crucified, you know I had to take you there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life

[Chorus]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

[Bridge]
I conquered
Conquered
Conquered

[Chorus]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

[Verse 1]
C'mon boy
I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll
I want somebody to speed it up for me
Then take it down slow
There's enough room for both

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word, and I'mma give you what you want

[Chorus: Madonna]
Time is waiting
No hesitating
Grab a boy
Time is waiting
No hesitating

[Post-Chorus]
Uh, you gotta get in line, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
Uh, you gotta get in line, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think what I need is a "you" intervention, yeah
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word, and I'mma give you what you want

[Chorus]
Time is waiting
No hesitating
Grab a boy
Time is waiting
No hesitating

[Post-Chorus]
Uh, you gotta get in line, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
Uh, you gotta get in line, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)

Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up

(Uh)

[Verse 1]
I like when I'm faded, I'm so innovative
Eatin' pussy at my dinner table, I been gettin' it catered
Get the yayo, got me spendin' pesos, Benjamin tornado
Count my blessings, this is what we pray for, everyone ain't able
Drop her heart, just like a hot potato, I'm a sado
She think she lit, I am fuego, keep that BS in her a-hole
'Cause I say so, and my bando, we just lay low
Rub my back, ask how my day go
I say I been on my J-O, she say, "Bae no"
Say no mo', cause she go low, bless my woe-woe
I say "uh-oh," she start slow-mo
Once that coco start her mojo
She gon' go-go
She gon' deep throat 'til it's sore throat
She go deep sleep, I go NoDoz
Said "I love you," watch my nose grow
Once that dope go, she go bozo
Girl, I'm gone

[Chorus]
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby

I like when I'm faded (Gone)

[Verse 2]
So outta here, keep that shit over there
Where do we go from here
Come to the end of the road
Can't get the road repaired
I am on Mars with a bitch in her underwear
She take 'em off and then come back to Earth
In a hundred years, you niggas Gummy Bears
Rest in peace Rabbit
I got the Lamborghini doors up like some bunny ears (Ahh)
Bitch, best not jump in here
Bitch, best not run in here talkin' crazy
Get her walkin' papers
See these married niggas makin' it hard for players
But, see, the hardest players is too hard to play
I give her dick and a couple ultimatums
A cup of Bumbu and a cup of coffee later
She do all the drugs, she do all the favors
So we fuck now and we argue later
Dick runnin' like an alternator
I don't separate 'em, I just alternate 'em
I got all the flavors, sit back enjoy the fruit of our labors
You gon' tan that applebottom, it's gon' be orange later
So I fucked the girl, wrote my number down
On the morning paper, set it on the table
Told her, "I'll be back" - Schwarzenegger
Lil' mama, I'm gone (Gone)

[Chorus]
Hasta la vista, baby (Yah)
Hasta la vista, baby (Yah)
Hasta la vista, baby (Hasta la vista)
Hasta la vista, baby (Yah)
I tell you I love you, baby (I tell you I love you)

You took my words and made a trap for silly fools
You held me down and tried to make me break
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)

[Pre-Chorus]
Did I say something true?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex

Don't you hate when society trouble you
Fuck up your TRW
When your lights get cut off
Gas get shut off
Plus you at work, workin yo butt off
You come home, pick up the phone
Don't hear the dial tone, something's wrong
Your girl come home hair done money spent
But baby, where's your half of the rent?
She start makin promises
But you already know how broke she is
You do the budget and you wanna kick her ass dude
Spent too much money on fast food
Now ya smoke that doja
House bout to go in foreclosure
Got so many bills in the mail box
It make you wanna dip sticks plus sell rocks
Late notice, final notice
You owe that, you owe this
You get pissed and start drinking cause you're tired of the drama
Wish you was at home, livin with your mamma
But you can't, you're full grown
And you gotta survive on ya own
Sometimes I wanna put the gat to my face (Why?)

Don't you hate when you go on an interview
And society likes what they see in you
You get so excited cause you got hired
Later on that day, you got fired
Even though you a thug tryin to do yo best
You still didn't pass yo drug test
Now you sittin at the house unemployed
Lookin at the bills gettin paranoid
So you grab your keys, get in your car
Hit the welfare office for some quick GR
Can you make it on food stamps? (Nope)
Now you need to sell a little (Dope)
If you made fast money that'd be on hip
But look at the people that you're dealin with
Gangbangers, cluckheads, backstabbers, cutthroats
You bought a quarter piece but the shit look short
It's bad enough a brother gotta sell crack
Break it down and you barely make your profit back
Sell ya nickles for dimes and ya dimes for dubs
But the baseheads don't show no damn love
Cause the esés slangin rocks down two doors
And they got rocks way bigger than yours
So what the hell is you talkin bout?
You give a price and the baseheads walkin out
Every night you argue with your spouse
Cause she don't want the cops to raid the house
You can't make love to the girl no more
Cause all night you got people bangin on the door
(Afro) Yo dreams you not achievin
Yo baby mamma talkin bout she leaving
You thought she was playin but she packed and left
You thinkin bout smokin that crack yaself

I really need to get my dollar bills on (Get em on)
Man forget a damn zone I need a bird (Need a bird)

This bitch ain't got no teeth in the front
She couldn't dance with me a minute ago

That ain't no perm that's a temporary
Nigga still need to cut that shit out grow yo natural
Make a rap tape like me
Bitch need to be the Afrowoman
Or some God damn body while you bullshittin
I'm just playin can I get yo number?

[Verse 1]
Visions, cold like cold glass
Visions, a bare light for your apartment
Your windows open right over the street
But you say you don't mind
And the night sounds help you sleep

In your dreams you go wild
In your dreams you go wild
In your dreams you go wild
In your dreams you go wild
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wild, wild, wild, wild
Go wild

[Verse 2]
Visions, cold air crystallizing (crystallize, crystallizing)
Visions, there are no lights in her apartment
Winter came and wrapped the town in sheets (nighttime)
But your kiss is warm and your touch turns me to pieces

[Alternate Chorus]
You make me go wild
You make me go wild
You make me go wild
You make me go wild

[Outro]
And I feel you present
I feel you holding

All of this disorder, no addressin'
The crown is broken in pieces, but there's more in my possession
There's a whole lot in my possession
Who do you really love? Well, that's sure to be in question
My Mount Rushmore is me with four different expressions
Who's givin' out this much return on investment?
After my run, man, how is that even a question?
After this summer, man, how is that even a—
I've had real Philly niggas try to write my endin'
Takin' shots with the GOAT and talked about shots that we sendin'
I've had scuffles with bad boys that wasn't pretendin'
I've had too many nights to mention, that's just the beginnin'
I'm pretty sure we got a label, I'm still independent
I fell back a hundred times when I don't get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times, I know where it's headed
Realize someone gotta die when no one'll dead it
Niggas gamblin' with they life for some content
That's the type of lottery that could get your top picked
I am a cream-of-the-crop nigga
You niggas pop mollies, my 'Malis pop niggas
House on both coasts, but I live on the charts
I have tea with the stars and I swim with the sharks
And I see in the dark, wasn't this cold at the start
Think my soul has been marked, there's a hole in my heart
Yeah, I was about to— Man, I thought about it
It's unsettlin' to talk about it
Free all of my niggas that they caught with it
RIP my niggas that they caught without it
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself
This is God's plan, young man, you said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
Daddy got suits like Bernie Mac, he dresses himself
I stopped askin' myself and I started feelin' myself
Now I gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself
I ain't even have to cut the tie, it severed itself
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself

[Intro: Lil Juice]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I just flipped a switch (Flipped, flipped)
I don't know nobody else that's doin' this
Bodies start to drop, ayy (Hit the floor)
Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, ayy
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot, ayy
Give me my respect (Give me my respect)
I just took it left like I'm ambidex'
Bitch, I move through London with the Eurostep (Two)
Got a sneaker deal and I ain't break a sweat
Catch me 'cause I'm gone (Outta there, I’m gone)
How I go from 6 to 23 like I'm LeBron?
Servin' up a pack (Servin' up a pack)
Niggas pullin' gimmicks 'cause they scared to rap, ayy
Funny how they shook, ayy, got these niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself, take a look, ayy
I'm a bar spitta, I’m a hard hitta
Yeah I’m light-skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm an unforgivin' wild-ass dog nigga
Somethin' wrong with 'em, got 'em all bitter
I'm a bill printer, I'm a gravedigger
Yeah, I am what I am
I don't have no time for no misunderstandings again

[Chorus: Mack Daddy Ju & Drake]
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
From smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is–

[Verse 2: Drake]
Future took the business and ran it for me
I let Ollie take the owl, told him brand it for me
I get 2 million a pop and that’s standard for me
Like I went blind, dog, you gotta hand it to me
(Gotta gimme that shit, dog)
Prayed, then I prayed again (Amen, Lord)
Had a moment but it came and went
(They don't love you no more)
You don’t wanna play with him (Nah, nah, nah)
They’ll be mournin' you like 8AM (R.I.P.)
Pinky ring 'til I get a wedding ring (Whoa, yeah)
Love my brothers, cut 'em in on anything (Big slice)
And you know it's King Slime Drizzy, damn (Woo yeah)
She just said I'm bae, I hit the thizzle dance (Mac Dre shit)
Either hand is the upper hand (Oh yeah, shit)
Got a bubba on my other hand (Whoa, yeah, shit, yeah)
This shit ain't no hundred bands (Nah, nah, nah, nah)
Palace look like Buckingham
Bills so big, I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real
I can’t go in public like civilian, for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents
Niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got and, man, it's hard to be content
Fuck what they got goin' on, I gotta represent (Ayy!)

[Chorus: Mack Daddy Ju & Drake]
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
From smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You've got me feeling emotions
Ayy, higher
Ah
You've got me fe–
You, oh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is "Leave me alone"
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, "Why let the story run if it's false?"
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy
Higher, higher
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy
Higher, higher

[Intro: Drake]
Too rich for who? Y'all just got rich again
Who grips the mic and likes to kill they friends?
I've never been the type to make amends
If shit was at a eight, we like to, we like to, we like to—
Yeah, if shit was at a eight, we like to make it ten
1da sent this in, I'm goin' up all the way
I don't like to talk when there's nothin' else left to say (True)

[Chorus: Drake]
Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your sister is pressin' play, your trainer is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey— (True)

[Verse 1: Drake]
I gotta breathe real deep when I catch an attitude
I got a whole 'nother level that I can tap into
Max said they only blessed when they attached to you
The only deadbeats is whatever beats I been rappin' to (True)
And the product is still the best though
It's only good in my city because I said so
Just to fit the estate man, I had to Copperfield like presto
Voilà, tada (True)

[Bridge: Drake]
Never a matter of "could I?" or "should I?"
Kiss my son on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I—

[Verse 2: Drake]
Miss makin' 'em pay
Helipad from Will Smith crib straight to the stage
Three Forum shows but I played Staples today
The neighborhood is smokey, y'all stay safe in this place (True)

[Chorus: Drake]
Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your niggas is pressin' play, your nanny is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey— (True)

[Verse 3: Drake]
Had to go and hit reset, now we here
I been on top for three sets of three years
I can't be around the niggas you minglin' with
I can't fly if I could sit on the wing of that shit (True)
I try to pay it less mind
They been keepin' tabs on me like I'm payin' next time
I think I sense a little fear from the other side
White vans parked across the street, real subtle guys (True)

[Bridge: Drake]
Yeah, never a matter of "could I?" or "should I?"
Kiss my mom on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I—

[Outro: Plies]
Hahaha, I can't argue with you, no! You mad!
Look at you, you mad! You big mad! Haheheh
I'm happy! Leave me alone!
I just want some money, a lot of money
I don't get paid to argue with you
No! Who is you? You ain't nobody!
You mad

[Intro: Static Major]
Haha, haha
Yeah, ayy (After dark)

[Chorus: Drake, Static Major & Both]
In the whip solo
No one's gotta know (After dark)
Knockin' at your door
I don't gotta work anymore (After dark)
You can
Put your phone down, you're gonna need two hands (After dark)
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

[Verse 1: Drake & Static Major]
Late night like Left Eye, I'm creepin'
Assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls
'Cause you've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So, I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
That narrative for me isn't changin'
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way (After dark)

[Chorus: Drake, Static Major, Ty Dolla $ign, Drake & Static]
In the whip solo, no one's gotta know
(No one's gotta know) after dark
Knockin' at your door, I don’t gotta work anymore
(I don't gotta work no more) after dark
You can, put your phone down, you’re gonna need two hands
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah) after dark
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Late night, me and you, got you wet like the pool
Then I'm tryna dive in, put some time in, yeah
Get the vibe right, get your mind right
It's gon' be a long night (Ooh yeah)
Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, "Fuck these niggas," rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, "Do anything, but just don't lie to me"
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the show then we got ghost
And when it's after dark anything goes

[Chorus: Drake, Static Major, Ty Dolla $ign, Drake & Static]
In the whip solo, no one's gotta know
(No one's gotta know) after dark
Knockin' at your door, I don’t gotta work anymore
(I don't gotta work no more) after dark
You can, put your phone down, you’re gonna need two hands
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah) after dark
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

My bitch in Chanel now
Your bitch in Escada (Sick, sick, sick, sick)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, and they shook
Please don't let them fool ya, I don't care how they look (Nah)
Heard all of the talkin', now it's quiet, now it's shush (Shh)
Twenty-nine is comin', they on edge when I cook (Cook)
Lead the league in scorin', man, but look at my assists (Shh)
Yes I be with Future but I like to reminisce (Yeah)
I do not forget a thing, I'm patient, it's a gift (yeah)
Try to tell 'em they ain't got to do it, they insist (they insist)
Yeah, I can tell
I just gave 'em two for forty million like Chappelle (Two)
Standin' over coffin with a hammer and a nail (Two)
Heard you hit up so and so, that name don't ring a bell, nah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sick of these niggas (Sick)
Hire some help, get rid of these niggas
I'm sick of this shit (Sick, sick)
I'm runnin' a blitz (Ayy)
Whatever you did (Ayy), it is what it is

[Chorus]
And I'm so tired (Tired)
I fuck with the mob and I got ties (Lotta ties, lotta ties)
Knock you off to pay their tithes (Do doo)
They want me gone but don't know why
It's too late for all that lovey-dovey shit
I'm your brother shit, all that other shit
It's too late for all that
It's too late for all that, ayy
It's too late for all that lovey-dovey shit
I'm your brother shit, all that other shit
It's too late for all that, ayy
It's too late for all that

[Intro: Drake]

[knocking on the door]
Ayy, nigga, get the-
DJ Paul
TWhy
Ayy, ayy
Lot of 6's in here tonight
Yeah, yeah, ayy
(Dopeman!)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ten of us, we movin' as one
I'm so proud of who I've become
You might think I've taken some lumps
Only if we talkin' 'bout sums (Yeah)
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This isn't that, can't be ignorin' the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the max
They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skippin' through that
If I get it trippin', it's no comin' back
I don't understand, these niggas gotta adapt
You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent
I promise it fell in my lap
My money is young, my problems are old
I promise I'm bridgin' the gap

[Chorus: Drake]
Woo! You know what I'm sayin'?
Woo! Ayy, ayy
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
(Gyeah, gyeah, gyeah, gyeah!)

[Refrain: Drake]
Niggas provoke, this shit ain't a joke, man, nobody playin'
He's at the top and he's at the top, but nobody stayin'
These niggas around but they ain't around
You know what I'm sayin'?
Say that they down, when they shit is down
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Yo, get close enough to HOV, smell like a kilo still (Still)
First album 26, I ain't need no deal (Real)
Already a hood legend, I ain't need no Shyne (Woo!)
First Rollie flooded out, I ain't see no time, woah
Stand-up niggas, we only duckin' indictments
Dope boys, Off-White, lookin' like soft white on 'em
Heh, you know what I'm sayin'?
We in the buildin', we came for a billion, ain't nobody playin'
Live every word that I'm rappin'
Say I lost 90 bricks and it happened
You probably wouldn't believe
Everything that you seein' right now if it wasn't live action
I ain't on the 'Gram, they record who I am
God to these dope boys, how do you not be a HOV fan?
I'm what Meech shoulda been
I'm what Supreme didn't become
If Alpo didn't snitch, niggas'd be like Young
I got your President tweetin', I won't even meet with him
Y'all killed X and let Zimmerman live, shhh, s-streets is done

[Chorus: Drake]
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?
(Gyeah, gyeah, gyeah, gyeah!)

[Refrain: Drake]
Niggas provoke, this shit ain't a joke, man, nobody playin'
He's at the top and he's at the top, but nobody stayin'
These niggas around but they ain't around
You know what I'm sayin'?
Say that they down, when they shit is down
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Pre-Chorus]
I think you're changing your mind
Starting to see it in your eyes
I used to love a good surprise
And now, I'd rather know ahead of time

[Chorus]
You said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they can't see
You liking someone just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like…?

[Pre-Chorus]
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusin' me
Don't have me wastin' my time

[Chorus]
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl
Summer just started, and we're already done

[Verse 2]
I kept it decent
I kept you sane, I kept it peaceful, don't lie
I kept it decent
Even the secrets, kept it between you and I

[Bridge]
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart
Breakin' me down when I'm already down
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart
Breakin' me down when I'm already down
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea

[Chorus]
You said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl
Summer just started, and we're already done

[Pre-Chorus]
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my time

[Chorus]
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl
Summer just started, and we're already done

[Intro]
Ayo, blast that shit, Maxx
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Ayy

[Verse 1]
UberX to Hidden Hills
Give me somethin' I can feel
If they come to Hidden Hills
Then I know they know the deal
We just right there up the road
You could hit it with a stone
I be out here on my own
I'm just tryna set the tone
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
Niggas think they run the town
'Til we run 'em out of town
And they gotta relocate
Gotta dip from where they stay
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

[Chorus]
Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke

[Interlude]
Ayo, blast that shit, Maxx
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Back and forth to Italy
My comment section killin' me
I swear I get so passionate
Y'all do not know the half of it
I grew up with the Reps Up boys, we crashin' it and splashin' in
And when I say they crashin' it, I do not mean a accident
I'm– I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
They be throwin' in the towel
I do yellowtail at TAO
They be watchin' what they say
Especially when it's to my face
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

[Chorus]
Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke

[Intro: Sample & Drake]
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on makin' the world feel some
They don't have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino, I take 'em to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of C-notes, get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms, I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's rose
Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that, I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood to go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short, I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doin' numbers like I'm Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves

[Chorus: Sample]
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Drake]
Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese, you don't want drama, capisc'?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase
I'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, jeez!
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards
Like Charlamagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link up on the 33rd
When I say that they cursin' me, it ain't dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I don't know who's protectin' me but we hit it off
Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are

[Chorus: Sample]
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Intro]
Here we go
Yeah

[Verse]
Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like "Billie Jean", but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time, and all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothin' like the new times
Now it's rough times, I'm out here on front lines
Just tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breakin' my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry 'bout whose house
You live at, or who loves you more or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got here
Nah, look, I'm too proud to let that come between me and you now
Realize I gotta think for two now
I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead, then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some Mod Rosé and the Baccarats out
For our cheers to the next generation
But this Champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit
But man, you know
I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably could'a did stand-up
Yeah, but at the same time, he's a stand up
And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony's sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hundred more
Sorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks, you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this
Me and your mother will have come around
Instead of always cuttin' each other down
God willin', I got a good feelin'
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this, my G

[Outro]
I'm changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
Here we go again

[Intro: Future]
Mario
Pluto
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang

[Chorus: Drake]
Look who I'm fuckin' again
I had her on ice but then
I watched the ice get thin
Now, does she sink or swim?

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Future]
She had an attitude in the summer
But she bein' nice again (She bein' nice)
Double my price again (Double my price)
Top of the charts, back in they hearts
Nigga, he strikes again, whoa
Some niggas bitter with life and they hate me
They wanna put knife in my ribs, whoa

[Verse 1: Drake]
Way this shit set up I live like Ronaldo
But I never been in Madrid, whoa
She said that that she workin', I told her come over
And we can get right at the crib, whoa
She finish at 6 but then say she got court in the morning to fight for her kid
I told her I'd pray for the kid

[Pre-Chorus: Drake & Future]
What a time this is (Whoa)
To be alive for this shit (Yeah)
President doin' us in (Woo)
My window got blue in the tint (Skrrt)
Did this shit once and I'd do it again

[Chorus: Drake]
Look who I'm fuckin' again

Now, does she sink or does she swim, now?

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Future]
Ayy, 'cause she bein' nice again (She bein' nice)
Double my price again (Double my price)
Top of the charts, back in they hearts
Nigga, he strikes again, whoa
Some niggas bitter with life and they hate me
They wanna put knife in my ribs, whoa

[Verse 2: Drake]
Nobody better to show up and run it
And I could put that on the twins, whoa

'Cause I'm nice to your friends
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah, they shouldn't have told me but they did

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]

[Refrain: Future]

(Blue faces)
I got blue diamonds, blue tint, yeah (Let's go)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Treat you like princess
Rest in heaven, Diana
Piquing my interest
She got peak like Montana
England breeds proper girls
Where are all your good manners?
Reply with pleasantries
Honestly, I can't stand ya

[Chorus: Drake]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you

[Verse 2: Drake]
What you thought of me?
Never had me missin' a beat
That's just a view from a cheap seat
They don't want problems with me
Talk used to be cheap; nowadays, it's free
People are only as tough as their phone allows them to be
Girl, that could never be me
I found my peace, I'm about to say my piece
You might not agree with me

[Interlude: Stefflon Don]
Bitch been with this boy, yeah, for four weeks
I told her go on a date
All of a sudden, she married
Didn’t say get bloodclaat married

[Chorus: Drake]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you

[Outro: Stefflon Don, Vinessa Douglas & Rhea Kpaka]
— What I'm sayin', in today really at our big, big age if you're gettin' with someone right now and you're linking them for couple weeks, they should know 'This is the girl I kinda want to see' so lemme lock off the ting but obviously in the world that we live in today is not like that
— He is… did that — but obviously it takes time— You're chattin' shit. First of all you shouldn't have no problems at the beginning, it should be like honeymoon–
— That's what I said, that's what I said! The beginning is always honeymoon season
— Yeah, well you overdo it and he's overdoin' it. Both of you are overdoin' it right now
— Yeah, well, alright

[Intro: Drake]
Ayy, yeah
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Leaving me (leavin' me)
Dippin' out on me (on me)
Already got what you needed, I guess
Quickly (Quickly) learned yourself through me (Through me)
Already gave you what you needed, I guess (Ooh yeah)
I guess (Yeah) yeah
That's why I'm not with nobody (Ooh yeah)
'Cause I don't wanna hurt nobody (Ooh yeah)
Did it over text, didn't call me (Ooh yeah)
Still got love for you, mami
I know you wanna be somebody
Even if you gotta leave somebody (Body) yeah

[Chorus: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded (Jaded)
Most of these things I don't wanna say (Jaded)
I wanna be around while you chasin' (While you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
I always want the truth but it's dangerous (Dangerous, oh)
You got somethin' real, not basic (Ooh yeah)
You wanna get with me, stop
Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded (Jaded)
Most of these things, I don't wanna say (Say)
I wanna be around while you chasin'
(Wanna be around, wanna be around)
You wanna hit me up when you make it (Ooh, yeah)
You'll try and come back when you famous
(Back around, back around)
I always want the truth but it's dangerous (Dangerous)
You got somethin' real, not basic
You wanna get with me, stop (Flakin')
Yeah, dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

[Verse 2: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Ayy, told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as being stuck
And like guns with the ink in, you're gettin' under my skin
Pretty little young thing (Young thing)
Had a nigga convinced, got me too excited
Yeah, you played me, you played me, you played me
Lowdown, dirty, shameful, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'
That's besides the point I'm makin'
You're way too opinionated to have to force it, to have to fake it
You had potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in (Ooh yeah)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I musta changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (Jaded)

[Chorus: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Most of these things I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin' (While you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
(Back around, back around, dangerous, oh, ooh yeah)
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
You wanna get with me, stop (Flakin')

'Cause I want ya, and I need ya

[Verse: Drake]
Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it
TrapMoneyBenny, ayy
I buy you Champagne but you love some Henny
From the block like you Jenny
I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many

[Chorus: Drake]

Because my Instagram is weak as fuck
I'm just being real, my shit, look–

[Intro]
Yeah, turn everything up
Yeah, oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Turn everything up a little more

[Verse 1]
I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York? I can't decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside
I can't do suit and tie
Can't be in a room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time, I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time, emotions running high
I wish you felt alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Just hitting my line
All the time, all the time, all the–
You stay on my mind
All the time, all the time
Yeah

[Chorus]
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind

[Verse 2]
You and your sister
Too hot to handle
Things would get cancelled
I would make time for you
Commitment
Going the distance
I'm new to all of this

[Chorus]
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind

[Chorus: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
It's your fuckin' birthday (Oh, birthday, I need more liquor)
It's a fuckin' celebration (Oh oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh oh

[Verse 1: Drake]
It's your birthday, baby, it's your birthday
Yeah, who's gonna love you on your worst day?
You talk so tough
I know you're soft like buttercups
Reese's, Reese's, don't be ridiculous
Just say your piece and peace up like Ibiza
Cool your headtop, you hotter than Anitta
Bakin', baby, tell me where I need to–

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday

[Chorus: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
It's your brrrrrrr–
It's your fuckin' birthday (Oh, birthday, I need more liquor)
It's a fuckin' celebration (Oh oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control (Oh oh)
It's a celebration, oh oh

[Verse 2: Drake]
They tried it, they went for it
All year and you're still here, just ignore it
If it ain't the real thing, you don't want it
GG, CC's all on ya
It's your month and you know it (And you know it)
And you know it's real, don't gotta say it for you
And you know somebody home prayin' for you
You say, "Play this shit," they better play it (Ayy, play it)
For you (For you), on time
And I miss the days that you was all mine
Haven't been official in a long time
So tell me where I need to–

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday

[Chorus: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
It's your brrrrrrr–
It's your fuckin' birthday (Oh, birthday, I need more liquor)
It's a fuckin' celebration (Oh oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh oh

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Oh, it's your fuckin' birthday, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I never really
Talk about dick that I wanna give you or places I wanna get to
Neck grab, hair grab
Arch back, heart attack, cardiac
I need it nasty like, like Evil Angel, like Vivid
You know, nasty like how they give it
You know, I need you to be open like Kai's kitchen
That pussy kinda sound like waves hittin' (Kshh!)
Soothin', keep it right there, no movin'
Make my way around the bases-es
I wanna take you to oasises
Bein' honest, I don't really know what patience is
Ayy, freaky like the red leather Michael
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school (Hi)
I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation
Willin' and ready for the takin'
Earth-shatterin', groundbreakin'
Headscarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare
But just be prepared that I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now, we’re one now

[Interlude]
Did somebody…
Who'd they say that baby look like?
Drake!

[Verse 2]
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixin' potion
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options, but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it (Woo woo, woo woo)
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it (Woo woo, woo woo)
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixin' potion
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options, but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it, yeah

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, woo

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time gets to tickin' and it takes a toll
Told you I couldn't really draw the line
Line ringin', sayin' that you told him things
Things that you could've kept inside
Sidetrackin' me when I was good to you
You were somebody I would stand behind

[Chorus: Drake]
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya

[Refrain: Nicki Minaj & (DJ Boof)]
Rule number one, to be a boss-ass bitch (Uh-huh)
Never let a clown nigga try to play you (Okay)
If he play you, then rule number two (Okay)
Is fuck his best friends and make 'em yes men (Okay)
And– (Wow, that's how you feel?)

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time, it done left you with a broken heart
Hardly excuses how you play with mine
Mindin' my business and you show up
Up to no good, I should've seen the signs
Signin' me up to do your dirty work
Workin' to try and get you off my mind

[Chorus: Drake]
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & (DJ Boof)]
What the fuck, this ain't Chanel, nigga?! Custom down?!
What the fuck, I ain't smokin' hot?! Bust me down?!
You the same clown nigga that was runnin' me down?!
Now you all up in my…'cause you wanna be down?! (Okay)
(Wow, that's how you feel?)

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled]
Me and Benjamín Franco stay at the banco
Getting checks like Nike, everywhere that I go
If you ain't getting no pesos, ¿qué estás haciendo? (J-Lo)
Stack it up like Legos, quiero dinero (another one)

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled]
Me and my man, we stack it up to the ceiling (more money)
Cállate la boca, let me finish (more money)
Every day I'm alive, I make a killing (let's get it)
Yeah, I swear I'ma get it (get it)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled, Both]
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay

Soy la Princesa, San Juan, Puerto Rico
They say money talk, but my talking bilingual
I should be cuffed, though, 'cause I don't do singles
In love with the money, so no need to mingle (let's ride)
Just back it up, hot talk, yeah, back it up
Holla at that if you actin' up
You ain't got that, you can't sit with us, yeah
Designer frames make you double take
Ben and Andy on a double date
Grant just hit me, said he on the way

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled, Both]
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay

I just want the green, want the money, want the cash flow
Yo quiero la venta, sí, sin cuenta, sí, lo siento (Cardi B, Cardi B)

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Look, they gon' do what I say so, Cardi B and J. Lo
Talk behind my back, but never up in my face, though
I just want my money, chips, guac, and queso
Y'all can kiss my ass, dame un beso
I spice it up, I'm like sofrito
I need my money, yo necesito
I told y'all, I'm trap Selena
I'll backhand a bitch like Serena
We need the guap, run up in your spot
Put it to your head like, "Give me what you got"
Two bad bitches that came from the Bronx
Cardi from the pole and Jenny from the block (block)

Been with so many women I can’t even count
Bitches all borrowin my Netflix account
Messin up all of my recommendations
You know I don’t wanna watch Sense8, son!
He may be my kid but I’m not buying no family plan
12 bucks a month? I ain’t made of money, damn
Learned my lesson, thought I could trust a hoe
Gotta change the password to HBO Go
For real

[Verse 1]
I had to catch the bus
Alarm was shaking, oh
Almost landed on the floor
So ready for you then
To leave was a mistake
What was I waiting for?

[Chorus]
What a sick, sick feeling
To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go, let you go

[Verse 2]
I used to turn you on
I used to be by your side
And now the rest is leaving me behind

[Pre-Chorus]
I miss the way you sound
I miss to be around you
Just let me have another chance

[Chorus]
What a sick, sick feeling
To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go, let you go

[Outro]
What a sick, sick feeling
To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]

Bow, bow, bow, bow, that's a supersoaker (Ah!)
Woke up with hangover, I ain't never sober (Ah!)
Supersoaker, a supersoaker, a supersoaker
Woke up with a hangover, I ain't never sober

Pussy on a four-wheeler, that's a vagi-suki (Bit')

I'm a pitbull, Hennessy and Red Bull (Ah!)
Takin' body shots (Yeah), like boxers do (Yeah)
On a mission with a bitch, that's Tom Cruise (Yyeah)
I'm a Tycoon, fresh out of ice shool
Gettin' head on a helipad
Hell yeah, helicopter when that chopper blam
Came in the gate, 400 grand, I had a plan
So be ready when I...

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Dr-Dr-Dr-Dr-Drop dead
Bitch, get out the way, I'm a supersoaker (Ah!)

Okay, how many bitches I gotta fuck tonight?
I'm thinking three, but a nigga gotta catch a flight
I'm married to the money, gon' an' throw the rice
Who you playing games with, I ain't Fisher Price
I got 200 on the dash, I'm 'bout to run the lights
I put a million on that ass, I'm 'bout to change her life
I'm 'bout to bus' a nut, all over them pearly whites
Mean muggin' in that pussy, I ain't never nice
She like to play with that jungle
I crawl in that pussy, make her pussy crumble
I formation, a nigga ain't gon' fumble
Right up in that hole, gorilla in the jungle

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Dr-Dr-Dr-Dr-Drop dead
Get out the way, I'm a supersoaker (Ah!)
Told her look back at it when she bend it over (Woo)
Bow, bow, bow, bow, that's a supersoaker (Ah!)
Woke up with hangover, I ain't never sober (Ah!)
Supersoaker, a supersoaker, a supersoaker
Woke up with a hangover, I ain't never sober

[Refrain]
She like to play with her jungle
That pussy sweet like a mango
She take it from every angle
Beat it up, like a motherfuckin' monster

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
I'm an outlaw
Quick on the draw
Somethin' you've never seen before
And I dare a motherfucker to come in my face
I got something chrome
And I got it from home
And it ain't a microphone
And I dare a motherfucker to come in my face

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
It's so real how I feel
Cause this society, that makes a nigga wanna kill
I'm just straight ill, ridin' my motorcycle down the streets
While politicians is soundin' like strippers to me
They sayin', but I don't wanna hear it

[Chorus: Vita]
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
It's a raw night
Who wants to bar fight?
Well come on, alright
And I dare a *motherfucker* to come in my face
Baseball bats
I got something for that
It goes bla-ka-ka-kat
So I dare a motherfucker to come in my face

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
It's so real how I feel
Ause this society, that makes a nigga wanna kill
I'm just straight ill, ridin' my motorcycle down the streets
While the government is soundin' like strippers to me
They keep sayin', but I don't wanna hear it

[Chorus: Vita]
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free

[Verse 3: Lee Harvey]
When you think of Harvey, think of a Harley
Blue denim, spiked wrists and 'Crombie
Slap-screws and tattoos, that's all me
Two blondes, both arms, feelin' like Fonzie
You can find me drunk, whippin' it might crash
Or find me chillin' with crackers who like thrash
Find me in court, smokin' that nice grass
Burnin' the flag, all in the name of white trash
It's Harvey baby, Christ on the arm, I'm gnarly, baby
Fuck with me? Not hardly, baby
And you know the flow ungodly, baby
So let's party, baby
Chicks nickname me Pilot, they get high off my *dick*
I take 'em to my home, they call it the cockpit
Time for take off, the panties they drop quick
Now that's first class *fuckin'*, ain't that some fly *shit*?

[Chorus: Vita]
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free

[Verse 1]
It got too hot and so we overthrew the system
'Cause there's no place for human existence like right here
On this bright blue marble orbited by trash
Man, there's no beating that
It was no big thing to give up the way of life we had, oh
My social life is now quite a bit less hectic
The nightlife and the protests are pretty scarce
Now I mostly spend the long days walking through the city
Empty as a tomb
Sometimes I miss the top of the food chain
But what a perfect afternoon

[Verse 2]
Industry and commerce toppled to their knees
The gears of progress halted
The underclass set free
The super-ego shatters with our ideologies
The obscene injunction to enjoy life
Disappears as in a dream
And as we return to our native state
To our primal scene
The temperature, it started dropping
The ice floes began to freeze

[Verse 3]
From time to time we all get a bit restless
With no one advertising to us constantly
But the tribe at the former airport
Some nights has meat and dancing
If you don't mind gathering and hunting
We're all still pretty good at eating on the run
Things it would have been helpful to know before the revolution
Though I'll admit some degree of resentment
For the sudden lack of convenience around here
But there are some visionaries among us developing some products
To aid us in our struggle to survive
On this godless rock that refuses to die

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Niggas wanna hold hands
Like Kumbaya
Hold these hands
Like "Ali, bomaye"
Monkey ass hoe
You Zoboomafoo
Used to make beats off of fruity loops
Most niggas need church though
'Cause the type of life I live
That shit would ruin you
Used to chase bitches older than the usual
Cougars had me tied up like a Puma shoe
It's like déjà vu
Every bitch say her ex was always gay, and she knew
If you knew he liked niggas, what that say 'bout you?
Ring hit the 'gram 'fore they say "I do"
The type to blast a nigga that get caught when he cheat
But your nigga's piping your best friend as we speak
Happy mother's day (that just mean your pussy work)
Anyone can bust a nut but who can put in work

[Hook: London Jae]
I'm back at it again, bitch
Back to setting records and the trends, bitch
Money still the mission, but I been rich
Gotta kick the fucking door right off the hinges
Stay on point like a syringes
Back again, bitch I'm back at it again
Setting trends, setting motherfuckin' trends
Money still the mission, but I been rich
I'm back at it again, bitch
Back again, bitch, I'm back at it again
Setting trends, setting motherfuckin' trends
Money still the mission, but I been rich
I'm back at it again, bitch

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Read about it
I feed her D, then feed her salad
Now that's a balance
Don't need no practice, she's invited
She decent at it
She look at my prints, she winkin' at it
She screamin' at it
It's just the tip, but she dramatic
She let me hit it
I put her on the 

[?]
Benz is tinted
She call me "doctor", I'm playin' a dentist
I get to drillin'
Soon as I finish, she get the fillings
I'm finna splint it
I'm not defensive, I can't be offended
Ambience ending
Watch your reach, over-extending
Ain't nobody sleepin' on you
We just losing our interest
She want that Gringo
She call me "Mandingo"
Throw her like Dan Marino
I flip the bag like hyena
Arm the torpedo

[Hook: London Jae]
I'm back at it again, bitch
Back to setting records and the trends, bitch
Money still the mission, but I been rich
Gotta kick the fucking door right off the hinges
Stay on point like a syringes
Back again, bitch I'm back at it again
Setting trends, setting motherfuckin' trends
Money still the mission, but I been rich
I'm back at it again, bitch
Back again, bitch, I'm back at it again
Setting trends, setting motherfuckin' trends
Money still the mission, but I been rich
I'm back at it again, bitch

Matador Bobby, I don't play
Miss me with that bullshit, ole', ole'
Steal your señorita in a day
And I got that cannon, who you fuckin' wit?

Bitch I'm bubblin', bubblin'
Bitch I'm bubblin', bubblin'

Got more wad than .Paak, bitch, I'm bubblin'

[Verse]
When you that clean, a bad bitch'll tie a bow
Call me Billy Blanks, kick, punch, elbow
Work your bitch out, dip out, now we fit now
If I went to jail for a night, she my pen pal
Pen pal, 'cause she miss me that much
Make her pull out one titty like Janet Jackson
(Janet Jackson, Janet Jackson)
(Janet Jackson, Janet Jackson)
(Janet Jackson, Janet Jackson)
Tr-tr-tr-tryna get ya' cap up, but your brim low
Talkin' all that Eddie shit, but your wins low
I'm the hottest nigga, period - menstrual
And I don't talk to no police, and that's a tenfold

[Hook]
Matador Bobby, I don't play
Miss me with that bullshit, ole', ole'
Steal your señorita in a day
And I got that cannon, who you fuckin' wit?

[Intro/ Sample]
Oh Bobby
Oh Bobby
Oh God, oh Bobby

[Verse]
These are the chronicles of a black magician, left the rap business
Made some plaques with an unthreatening black image
But that's finished, you niggas still ass kissing, catfishing
Before I was rap fishing, I had visions of mostly millions and packed buildings
Everybody's depressed, no happiness
It's sad when you find out the world is trash, inn'it?
(Wa-wait till they discover it's flat)
If I ever made me a movie and casted it
You wouldn't have to be a dysfunctional black family
Or single and sad, or sell crack to act in it
The crooked enslave you, you sending prayers
Like Sky Daddy blessing black people with good behaviour like
"You're a good nigga (yeah), you're a good nigga (yeah), here's a gold sticker"
And I swear it's folks going through my house
When they know I ain't home
It be your own people, you don't know what I'm on
Chopped it up with Shawty Slim like nigga pick up the phone
Stayed up till 5am just to finish this song
You ain't gotta say "Let's get it", bitch I got it
I ain't gotta dumb it down, they just gotta catch up
I don't need boy scout, bad bitch, I ain't a tiger cub
Fuck you and your entire club, fuck you, bitch, I'm fired up
I'm the whole entire plug, the way I drive fuck my tires up
Game over, nigga, time's up, me and my bitch, fuck your bitch, ayy
You ain't know she was with the shit, ayy
Yeah, we some thots, no kids, ayy
Whoa, I'm high as fuck, just a sip, ayy
Bobby Ray Bandz, I'm the shit, ayy
Fake niggas keep jumping ship, how good does good get?
There's more to life than being hood rich, you ain't on what I'm on
You ain't on what I'm on, you ain't on what I'm on
Chopped it up with Shawty Slim, nigga pick up the phone
Chopped it up with big rich, nigga pick up the phone
Chopped it up with TJ, nigga pick up the phone
Chopped it up with B-Side, lived the real street life
Chopped it up with Playboy Tre, pick up the phone
Chopped it up with London, chopped it up with Havi
Chopped it up with Jacques, chopped it with the money
Chopped it up with T.I.P, chopped it up with Rocky
Chopped it up with Tech N9ne, nigga, who gon' stop me?
Niggas know I'm mobbin', niggas know I'm not playin'
What's her name, what's her name? Could it be Roxxanne?
Niggas know I'm the bomb, woah, kemosabe
Racist white people look at me like Bin Laden
How many crisis actors out hear rapping today?
How many dick appointments can she make in a day?
Young guys think they're cold as can be
But even triple OGs get old in the knees
Always knew niggas was gon' wake up
Ain't shit to worry 'bout if you ain't trying to opress us
The whole hotep club, the whole no flex club
But if you had the money, buy a Rolex club (hotep hooray)
Gotta be broke,  to be woke, no check club (ho hey)
No sex, no neck  (ho, hotep hooray)
No neck, no sex, no sex  (ho hey ho)
How much clout? How much clout? How much?
How much clout make that ass come out?
How much clout make them titties come out?
How much clout? How much clout?
How much clout make you fakers take a bow? Game over

[Chorus: Waka Flocka & B.o.B]
I really, really wanna rock right now
I wanna rock right now

I wanna see your ass in your elbows

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I wanna see that ass and them elbows, bitch
All about a dollar like Creflo, bitch
I give her snaps on a Pedro, bitch
And she go H.A.M. on a breadroll
Feelin' zesty, kissin' on her bestie
Archive, archive, archive, archive
Both hands needed like a jet-ski
Head on my iCloud, ass on my hard drive
Keep dancin' mamma, pose
Peep the wood in the morning, you will see a nigga woke
And that ass on woke, and them titties on perc
When you gon' twerk, bitch?

[Chorus: Waka Flocka & B.o.B]
Head, knees, shoulders, toes (yeah, yeah)
Head, knees, shoulders, toes (yeah, yeah)

Good girl, bad girl, got horns in her halo

She wanna rock right now
Said she was straight, but she not right now
Act like a saint, but a thot right now
All in my face, told her "not right now"
Right now
She wanna rock right now
Said she was straight, but she not right now
Act like a saint, but a thot right now
All in my face, told her "not right now"

My bitches, they foxy, they fine
Don't speak in my language
Don't know what she saying, but we converse
I got no concerns, survived every purge
I'm straight like a million perms
Flow is superb, and did it occur that these were the thoughts of a nerd?
I used to get curve, now all of these bitches is catching the ear
(You got some nerve)
Well, beat, beat in them sheets, Eee, E-rr

Puerto Rican verse
Speak to me first
Lil B curse
Vietnamese, I came with more than one bird, call it a geese
Can't know where I sleep, multiple keys, I'm having multiple dreams
I'm a juggernaut, you gon' jugg or not
Are you a Gemini? Be at a gym a lot
Talkin' to them a lot, talkin' to him a lot
I just be in 'n out, police be trippin' now
Off of my block, they gon' beat up a crooked cop
Made a couple knots, turned it up a notch
I'mma call a phone, they gon' walk it out
Should I rap? Should I sing on the hook or not?

'Til I leave the Earth

[Intro]
In search of something greater
I'm sick and tired of doing fuck niggas favors
I'm sick and tired of chasing down designer labels
So I said "fuck it, imma start up my own label"
'Cause tryna please you, I just ain't capable
I'm sick and tired of tryna make myself relatable
So please don't ask me why my eyes low
'Cause madafucka i could do this with my eyes closed

[Verse 1]
How many hits? How many pills do I gotta take to think of a hit?
To be at the top, how much cotton do I gotta pick?
How many M's do I gotta get? Don't make any sense
Ain't that a bitch? Ain't I, Ain't I legit?
Since I was a g, fuck with my shit
I was a stubborn kid, I grew up stuttering, hoping that someone on top would discover me
How many publicists do I gotta-?
How many publicists I gotta hire to juggle this fuckery? Someone should cover this, I've had enough of this
I can't make up this shit, I am on too many substances
How many streams? How many themes? How many awards? How many rings?
Fuck with these dreams

[Hook]
Who I ride for?
Definitely not no clown-ass niggas, call you sideshows
And we, and we know that your IG be telling lies, hoe
I'mma reap the shit that I sow

[Verse 2]
I find it odd, niggas stay saying "don't wife a thot"
But you wifing thots behind the dignified facade
Your life's in knots, my life might appear more aligned a notch, but I'm on suicidal watch
(Hello? you ever just wanna die a lot)
Well, commence the chords, B.o.B you sound rich and bored
I say we're just a bunch of piles of shit with pores
That spend all day eating, then shit some more
I don't want kids, I'm convinced, I'm sure
Pull out like my dick's a sword
Eight billion people, 90% of them's poor, but fuck it, what's a few more
Let's even get more shit to afford
Seventy summers and you're a cripple corps
You on, you on, you on my dick
A dog, a dog, a dog only holler when it's hit
That means something I said must got under your skin
Tell me, how real can I get?
I said fuck the feds, the twelve, the CIA it ain't shit
'Cause they can't do shit

[Hook]
Who I ride for?
Clown-ass niggas, call you sideshows
Your IG be telling lies, hoe
I'mma reap the shit that I sow

But they still don't love you

Rock a bed, I don't stick around, make it hard to cuddle
Been a made man, so it's nothing if I gotta dust you
Kung fu, I'mma break the board when I come through
I surfed to, single moms tryna be healthy, they shop at Whole Foods
These niggas hoes too, huh
Look what I go through, huh
Eatin' that Nobu, but
I ain't go no boo
Drankin' my bottle, drankin' my bottle, huh
I feel like Goku, huh
You tryna go cool, huh
Been poppin' since '02, huh
Ocho, cinco
I just bought a bank, ho
Cain and Abel
Every shot is fatal
Belly at the table
You seen it, you got cable
Hop out the grave tomb
Ain't no more slave tunes (Bandz)

[Chorus: B.o.B]

Fuck twelve, right now, right now
Pull up to the club, no pat down, pat down
Young nigga got the racks now, like right now
This right here gon' make you go dumb, AP shine like the motherfuckin' sun
Trap shit, get it trap shit, get it trap shit
Ratchet shit, bad bitch, make-it-clap shit
Rich bitch on some rich shit, kicking big shit
Real slick, on some slick shit, like I'm Slick Rick
I do what I wanna, you got, see like my persona
She givin' me tat, she wanna kick shit with Big Havi and Bobby
But fuck it, I'd rather kick shit with my posse
And baby wrap around me like a rib-stick
I ball too hard, won't miss shit
Big Havi on the beat, that's a whole hit
Took off on 'em, got 'em like "oh, shit"

[Chorus: B.o.B]
DUI, leave 'em DOA

Wait, T.M.I

[Verse]
Yeah yeah
Look
She said her ex wasn't shit, one before that wasn't shit, one before that wasn't shit, one before that wasn't shit
How you navigate to the same shit?
You always gravitate to the same dick
She said I'm just like every guy, how you know 'bout every guy?
Maybe only all the niggas you've met
Look, she wanna be a housewife, but don't know what a home is
She want a soul mate, but don't know where her soul is
Now, what are we supposed to date or procreate, shit?
Well, I guess, I suppose that ass supposed to shake
What is love?
How many dates? How many texts? How many compliments does it take?
You know this, you know this world ain't shit, but still, you smile even with a fake grin
Maybe it's something in your mind you can't shape
Maybe it's something in your heart they can't break
Now, look she know how I feel about her, she do what she wanna do
I know how she feel about me, I move how Mohammed move
Couldn't leave if I wanted too
Yeah, look
You want love? What the fuck is that?
Love is how you feel, regardless how they treat you back, yeah
Frequencies above anything negative
Big up yourself, the same you did the 44th president
You can't love the culture and hate the people
Embrace the flaws, elevate what you call evil
Nigga, I mastered the shit, I mastered the shit
Like when Pac shot them cops that was attacking his camp
Would you let your bitch look through your phone? Alone?
Fuck all that pretentionship, get you a real nigga with no censorship
Tough conversations to have, type of conversations make you pack all of your bags
Well if it's meant to be, then it'll be
The truth will come to the light, eventually
So quit up, all that fake shit, quit all that flaw shit, quit all that fluke shit, get off that tough shit, let's have a talk shit
We on this art shit, yeah, owning boss shit
And we ain't gotta have a baby
I like it being me and you
When you weep, you kinda cute
What we watching, season one, season two?
And I don't really want no fairytales
Still, I wanna fall in love like the fairytale, still
We can do this shit without no training wheels, real
On some Kemet shit, Heru take the wheel
That bitch, my bitch, that's my bitch
I feel like I got the baddest bitch in Atlanta
I feel like I got the baddest bitch in the world
I feel like, I feel like that's my queen, not a girl
I feel like, I feel like I'm the king of the world
I feel like, I feel like that's my queen, not a girl
And if you feel like how I feel, then you're lucky as me
But what the fuck is luck? This shit was destined to be, yeah
Now, what is love? Now, what is love? So, what is love? Yeah, yeah
You can tug, you can tug, but jealousy ain't love
Jealousy ain't love
Just 'cause you feeling reckless, don't mean that it's really love
The tendency for dysfunction eventually breaks up, it breaks up
You can tug, you can tug, jealousy ain't love
Jealousy ain't love
Just 'cause you feeling reckless don't mean that it's really love
The tendency for dysfunction eventually breaks up, it breaks up
Bandz

[Chorus]
I've traveled so far
Couldn't tell you how far
Feels as though I have been
A million places at once
Many lives I have lived
Many battles I've fought
I've fought, and lost

[Verse 1]
Mass shooters
Black rulers
What's up to you half-truthers
Hotep-lujah
That's humor
I'm past the rumors
I'm past the human
The body is trash
A bad computer
A ghost, a ghost
With massive tumors
Can't threaten a nigga like me
With death I'd be glad to do it
And sprinkle my ashes on my Mac computer
And rap into it
While blastin' Future
And say that's the future
Thats the future

[Interlude]
If you're lookin for trouble
You ain't gotta look far
Without the presence of dark
Wouldn't-

[Verse 2]
The year is 5625
Niggas is clappin' and stompin' in church, waiting for Jesus to come back alive
Niggas is still (conscious), waiting on E.T. to come out the sky
Stop all these crimes, mentally ill and out of their mind
Niggas-niggas-niggas-niggas is still awaiting for Flint to get some supplies
Niggas is still like "Damn, I was just talkin' to so-and-so the other day, how did they die? Why?"
Niggas is still (conscious), waiting for politicians to admit that they lied
Since we all comrades, (let them niggas pre-locked up in them contracts)
You accept that its generous, just 'cause the man let his boot off your neck just a little bit
If that shit - if that shit - if that shit was threatening, you wouldn't know that it did exist
They wouldn't - they wouldn't - they would've hid that shit from you, like all of your history
They brought - they brought - they brought Bill Nye back from the dead just to get at me
They sent so many agents my way, I could start an agency
(You are nearly conscious)
It's all about branding, all about branding, feel like a fraternity, niggas wanna brand me
Niggas want Grammys, niggas want families, niggas think I'm crazy, I don't own a damn thing
Where the fuck's the manual? They can't understand me, they can't understand me
All that shit must go, all that shit is trash, there is not a Plan B
(You are nearly conscious)
Where do all of that go, where we gon' end up, where we all landing?
This is just a shit-show, this is just a Citgo, I am only passing
(You are nearly conscious)

[Chorus]
I've traveled so far
Couldn't tell you how far
Feels as though I have been
A million places at once
Many lives I have lived
Many battles I've fought
I've fought, and lost
If you're looking for trouble
You ain't gotta look far
Without the presence of dark
Wouldn't be any stars
You may know who I am
But do you know who you are?
(You are, you are)
These roads, they don't go nowhere
These highways are a dead end
I've had my share of losses
I've had my share of lessons
And I sure know what hell is
And I ask you this question
If we, ourselves, ain't perfect
Then how could we know what heaven is like?

[Intro: Lil Yachty]

Bombs and batarangs
Bo staff hitting, steady doing his thang
Robin Robin the leader, Robin Robin in charge
(Show 'em his baby hands!) Nah, Robin Robin's are large!
Nah, nah, no, for real! Those are some super small hands!
What? No they're not! Whatever, just keep going, just get going!

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Go, Teen Titans, go!
Go, Teen Titans, go!
Go, Teen Titans, go!
Go, Teen Titans, go!

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Raven is here to drop it on you even harder
There's no darker than she, Raven's as dark as can be
Check it, Azarath Metrion Z-zinthos
Teleport and magical powers they adios!

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Go, Teen Titans, go!
Go, Teen Titans, go!

Go, Teen Titans, go!

Some girls won’t dance to the beat of the track
She won’t walk away, but she won’t look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she’s a mess
She’s a mess, she’s a mess
Now the girl is stressed

Run, run, her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights her way while she’s howling at him
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she’s a tramp
She’s a tramp, she’s a vamp, but she still does her dance
She’s a tramp, she’s a vamp, but she still kills the dance

[Chorus]
Baby loves to dance in the dark

Mommy's in the kitchen, cooking up something good
And daddy's on the sofa, pride of the neighborhood
My brother's in the ballet, it seems he's got it set
And I'll be up at midnight with my cigarette

[Chorus]
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go

[Verse 2]
Daddy's in the basement, cooking up something fine
While Rick's out on the pavement, flipping it for dimes
If there's anything redeeming, I haven't seen it yet
And I'm still up at midnight, chewing nicorette

Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go

I just wanna go

Honey, this town’s really taking it’s toll

And I just wanna go
I just wanna go

Fucked up your budget on one stone

Baby, don't you move, I'll invest in your moves
Baby, watch me move, watch me Michael Jackson move
Billy Jean move, Bill Jean truth
Pocket rock inside of me

I just noticed all the bad bitches followin' (I noticed)
With a clear rearview, I see a lotta niggas followin' me
I see a lotta niggas broke, also loud as me
I see a lotta niggas try, but don't stick out like me
And if the monkey niggas died, you can't compare with me
An' when I'm in my stride, he can't bear with me

[Chorus: Young Thug & Future]
All my life, I showed you (all my life, I showed you)
Ran it up on you and showed you (ran it up on you, I showed you)

[Intro]
Summer starts now

[Verse 1]
I love your heartbeat givin' me rhythm
And I can feel your frequency, so unique
In other words, such a freak, set me free

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be, wanna be

Make it disappear, that's too many clothes for me

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be your—

[Chorus]
Soulmate, for the night
Let me put my soul on you, it's only right

[Bridge]
Whatever you believe in could be real
'Cause I believe in miracles
So please right now, you and me right now
We could live our dreams right now
First, lay down

[Chorus]
I'ma be your soulmate (ayy), for the night
Let me put my soul on you, it's only right
Let me pull you up out your body, into mine

[Verse 1]
Prettier than all the world
And I'm so proud, I'm so proud of you
You're only one fellow's girl
And I'm so proud, I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of being loved by you

[Bridge]
And it would hurt, hurt to know
If you ever were untrue

[Verse 2]
Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
And I'm so proud girl (I'm so proud) I'm so proud of you
Complements to you from all the people we meet
Yes and I'm so proud now (I'm so proud)
Believe me I love you too
I'm so proud of being loved by you

[Instrumental interlude]

[Hook / Bridge]
I'm so proud of being loved by you
And it would hurt, hurt to know
If you ever were untrue

[Verse 2 abbreviated]
Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
Yeah and I'm so proud (I'm so proud) I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of being loved by you

[Part I: Trust Issues]

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I've been working late
You've been on my case
You wish I was better at communication (Ooh)
Lately, you've been telling me the truest statements
I find it hard to believe
That you love me and only me
I find it hard to see
I find it hard to see

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It's gon' be hard for me to give you all of me (Yeah, yeah)
You hold it down for me, you get this crown for me (Whoa-whoa, yeah, yeah)
And I don't usually 'cause it's new to me
But I think I'm feelin' you
Oh, but I, I got trust issues, trust issues, yeah

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Sage The Gemini]
He can't love you like I love you
He can't fuck you like I fuck you
Whoever it is can't handle you (No)
Spendin' money ain't a thing, I do it, baby
On that Gucci purse and them shoes
You know I've been checking for you
I know you're ready for your glow up
And start to act like nobody know ya
Don't pick your phone up
It's gon' be too hard for me

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It's gon' be hard for me (Yes, it is) to give you all of me (Yeah, yeah)
You hold it down for me (Hold it down), you get this crown for me (Whoa-whoa, yeah, yeah)
And I don't usually (No) 'cause it's new to me
But I think I'm feelin' you
Oh, but I, I got trust issues (But I), trust issues, yeah yeah

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Part II: Act In]

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I just want the truth, you won't hurt my feelings, no
Just tell me the truth, I'm not the only one you dealin' with
I just want the truth, you won't hurt my feelings, no
Just tell me the truth, I'm not the only one you dealin' with

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah, 'cause you ain't gotta act like you a good girl for me (Yeah)
No, you ain't gotta act like, you ain't gotta like that (Yeah)
And you ain't gotta act like a good girl, you a little freak (Yeah)
No, you ain't gotta act like, you ain't gotta like that

[Verse: Chris Brown]
Five in the morning, that's when we be zoned in
Fuckin' up the headboard
Girl, that's what it's there for
Tonight, you gon' act like you're my baby, but we know the truth
Tomorrow, you might be somewhere else, yeah, with your other boo (Boo)
That's crazy (That's crazy)
You spend time with him but I'm your baby (Your baby)
You know he ain't me (Know he ain't me)
You tell me I'm on your mind daily
Either way (Oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I just want the truth, you won't hurt my feelings, no
Just tell me the truth, I'm not the only one you dealin' with

And you ain't gotta act like a good girl, you a little freak (No, yeah)
No, you ain't gotta act like, you ain't gotta like that

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Roll it, boo'd up (Boo'd up)
This ain't new stuff
Poured a few cups
Go and move up
The way you ride it, throw them twos up (Ayy, ayy)
Need that girl to do somethin'

[Verse: Chris Brown]
Five in the morning, that's when we be zoned in
Fuckin' up the headboard
Girl, that's what it's there for
Tonight, you gon' act like you're my baby, but we know the truth
Tomorrow, you might be somewhere else, yeah, with your other boo (Boo)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Oh-oh
I, I, I know, no
I got a woman with plenty of money
She got the money and I got the honey

Called my baby late last night
She told me, daddy, everything was all right

I don't have to worry about what she will find
I know my baby she's all my mine

She's getting me a Cadillac and a diamond ring
She told me, daddy, don't you worry bout a thing

She's all my mine and I'm so glad
She the best woman that I ever had

[Verse 1]
I'm a fool to care when you treat me this way
I know I love you but what can I do
I'm a fool to care

[Verse 2]
I'm a fool to cry when you tell me goodbye
You left me so blue when you were untrue
I'm a fool to care

[Bridge]
I know I should laugh and call it a day
But I know I would cry if you went away

[Verse 3]
I'm a fool to care when you don't care for me
So why should I pretend I'd lose in the end
I'm a fool to care

[Bridge]
I know I should laugh and call it a day
But I know I would cry if you went away

[Verse 1]
I'm a fool to care when you treat me this way
I know I love you but what can I do
I'm a fool to care

[Verse 1: Boz Scaggs & Bonnie Raitt]
Well I got a Senator over in Texas
Got me a judge down in New Orleans
Bought me a Senator over in Texas
And a judge down in New Orleans
Sometimes I call the Gulf my oyster
Sweetest little deal you’ve ever seen

[Verse 2: Boz Scaggs]
Well the one kid’s high on God knows what
And the other one smashed the Benz
Between the bank boys and the lawyers
I don’t know where it ends
Sometimes I've got to wonder about living high in the hog
There’s times I wish I’d married me a woman
'Stead of buying this fierce show dog
Can’t say the old man didn’t warn me
When he 'xplained me judgment day
And the one little thing I forgot to remember
There’s a matter of some hell to pay

[Verse 3: Bonnie Raitt]
And then here comes Shifty and his new 150
He wants to take me for a ride
Saying hey little mamma how ‘bout a little drama
Why don’t you just hop in inside?
Said I might look like a yokel but I’m high tech mogul
With a tiger in my tank
I said oh my goodness you’re a real smooth talker
I believe I’ll take that drink
But first thing buddy better cool your jets
Before you make your play
You gotta feed the kitty and oh yes well
There’s a matter of some hell to pay

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 4: Boz Scaggs & Bonnie Raitt]
Well now you got your devil in the details
Got your devil in the cake
You can’t look around most anywhere
That the devil ain’t on the take
He’s waiting on down at the end of the aisle
He’s a waiting at the pearly gates
I’d say the man’s about everywhere
Ubiquitous some might say
Truth is he’s worn out all us fools
And ain’t no one left to play
He’s bored, he’s mad, he’s all shook up
And there’s gonna be hell to pay

[Slide guitar solo]

[Verse 5: Boz Scaggs & Bonnie Raitt]
Well we’ve dirtied up the waters
We pretty much trashed the earth
The butcher and the baker and everybody else
Has taken it for all its worth
Saying “me oh my, it was a big old pie
And I sure as hell filled my cup”
That Senator’s a comin' on a big white horse
And my judge is gonna fix me up
But as I come to 

[guage?] this moment
It’s time to pipe or pray
'Cause now it’s time for the money shot baby
Times up and there’s hell to pay
You got some hell to pay

[Verse 1]
It's all small town talk, you know how people are
They can't stand to see someone else doing what they like to
It's all small town talk, you mustn't pay no mind
Don't believe a word, they'll try to do it every time

[Bridge 1]
You can't believe everything you hear
And only half of what you see
And if you're gonna believe in anyone
You gotta believe in me

[Verse 2]
It's all small town talk, and it's a well known fact
You don't ever know how one might react to what you're thinking
And it's small town talk, they tell a lot of lies
Make some people crazy and never realize that they're sinking

[Bridge 2]
We're only two people, trying to live together
Trying to make something work
Who are we to judge one another?
That could cause a lot of hurt

[Verse 3]
It's all small town talk, you know how people are
They can't stand to see someone else doing what they want to
It's all small town talk, you mustn't pay no mind
Don't believe a word, they'll try to do it every time

[Verse 1]
Selling late night transfers, try to make a play
The people with the answers don't often pass this way
Starting from Dolores all the way to Treat
It's the last tango on 16th Street

[Verse 2]
The later that it gets, the meaner that it looks
There's a lot to learn out here not found in books
We gotta solve the winter rain, watch out for the heat
When it's the last tango on 16th Street

[Verse 3]
Same old people begging quarters, stretching out their hands
Vendors selling flores from a plastic can
Some are poor but honest, others lie and cheat
Well, it's the last tango on 16th Street

[Verse 4]
All the homeless helpless need a place to stay
Asking you for spare change, don't know what to say
Gypsy plays a melody, a broken tooth, just smile so sweet
At the last tango on 16th Street

[Verse 5]
Same old song, I know you heard it many times before
Why this life in poverty seems so much like a war
Just make sure you're careful where you place your feet
When it's the last tango on 16th Street

[Verse 6]
Some of them don't see so good when they leave the bars
Talking loud and ugly, step in front of cars
If you're holding valuables it pays to be discrete
'Cause it's the last tango on 16th Street

[Verse 7]
Dodge between the hookers, aim between their thighs
Full moon shines above the bay, you can see it in their eyes
Past the Capp Street dogleg, your heart might skip a beat
When it's the last tango on 16th Street

[Outro]
It's the last tango on 16th Street
It's the last tango on 16th Street
It's the last tango on 16th Street

[Verse 1]
There's a storm a-comin', you'd better run
There's a storm coming, goodbye to the sun
There's a storm a-comin', you'd better run boy run
You'd better run

[Verse 2]
There's a ship that's sailing out in the night
There's a heart that's breaking - I think it's mine
There's a storm a-comin', you'd better run boy run
You'd better run

[Bridge]
Every little part of you is a miracle of molecules
Every little thing you do is so sad, in the end
Oh in the end

[Verse 2]
There's a ship that's sailing out in the night
There's a heart that's breaking - I think it's mine
There's a storm a-comin', you'd better run boy run
You'd better run
Know this girl, this Mary Ann
Can't see her when you want to
You've got to see her when you can
I had a dream, late last night
You were speaking to me
Everything was alright
I had a dream, in the morning time
Birds were singin'
Everything was just fine

I want to see you
I want to see you
I'd like to call you
Want to get to know you
I think I want to be with you
I think I want to be with you
I think I want to be with you
With you

Talk about a woman, you're sad and leave
Said that you wanted to find out about me
Sorry Anna Lee, go on, do the best you can
Got a one track mind; I know you understand
I want to see you
I want to see you
I'd like to call you
Want to get to know you
I think I want to be with you
I think I want to be with you
I think I want to be with you
With you

That's just walkin'
That's just talkin'
'Cause she untied my left shoe
Then I start to wonder
What you tryin' to do?
Next she untied my right shoe
Then she said to me, 'am I comin' through?'
(Yeah, you're comin' through alright)
I want to see you
I want to see you
I want to call you
Want to get to know you
And I think I want to be with you
And I think I want to be with you
I think I want to be with you
With you
I want to see you
I want to see you
I want to call you
Want to get to know you
And I think I want to be with you
And I think I want to be with you
I think I want to be with you
With you
I get a high blood pressure when you call my name, uh huh
I get a high blood pressure when you call my name, oh yeah
I get a high blood pressure baby when you by my side
I get a high blood pressure when you by my side, uh huh

I get a high blood pressure when you speak to me, oh yeah
I get a high blood pressure I can hardly breathe, oh yeah
I get a high blood pressure baby when you're in my arms
I get a high blood pressure when you're in my arms, uh huh

My eyes started jumpin' up and down in pain
Heart starts jumpin' up and down like a strain
Chills run up and down my spine it's true
My head started sweatin' all because of you
I get a high blood pressure 'cause I'm your man

My eyes start jumpin' it's a terrible strain
My heart get to pump up and down my pain
Chills run up and down my spine it's true
My head started sweatin' all because of you
I get a high blood pressure 'cause I'm your man
Oh, yeah
Oh, you're full of fire and you're my one desire
You're all full of fire, full of fire
It's about to make me cry, mmm-hmm
When you dance to the music
And you shake it, girl, all night long
When you jam with the band
It's all over
Full of fire, full of fire, full of fire
I'm on your party line, yeah
You're all full of fire
Full of fire
And I got wings to fly, girl

You can dance with the party
With your special kind burning love
I can't wait 'til the party's over
Woah, oh, oh, oh

Oh, full of fire, I hit my 21 (21)
You're all full of fire and life has just begun
You can dance to the music
Oh girl, you make me understand
I got a feeling that like a bolt of lightning
There's a hole in my head
Oh, you can boogie all night long with the music
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Oh, you're full of fire
I'm on your party line, girl
Mmm, you're full of fire, full of fire
Enough to blow my mind, mmm-hmm
When you dance to the music
And you're jamming, and you're jamming, girl
When you jam with the band
It's all over
Dance, dance, dance, you dance
Mmm-hmm, you can dance girl
Ah-ha, understand it
It's a kind of power
Must you make me understand
It's a kind of, kind of power
Mmm, mmm, understand
Oh baby, you can dance

[Verse 1]
Sometimes a girl, will come and go
You reach for love, but I won’t let you know
That in the end, you’ll still be loving her
But then she’s gone, you’re all alone

[Verse 2]
I’ve never learn to give myself
I’ve been a fool, now I need somebody else
Just like boy blue I’d blow my horn for you
Just lead me on, baby, I should have known

[Chorus]
It takes a fool to learn that love don’t love nobody
It takes a fool to learn that love don’t love no one

[Verse 3]
The silent pain disarmed my face
My heart beats on but I won’t take the blame
I’d give her all, all the love I had to give
My love was strong, something sure and right

[Chorus]
It takes a fool to learn that love don’t love nobody
It takes a fool to learn that love don’t love no one

It takes a fool to learn that love don’t love nobody
It takes a fool to learn that love don’t love no one, no one

It takes a fool to learn that love don’t love nobody
It takes a fool to learn that love don’t love no one

It takes a fool to learn that love don’t love nobody
It takes a fool to learn...

[Verse 1: Lucinda Williams]
If you find me in a gloom, or catch me in a dream
Inside my lonely room, there is no in between
Whispering pines, rising of the tide
If only one star shines
That's just enough to get inside
I will wait until it all goes 'round
With you in sight, the lost are found

[Verse 2: Boz Scaggs, Lucinda Williams (lines 2-5)]
Foghorn through the night, calling out to sea
Protect my only light cause she once belonged to me
Let the waves rush in, let the seagulls cry
For if I live again, these hopes will never die
I can feel you standing there
But I don't see you anywhere

[Verse 3: Lucinda Williams, Boz Scaggs]
Standing by the well, wishing for the rains
Reaching to the clouds, for nothing else remains
Drifting in a daze, when evening will be done
Try looking through a haze
At an empty house, in the cold, cold sun
I will wait until it all goes round
With you in sight, the lost are found

[Verse 1]
Oh, I bet you think you're John Wayne
Showing up and shooting down everybody
You're classic in the wrong way
And we all know the end of the story

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

[Chorus]
And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse

[Verse 2]
I bet you think you're first place
Yeah, someone should give you a ribbon
And put you in the hall of fame
For all the games that you think that you're winning

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

[Chorus]
And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse

[Bridge]
Darling, you take the high horse and I'll take the high road
If you’re too good for us, you’ll be good riding solo

[Chorus]
Yeah, I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse
High horse
You ain’t ever gonna come down
You ain’t ever gonna come down

[Intro]
Right Now Sound
Hitmaka!

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in your eyes, shit is dangerous
Grateful I had all the patience
I know you going through some changes
You taking pictures, know your angles
Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
No angel, but you got a halo
When it's nights like this
I really wanna be right here
I really wanna take you there (you there, oh there)
When it's nights like this
I really wanna be right here (be right here)
I really wanna take you there (you there, baby, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill & Jeremih]
Uh, it was nights like this, feelin' right like this
I never really spent no time like this, huh
The second time at the crib knowin' I might not hit
You said, "What I look like?" Like my bitch, yeah
Look into your eyes, shit is dangerous
The pussy wet, I call it angel dust
I done put so many diamond chains on you, they get tangled up
I never felt like this, it's strange as fuck (that's what it's like loving you)
Got yo ex nigga calling, but he can't do much
'Cause you with the kid now, Ella Mai, boo'd up
And all you gotta do is call and watch that Wraith pull up
Under the stars since they throwin' all that shade on us
Facts, woo!

[Chorus: PnB Rock, Jeremih & Both]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous (Your eyes)
Grateful I had all the patience, hey
I know you going through some changes

Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
That's what it's like loving you

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Uh, you feel the vibe, uh, I'm deep inside, yeah
You fuckin' me, ooh, I let you ride, yeah
At first you curved me, I let you slide in
Yo hips so curvy, you let me slide in
Ooh, and it was over once I flipped you over
Relation goal when we come through just like Beyoncé, Hova
This that Hermes money, this ain't no Fashion Nova
You said yo ex had you depressed and I'm just glad that's over
'Cause now you rockin' with a real one
And when I'm in it, you be maxin' on a million
And when I hit it back to back, you make me still cum
I know them bitches hatin' on you, we gon' kill them
That's facts

[Chorus: PnB Rock, Jeremih & Both]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous (Your eyes)
Grateful I had all the patience
I know you going through some changes
You taking pictures, know your angles
Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
That's what it's like loving you

[Verse 4: PnB Rock & Jeremih]
Ayy, you know you bad babe
You know I laugh at these shawties that try to text back
You from the projects, but so exotic
Just give me all of that pussy, so many options (so many options)
Girl, you got me callin', all these different numbers
Why you being selfish? You know that I want you
You be leavin' work and you deserve a Birkin
Girl, you so contagious, damn that shit so dangerous

[Chorus: PnB Rock, Jeremih & Both]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous
Grateful I had all the patience
I know you going through some changes
You taking pictures, know your angles

Hey girl, a-stop what you're doin'
Hey girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is that I like about you that I like so much

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown
It's always the same

Squeeze my lemon, just a little bit
Squeeze my lemon, just a little bit
Oh yeah

I don't want no communication breakdown

Oh oh, yeah
Oh, my my babe
Come on
I can't stop it
Hey fellas, have you heard the news
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long just watch an' see
How the fellas lay their money down
Her style is new but the face is same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

Well, it's been ten years and maybe more
First set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rollin' along
With the grace of the Lord above

People talkin' all around
'Bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me another guy's name
Baby, when I, baby, when I, baby, when I
Oh, try to make love
Mmm, work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand time
However hard I tried
Heartbreaker, your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away, Heartbreaker

Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heart

[Chorus]
Dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Sweet little baby, say what you will
Tongue wag so much when I send you the bill

[Verse 1]
You hurt and abused, tellin' all of your lies
Run 'round sweet baby, Lord, how you hypnotize
Tryin' to love you, baby, but you go on hurtin' so
Soul of a woman was created below

[Verse 2]
Every day I work so hard, bringin' home my hard-earned pay
Sweet little baby baby, then you take it away
I wanna love you baby, but you do me so bad
The worst little woman I once ever had, I've got to quit you baby

Ma ma, yeah
Ma ma ma
Oh
Ah
Ah

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Oh
Oh
Hey

[Chorus]
I've been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Sweet little woman, say what you will
Tongue wag so much when you end up in hell

It's gonna burn burn
Ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma

Well, what's to be they say will be

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave the day

Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave the day
Way up high in the sky
And whoa, but the wind won't blow

To fight the horde, sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming, yeah
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow

How soft your fields so green
Whispered tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
Baby baby, ho-o-h-oh, overlords
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite all your losing

To do the best, the very best I could

Sweet little baby baby, then you take it away
I wanna love you baby, but you do me so bad
The worst little woman I once ever had, I've got to quit you baby

Ma ma, yeah
Ma ma ma

Oh
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Oh
Oh
Hey
Yeah
I've been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Sweet little woman, say what you will
Tongue wag so much when you end up in hell

It's gonna burn burn
Ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Spend my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind, make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair

Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all all the same
The sea was red and the sky was grey
I wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
Hills and the canyons start tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake, watch out

Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings, la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in a mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems, it's hard
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you
I can't play with you no more
I don't know how I'm gonna do what mama told me
My friend, the boy next door

I can't believe what people sayin'
You're gonna let your hair hang down
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
You're in the darker side of town

And when I'm out I see you walking
Why don't your eyes see me
Could it be you've found another game to play
What did mama say to me

That's the way
Oh, that's the way it ought to be, oh oh, yeah now
Mama, ma ma ma ma ma, said
That's the way it ought to stay, ah, ooh, ah, ah

And yesterday I saw you standing by the river
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying
Had they got you hypnotized, don't you even think about it
And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers
And all that lives is born to die
So I say to you that nothing really matters
And all you do is stand and cry

I don't know what to say about it
When all you ears have turned away
But now's the time to look and look again at what you see
Is that the way it ought to stay

That's the way
That's the way it ought'a be, yeah
That's the way it's gonna stay, ah yeah, ah hah, ho ho, ah
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma

Whoa yeah

Oh oh, yeah, ah, oh yeah
Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe
Oh
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die, my my my
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness, I'm glad


And so today, my world it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
But thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one, ah ah yeah
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness, I'm glad
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
Mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me
Hey, fellas, have ya heard the news?
Ya know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see
All the fellas lay their money down
Her style is new, but the face is the same as it was so long ago
B' from her eyes, a different smile like that of one who knows

It's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by, here I am alone and blue
Some people cry and some people die by the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rollin' along
With the grace from the Lord above

People talkin' all around 'bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say, I know where their jive is at
A-one thing I do have on my mind
If you could clarify, please do
It's the way you call me another guy's name
When I try to make love, I got to make love
I really need to make love
Ooh, yes, every night, every night
Give it to me, c'mon

[guitar solo]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Step right up, i'm about to light up the skyline
So bright i'm about to fuck your whole night up
Light up your glow sticks, go stick a stick in your ass
This is the ghost of christmas past
This is your host, you're supposed to kiss his ass
This is gross, but listen close
Stick your whole nose in his crack then lets one go
And blows your whiskers back, then get a great whole whiff
Cause if you last it out, without passing out
You'll be on the next episode of fear factor
Yea back to, back to what?
I don't know, smack a little child actor's butt
Mike Jackson, what?
What the fuck you want? i got a blunt and some jesus juice
Who needs a excuse these days? the way they rally around
Pedophiles you're lucky i don't pee in your face
I can do anything and apologize for it later
As long as it isn't a racist tape from 88'
That cannot be forgave
If i drank pee for 18 years straight
And eat shit everyday on a porcelain plate
That was shaped like a toilet with a fork, and steak knife
For the rest of my life, i had to watch my wife
Get fucked by Vanilla Ice, twice a day
Cause i said N-I-G-G-A, when i was a teenager
Blah blah Shade-a 45
Shorty let me get your number baby, maybe
I can hump your leg, with something
But it's time for me to go, so i stopped
Jumped in the vehicle, it's like this
Because i

[Verse 1]
Her face is cracked from smiling, all the fears that she's been hiding
And she wonders pretty soon everybody's gonna know
And her voice is sore from shouting, cheering winners who are losing
And she wonders if their days are few and soon they'll have to go

[Chorus]
My, my, I'm so happy, I'm gonna join the band
We're gonna sing and dance in celebration
We're in the promised land

[Verse 2]
She hears them talk of new ways to protect the home she lives in
She wonders what it's all about when they break down the door
Her name is Brown, White or Black, you know her very well
You hear her cries of mercy as the winners toll the bell

[Chorus]
My, my, I'm so happy, I'm gonna join the band
We're gonna dance and sing in celebration
We're in the promised land

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
There is a train station heading for your destination
But the price you pay to nowhere has increased a dollar more
And if you walk you're gonna get there though it takes a little longer
And when you see it in the distance you will wring your hands and moan

[Outro]
Oh Yeah
You're gonna moan, you're gonna moan
Hear me, you'll moan

[Guitar Solo]
Hey, lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh, darlin', darlin', darlin', walk a while with me
Oh, you got so much, I really need so much, I have to have so much

Many times I've lied and many times I've listened
Many times I've gazed along the open road
Many times I've lied and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know
Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold
Some Acapulco gold, every time

[Guitar Solo]

Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missin'
Many, many men can't see the open road
Many is a word that only leaves you guessin'
A-guessin' 'bout a thing you really oughta know
You really oughta know, hoh
Ohhhhh, sure nuff
You know it's sure nuff
Okay, let's go!

[Verse 1]
Ohhhh, yeah
It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the Stroll
Ooh baby, let me get it back, let me get back
Let me get back, baby, where I come from

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Yes it has

[Verse 2]
It's been 

[?] a while since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just don't work right
Ooh baby, open your arms, open your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Ha!

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
It's been quite a while since the book of love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Ooh, baby, carry me back, carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I come from

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Sure has

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ah, rock it fuckin'
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

[Intro]

[Instrumental intro of "Bring It on Home"]

Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
Uh-uh child, is that the way you swing
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting
Ah ha, child when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip, I can't keep away

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I gotta roll, can't stand still
Got a flamin' heart, can't get my fill
Eyes that shine, burnin' red
Dreams of you all through my head

Ah ah...  (Ah ha)
Ah ah...  (Ah ha)
Ah ah...  (Ah ha)
Aaahh
Keep up
Keep up

[Guitar Solo]

Good evening!
Walking in the park just the other day, baby
What d'ya, what d'ya think I saw?
Crowds of people sitting on the grass
With flowers in their hair said, "Hey, boy, do you wanna score"

"Do I wanna score?"
I really don't know what time it was, whoa-ho-ho
So I asked 'em if I could stay a while

I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really
Ooh yes, I was really outta my mind
Just then, a policeman stepped up to us
Asked us, said, please, please, hey
Would we get, get in line, get in line

They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
Ho-ho-ho, he said that his friends would all stop by

Really don't you take a good look at yourself
And describe what you see
And baby, baby, baby, do ya like it?
There you sit, sittin' spare like a book on a shelf
Ohhhh, you're not rustin' baby, you ain't tryin' to fight it
I really don't care if they're comin', whoa-ho-ho
I believe that it's all a state of mind

[Guitar Solo]

If you go down in the streets today, baby, you better
Oooh, you better open your eyes, you know what I'm talkin' about
Folk down there really don't care, don't care
Really don't, which, a-which way the pressure lies
A-that's a lot of pressure

So I'm packin' my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits soar now
Over the hills where the spirits fly
I gotta get there, I gotta get there
Ohhhhh, rock it

I really don't know, know, know, know, know, know, know
I really don't know, know, know, know
I really don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh-oh-oh
Ahhhhhh, I've been workin' from seven, baby, to eleven every night
Ooh yeah, with miserable a drag, drag, draaaaag
People, I know you don’t think that’s right
I've really been the best, the best of fools
Ohh, yes, but I did what I could, yes, I did
Oh, I love you more, yes, I love you, baby
Oh, I love you, oh, I love you, oooh yeah

A-baby, since I've been lovin' you
I'm about to lose my worried mind
Ah, don't make me lose it

Everybody tryin' to tell me, tell me, ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh
That you didn't mean me no good
But I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried
Ohhhh, I've been tryin' to do the best I could
I've been a-workin', I've been a-workin', I've been a-workin' from seven, oh, baby, baby, to eleven every night
Your used a drag, whoa, used a drag, my used a drag, your used a drag
Sweet mama, sweet mama, I don't think that's right

Ohhhh, baby, since I've been lovin' you
I'm about to lose my worried mind
Oh, don't make me, don't make me, don't make me, don't make me, don't make me lose it

[Guitar Solo]

Ooh yes, I've been cryin', oh-ooo-oh, yeah
All my tears, they fell like rain, don'tcha see them fallin’?
Baby, can’t you see them fallin’, ah, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, can’t you see them fallin'?

Now you listen
Just you listen

Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door?
You had the nerve to tell me you didn't want me no more
I open my front door, I hear my back door slam
I said, hey baby, hey baby
I gotta feed the back door man, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohhhh, I've been workin' from seven
Oh, baby, to eleven every night
You used a drag, my used a drag, you're used a drag, now, mama, my used a drag
I don't, I don't, I don't think that's right

Ohhh, baby, since I've been lovin' you
I'm about to lose my worried mind
I can't lose it, I've been tryin' so hard
Ohhh, yeah-ee-yeah, yes, I've been tryin'

Oooh, baby, baby, I've been tryin', don't make me lose
Don't make lose my worried mind, whoa-oo-oh, ohhhh
Jimmy Page guitar!
This is called "No  Quarter"

[Verse 1]
Close the door, put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight, ohhoohohoh
The snow falls hard an' don't you know
The winds of Thor are blowin' cold cold cold col col col...
They're wearin' steel that's bright an' true oh, oh, oh, oh
To build a dream for me an' you ah-hahhhh

[Chorus]
They choose the path where no one goes
They hold no quarter, oh hoh
They ask, they ask no quarter, whoah yeah, whoa yeah, ohhhhh

[Keyboard Solo]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Walkin' side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howlin' more more more more more...
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me an' you ahhhh yes they do

[Chorus]
A-they choose the path where no one goes
They hold no quarter
They ask
They ask
They ask
They ask no quarter

Oh what misery without quarter
Oh the pain, the pain without quarter, oh-oh-oh
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ahh give me quarter, quarter, quarter
Oh give me...
This is called "The Song Remains The Same"

[Verse 1]
I had a dream, oh now
Crazy dream, ohh ho
Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go
Hear my song
People won't ya listen now?
Sing along, yeah
You don't know what you're missin' now
Any little song that ya know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it always grows
Push, push, yeah, ahhhohhhuhh

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu starbright
The song remains the same
Ooooooh yeah, ooh yeah

Sing out Hare Hare
Dance the Hoochie Koo
City lights oh so bright
As we go slidin', slidin'
Slidin', slidin'
Slidin', slidin'
Slidin', slidin'
Slidin'...

Ohhh here we go
Push, push, push, push, push
Ahhhhhhhhh

[Verse 1]
It is the springtime of my lovin'
This second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growin'
So little warmth I felt before
Ahhh, it isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low

Ah, ho oh oh
Ah, ho oh oh, ahh oh

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me, keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes, hohh
It is to you I give this tune
It isn't hard to recognize, ho-oh-oh
These things are clear
To all from time to time, oh-hohh

[Verse 3]
Talk, talk to me, talk to me
Now listen
I felt the coldness of my winter, ooh ooh, yeah-e-yeah
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us
But I know a-that I love you so
Ohhhh yeah, an' it feels good, it feels good now
But I know that I love you so

These are the seasons of emotion
And like the wind they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
An' people this is the mystery of the quotient
Upon us all, ohhhh a little rain must fall
Juh- juh- juh- just a little rain ohh, yeah I know

Ahhhhhh

[John Bonham]
We've done four already, but now we're steady
And then they went, "One, two, three, four"

Singin' in the sunshine, laughin' in the rain
Rockin' on the moonshine, rollin' in the grain
Got no time to pack my bag, my foot's outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late for the high hopes hailla ball
Uh-huh
Do it

Sittin' 'round, singin' songs 'till the night turns into day
Used to sing on the mountains, but the mountains washed away
Now I'm singin' all my songs to the girl who won my heart
Now, she's only four years old, and it's a real fine way to start

Ohhhhhh

La, la, la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Laa, la, la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La, la, la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Laa, la, la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Singin' to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar
Play for me and play for free and play a whole lot more
Singin' 'bout the good things, and the sun that lights the day
I used to sing to the ocean, has the ocean lost its way?
I don't think so

I don't know-hoh, I don't know-hoh-oo-ohh
I don't know, I don't know-hoh

It's so
Shoo-wop a-diddly-iddly, doo-wop a diddly-iddly
Doo-wop a diddly-iddly, doo-wop a diddly-iddly
Doo-wop a diddly-iddly, doo-wop
Doo-wop, ohhhh ohhhh, oh, it's so good
It's so good, so-oh goo-ooo-ood

[Intro]

[Chorus]
I've been dazed an' confused for so long it's not true
I wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Now lots of people talkin', pretty few of them a-know
Soul of a woman was created below, that's right

You're the one, you're the one

[Verse 1]
Oh, everybody's been talkin', Lord
I swear they been talkin' trash (trash)
The way that ya push, push, push, push, push, push me darlin'

Jimmy Page, electric guitar
I think this is a song of hope

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
And when she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for

Oohoohooh oohoohoohoohooh

And she's buying a stairway to heaven

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook there's a songbird that sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

And I think you can see that
Ohh

[Chorus]
And it makes me wonder, sure does
Oh hoh hoh, hohooh ohoohohooh, yes sir

[Verse 2]
There's a feelin' I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Ah hah. Ah hah
Ah hah. Ah hah. Ahhhahhohoohohooh

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

Does anybody remember laughter?

Baby! Oh, baby look...
Just give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Sure does, sure does

But I got some good news, listen...

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

I hope so

Oohh! Baby, baby, baby
Ya, darlin' babe
Ya, darlin' babe
Ya, darlin' babe

Wait a minute...

[Verse 5]
Your head is hummin' and it won't go in case ya don't know
The piper's callin' you to join him
Dear Lady, can you hear the wind blow and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whisperin' wind?

Ohh hah hahhahhh

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our souls
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold, yeah
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all is one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll, not to roll

[Outro]
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
Ahhahhhhohhahhoh

[Verse 1]
You need coolin'
Woman, I ain't foolin'
I'm gonna say it yeah
Go back to schoolin'
A-way down inside

And there ain't a lower league, all in my ovaries
The fur on my shoulder mink, tell me what Hov would think

And I rock a sew-in weave (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
I run it, I run it, I relay the win
They talkin', they talkin', I'm takin' it in

Smelling like Bahamas for sure

After dark, it gets a little loose
A lotta voli 3-0-5, no goose
Straight water, straight lime, no juice
Catch me on top of that ya, (heh) no roof
Travel 'round the world like it's a new sport
Move and escape to New York

[Verse 1]
Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long just watch an' see
How the fellas lay their money down

[Verse 2]
Her style is new but the face is same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

[Verse 3]
Ooh yeah, it's been ten years and maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

[Verse 4]
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
I'll just keep on rollin' along
With the grace of the Lord above

[Verse 5]
People talkin' all around
'Bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at

[Verse 6]
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me another guy's name, name, name, name, name, awww yee-ahhh

[Guitar Solo]

Ooooh yeahhh

[more Guitar Solo]

[Verse 7]
Ohhhhh, work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried

[Outro]
Heartbreaker, your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away, heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
Ah, ah, child, when you shake that thing
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting
Ah, ah, child, when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip, I can't keep away

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Refrain]
Oh-oh

Lemme tell ya, lemme tell ya, lemme tell ya, it really makes life a drag

[Verse 1]

Oh have mercy, I did what I could, yeah, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, since I've been loving you

Seven, seven, seven, seven, oh, to eleven every night

Oooooooooooooooooh, I've been cryin', cryin'-oh
All my tears they fell like rain, rain
Whoahhhhhh, somebody hear them calling
Please, please, please, whoa-oh-oh, now listen

[Verse 3]
Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door
You had the nerve to tell me you didn't want me no more

Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Refrain]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure
All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows
If the stores are all closed
With a word, she can get what she came for
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook
There's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven, you know

Ah-oh

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts, I have seen
Rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking, that's you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon
If we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn
For those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter, remember laughter

[Chorus]
Ohhh yeah-ee-yeah, yeah-ee-yeah, yeah-ee-yeah, yeah-ee-yeah, yeah-ee-yeah, yeah-ee-yeah
And it makes me wonder, wait a minute

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May-Queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It really, really, really, really, really makes

[Verse 5]
Your head is humming and it won't go
Because you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind, oh-oh

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know, yeah
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last, yeah
When all is one and one is all, that's what it is
To be a rock and not to roll-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooll, yeah

[Outro]
And she's buying a stairway to heaven

[Verse 1]
Yeah, caught you smiling at me
That's the way it should be
Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine, let's hear it
Yeah, all the good times we had
I sang love songs so glad
Always smiling, never sad, so fine

[Chorus]
As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singing a song, hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling Mother Nature about you and me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, if the wind was so right
Or on our way it's darkest night
The road we choose is always right, so fine
Yeah, can your love be so strong
When so many loves go wrong
Will our love go on and on and on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singing a song, hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me

[Bridge]
My my, law-dee-law, come on now it ain't too far
Tell your friends all around the world
Ain't no companion like a blue-eyed merle
Come on now well let me tell ya
What you're missing, missing, 'round these brick walls

[Guitar Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Everybody!
Yeah, of one thing I am sure
It's a friendship so pure
Angels singing all around, my dog's so fine
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do
Spend my natural life with you
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine

[Outro]
When you're old and your eyes are dim
Ain't no old Shep gonna happen again
We'll still go walking down country lanes
I'll sing the same old songs
Hear me call your name, Strider!
Good evening!
This is going to be Going To California

[Verse 1]
Spend my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind, make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair, I didn't see too many this time
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all all the same

[Verse 2]
Hoh, the sea was red and the sky was grey
I wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
The children of the sun began to awake, come on children

[Verse 3]
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking, ah ah
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll see you up there where the path
Runs straight and high, oh-ooooh-ooooh

[Verse 4]
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and she sings, Joni
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in a mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems, ooh-ooh-ooh, sure is hard, yeah

Oh, its hard

Oh

[Verse 1]
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you
I can't play with you no more
I don't know how I'm gonna do what mama told me
My friend, the boy next door

I can't believe what people sayin'
You're gonna let your hair hang down
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
You're in the darkest side of town, whatcha doin, whatcha doin, whatcha doin there, I know

[Bridge]
And when I'm out I see you walking
Why don't your eyes see me
Could it be you've found another game to play
What did mama say to me, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
That's the way Ohhhh, oh, oh yeah-ee-yeah, oh now
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma, ma m-m-ma m-m-mama
That's the way it ought to stay, I don't think so
Sho' don't think so
Ohhh oh-oh-oh, Ohhh oh-oh-oh, oh, oh oh-oh, whoa

[Verse 2]
And yesterday I saw you standing by the river
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying, dying
Had they got you hypnotized, oh dear

An' yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers
But all that lives is born to die
And so I say to you that nothing really matters, no no
And all you do is stand and cry, I know, I know

[Chorus]
That's the way
That's the way it oughta be
Oh don't you know now
And when I wake up in the morning, morning, I tell my mama
That's the way it oughta gonna stay, I don't think so, uh uh, oh

Ohhh oh-oh-oh, Ohhh oh-oh-oh, oh, ah-ah-ah
Hey, it ain't right, it ain't right, it ain't right, it ain't right, it ain't right, mama

It ain't right, it ain't right, it ain't right, it ain't right, no-no-oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Oooooh, I've been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
I wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lots of people talkin', few of them know-ooo-ow
Soul of a woman was created below, and I like it
Oh-oooh-oh yeah, ma

[Verse 1]
Everybody's been talkin', Lord, I swear they been talkin' trash
Ohhhhh sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet babe, I can't take too much of that
Come on, come on, come on, come on, show me the way
Oh, I want to make love to you little girl twenty-five hours a day
Oh, that's all I want

[Verse 2]
Said you're hard and abused, tellin' all of your lies
Oh sweet sweet baby Lord, I said how you hypnotize
Take it easy, baby, let them say what they will
Will your tongue wag so much when I send you the bill
I
Oh, no, no, no, oh
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it

It's to a castle I will take you
Well what's to be, they say will be

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave the day
Way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By takin' our time, ahh yeah

And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh what fun it all would be, yeah
What's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be, ahh I said

And happiness is what everybody needs so bad
Well, lemme tell ya, the answer lies in you, oh yes

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave the day
Way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow

Well, the wind won't blow and we really shouldn't go
And it only goes to show, yeah
Ride the wind, we're gonna see it spin
Gonna sh

Everybody I know seems to know me well
But they really didn't know that I fall out o' hell
Baby baby baby, just give me the good things, mama love ya
Oh yes, uh-huh
Oh, you just sold out on me

[Verse 1]
Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman who knows

[Chorus]
You know it's all right
I said it's all right
I know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start

[Verse 2]
Now crazy ways are evident
In the way you're wearin' your clothes
Sippin' booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow

[Chorus]

You told your mam'er I'd get you home
But you didn't say I got no car

With a tadpole in a jar

I guess it's all in my heart ohhh
You'll be my only, my one and only

So, dancing days are here again
As the evening starts to grow

I said it's all right
You know it's all right
I know it's all in my, all in my, all in my

Ah ah, yeah

Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar

Sitting around singing songs 'til the night turns into day
Used to sing on the mountains but the mountains washed away

Taylor: I mean, yeah, we could do that.

We could do that, right?

Yeah. I mean, did you have a fancy introduction planned?

No?

Did you have a song prepared?

Do we really, well, funny you should mention - no, no song. No song prepared, that's not gonna -

Not at all? And I came all the way to Canada.

Focusing on the year 1989, it was a great year. Do you know what the Best Picture that year was?

I do not.

The movie that won Best Picture in 1989: Rain Man.
Amazing!

Good movie, right?

Fantastic.

Good movie. The Album of the Year, do you know the 

[?] that won a Grammy? It's the first time that this has happened, really, to you?

Yeah.

In an interview about an album called 1989?

Well, I just figured you'd just want to show off your knowledge.

Well, it's the internet, it's not really showing off.

Okay.

George Michael's Faith!

Amazing!

Album of the Year.

This is actually educational.
It's pretty good, right? But I was happy that it wasn't, like, there weren't too sketchy things. Those were really good things that stand up. Rain Man is still great to watch, Faith is still a fantastic album.

"Like a Prayer" by Madonna came out in 1989, one of the most influential pop songs and music videos of all time.

You were born.

I was in 1989 for two weeks.

Yeah, that's okay. That's okay.

But it still happened in that year.

It happened in 1989. You've only released a studio album four times previous to this, so this is something that doesn't happen to you all that often. So, the title of it -

It's really important.

The theme of it is really important, right? When was the moment you decided it was gonna be 1989?

Actually, no one... this is why I like talking to you, because no one has ever come at it from this angle and actually asked me that specific question. It's actually a really interesting moment. I remember exactly when I decided that I was gonna call it 1989. It was the night of the Grammys this year. After the Grammys I didn't go to any afterparties or anything, I kind of wanted to go home and eat In-N-Out Burger with my friends. I remember going home and playing a lot of the new music I had recorded for some of my backup singers and one of my best friends. We were all sitting in the kitchen and I was playing them all this music, and they were just saying, ‘you know, this is very eighties. It’s very clear to us that this is so eighties.’ We were just talking and talking about how it’s kind of a rebirth in a new genre, how that’s a big bold step, how, kind of, starting a part of your career over. When they left that night, I just had this very clear moment of, ‘it’s gotta be called 1989. It's gotta be called that. We're talking about creative rebirth, my birth year, the album is eighties-influenced.' I didn't know I was doing that but I was doing that.

You didn't know you were doing that?

I didn't mean to do it, I just was doing it. And so, then, after that, I really was able to focus on the, kind of, eighties sonic concept. And then it really came together as a very sonically cohesive project.

Were you still writing songs in the traditional way, with a guitar?
Yes and no, I mean, some of them I wrote on piano, some of them I wrote on guitar. Some of them I would think of some synth line in my head and sing it into my phone and send it to my co-writers and say, ‘do you think this would sound cool?’

Like, without words, just singing the, kind of, synth line?

Yeah! Or singing a drum beat over top of it, and I would send it to them and I'd go, ‘I don’t have the right keyboard to make this sound in my house. I just have a piano and a guitar, but let me play it for you on piano and let you know what I think the bassline should be, and we can start there.’ Or it would be a first line of a first verse, or it would be, sort of, an image that I wanted to create a feeling around. We would just start with this image I had, or a story. It was a lot different than making any of my other albums.

It was?

Yeah.

Biggest difference was what?

The biggest difference was that I didn't have any, I didn't have any boundaries around me production-wise. You know, one of my favorite things about country music is that it taught me how to tell stories. Coming up in the Nashville songwriting community was the greatest thing that could've ever happened to me because it taught me how to weave a story together with very, um, very detailed, personal details but also some, kind of, like, poetic, purple imagery. I love, kind of, I love how it all came about with my career, but at this point, it felt like I wanted to go and run in a direction that I had never run in before, which was, "I wanna be able to use whatever instruments I want, whatever drum sounds I want, whatever vocal stylings I want. I want to build and layer things, and I don't want someone to say, 'well, this isn't country.'" You know? And for me to be trying to prove that it was. So the reason this felt like a much more free experience was because I was able to write songs without the worry people would say it wasn't in the genre it was supposed to be in. So in labelling it pop and just calling it what it was, you know, when you make a pop album nobody's gonna look at it and say, "well, that's not pop." So I didn't have any restraints on me.

Jason Aldean recently said something about how you're not gonna hear him writing a song about being a Wall Street stock broker because he doesn't even know where Wall Street's at, and that was the -

He's gotta know where that is.

I think he-

It's in New York.

That's where he keeps his money.

He's gotta know. He knows where it's at.

I think he was trying to say, just why -

I get what he's trying to say, though. Sorry, I was just, like, my dad is a stock broker who would've just been, like, his brain would be, like, 

[*brain exploding gestures.*]

I understand that that's his life and talking about, "this is where I grew up, what I grew up knowing." What you grew up knowing is much different. It's international.

Yeah.

It's the world. You've been traveling the world for a long time.

I completely understand what he was saying there, because, I mean, with me, it's the same thing. It's like, as my life has changed, I need to continue to write about it, and I need to continue to write about even the things that change, like moving to New York and, you know, focusing more on my girlfriends rather than boyfriends. Like, these are things that are, kind of, the focal point of this new album. And as much of when I was in high school, I would sing about what my life was, which was, you know, sneaking out at night, and driving in trucks with your first boyfriend, and falling in love, and that, kind of, innocent summer romance thing, small towns, dirt roads. That was actually my life in high school. It's not anymore. So if I were to continue to write songs about that, I feel like it would be very disingenuous, and as a songwriter, that's the exact opposite of the goal I'm trying to accomplish.

In listening to the songs I've heard already, they're still, they're very much story songs. You tell a story in each one. There's a beginning, a middle, and an end, and that's something that you focus on.

Definitely. I mean, I think that's kind of engrained in me, and that's the one part of my songwriting that I don't think should change as everything else does. I think that my fans have gotten used to receiving my diary entries every two years, and getting that album and going, "oh, this is what she's been through the last two years."

I meet a bunch of people who are in the public eye, but not quite like, there's nobody in the public eye like you. There's a few on the planet, and there's nothing that could prepare you for that. Am I right? There's nothing in life that could prepare you for that.

I feel really lucky because I don't feel like I was shot out of a cannon, you know? A lot of people have their first single come out and it is everywhere, and all of a sudden they have a triple-platinum single, and there's all this anticipation about their album and then, all of a sudden, people start to tear them down, and it all happens over the course of six months to a year. My career build, I mean, we're going on, it's about nine years now since I put out my first album?

The record label was signed in 2005, right? The record deal rather, sorry.

We're going on almost ten years, so it's been a really, really gradual arc, and that doesn't mean that sometimes it doesn't feel that it's at a crazy fever pitch that no one could ever prepare you for, but as much as you could possibly be prepared for it, I feel like time has kind of prepared me for it. I mean, some days I wake up and am absolutely overwhelmed by how abnormal my life is. It's not normal to have security with you wherever you go. It's not normal to have assistants. It's not normal to have hair and makeup every day. It's not normal -

To give you people heat for holding a cat a certain way on the streets of New York.

That cat loves being held like that!

I know! No, I know! But you can't do anything without somebody at some point on some website, "well, the cat doesn't, this isn't right for the cat to be out like that."

The cat loves it. The cat, here's the thing -

Is that Olivia?

Yeah, that's Olivia. Yeah, you're right, exactly. And when everything that you do is debated upon, scrutinized, questioned, everybody feels entitled to ask you why you did everything. There are days where I feel really, really okay with that, honestly, but then there are days where I just, am kind of overwhelmed by all of it, and I think that that's okay. I try to encourage my fans that they don't have to feel confident every day, they don't have to feel happy every day, they don't have to feel pretty every day, they don't have to feel wanted every day. That they shouldn't put added, extra pressure on themselves to feel happy when they're not, you know? I think being honest with yourself emotionally is really important.

When you signed that record deal in 2005, is there any advice you would go back and give to that girl that was signing that day? Or because the slow and gradual build it kind of worked out? I mean, it's obviously all worked out okay. What advice are you gonna give to somebody like that?

I don't think I'd wanna give her too much advice, I would... oh, I think I would tell her to laugh more. Just, you know, if you laugh at yourself first it's less funny when other people make fun of you. I would also explain to her the actual definition of feminism, because I didn't know it when I was younger. I think those are two important things for girls to know, going into this business or going into life itself. But all the other things, all the really intense, times I felt serious pain or rejection or humiliation or embarrassment, those have all produced the songs I'm the most proud of. There was this crazy circumstance that happened where I wrote this song "Mean" about the harshest criticisms I've ever gotten. It was brutal. And that song ended up winning two Grammys.

Spectacular, yeah. In hindsight you don't 

[?], but if you knew something was coming, if someone said to you, "there's something coming around the corner, it's brutal, you're gonna want to, you know, hoodie for three weeks, you're never gonna want to deal with it. But the result will be Album of the Year."

Oh my God, you'd do anything for that!

Fair enough. Like I said earlier, this is one of the things you don't get to do all the time. You get to go on stage a lot, you get to be interviewed a lot, all of these things happen to you, but album releases don't happen a lot.

They don't.

They don't happen a lot.

I'm really soaking it in.

Yeah? Do you still get as excited? I know you were saying you're more proud of this than any of them.

Yeah. I'm so excited, I mean, honestly. Because having spent the last year and a half, just kind of living my life on my own terms and not, not dating, not focusing on really anything else other than figuring out the album I wanted to make, there's such an incentive for me, like, I'm so proud of it. And I've always been proud of my albums, but there's something about this one, where I feel like I actually did something different this time. I actually made something that is cohesive and fits together and has its own sound and something I was so focused on. And I can be focused on my fans, and I can, you know, like, I'm not tired right now during this interview. Like, I'm not distracted, I'm just, kind of, I'm just, really taking it in.

The highs that you get on stage, almost nobody gets to experience, what you experience on stage. Which, again on the planet. You have one of those jobs that's very rare. What's second to that? What's the thing that comes the closest to the electricity that you feel when you're on stage?

I would say it's different all the time, but right now it's, like, seasonal stuff. Like, I get as excited about being on stage as I get about cozy things. Because just the idea of seasons changing. This is the time of year where I'm so out-of-control excited about the fact that it's fall. Guess what's next? Winter.

Yes, so you're gonna have a hard time getting anybody here excited about that.

It's two seasons that I love, and I can bake stuff all the time, and then I can give it to people. I can try out new recipes, I can wear sweaters, I can wear knee socks. I could even buy sweaters for my cats to wear.

Okay.

I could do any of that, because it's that kind of season!

But that's almost as exciting as being on stage in front of forty thousand people?

You have to understand that if you're choosing your first place as being something like, "ahhhhhhh," the second place has to be something that evens that out, which is, like, baking day with your friends.

But your answer really is, "I don't need another high like that, because that's the one I get by going on stage."

I think that is actually my revised answer.

You mentioned feminism. You have, almost by happy accident, become a real icon for girls and women, and you said earlier that that would be one of the things you might make sure you would change if you were to go back and talk to younger you, is to, kind of, narrow down that definition, or define the definition of feminism. Do you realize, kind of, how great that it is for young girls to see what you're doing? I mean, you get to experience that 

[?], right? When you talk to parents of young girls, right?

That's awesome. It's interesting because I think that feminism is such an important conversation to be having. Especially right now, because with girls out there in the world living their lives, knowing what it means is so important, because all it means is that they feel they should be treated exactly the same way as guys. They should be given equal opportunities and rights. And I think the more people like Lena 

[Dunham] talk about it, like, Lorde and Emma Watson talk about it, and the fact that it's becoming, sort of, a conversation that is top-of-mind in the media. I think it's so incredible. I've always made music so I could feel camaraderie with my fans, not in a way that was trying to cater to, kind of, any male fantasy, and that wasn't on purpose, that's just been what has felt natural to me. When asked early on about feminism in my career, I just, I think I was probably fifteen the first time I was asked about it. And so I would just say, "I don't talk about politics, I don't really understand that stuff yet, so I guess I'm just gonna say I'm not." And I wish that when I was younger I would've known that it's simply hoping for gender equality.

Probably not so fair of the interviewer to ask a fifteen-year-old about that.

You know, that's an interesting point to make. But I think that, in the media, it's very interesting to witness, on a daily basis. You know, you go online, and we all see these gossip blogs every single time we log on, because we're curious and that's the society we live in. But you'll see these polls, like, "vote on who has a better butt! This woman or this woman?" And you never see "who has a better butt: this man or this man?" It just never happens. "Who's the hotter mama: this woman or this woman?" It's not, like, "who's the sexiest dad: this man or this man?" You just don't see it. And people are allowed to pit women against each other and vote, and they think it's an innocent thing, when really it's kind of warping your mind that, you know. And if a young girl logs on and votes, it's like she's going, "oh my God, if that girl in my class is pretty and smart, then maybe everyone's comparing me to her, and maybe I should hate her." And that's just, it's feeding this negativity and I really think that with girls, kind of, banding together, in music, in culture, in movies, whatever. I think it's nice to see people actually cheer each other on and girls be friends with each other, because hopefully that will kind of bleed into the classroom, and the playground, and the campus, and all that.

I know it seems like disposable entertainment for adults, but it's not only adults who are seeing this stuff.

It's mostly not adults.

It's mostly not adults.

It's mostly very impressionable kids and young girls who are still forming their ideas of who they actually are. And to warp their opinions of other girls, that just adds anxiety to their life that they don't need.

This kind of brings me to talking about your legacy, and I know, I think five albums in it's appropriate to start talking a little bit about that. I'm guessing that you try very hard to make sure that the music you make, you release the things you take part in enough, that they'll all be able to stand up. Not just to the test of time, say, sonically or whatever, but that you can continue to be proud of this, is that right?

Yeah, it's completely right, it's dead-on. I've always had this thing where I think about what, if I'm lucky enough to have grandkids someday, what they would say. If they looked back on pictures, and videos, and things like that, and I'd sure they'd laugh at me and make fun of my awkwardness and things like that. But I would never want to embarrass them. It's interesting because it's like the whole role model question, like, are you a role model? Do you think about the little kids in the front row when you're doing all the things you're doing in this life? I think that's an unnecessary pressure to put on yourself, but it's easier when you make it about your own life, your own legacy, when you, kind of, bring it in house, and you're, like, "what if I have a five-year-old someday? And what if someday my ten-year-old goes online for the first time? Like, what do I want her to see about me?"

That's a pretty good way to look at it.

It's something that happens very naturally where if you're, kind of, just taking accountability and responsibility for your own actions, it's kind of a natural thing that happens, where, you know, all of a sudden you have parents coming up and thanking you, and you're just, sort of, like, "hm, well, you're welcome." Where you were just, kind of, trying to live a good life, because I think, you know, you don't want to feel like you're the national president of the babysitters club, but you do wanna try to do good things, and make ripples, and good echoes in society, and culture, and all that.

But you are doing that, and in the music that I've heard already, man, are people gonna get a kick out of hearing this, and experiencing it live. It's great, congratulations on this.

Good. Thank you!

It's epic. The album's out.

Thank you! It's great to talk to you, as always.

As always. Thanks, Taylor.

Awesome.

Nice job.

Thanks! You're so good!

Thank you, thank you for doing this.

I always end up telling you stuff that I've never thought to say in interviews.

[Verse 1]
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long-forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time now to do the things we never have

[Verse 2]
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time now to do the things we never have

[Bridge]
Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you
(So whatcha gonna do?)

[Chorus]
It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time now to do the things we never have

Yeah, feelings, so deep in my feelings

[Outro: Ella Mai]
This is such a crazy feeling, like
I don't want to get too attached, but
I feel like I already am
My mind's telling me one thing, but
I guess I should listen to my heart
Right?

Chun-Li when I street fight, bust back
You ain't got combos, what's that?
Rock bitches on Mortal Kombat (Finish her)
It's tricky to rock a rhyme
Merk bitches on SSX

Mic check 'em like "test, test, test"

[Verse 2]
Master of my craft, never played Minecraft

Be on my Halo tingz
Look at my Sonic rings
Awooga, don't push me
I "hadouken," hear the “toasty”?
Donkey Kong when he drum on that pussy
I don't play but I sure ain't no rookie
Steal a nigga like a bandit, boo
Then spend every penny of his bands and loot
Now she think that I'm the devil like a bandicoot
Wawawawawawa what you wanna do?
Yo, can I get it, get it yah?

That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
'Cause ever since I left the city, you

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before
'Cause ever since I left the city, you

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

[Intro: Jazze Pha]
"Ladies and gentlemen, lions, tigers and bears, giraffes, sea urchins, alligators and all that shit. I am Jazze Phenzel Burgandy Obama Luther King Jr. Jackson 5 the First, and I'd like to introduce to you Block Hemzell, AKA BLOCKHAMPTON! Oh, boy—ladies and gentlemen!"

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Jazze Pha]
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Thirty-two hundred on the jacket like Magic Johnson
Got a couple chains off Slauson
Silhouette lookin' like Charlie's Angels
I loose up with a drip of sangria
Wipe that smirk, life ain't that serious
Love when you're double bunned up, like Leia
Make me wanna check my blood pressure
Am I being too obvious?
I got a crush, it's nothing else, I swear, it's nothing else
Wake up, feelin' like Adriana Lima
Wavin' my feet, yo, right up out the Bimmer
Do my dance like ooh, la, la, when she strut like "oh my god"
Make me sweat like exercise, double up, milkshake and fries

[Verse 2: Joba]
I heard a call from the mountain top: "Joba!"
So I put my cloak on and I walked
Coined a peasant in the grasslands with a wand
Cast my spells with some peasants, now we roam
We left our shanties in the village with nowhere to go
Just a group of outcasts with the gift of hope
Well, now we're eating grapes, and the finest cheese
Achieving wisdom from the wizards we were trying to be
Now other people from our village want to come with me
The thing with magic is you cannot have it if you don't believe
You did not believe, they did not believe
You can't tell me things, this was all foreseen
You're not one with me
I bought a horse with the shillings that you took
And then gave back to me
I met the queen that you praise so much, she's into me
I bought a castle in the Shire with the moat and the catapult
I keep it clean with my medieval flow

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Jazze Pha]
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon & Joba]
Martin had a dream for a nigga like me to show up like this
Why you gotta hate? Looking at my pace
With your face screwed; hope it get stuck like this
Never even cared to appear or adhere my career
Trust me, you don't gotta touch my shit
Pulling every card out the cuff, no bluff is enough to discuss
I won't be the one to rush that shift
Couldn't crush my gift even if I'm in a thousand pieces
Listening to menaces that pledge allegiance
To my every weakness, why they spreading secrets?
Called my dreams facetious, bet they can't believe this
Or they act like the world shoulda knew about me
All I know is they wanted to move without me
How they used to doubt me, but you can’t renounce me
Like la, la, la, la

[Bridge: bearface]
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Straight to the fire, right 'til you move on
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Straight to the fire, right 'til you move on
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie, whoop!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Joba]
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la, la, la, la

[Outro: Matt Champion]
Thirty-two hundred on the
Thirty-two hundred on the

[Verse]
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fuckin' head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leavin' you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers? We blowin' up your house killin' your parents
And comin' back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keepin' a promise as Nostradamus
'Cause I ain't makin' no more threats
I'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head, maybe more
'Cause I smoked crack today, yesterday and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
Motherfucker!

[Intro]
Yo, yo
(Huh, huh, huh, huh)
Aight, aight (huh)
Slim Shady
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse]
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4 door Ford
But I'm more towards droppin' an acappella that'll chop a fella
To mozzarella, worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showin'
Developin' anorexia while I'm standin' next to ya
Eatin' a full course meal watchin' you starve to death
With an IV in your veins feedin' you liquid darvocet
Pumpin' you full of drugs, pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receivin' with the asses ripped out of they pants and given
A less than 20 percent chance of livin'
Have a possible placement, it's a hospital patient
Storin' the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream, "I'm still alive!"
Drivin' a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pullin' your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpets and burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight, you need a crowbar to pry her apart with

[Outro]
Motherfucker
Slim Shady, bitch
Recognize
For the 99
I'm on February 23rd

[Intro]
Yeah, Link Up TV, Behind Barz
Big up man like Rashid, Joey, Tadas, yeah
Shoutout Giggs for settin' the ting
SN1, OVO
Mm-hmm, yeah, look

[Chorus]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like Rs and Vs and Os
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'Chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones

[Verse 1]
Staying in big six-six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after it snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm gettin' up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm takin' the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seein' a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're takin' control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get rushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turnin' these yutes into dust

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah
Big Scorpion, out now
Yeah, look

[Chorus]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like Rs and Vs and Os
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at Nobu
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones

[Verse 2]
Think you know me? That's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slewed
Throwin' up six like man had flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried 'bout sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck about jeans and crep
Or goin' to Milan or goin' to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that and let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, dun that clash
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots in cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like goin' tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
I'ma just end that there, that's that

[Outro]

Maddas, jheeze!

[Verse 1]
Hard to read, you could be OCD
You could be bad for me, you could say anything
Sometimes I get a bit TMI, little bit scared of heights
Little afraid to say
You know the things that make me smile
The face I make before my tears fall down
The things that I feel when you're acting suspicious
You know the place I run to hide
I take my problems there to work 'em out

[Chorus]
These are the things that could make us official
Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

[Verse 2]
Hard to read, you could be OCD
You could be bad for me, you could say anything
Sometimes I get a bit TMI, little bit scared of heights
Little afraid to say
You know the shapes my body makes
Under the sheets at 4 AM with you
The things that we break when we're switchin' positions
You know the words to my mistakes
You understand because you made 'em too

[Chorus]
These are the things that could make us official
Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

[Bridge]
All of the things that we sometimes forget
All of the dreams that you put in my head
I'm still asleep, but there's breakfast in bed
These are the things that could make us official
Maybe the sky might not always be blue
All of my wishes will never come true
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm here with you
This stuff could make us official
So tell all your friends 'cause we're goin' official

[Chorus]
Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You mad or you jealous, you sad or you settle
The brighter the rainbow, the badder the weather
The good with the bad, but the badder the better
Bring my sand to the beach, nigga, and to the desert
We fell from the heavens, we landed like feathers
The rose in the rubble, keep your nose out our petals
Your hoes know my schedule, and my hoes know I'm special
They know not to question, bitch, you know I'm not Alexa
She, she post a pic of me and her from off her iPad
You know them hoes don't like that, where the likes at?
Jealousy is a disease, you can die mad
Tunechi, Sean, CB, Khaled, hi there (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, DJ Khaled, & Lil Wayne]

Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Together)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Dawg, it's these jealous ass hoes I can't relate to
The type to follow you but hardly follow through
You say I'm on your mind, I'm wondering why I'm not on you
Girl, you're fresh out the shower
Towel around your head like you're Erykah Badu
It's lookin' like a spa day
I rearrange your chakras, listenin' to Sade
Let's take a road trip and get high on the highway (Swerve, swerve)
Migrate, spend time, lay back, watch the sky change, woah
And I hear the jealousy, but look, I never listen
The quickest way to let something die is lack of attention (Straight up)
And you got it all, you looking good as my intentions (Damn)
We on an ascension, straight up

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
But girl, I can tell you need some love in your life (Let's ride)
And I'm the one, don't let no one change your mind (Oh)
Fuck what they say (Fuck 'em)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Let's go)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Oh, oh, woah)

Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Woah)

Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Together)

[Bridge: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]

You could drop a dime, but I make it make sense
Girl, you coming home with me

They don't want us together
They played themselves (Played themselves)
Baby, I got an idea
Let's be together forever (Forever)
I think I hit a lick, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

[Bridge]
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Chorus]
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart

Take it like a thief in the night
Hold me like a pillow
Make me feel right
Baby, I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keeping
You can come inside
And when you enter, you ain't leaving
Be my prisoner for the night, ooh

[Chorus]
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
'Cause I'm the only one who understands
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one

Oh, make it last all night, night
Take me for a ride, ride
Oh, baby, take me high, high
Let me make you rise, rise
Make it last all night

[Chorus]
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
'Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world

Tired of this place

I need to get away

It's time for me to go now

I can't stay, no, no, no, no

Just like any bird
I need to spread my wings

And fly across the ocean

See what the new day brings

'Cause I'm a seagull, yeah

In the first verse of this song

The singer, um, portrays
Himself as a free spirit
He does this by using the metaphor

Of a seagull
A creature untethered...

To gravity

No, I can't stay on
This cold, little rock

No, it's time for me to go

My mind's made up

It's the mind of a seagull
Yeah, yeah

'Cause I'm a seagull
I got the mind of a seagull

Yeah

In this fascinating second verse

He talks about leaving a rock
The rock, obviously
Represents a relationship

Which has grown cold
And uninhabitable

Wanna fly up in the sky

There's something more I seek

I wanna feel the warmth of the
Morning sun across my beak

'Cause I'm a seagull, yeah, yeah

I got a beak, yeah, yeah

This verse, he talks about

Leaving the rock again

Well, the relationship, obviously

Feeling the sun on his beak

The beak is, obviously, a
Phallic symbol. It's his penis
I'm a seagull

A seagull I will always be

Dive into the ocean

Dip my beak into the sea

Oh, here we go now

I'm a seagull, yeah, yeah

I'm trying to lift this piano

I'm trying to lift it
With my hopeless wings

Damn these feathered things
Ah, no, no, no

Feathered curse of being
A seagull, yeah, yeah

I have absolutely no idea
What he's talking about now

One day I found this piano

It washed up on this
Cold, little rock

Since that day, I've been
Playing my piano nonstop

'Cause I'm a piano playing seagull

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm totally confused

Uh, he seems to be mixing
Metaphors here with the piano

What's--what's the piano
A metaphor for?

Is that--is that a lost dream?

Or what's the--?

Sorry, what's the-- Excuse me

We're just doing an
Analysis of the song

-What's the piano a metaphor for?
-No, the piano is a piano

Yeah, it's literally a piano
Yeah, yeah, yeah

It's just a piano?

Yeah, that's right, it's a piano

-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I-s the rock a relationship

That has grown cold over time?

The rock is just a rock

So, the beak isn't
Phallic symbolism?

No, no

The beak is not my cock, no, no

So this is just a song about

A very musical seagull?

I'm literally a keyboard
Playin' seabird

That sings

I keep on playin'

Seabird playin' my piano

With my wings, oh

Literally, a seagull, yeah

Who sometimes shits on people, yeah

Literally a seagull, yeah

Piano solo! Yeah!

Oh, I wish I had some fingers

Oh, damn these feathered things

Literally, a seagull, yeah, yeah

Everybody!

Literally, a seagull, yeah, yeah

Literally, a keyboard
Playin' seabird

That sings
Okay, this is a song called
"The Summer of 1353."

With Nigel

The New Zealand Symphony
Orchestra, on cello

Hold on. I forgot it

'Twas the summer of 1353

And I sat beneath a willow tree

I decided upon that day I would be

A-wooing a lady

I went to the florist
And I said to she
"I need a flower
For today I will be

"A-woo-woo-woo, a-wooing

"A lady

"I'll hold this flower
Beneath her nose

It should smell as sweet as a rose"

Both: "For this," she
Said, "I'd recommend

"A rose

"For a rose-like scent
I'd probably go

With a rose"

Then I went to the tailor

For to buy some clothing
Of the latest style
Which at that time

Was tights and pointed boots

I got the very tightest tights

And the pointiest of boots

Then I said to the hairdresser

"Cut my hair"

"I'll cut it like the page boys wear

"Just a straight line
Across the brow

"I'll get a ruler and some scissors

"And do it for you now

"It's a very hot look

If you're trying to woo a lady"

Then I needed a horse
So I went to the stables

Said, "Stable Man, would I be able

To hire a horse from
Which to woo milady?"

"Sire, there are two things
That I must see

One florin and
One form of picture ID"

"Alas, I have no ID on me

Who even carries ID?
It's 1353"

"I maketh not the rules"

Quoth he

I had a very unflattering
Tapestry made of me

Then from a hilltop
A lady, I did view

And I knew exactly what I must do

The time had come
For me to woo this lady

So I said

Both:
"Woo-hoo, woo-hoo-hoo

"Woo-hoo, lady, I am wooing you

Woo-hoo, woo-ooh-hoo
I woo you, lady"

This lady then said unto me

"You can't woo me so easily

It takes more than going
'Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh' to a lady"

But, lady, look, beneath your nose

It is a rose-scented flower
Which I call a rose

I have a very large horse

And the tightest clothes

All of these things I do to woo you

Lady

The horse is big

The tights are fun

But the hairdo's a little 1351

In fact, it makes
You look a little like

A lady

He-Man has this very same haircut

He-Man, double masculine

He-Man

I'm to be married to the king

We are to be wed

This coming spring

If you want my heart
You have to challenge him

To the thing they do

With the long pointy thing

The thing where they run
At one another on horseback

With a very long pointy thing

Puncture your lung

Oh

Is that the time?
I should be on my way

I think I'm coming down with
A little bit of the plague

If it matters not to you

I will just away

And claim that I wooed you anyway

I'll tell all my friends
In the village

That I wooed a lady

-By going
-Both: Woo-hoo, woo-hoo-hoo

Woo-hoo, lady, I have just wooed you

Woo-hoo-hoo, woo-hoo

I wooed

You

Milady

Thank you
When I think of Molly, I think of you
Is she waking up?
Who's gonna pinch her cheeks without mom and dad around?
Do you think she knows why the moon comes out so clear?
And what about the sun?
And what about the big problem?
I know she'll never tell

[Bret, Jemaine, & Both]
Hey, dad
Yes, son?
I thought today was a lot of fun
Hey, son
Yes, dad?
Today was the funnest day a dad ever had
Building castles in the sand (Just you and I)
Driving round in the car (I even let you drive)
Eating dinner from a can (Dad's yummy can delight!)
Just a guy and his little guy

[Jemaine]
Son, I know it's hard to watch your daddy cry
It hasn't been easy since your mama died
But don't you worry, we'll be alright
Remember we're a family, just you... and I

[Bret]
You know very well, dad, mama didn't die
She just hooked up with another guy
His name's Trevor and now they live together
That's where you pick me up on Friday nights

[Bret, Jemaine, & Both]
Don't you wonder where I go?
You always go for a while
You never ask me where I've been
Don't want to cramp your style
When I see you on weekends
You always make me smile
That's the smile of (my/your) little guy

[Bret & Jemaine, & Both]
Hey, dad, can I sit on your knee?
Got questions about the world that are troubling me
Well, tell me every question that you have for me
And tell me, does your mama still mention me?
When I grow up, what will I do?
Will I be a fireman or work in a zoo?
You can do anything that you choose
The world is at the feet of a kid like you
Just a boy and his dad (Just a dad and his kid)
Hanging out together
I'd like to live on the moon, or maybe live on a star
Or will I be like you, dad, and live in the car?
You can't live on a star, you'll disintegrate to ash
And where you spend your nights is dependent on cash
Will I fall in love and will it be forever
Or will she leave me someday for someone like Trevor?
Well, you just never know how love will end
But never, ever introduce her to your handsomest friend
Just a boy and his dad (Just a dad and his kid)
Having fun together
Uh, uh

[Bret & Jemaine]
Since your mama ran away
Been thinking about your lonely little heart every day
But you, you don't need to feel so sad
You've still got your dad
Since your mama ran away
No, she didn't run away
I've been thinking about your lonely little heart every day
Dad, she's living in our old place
But the two of us, we don't need to feel so sad
I'm not sad because I've still got Dad
Because you've still got your dad
And another even cooler dad
Ever since your mama ran away
She passed away, then ran away
Mum said she wished she did it years ago
Been trying to think of the right words to say
And, Dad, she calls you an asshole
But the two of us, we don't need to feel so bad
I'm not sad because I've got two dads
Because you've still got your dad
And Trevor bought me a brand new bike
Not been the same when she went away
Trevor lets me watch anything I like
I've been thinking about my lonely little heart every day
Eat ice cream on weekday nights
But you know what makes me feel so glad
I'm not sad because I've still got Dad
Because I'm still your Dad
I'm still your biological dad

[Bret, Jemaine, & Both]
Hey, Dad, can I sit on your knee?
Got questions about the world that are troubling me
No, son, don't you sit on my knee
You're too big now; you're 33
You'll always be my little guy
I'll always be your little guy
But (I'm/you're) 33

[Verse 1]
Walking down the road
Headed to the show
The night is so young
And the bottle is full

[Verse 2]
Line up in a row
We're shuffling in
The bar is too full
So we wait out in the cold

[Verse 3]
The music is loud and the
Lighting is low
The women are shaking and
Moving on the floor

[Verse 4]
The singer is yelling bout the
Women who left
And I'm in the back getting
Drunk with my friends

[Chorus 1]
And this is
All I need
To get me through
The city blues
And this is
Good for me
Give me a swig
And let it be

[Bridge]
Way up here
You'll find me
It's 12 in the morning
I'm lifted off
Substance
We're chasing that taxi
You look so fine
You must know
You make me go crazy
Well I don't know
If it will last
But I'm gonna let you have me

[Chorus 2]
And this is
All I need
To get me through
The city blues
And this is
Good for me
Give me a swig
And let it be

[Chorus 3]
And this is
All I need
To get me through
The city blues
And this is
Good for me
Give me a swig
And let it be

[Outro]
Who knows how many nights I'll be stuck here
Who knows how many nights I'll be stuck
Who knows how many nights I'll be stuck here
Who knows how many nights I'll be stuck

[Intro: Clair de Lune by Claude Debussy]

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Life is so wonderful
Life is so beautiful
Life is amazing
Life can be terrible
Life is unbearable
Life is just crazy
Life is terrific, it's also horrific
It's a magnificent painting
If life is a gift
If life is a bitch then I'm 'bout to get it
I'm 'bout to get it
I'm 'bout to get it, get-get it all
I'm 'bout to get it
I'm 'bout to get it, get-get it all
I'm 'bout to, I'm 'bout to get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it all

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
All I wanna do is win
Man I've been winning since way back when
In my mind's eye had a Maybach then
Fast forward now, Maybach's what I'm in
Getting out the project was the project
Momma said "progress is the process"
I was paid less shopped at the Payless
Now my ass is living in a nice address
Feeling like a champ living up in Los Feliz
Way back when I just wanted dope feelings
A Kangol and a tracksuit from Adidas
Now we over here selling 80,000 seaters
Yeah they wanna see us when we coming to the town
'Cause we number one with the champion sound
We be falling up, ne-never falling down
Keep it at a higher level, elevated ground

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Life is so wonderful
Life is so beautiful
Life is amazing
Life can be terrible
Life is unbearable
Life is just crazy
Life is terrific, it's also horrific
It's a magnificent painting
If life is a gift
If life is a bitch then I'm 'bout to get it
I'm 'bout to get it
I'm 'bout to get it, get-get it all
I'm 'bout to get it
I'm 'bout to get it, get-get it all
I'm 'bout to, I'm 'bout to get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it all

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
Y'all need to focus on this
Apl was ESL in this bitch
That means English is my second language
From Angeles to Los Angeles
No handouts, they don't wanna hand me shit
Now they analyze me calling all the analysts
Now they realize that I'm the catalyst
On the Bob Marley shit, I'm the activist
And no I ain't talking 'bout no cannabis
Born Filipino, born philanthropist
I know I wouldn't be the guy 'bout the bullshit
Know wise from the dumb all about the school shit
U2 know where The Edge is
Gotta have knowledge, know where the ledge is
Bridging the gap, close all the wedges
Ordinary people we the John Legends

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Life is so wonderful
Life is so beautiful
Life is amazing
Life can be terrible
Life is unbearable
Life is just crazy
Life is terrific, it's also horrific
It's a magnificent painting
If life is a gift
If life is a bitch then I'm 'bout to get it
I'm 'bout to get it
I'm 'bout to get it, get-get it all
I'm 'bout to get it
I'm 'bout to get it, get-get it all
I'm 'bout to, I'm 'bout to get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it all

[Intro: Kanye West]
Um, I'd like to introduce myself
Coming to a theater near you this summer or, really, like right now
Oh
It's Kanye, to the
I used to live in the movies, you know
So uh, get your popcorn, get your condiments
Turn your cellphones off, you don't wanna miss nothing

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had to stab big nigga, tryna sell me a lick
He said "Analyze this, this as good as it gets"
Now don't be bedazzled by the purple haze
It ain't gon be the color of *Purple Rain*
I told him
Just break it off, light it up, set it off man
How hot? Better make Eddie cough, man
And them shrooms'll have a man on the moon
Cookin up flow in the boiler room
I want DMX style of run, exit wound
I want the X-Men around me, Malcolm X could use
Like no one man should have all that power
Get all that powder in 48 hours
And he stick the kingpin. or king of New York
They probably just queens of comedy
If you in my things, you *Suicide Kings*
There's only *Three Kings*, *Me, Myself and Irene*

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I'm livin' the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
I'm livin the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
Sit back and enjoy the show

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They call me *Edward Scissorhands* cause I'm trying to cut
She claim she got cramps, I'm gon' get you to suck
And you not gon' use your teeth, you hear?
You gon' find out *What Lies Beneath* right here
*The Preacher's Wife* don't give head, get a divorce, man
*The Kids* been calling you the headless horseman
Like *Sleepy Hollow*, see she swallow
Suck like ol' girl, got booed at *Apollo 13*, *Ghosts*
Use my *Hollow Man* for *Friday 13th*
You be *Ghost*, *Backdraft* from the toast
Niggas who drop names is oh so shameless
Get a chain that's stainless, now they *Almost Famous*
My bling got 'em calling me *Lord of the Rings*
*The Shining* make it hard for her to *Do The Right Thing*
But *I Don't Say a Word*, I'll never tell
Until you get a Kanye beat, you'll never sell

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I'm livin' the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
I'm livin the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
Sit back and enjoy the show

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I know *Something About Mary* (mm-hmm)
*I Know What You Did Last Summer* before Sally met Harry
Back when I was sprung on *Carrie*
Must've been on some *Shallow Hal*
Cause she was definitely wasn't no Halle Barry
I guess I did it for the *Glory*
Now the players love that *Neverending Story*
My Christian story, shorty
Talked about my outfit, but they quit
Cause I'll shoot your eye out, kid
Don't forget
My school days back in *Cooley High*
I wasn't trippin, just foolish, just crusin by
Yo Gerard, Dr. Nichols in the hospital
Yo, I was out to prove that it was possible
And why your *Bodyguard* come home like Kevin Costner do
I love men who can pimp her, like a prostitute
I tell her this relationship is like the 1st rule of *Fight Club*-
Don't talk about *Fight Club*

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I'm livin' the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
I'm livin the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
Sit back and enjoy the show

After all the love changes
My heart had locked the door
Then that girl released her magic
And made me love once more

(ooohooohhoo)

Like the warm rays of the sun
Her sweet love can shine down on me

(ohhhhohhha)

All at once turned my life around
And with one kiss she set me free

(Chorus)
She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
That girl she brings me Joy
She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
That girl she brings me Joy

Goodbye Loneliness
And so long to my heartache
Now that Joy has taken over
And decided to stay

Her love lifts me up
Like no other love before
With every beat of my heart
I'm Hold...Holding on... heyayyayy

Just look what she's done for me
She's erased all the sadness away
I could never repay the deed
Cause she keeps lovin me more and more

(Chorus)
She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
That girl she brings me Joy

She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
And she brings me Joy
She's giving me

[Verse 1]
It was early one morning, I was, on my way to school
It was early one morning, I was, on my way to school
I met a magic woman, and she broke my teacher's rule
I'm in love with that woman, before I learn to call her name
I'm in love with that woman, before I learn to call her name
The way you treat me, is doggone insane
Yes, tell me baby, honey where you stayed last night
Yes, tell me baby, honey where you stayed last night
You didn't come home, darlin' untill the sun was shinin' bright

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I'm in love with that woman, before I learn to call her name
I'm in love with that woman, before I learn to call her name
The way you treat me, is doggone insane
Yes, tell me baby, honey where you stayed last night
Yes, tell me baby, honey where you stayed last night

[Verse 1]
So you lived your life precisely
By the rules of the game
Is your mind an open page
Or will it always be the same?
Did you try to pass the point
Deny the holder's job?

[Refrain]
If your heart lays with the rebel
Would you cheer the underdog?

[Verse 2]
When the better half is careful
Do you take the cheaper way?
Do you recognize your conscience
When there's danger in fair play?
Is your mind in twilight guiding
The constant noncommittal fog?

[Refrain]
If your heart lays with the rebel
Would you cheer the underdog?

[Chorus]
I won't ask you again
If a chill comes to your hand
Someday I'm going back
To a world I understand

[Verse 3]
When the morning light came too late
Did you ever blame yourself?
Would you leave the unprepared bed
Every time for someone else?
Is your word in silence heard
To pass away the quick and mild?

[Refrain]
If your heart lays with the rebel
Would you cheer the underdog?

[Chorus]
I won't ask you again
If a chill comes to your hand
Someday I'm going back
To a world I understand

[Verse 3]
When the morning light came too late
Did you ever blame yourself?
Would you leave the unprepared bed
Every time for someone else?
Is your word in silence heard
To pass away the quick and mild?

[Refrain]
If your heart lays with the rebel
Would you cheer the underdog?
Caught up in the pain of a broken heart
Life isn't what it seems
Because it's all been torn apart
Is my imagination playing tricks on me?
The politics of love
Have turned into a conspiracy

Wash your life in mother's tears
Grieving after all disease
Tell me who gave you the right
Get down on your knees and cry all night
Cry all night

Insanity and madness, better or for worse
Dishonesty and lies
Have turned a blessing to a curse
And in this world of sadness
It's easier to blame
Deception and denial
Shuns the burning of the flame
The path of life leads to the grave
God have mercy, Jesus save
Guide us through, now, hold on tight
Get down on your knees and cry all night

Why don't we try to find a real solution?
No need to cry, so wipe away those tears
So many times I've tried, but you won't listen
Now it's too late to save those wasted years

Mind assassination, break the golden rules
Who do you think you are?
To me, you're just another fool
You didn't stop to reason, you didn't even try
Only see things from your side
It's all a one way ride

Don't go under, stand your right
Wish someone would stop the fight
Shattered dreams fall out of sight
Get down on your knees and cry all night
Cry all night
You're gonna cry all night
Cry all night
Take these bones
My spirit doesn't need them any longer
In the zone
Between the living and the dead
Take these eyes
'Cause I don't need to see another minute
Of this life
From which I'm hanging by a thread

Please let go
We'll maybe meet again in someone's vision
Who could know
If there's another world out there?
On my own
I'm crossing through the final resolution
Going home
Without a promise or a breath

The hour of indecision
Too late to change your mind
Was it a superstition?
In light and in your time
In my time
I've tried but didn't find a real direction
Toe the line
On the periphery of life
Say goodbye
There's no escape from absolute conclusion
Life goes by
But memories remain the same
Remain the same
I like being alone
I'd like to stay in my room all day and night
Don't like to talk on the phone
So please forgive me while I just turn off the light

Don't wanna see nobody
Ever and ever again
Don't you feel sorry?
I'm just a crazy, isolated man

I know me better than you
I hate to hear another persons screaming voice
What are you trying to do?
Leave me alone!
I won't be anymore in cries

Don't wanna see nobody
Ever and ever again
I'm not in any hurry
I'm just a crazy, isolated man
Why don't you leave me alone?
'Cause there's nothing more I wanna say!
Thank you for caring but I'll be alright
Now will you understand and go away!?
Don't have a problem living in my room because it's where I really wanna be
So please forgive me if you think I'm strange but I just wanna spend my life with me!

Don't wanna see nobody
Ever and ever again
Don't you feel sorry?
I'm just a crazy, isolated man

Don't wanna see nobody
Ever and ever again
I'm not in any hurry
I'm just a crazy, isolated man

[Verse 1]
All alone on a city high
In New York and the dead of night
We can't swim, we're about to drown
All alone in a famous town

[Chorus]
We always knew we never would survive
Protect ourselves and hide out in denial
We on the way, on the way out (We, we, we, we)
We on the way, on the way out (On the way, way out)

[Post-Chorus]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

[Verse 2]
No oxygen left in our hearts
Goin' down and we felt the pain
But we're lookin' cool, sinkin' in the chain
We feel the same as we fall apart

[Bridge]
Out here in the blue with the lights behind us
Shot us in our backs but we keep on ridin'
I don't wanna go and the lights are blinding

[Chorus]
We always knew we never would survive (Survive)
Protect ourselves and hide out in denial
We on the way, on the way out (We, we, we, we)
We on the way, on the way out (On the way, way out)

[Post-Chorus]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

[Chorus]
We always knew we never would survive (Survive)
Protect ourselves and hide out in denial
We on the way, on the way out (We, we, we, we)
We on the way, on the way out (On the way, way out)
We always knew we never would survive
Protect ourselves and hide out in denial
We on the way, on the way out (We, we, we, we)
We on the way, on the way out (On the way, way out)

[Outro]
All alone on a city high
In New York and the dead of night

[Verse 1]
If I could reach the stars
I’d pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth
That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems
But for now I find
It’s only in my dreams

[Chorus]
That I can
Change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could
Change the world

[Verse 2]
If I could be king
Even for a day
I’d take you as my queen
I’d have it no other way
And our love would rule
In this kingdom that we had made
’til then I’ll be a fool
Wishing for a day

[Chorus X2]
That I can
Change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could
Change the world

She kind of love fucking, she don't use the pussy muscle
Make your body do the shuffle
Got a bitch named Jaz, she let my Stacy dash
She be raking in the cash, take it in the ass
Janet and Janine, now take it in the jaw
Nobody like to fuck 'em 'cause they like to take the balls
And it's blowjob Kate, her head game's great
Her tongue run on me, like the bitch vibrate

But they only pop they pussy to a Khao track

Gangbanger yes, soo-woo gang
And if you ain't wit it then you in the food chain
I'm in that wide body I'mma need two lanes
Blue seats white paint wetter than new rain
It look like a white person, with blue veins
I keep a black Glock, red dot blue flame
Feet hanging out the window jock my shoe game
Cause all my kicks fly, like Liu Kang
Hehe, old playa new game
I'm focused, I'm thinking like I got two brains
I'm in my prime I feel like a new Wayne
How come there is two bitches but ain't no two Waynes?
{*Wayne over Hook*}
Hehe I don't know what they do but I do thangs
This Mr. "Everytime You See Me Got A New Chain"

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz] - 2X

[Verse 2: Boo]
Yeah I grind hard (grind hard) but I shine harder (harder)

We might got the same car but my rims different
Plus a sexy lil fine bitch come with it
Young Money we the flyest crew (flyest crew)
Rappers we can't see y'all, who are you? (who are you?)

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Yeah Young Money in the house
Motherfuck anybody else who in the house
My niggas with me so you know it's guns in the house
The cops'll grab a roll of yellow tape and run around your house
Why y'all fuckin with Lil Spitta?
I wasn't doing nothing just laid up chillin
Playing Tony Hawk on the Xbox, burnin incense
Rocking sweat pants and some Jordan number sixes
My check cleared I'm officially a rich nigga
So from this day I'mma smile in all my pictures
Get the champagne from the top shelf
The crib got wings like a jet, one east one west

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]

[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
Bitch I'm Mack Maaaaaaine
I'm psycho, like no, other motherfucker
And I'm in this bitch hollerin Young Money motherfucker
It's Mack Maine I make my money speak latin
And
I'm comfortable like my sheet satin
The kush got me higher than an old hooker's skirt (skirt)
And I never been to culinary school but cook work (cheah)
I'm no sergeant homie so I never cuff a ho
And I hustle for my +Bills+ like I'm from Buffalo
Ya figga deal - but on the really-real
Pause the clock my flow timeless
Say my name and lose your job like you're Don Imus (fuck you)
I'm just a, real nigga, Mack Mizzle
I'm off the hizzle, with two pistols now

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]

[Verse 1]
We're fucking in a car, shooting heroin
Saying controversial things just for the hell of it
Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men
Start with misdemeanours and we'll make a business out of them
And we can find out the information
Access all the applications
That are hardening positions based on miscommunication
Oh, fuck your feelings
Truth is only hearsay
We're just left to decay
Modernity has failed us

[Chorus]
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it

[Verse 2]
And poison me, daddy
I got the Jones right through my bones
Write it on a piece of stone
A beach of drowning three-year olds
Rest in peace Lil Peep
The poetry is in the streets
Jesus save us
Modernity has failed us

[Chorus]
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
I'd love it if we made it

Tell me something I didn't know

[Bridge]
Consultation
Degradation
Fossil fueling
Masturbation
Immigration
Liberal kitsch
Kneeling on a pitch

[Verse 3]
"I moved on her like a bitch!"
Excited to be indicted
Unrequited house with seven pools
"Thank you Kanye, very cool!"
The war has been incited
And guess what, you're all invited
And you're famous
Modernity has failed us

[Outro]
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
Tell me something I didn't know
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it

[Chorus]
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
It feel like summer
I feel like summer
I feel like summer
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
I feel like summer
She feel like summer
This feel like summer
I feel like summer

[Verse 1]
Seven billion souls that move around the sun
Rolling faster, fast and not a chance to slow down
Slow down
Men who made machines that want what they decide
Parents tryna tell their children please slow down
Slow down

[Refrain]
I know
Oh, I know you know that pain
I'm hopin' that this world will change
But it just seems the same
(It feels like the same)

[Chorus]
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
It feels like summer
(I feel like summer)
I feel like summer
(I feel like summer)
I feel like summer

[Verse 2]
Every day gets hotter than the one before
Running out of water, it's about to go down
Go down
Air that kill the bees that we depend upon
Birds were made for singing
Waking up to no sound
No sound

[Refrain]
I know
Oh, I know you know my pain
I'm hopin' that this world will change
But it just seems the same
I know
Oh, I hope we change
I really thought this world could change
But it seems like the same

[Outro]
I know
Oh, my mind is still the same
I'm hoping that this world will change
But it just seems the same
I know
Oh, I hope we change

[Pre-Chorus]
You feel like summertime
You took this heart of mine
You'll be my valentine in the summer, in the summer
You are my only one
Just dancin'; having fun
Out in the shinin' sun of the summer, of the summer

Baby girl (woo, ah!) my whole world, hoo, oh!

You feel like summertime (oh, yes you do)
You took this heart of mine (you know you did)

In the summer (in the summer)

[Chorus]

All I wanna do is let you shine

[Outro]
It's your summertime
It's your summertime magic

[Verse 1]
Face down in a pillow, she cries
Her black mascara runs in circles from her-er-er eyes
Pink feather regrets she washes away
She said she wants him
But it's hurtin' and it's burnin' in the worst, the worst way

[Chorus]
She does the yay-ha
Yay-yay-yay-yay-ha
Let's do the yay-ha
Yay-yay-yay-yay-ha

[Verse 2]
Lockdown in a bathroom, she cries
Her white skin looks better in this kind of light
Pink feather regrets she washes away
Looks in her mirror
And it's hurtin' and it's burnin' in the worst, the worst way

[Chorus]
She does the yay-ha
Yay-yay-yay-yay-ha
Let's do the yay-ha
Yay-yay-yay-yay-ha
She does the yay-ha
Yay-yay-yay-yay-ha
Let's do the yay-ha
Yay-yay-yay-yay-ha

[Bridge]
Face down in a pillow, she cries
Her black mascara runs in circles from her eyes

She says she loves to run
Her hands are tongue tied
He said "It's just a game'
Then why do we play?

Yay-ha
She says she loves to run
Yay-ha
Her hands are tongue tied
Yay-ha
Yay-yay-yay-yay-ha
Then why do we play?

[Chorus]
She does the yay ha
Then why do we play?
She does the yay ha
Then why do we play?
Let's do the yay-ha
Yay, yay, yay, yay ha
Then why do we play?

[Outro]
Then why do we play?
Then why do we play?
Then why do we play?

You can be my Mona Lisa
Baby, won't you tell me all your little secrets?
Love's gonna hurt
Open up your heart to me

[Verse 1]
I can tell you're trouble
Got me in your pocket now
You got me round, round, round
Your little finger, round, round
Got a little hustle
Hangin' on a promise now
You got me reaching straight out
My arms are reaching right out

[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven help me, I just want your love
But I don't play the game that good
Don't hide behind a smile like you

[Chorus]
You can be my Mona Lisa
Baby, won't you tell me all your little secrets?
Love's gonna hurt
Open up your heart to me
You can be my Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
Baby, won't you tell me all your little secrets?
Love's gonna hurt
Open up your heart to me

[Verse 2]
What's a little drama?
What you're hiding in your eyes?
I'm out here taking that chance
It's risky taking that chance
You're a fire starter
Wish I could've seen the signs
But I'm a wish on that star
You're gonna tear me apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven help me, I just want your love
But I don't play the game that good
Don't hide behind a smile like you

[Chorus]
You can be my Mona Lisa
Baby, won't you tell me all your little secrets?
Love's gonna hurt
Open up your heart to me
You can be my Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
Baby, won't you tell me all your little secrets?
Love's gonna hurt
Open up your heart to me

Well, it's the King of the Underground, and the King of the Trill
Standin' on the top of the South like the King of the Hill
You're tuned into a winner that's never takin' a loss
Reppin' Houston with Beyoncé and Slim Thug The Boss
Diamonds on the wood peel, I'm a Dirty South Soldier
Draped up in that Crown Holder, thought I told ya

Baby, our love was strong yesterday
(Now you watch love fade away)
Happiness was ours to share
(Now you just don't seem to care)
Without the love that we once knew
My heart is weak, what can I do
Feel like the rain, I feel the pain of losing you

It's a tragedy, baby, that you do to me
Why did you leave me
It's a tragedy, honey, that you do to me
Why did you leave

Baby, everywhere I see your face
(Memories you can't erase)
The long lonely nights have begun
(And you've got no place to run)
Can't you see the way I feel
Black is black, the pain is real
I can't bear to see the dawn
'Cause you're gone
It's a tragedy, baby, that you do to me
Why did you leave
I can't feel a thing, baby
Why did you leave, why did you leave, baby
Why did you leave, honey
Why did you leave, baby, honey
It's a tragedy that you do to me

Why did you leave, baby
It's a tragedy that you do to me
Don't crush my world, baby
It's a tragedy that you do to me, honey
Don't crush my world, baby
You know I need you, honey

Don't leave me alone...
This is my beloved, this is my beloved
Ooh when I get weary and my way gets dim
And I look all around and see my chances are slim
She give me courage to go on

This is my beloved, this is my beloved
When I lay awake in the middle of the night
And all my dreams have faded way out of sight
I hear her sweet voice in the dark

This is my beloved, this is my beloved
She never puts anothing before me
She knows me like a book from A to Z
She can make me laugh, have fun and be free
But most of all she know when to just let me be

This is my beloved, this is my beloved
When my pride is gone and I feel half a man
And everything goes wrong though I do the best I can
She makes me feel ten feet tall
This is my beloved and she's so good to me
This is my beloved and I love her, can't you see
This is my beloved and I'll never never let her go
This is my beloved, simply because I love her so...

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Started out local, but I ain't motherfuckin' local
Got two million worth of jewelry on one of six sofas
Got a pocket full of fifties like a damn club promoter
And these crackers wanna see me on a Most Wanted poster
Who are you supposed to be? ('Posed to be?)
Say that you's an OG, but really
Nigga you just O.V, O.V
I'm cooking dope in L.V, Louis
Remix a brick in double G's, Gucci
I just sold a thousand P's in Fendi
My sweater and my drawers and my jeans Burberry
Coconut Cîroc mixed with molly cranberry

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
(Wasted!) Coconut
(Wasted!) Coconut Cîroc
(I'm Wasted!) Coconut
(Wasted!) Coconut Cîroc mixed with molly cranberry

[Verse 2: Hard Wurk]
Just to stand next to me, gotta be initiated
I'm in here with the plug, tell the hoe to get naked
She wanna fuck the kid, I tell her, "Baby, be patient."
She say her name's "Asia", but she don't look Asian
Remember being broke, a nigga not having shit
True hit me with a split, I pulled the 

[?]
Hermes belt, just to hold my Trues up
Dirty forty shawty, if you move you'll get bust
Phone going crazy, I just had a good rush
I was standing on the corner from the dawn 'til the dusk
Ayy, this an Audemars beat, I'll drop you for a fee
Got a condo right by Lenox just to fuckin' smoke weed (Strong)
Drunker than a motherfucker throwin' bands up
On that Coconut Cîroc, and I'm pourin' Xans up
I'm a get-money nigga, go and put your hands up
I'm a get-money, bitch, let me see you stand up

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coconut

'Cause these squares can't understand me
How I do it when I do it?
Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis
Eazy E, I'm extra ruthless
Sign the check and write the music
Pump it, push it, pump it, push it and produce it
Make you think it's the real Gucci
Who the hottest? Me or Gucci?
Who gon' win? Guwop or Gucci?
Fed cases, mixtapes and movies
Ask me how I feel I'm Gucci
No one can beat me but Gucci

[Interlude]
It looks like Gucci Mane might be behind bars until 2016
Today, the Atlanta rapper pled guilty to a gun possession charge
And according to reports, prosecutors want to jail him until 2016
The maximum sentence that goes along with this charge is 10 years
But with the plea deal copped today, Gucci is only expected to serve 39 months
Gucci has been in jail since September after cops arrested him
In a parking lot with a handgun
A hefty fine of $250,000 also goes along with the sentence

[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves]
Yeah, looks like we've made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there some day

[Pre-Chorus: Kacey Musgraves]
They say, "I bet they'll never make it."
But just look at us holding on
We’re still together, still going strong, oh

[Chorus: Harry Styles & Kacey Musgraves]
Still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Still the one I want for life
Still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
Still the one I kiss good night

[Verse 2: Harry Styles]
Ain't nothing better
We beat the odds together
Glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missing

[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles & Kacey Musgraves & Both]
They said (They said)
"I'll bet (I'll bet), they'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong, oh

[Chorus: Harry Styles & Kacey Musgraves]
Still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Still the one I want for life
Still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
Still the one I kiss good night
Still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Still the one I want for life
Still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
Still the one I kiss good night

[Outro: Harry Styles & Both]
So glad we made it
Look how far we've come, my baby

[Verse 1]
I don't ever ask you where you've been
'Cause I don't feel the need to
Know who you're with
I can't even think straight
But I can tell
You were just with her
And I'll still be a fool, 'cause I'm a fool for you

[Chorus]
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

[Verse 2]
I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy
That's what they say
I know I'm not your only
I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you

[Chorus]
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

[Bridge]
I know I'm not your only
But at least I'm one
I heard a little love is better than none

[Chorus]
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
See, those flowers, they need love
See, the bluebirds, they need love
See, the babies, they need love
All God's children, oh, need love
See, your mother, she needs love
And my father, he needs love
That's true, baby, and I need love too

See, those rain drop rivers, they need love
And the mountains and the valleys, they need love
God forgive us, and send us more love from above
Don't find good love every day; we ought to think
Before we throw good love away

Doesn't matter what you are
A thief, or a beggar, or even a superstar
As long as you were made by God above
Oh, I know, I know, you need love; we need love
Baby, oh, I need love, I need your love

(I'm standing here, ) oh baby, standing in the need of
Love, I need love
I need it; I got to have it, baby
Oh, can't you see that I'm standing in the need?
I'm still here 'cause I need love
I'm still with you, dear
Cause I need your love
And I know, oh yes, I know
Though you feel you don't need loving
You still need loving too, oh yes, you do
It don't matter, no, it doesn't matter what you are;
A thief, or a beggar, or a superstar
As long as the Lord made you from above
I know, I know
You were made for love ('cause love is what you need and understanding, ) oh, understanding
You were made for love, sweet understanding why can't we see we were made for love
You were made for love, baby; sweet understanding, why can't we see?

We, (you, ) were made for love
(Why is it so hard for us, today, to see the real?)
We were made from love; you were made of love
Baby; you were made to love, baby
What's the only thing that's gonna get us together?
(Love's the only thing that's gonna make this cold-blooded world alright.)

What is this we're singing about? For the love of Jesus, let's do it
I need a whole lot of love, sugar
I need a whole lot of sweet love

It's a fact
(Who?) Even the slightest thing needs love
(Who?) All of the folks in jail need love
(Who?) Even a mean old man needs love

[Marvin riffing]

Jesus said time would heal ALL WOUNDS
(Time... Time...)
But we have to live right to get the time
(Time... Time...)
Oh, time
(Time... Time...)
Please, time, you got to be a friend of mine

Sometimes I am unable to move
(Sometimes I'm ready to groove
And then sometimes I'm unable to move and then)
I let temptation get me off of my groove
(Sometimes I'm ready to groove
And then sometimes I'm unable to move and then)

Sometimes I get it
Sometimes it's hard
To stay with it
But right now, get it, gotta get it, get it
Got to stay with it
Makin' up my mind to get it
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right
Pretty good lovin', oh
Get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right
Oh, gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right - Woo!
Oh, gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right, baby
Oh, gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock -
My life's a clock and it's winding down
From the day you're born
Till the day you're in the ground

Come on, let's say this thing together!

I've been racing against time
Trying my best to find my way
Change our world in just one day
Blowin' coke all up my nose
Gettin' in and out my clothes
Foolin' 'round with midnight hoes
But that chapter of life's closed
From the day you're born
Till the day you're in the ground

Father, forgive me
To sing and dance, give love a chance
Please be on my side
Please be on my side
Just a few more days and I'll change my ways
Please be on my side

Ain't no need
For us to leave
Before we want to
But if we respect father time in our prime
Aw, baby, we won't have to

Sometimes I'm ready to groove
And then sometimes I'm unable to move and then
Sometimes I'm ready to groove
And then sometimes I'm unable to move and then
Sometimes I'm ready to groove
And then sometimes I'm unable to move and then
Sometimes I'm ready to groove
And then sometimes I'm unable to move

Like the rest of mankind
I've been racing against time
Trying my best to find my way
Change my world in just one day
"I can dig it, I can dig it!"
Cold-blooded out there, man, I been fooling around a long time
Yeah, I been trying to hit the big one
"You got to learn!"

Like the rest of mankind
I've been racing against time
Trying my best to find my way
Change my world in just one day
Blowin' coke all up my nose
Gettin' in and out my clothes
Foolin' 'round with midnight hoes
But that chapter of life's closed

From the day you're born
Till the day you're in the ground

I've got to say, I've got some debts to say (please be on my side)
Please be on my side (time, time)
Know I've done some wrong, I won't be here long
Please be on my side, please be on my side

(Stop fooling with time!
Stop fooling with time!)

You know, Ed? Life's a bitch, man
I tried my best to do right, man but you know it's cold-blooded out there

Got to learn sooner or later, don't you?

Got to learn! Life can't be this way!

Got to sometimes in life, make a change. Every man has to make a change. Sooner the better is the saying

Sometimes it takes you a long time to learn

Way too long, way too long, man. Things be going down, you'll be sorry for it

[Marvin relaying instructions for Sparrow, next track]
Get to the F-minor there, now the whole process repeats again
And then it just repeats!
Hey Mike, let me have a pelmel when you get a sec, please, bless you
Before we cut
One, two, three, four!

[Verse 1: Questlove]
I heard about a sparrow singing
One day as I went along
I didn't hear him sing his song

I know where the sparrows can sing
It's like a bird on a wing
Oh, sparrow, why don't you sing?
Sing to me, oh won't you come around
Come around, will you come around
And sing

Sing about a melody, about a thing you see
Anything you want to sing about
Sing it on out, sing it on out
Till the world knows what life's all about
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Oh, sing, little sparrow, won't you sing for me

[Background repeating: Marvin Gaye]
Sing sparrow, sing-a-little sparrow
Sing sparrow, sing-a-little sparrow
Sing
Sing
Sing
Oh, sing
'bout misery
Sing
Sing
Gonna sing
Whoa

[Singing outro: Ed Townsend]
Hear that change
The change in your headphones that time
It'll change in your headphones that time
Sparrow
Oh, my little sparrow now
You can think about it now
Keep on singing, little bird
Keep on singing, little bird
Your song, your song
Yeah, yeah!
Two thousand and seventy three
Two thousand and eighty four
Two thousand and ninety three

Light years ahead
You and me gone be getting down on a space bed

Light years - interplanetary funk

You know, you look like somebody I met a long time ago

Come on, Zack, let's go out there and party now we got out of the atmosphere

Let's party, man, let's disco on this shift

Make us some women

Come on, baby, mess around
Move
Mess around
Let's plug ourselves into this machine in the ground
See, we need to say what we mean
Let's plug our hearts into the real machine

Yeah, I says yes
Come on, baby, mess around
I remember like it was yesterday
We were over Gwen's
And we was trying one more time to make amends
Oh yes we was
Suddenly it occured to me it did not matter
Whether I was mad at her
Or she was mad at me
Naw, babe
Understanding my condition
I must surely be a wishing
And a hoping to be free

Some say, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, yeah, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
Yeah, she said, you can leave, but it's gonna cost you dearly, oh
You can leave, but it's going to cost you, hah, dearly

Sometimes your eyes was red as fire
Intoxicated
Sometimes your spirit was moving on me
It wanted to fight me
I had to fight to defend my life
I didn't mind it
You see, I find it
A bit stimulating
That after fighting
We're making love
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
Cause after all, you was my wife
Hey, can you still boogie
Boogie down the road sometime

Hey, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
You were trying to put me down
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
I used to sing this song, I'm dancin' on
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
Mystery man, what's going down

That young girl is going to cost you
If you want happiness, you got to pay
Oooh baby, used to be the apple of my eye
How come you loved me, baby?
How come you love
You used to be my heart's desire
My heart's desire, yeah

I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it
You tried to have them shackle me
(Power, power, power)
Bring me in
Tell me what for
So to satisfy you baby
You have won the battle
Oh but Daddy's gonna win the war
Her lawyers worked so hard
Tryin'a take my riches
Rich things, too
Trying to sell my home
Tried to take my life
Not my child too
I don't care
Tryina upset my woman
Examinin' my soul
But I was strong, baby
Stood my ground and prayed
Asked the Lord to help
Wish he was in a position
To upset the judge

You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You use to say that I was a gorgeous hunk of man
That didn't help me baby
Ah, when you was on the stand
You can't have happiness
Until you pay me
And make me happy too, baby
You can leave, but it's going to cost you

You can't have peace of mind till I get mine
You can leave but it's going to cost you, mommy
You can't have no jewelry
Think about them first
You can leave but it's going to cost you, mommy
If the road can show us again
And the blue of night and magic
And the river begin to be broken down
Where are you?
Oh, darling, where are you?
Where are you?

Falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love all ovre
I'm falling in love again
I, I, I found somebody who loves me
Falling in love again

In this life... of... happiness and sadness (Alright)
When you've lost... out on love... (I know)
And it all... ends up in madness (Play that horn)
And you say, "Love, please go away. Don't torture me night and day."
Then something that's real... Someone you feel comes in

Now I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love all over
I'm falling in love again
I, I found somebody who says she love me
I'm falling in love again, falling in love again, falling in love
Once again... Hey baby
She's pretty, outside and in...
She's so wonderful
I tried not to let my heart step in
But what to do, baby
What could I do
When somebody real comes in
Someone who feel comes in
Now I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I found somebody
She says she love me
I'm falling in love again
Oh, beautiful woman
Falling in love again
Falling in love again
Falling in love

The world's so great, baby
So love me
As though there was no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow
So let's have a toast and whisper
See you later
I love you
I love you, baby
I love you

Let's live, not regret it
Let's live, not regret it
Let's live, not regret it
Let's live, not regret it

[Chorus x3]
Ain't it funny
No it just ain't funny
How things turn around
How things turn around

Once we loved each other so deeply
We talked to each other so sweetly
Now, we don't even talk at all
Only, only on the telephone

When I call
Talking about the kid
Talking about the baby
Talking about the baby

People think life is a game
Life is a game
People think life is a game
They think life is a game, baby
Ain't it strange? It ain't never the same
Gonna turn around, baby
Turn it around, soon
Gonna be getting down
Got to turn around, going to turn it around

Please, please don't ever go away
And if you wonder, please, please
Don't ever go away

If we work together, we can help things turn around
Can't we baby?
Ain't it funny, baby
How things turn around, baby
Ain't it funny, baby
How things turn around, honey, honey
Ain't it funny, how things turn around
Look at you, baby

If we work together, we can help things turn around
Can't we, baby?
F-U-N-N-Y, help it turn around
F-U-N-N-Y, help things turn around
Ooh, baby
Look at you, baby
F-U-N-N-Y, help things turn around

[Outro]
F-U-N-N-Y
Turn it all around, baby

[Verse]
Tire marks, tire marks
Finish line with the tire marks
When the relay starts I’m a runaway slave
Ugh, walking on water and running on waves
God MC Oh my God you gotta see
There’s never no I's in me
Of an Odyssey, I’m a block away
Fire marshal's moving in
Marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens
Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I’m so appalled
With the prototype with a godly protocol
You an amateur, they wanna pro to call
I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada
I don’t care where ya are
Just blink twice and I’m there where you are
Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
In an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga
Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
Had a black Camry, bumpin' Dipset, Killa Cam nigga
I had been around niggas, killas, pimps
You ain’t been around shit but your momma and your bitch
Shoved off the porch when I was like six
Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6
Kick in the door
K9s all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick
Momma in the bathroom poppa at work
Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church
Look at my shirt, Polo on it
It’s gon' sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent
A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen
You looking at the 2010 Romans
Empire, Hiiipower HP, in ya face like HD
And I spit like a HK
I’mma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G
Problem and Hootie nigga
Tell the government come shoot me, nigga
Cause I’m going out with a fist raised
And a fist full of money give it to a fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
With a democratic politician from CA
They don’t wanna see a B-L-A-C-K
Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
Give us some free J’s put us in PJs
Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
God-Damn, y'all cold
Mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code
Stuck in the street where it's dark like Harpo
Black man tell me where your God-Damn heart go
Although I’m in the land of milk and honey
Nobody never gave me shit, when I got my first chain
All the niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and shit
Get it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
Like he back that shit
Acting like you real or something
Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
Go pop some pills or something
You trying real hard to appeal to someone
I’m being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub
With your BM in it and your stash box glove
And the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
I’m at the limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt
I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like
Bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
Cut cut cut where your life at?
Your careers over, he’s slumped over
And if I'm off beat know I’m un-sober
That's a new flow
Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer
Not a rapper, I’m a raptor
That's a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture
I’m a factor and your facial
I will fracture to a fraction
No one-half and I hate math
Pastor’s like Eddie long, fucking maricon
Took me mighty long to get here
Nigga, Fuck!

[Intro: Drake & Charlie Sloth]
Yeah
I been waiting on this one Charlie, for real
I've been waitin' Driz
I've been waitin', let's get 'em bro
Nah, for real
Shout out Boi-1da too
Mm, I like that
Let's get 'em Driz
You don't have a drink, you're not drinking or what?
I got a drink bro
Hahahaha, I like that
I got my drink right here. Cheers my bro
Toast up man
Yeah, okay, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Goldman Sachs, they wanna hold my racks
Hedge fund investors talk to Adel like he the expert
I hear it in they tone when they address him
We way too connected
Tom Ford assistant texted asking if I want classic or double breasted
I flex with broad shoulders
When I walk through the halls they move over
Stories of how we handle ours start to travel like a lone soldier
I told you
You hold your girl the same way that I hold composure
Or hold the wheel of the Fuji white Rover
Silverstein dinners, all kosher
Never rushin'
My niggas really made somethin' from nothin'
Dodge sentences like they don't wanna discuss it, change subject
Got the Benny Yang chains rubbin', never tucked in
Waiting to inhale
Things that I own will sell at auction as proof we did well
My house museum-scale
The only skeletons here are the ones from the nights I raised hell
Make sure the staff are paid well
Make 'em think twice 'bout the stories that they tell
No one knows when the plan is hatchin'
I'ma let 'em walk on eggshells
Tiptoe, niggas better know

[Interlude: Drake & Charlie Sloth]
Wow, man like Drizzy Drake!
Yeah
Got his foot on your neck man
What time is it? What time is it? It's like two in the morning right now
Yeah, well it's real late over here
It's me and Charlie, that's it, you hear me? We got the whole building to ourselves
We got the building. Kill them again, kill them again Driz, kill them!

[Verse 2: Drake]
Y'all keepin' the score while watchin' me score
Y'all keep the awards, I'll take the rewards
If y'all goin' for fun, I'll stay and record
But if y'all goin' to war I'm there for sure
Wouldn't miss it
I'm living next to Michael, Bobby, Ralph, Johnny
My neighbors soundin' like New Edition
That's these guys
Us guys don't wear New Balance or Levi's
Key West retirement plan
Grippin' the Callaway club in my hand
Hittin' balls off of the balcony into the sand
Tryna see where they land
October Firm the new chain of command
El chico, this verse is the explanation for the large ego
100 mill' hands free like Ronaldinho
I go from Star to Venetian in a small speedboat with girls we know
Take your pick, Brooke or Tanya
Both those shorties'd leave their GPS on so I can find ya
Drop location
Spring break trips, I'm in hot rotation
I took a lot of my brothers from B and E licks or the pot rotation
To ridin' shotgun in a Picasso painting
Tricks up sleeves, have 'em playin' innocent to get the shits I need
Loyalty is priceless to me and this I see
Before I ever seen this shit tatted on P and tatted on C and tatted on me
I speak truth and get to shatterin' dreams
So it's best to tiptoe, niggas better know, yeah

[Outro: Drake & Charlie Sloth]
Drizzy Drake! You're an animal Drake! You already know that you an animal bruh! Animal!
I'm saucy!
Saucy! You just stepped out of the club straight into the booth like it's light. Tear up the ting in one take!
Showed up for you, you know what I'm sayin'?
My brother Drizzy
My brother, you already know
Wow. And you know what it's like. You stepped out the club into the booth to prove to everyone why you number one bro. Why you got your foot on their necks!
Nah for real. I stepped in here, SN1, OVO, Fire in the Booth, Charlie Sloth. Come on. The official. I rock with the official. I'm on official ting, you know what it is man. Come on, come on
Ayy bro, it feels like that's another moment there, you know what? Like, I got to say this to you on the real bro. The way that you've embraced British culture will be remembered forever. And the UK love you. The real G's over here, you know that bro. When you go to your parties, you see who's in your parties
Nah, you know what it is, of course
It's the certies
Nah, listen, but listen. It's a family and it's a big family, you know what it is. I'm just happy to be home, like I said man
My brother, man. Foot on neck time
Yo, are these guys dumb? You see the big man Charlie too, oh my goodness
My brother Drizzy. I can hear these rappers' prayers man
Nah, I'm heated for you right now
They're like, "Yo, please tell Drizzy to take his foot off my neck!"
Nah, I'm heated right now man, oh my goodness. Shout out French Montana, my brother, you know what I'm sayin'? The big wave, yeah. Shout out Huncho, Quavo. Shout out Offset, blessings on the new ting. Oh my goodness. Shout out, yo–. I could go for hours. Charlie, come on man
Ayy, you could go for hours. I was at your party the other night, I've seen who was there. I'm like, "Woah!" There's a lot of people, there was a lot of faces in that party
Nah, I don't wanna hear no chat for the whole 18 about Charlie Sloth. Are you dumb? Alright. Jheeze, jheeze
And that right there: one take. A real moment right there
Yeah, jhee!
And that's Fire in the Booth my guy!
And I'll be back January-February part two, you know what time it is. Come on!
Okay, okay
Shout out all the G's too, man. Shout out all the artists man. Everybody from here doin' their thing. I'm telling you. Big inspiration. London, England, come on man
Come on! You know I've applied for your passport, right?
Hahaha. I need that

[Verse 1]
Calling the world from isolation
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained
And if you're coming back to find me
You'd better have good aim
Shoot it true, I need you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you

[Chorus]
I'm alone between the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now?

Caught in the hard to win the raffle
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained
Shoot it true, I want you in the picture

Reset myself and get back on track
I'm alone between the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track

See the state

[Outro]
Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now time for me is nothing 'cause I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs and I
Reset myself and get back on track

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Nigga for real, for real
My niggas is real, for real
I'm in the field for real
I'm 'bout my check for real
I'm 'bout my respect for real
My diamonds are crystal clear
I'm shining from ear to ear

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Roll with the paper, see them lames later
Can't save her, her nigga stepped out, now she sayin' what she really think
Rollin' up pounds of dank
Open accounts, no matter where we at, smoking there and back
Eyes barely open, not never smokin'
Hit it once and she choke
2 K's, that means it's potent
Can't overdose but my strain explosive
Trained to go, my chain, it glow
Everything you see, I paid for
Gang or croak

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Lil Skies]
Nigga for real, for real
My niggas is real, for real
I'm in the field, for real
I'm 'bout my check, for real
I'm 'bout my respect, for real
My diamonds are crystal clear
I'm shining from ear to ear
Nigga for real, for real
My niggas is real, for real
I'm in the field, for real
I'm 'bout my check, for real
I'm 'bout my respect, for real
My diamonds are crystal clear (they clear)
I'm shining from ear to ear

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
I'm shinin' from ear to ear
Stand my ground, I ain't showin' no fear
I done came up like the top of the stairs
These niggas hate 'cause they cannot compare, aw shit
I'm in the crowd with the mosh pit
I hit the stage and they show tits
I'm in the game, I can't forfeit
Honestly, I'ma make more hits
Hop in the coupe and I swerve into lady
She gave me top because I am the greatest
I stayed the same and then came all the changes
You wanna know what it's like to be famous
Rollin' up weed in public (in public)
Skies be on all of that fuck shit (that fuck shit)
I'm ballin' bitch, like I got buckets (got buckets)
And they hate 'cause we stunt like nothing, biatch! (woah)

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Lil Skies]
Nigga for real, for real (for real)
My niggas is real, for real (for real)
I'm in the field for real (for real)

My diamonds are crystal clear (uh-huh)
I'm shining from ear to ear (cash, cash, woah)
Nigga for real, for real
My niggas is real, for real
I'm in the field for real
I'm 'bout my check for real

I'm 'bout the bag, for real
I'm 'bout that cash, for real
Shorty got ass, for real (pssh)
If it's no mask, it's for real
I'm on that gas, for real
My niggas trap for real
Runnin the game
You speak of me, put "Big Homie" in front of my name
For every one of you lames
Y'all unoriginal niggas, they all sound the same
I stay ballin', money like a faucet
It stay runnin', runnin', runnin'

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Nigga for real, for real
My niggas is real, for real

I'm 'bout my check for real
I'm 'bout my respect for real
My diamonds are crystal clear
I'm shining from ear to ear

[Chorus]
Yeah, bitch I'm a king

And anywhere I go

Grind for the cheese
I grind for the paper

And anywhere I go

She roll up with me
Because I'm a king

[Verse 1]
Ain't no debating
New car, another one waiting
I ride slow, remember faces
Go hard no matter what the case is
Hands down, one of the fans' favourite
Not the one to play with
Rich, young
Not really trippin' on being famous
Taylor Gang, can't a thing tame us
Hundred million on my brain
Groupies fuck me 'cause of my chain
When I bleed just my name
Man, the shit that I did for my gang

[Chorus]
Yeah, bitch I'm a king
I fly overseas
Grind for the cheese
I grind for the paper
I ride for my team
And anywhere I go
I roll up the weed
She roll up with me
Because I'm a king
I fly overseas
Grind for the cheese
I grind for the paper
I ride for my team
And anywhere I go
I roll up the weed
She roll up with me
Because I'm a king

[Verse 2]
Real nigga
Been in the game, you's a lil' nigga
Diamonds on my chest now they Hilfiger
Won't rest 'till I get a mil', nigga
Always movin' forward, never still, nigga
Always on my job, never chill, nigga
Came from the 'Burgh field, how I feel nigga
Now I'm in the Hills where I live, nigga
Always said I do it big (do it big)
Now them bitches get lost when they in my crib (in my crib)
Yeah, I always go hard that's how I live (that's how I live)
Got it, I got more to give
Don't grind and it won't appear
Take shots, there's smoke in the air

[Chorus]
Yeah, bitch I'm a king
I fly overseas
Grind for the cheese
I grind for the paper
I ride for my team
And anywhere I go
I roll up the weed

Grind for the cheese

[Intro]
My bad, I came in and fell straight asleep
Tired as a muhfucker
Uh!

[Verse 1]
It was 2009, and I was just gettin' home off tour
Doin' hella shows for my fans
And I could tell that everybody want more
Ain't ever wait for nobody, we kicked through that front door
And always did our own thing
Can't tell you niggas wanna front for
We bought cones and stuffed more, past girls, you cuffed yours
Spent nights on the airplane goin' too hard, like what for?
And all I did was make time but I ain't take enough for myself
Just doin' shit for everybody else, I ain't hardly even by myself
Family time is slowed down, cause they want me to burn out
Seen the end of this movie, they don't know how it turns out
Say they all gon' still love me if I don't make another hit song
If I don't take time to embrace it
What's the point of doin' this for?
I'm packin' up my bags, book a night, another hotel
It's a lot that could go down so I'm hopin' everything goes well
Came in to this game, givin' rules to you lames
Be the one that's holding you down, tryna count you out
It's a shame

[Chorus]
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)

[Verse 2]
It was 2014, and I was 'bout to go world tourin'
You was all up in my face sayin' that you want more
And I was gettin' tired of frontin' for the public
Sayin' I could do without it but you seem like you love it
I remember all of the subjects
That we would argue 'bout day and night
Do the best that I can, no matter what, I can't make it right
When you said you felt single, I remember like it was yesterday
How the fuck you hold me down
When you ain't take my last name?
I tried hard to move past things, came home, made shit change
Had to make a hard decision, let you go
It's time to do what's best for me
We went to Colorado, we was there for your friends' wedding
I was tryin' to hold it together but I felt like we were ending
I remember the beginning but this ain't nowhere close to that
Seen some shit you didn't like, said some shit that wasn't facts
Never thought 'bout gettin' back by puttin' your business out
In the end you made it seem like I ain't the one who held you down

[Chorus]
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)

[Bridge]
We ain't hurtin' no mo', we ain't fighting no mo'
Cause everything, cause everything is okay
We ain't hurtin' no mo' (I swear), we ain't fighting no mo' (no)
Cause everything, cause everything is okay
We ain't hurtin' no mo' (we ain't gotta hurt no more, bro)
We ain't fighting no mo'
Cause everything, cause everything is okay
We ain't hurtin' no mo' (no), we ain't fighting no mo' (nah)
Cause everything, cause everything is okay
Okay, okay, I'm a be okay
Okay, okay, I'm a be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)
Okay, okay, I'm a be okay
Okay, okay, I'm a be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)

[Verse 3]
It was 2017, the day before my son birthday
The week before my mom birthday
That's the day you passed away
Can't feel too bad because I know I see you again one day
But right now I can't help but feel this pain

[Chorus]
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
(Be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay)

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Might as well reach for the stars
Way up in the air where you belong
Might as well reach for the stars
Even if you don't make it, you'll still be with the great ones, yeah

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
(Yeah)
My path, been clear
The bottom, been there
My plate, gon' share
My grind, took years
I've faced, my fears
I've passed, my peers
I've switched, them gears
They in, the rear
Goin' hard, there no stoppin' him
Everyday gotta thank God again
Money really ain't no problem
Nigga talk crazy, gon' ride on him
Niggas turn they back
Then they wanna be on your side again
Nigga keep it G like alphabet
We ain't tryna be on the ground

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
Better go for the gusto
Way up on the rack, my muscle
I'm a get mine's, it's always been cutthroat
Ten toes to the ground, I must blow
On my way up, but I do this for us though
Whatever you set your mind to you can do that, do that
On the ground, full-time I shine cause I'm puttin' in work nigga true that, true that
Ain't it funny how the world go round
Ain't nothin' new to me under the sun
If I did it, Wiz did it, Kray did it, player
Put it up on Bone you can get ya some
Just take that "can't" up outta your vocab
You so bad
Tell the world that you can, can
Little man, man
You gon' land

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Might as well reach for the stars
Way up in the air where you belong
Might as well reach for the stars
Even if you don't make it, you'll still be with the great ones, yeah
Might as well reach for the stars
Way up in the air where you belong
Might as well reach for the stars
Even if you don't make it, you'll still be with the great ones, yeah

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Reach for the stars
Why not go Mars?
We go way too hard
Ya’ll niggas still in cars
No limit the galaxy ours
Shaking these suckas like gravity
To the bottom they constantly grabbin' me
Let ‘em know, straight face
Ya’ll niggas can’t fuck with Kray
But I’m on the brand new wave
And I know that these niggas beneath me
Keep 'em beneath me mane
Keepin’ the heat, niggas is creepin, I gotta keep the thang
They don’t wanna see me shine but the nigga’s so sick with the grind
And they don’t wanna see Kray high, so high, I’m scraping the sky

[Verse 4: Bizzy Bone]
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
It's that Thuggish, Ruggish, Bone
Just like I keep my gun on me
I keep my hustle on
I know what I'm worth and I ain't wrong
Bet I'm in a betterment
I bet I'm in a zone
Telling me I better take a cut and I'll be gone
Currency, I finna reach for the stars
But don't you worry me
Currently, the future of this music starts to worry me
That's all ya'll, all ya'll, all ya'll
Cannabis Sativa
And Wiz Khalifa ya'll

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Might as well reach for the stars
Way up in the air where you belong
Might as well reach for the stars
Even if you don't make it, you'll still be with the great ones, yeah
Might as well reach for the stars
Way up in the air where you belong
Might as well reach for the stars
Even if you don't make it, you'll still be with the great ones, yeah

[Verse 5: Flesh-N-Bone]
Tell me how far is that you see
I'm in another galaxy
Fuck Scotty I'mma beam you up then back down, check this reality
So that give 'em a full dose of ambition, that's ammunition
That click and that clack don't stop it's that drug I'm cookin' in the kitchen
How many pounds a day?
Maybe get few keys of yay
Ya'll heard but they sound like they say
Ya'll fuck around, they don't play
Everyday, it's a special occasion
Everyday, it's a celebration
Everyday, a brand new creation
Everyday, got a brand new hater

[Verse 6: Wish Bone]
Rewind, rewind
You can get the state of mind
And then never give in to it
Speak into existence
Put more weight on the best life, live relentless, (relentless)!
Do the most, do the most
And if I'm close, I never think lose
Never think lose
Not this dude
And if it comes 'round to it, do it
Stand in my way, and I'm a show how we do it, do it
Thugs us no play, no conscience leave 'em all clueless
I do this, do this. Go against the goal. Need I say? That's foolish
Rope-a-dope style on the ropes
Better than me then prove it

[Outro: Layzie Bone]

[Verse 1: MXXNLIGHT]
I been in my zone (I been in my zone)
I just wanna know (I just wanna know)
Why you left me in the cold (why you left me in the cold)
Now you're blowin' up my phone (now you're blowin' up my phone)
Only when I get a check, you wanna call me
Every other night, you go out poppin' molly
People think you're nice, but girl you're really naughty
I hit up Santa, had to tell him you're a thotty

[Chorus: MXXNLIGHT]
You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen
You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, got all the papers rolled
Used to be Backwoods, now it's cones
Fuck a DM, I'm slidin' through your home
You sendin' them pics to my phone
You like that I'm well known
But still be hella low
On point, your friends ain't gotta know
Don't go tellin' 'em 'bout my stroke
She might want to find out
Ain't nothin' new, this happens all the time
Pressure break pipes, hit me late night
Ain't the gang, it ain't right, yeah

[Chorus: MXXNLIGHT]
You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen
You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Finally free, high off the tree
Nigga had a lockdown, she was under siege
Wanna be flyin' places and smokin' in peace
On the runnin' team with my own machine
They ain't comin' close, that's why you puttin' on your clothes
And rushin' out the door when it's over
Nowhere near sober, nigga say he need closure
I just throw another pound your way and hope
Next time I see you, you'll know how to roll
Gang or ain't, nothing at all

[Chorus: MXXNLIGHT]
You'll never be my wife not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen
You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
I was born a star
It's gang or nothin' at all
Got your bitch tryna FaceTime the call
Heh heh heh

[Intro]
Gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang
Gang

[Verse 1]
Leave it to me, I'll have you twisting that weed with a G
Got too much talent just to be sittin' around with
Weed and alcohol, that's the balance
Ridin' in the Benz with low mileage
Working 'til my hands get callouses
Been a player, I established it
Whips be the fastest
Chicks be the baddest and my kush above average
Legendary status and my crib like a palace
I know why they mad
'Cause your bitch layin' in my bed
Still got the weed smell in her hair
Comin' home later, nigga gettin' carats
Make a whole pound disappear
Come for the money, tryna get it all
If it's for the gang, Imma get involved
Look at me different now
Roll some weed and put your niggas on
You ain't bout the paper, what you in it for?

[Chorus]
And my eyes so low, soon as I walk in
I got a joint rolled you know that I'ma spark it
That's why I ride so slow, me and my gangsters
I hear 'em talkin' like they livin' but they ain't us
Pockets, they swole
I won't leave here alone, came here with no bitch
But when I walk out the door, I might leave here with your bitch

[Verse 2]
Uh, they ain't goin hard as us
We courtside, chillin', smokin' out the building
Regardless if authorities give us permission
Boss bitches niggas breakin' they credit card limits
To try to ball with us
We in talks with those who own they own business
My spark lit, then I paint pictures
Don't leave witnesses, nah nigga, my gang different
Pull the Benz out in the rain
Hit her once, I won't even remember her name
Hella diamonds up in my chain
To say that I'm dope is an understatement but no, I ain't underrated
Came from a place where niggas make their own way
Got some girls who fuck me but got niggas so they don't say
I'm puttin' KK in the paper
On point, gang ready for danger
Long joints, rollin' them things like broken fingers
Too clean to ever have a stain
Khalifa the boss before you beat the game

[Chorus]
And my eyes so low, soon as I walk in
I got a joint rolled you know that imma spark it
That's why I ride so slow, me and my gangsters
I hear 'em talkin' like they livin' but they ain't us
Pockets, they swole
I won't leave here alone, came here with no bitch
But when I walk out the door, I might leave here with your bitch

[Outro]
Pockets is gettin' swole
Used to smoke blunts now it's paper she roll
Diamonds to my toes
Everywhere I go, I'm froze
You already know
Fool
Gangsters too
This is how them gangsters do

[Refrain]
Everybody wants someone to blame
Taking losses that's part of the game
Ain't forgetting how far that we came
Hey
Everybody wants someone to blame
Taking losses that's part of the game
Ain't forgetting how far that we came
Hey

[Verse 1]
Uh, if you made for the top, then you gon' make it to the top
And you gon' keep goin' because the game don't stop
If you always stay ten toes you ain't gon' flop
Lot of doors will get closed but ain't gon' lock
Things, they change it's a newer game
Niggas who talk but won't do the same
Plus they all broke, I see through the fame
Invest in yourself like you do them chains
Next year is you gon' be on private planes

[Chorus]
And you can't blame anyone
It's on you, you, you
Don't give in, keep on goin'
And you can't blame anyone
It's on you, you, you
Don't give in, keep on goin'

[Verse 2]
L.A. to Miami, Atlanta to Houston, New York
Do what you gotta do for now it makes you feel important
You could be in the room with bosses, won't even absorb it
Cause you too busy livin' out what you see in the portrait
All the things you involve with
Are just the smallest problems
I ain't gon' need a part in
And I'm just being honest
You need to take some time to yourself and think about it
Grow up, quit being childish
I wanna see you balance
Don't think you're being challenged

[Chorus]
And you can't blame anyone
It's on you, you, you
Don't give in, keep on goin'
And you can't blame anyone
It's on you, you, you
Don't give in, keep on goin'

[Refrain]
Everybody wants someone to blame
Taking losses that's part of the game
Ain't forgetting how far that we came
Hey
Everybody wants someone to blame
Taking losses that's part of the game
Ain't forgetting how far that we came
Hey

[Intro]
Nigga, my motherfuckin' life depends on this shit
Do this shit for my son
Turn me up
So I can hear myself a little more in the headphones, uh

[Verse 1]
Came from the bottom, started this out with nothin'
Turned to fam and my squad, and turn this thing into somethin'
I grab a cone and I stuff it, never gon' get enough
Dependin' on how its goin', we only gonna get tougher
I done seen people suffer, hate turned into love
Lost some people to get here
But they watchin' from up above
On the road, hardly ever home
And money caught one in the dome
Now its hard to even pick up my phone
Leave me alone, I be in my zone
I'm gettin' grown but not too grown to let my feelin's show
Anythin' you want, you can get, you gotta build it though
I blew up quick and lost some shit
But now I'm dealing though
There's consequences to every decision
Good or wrong, just do the best with time you're given and live strong

[Pre-Chorus]
Give your all 'cause a man gon' be a man
And do what he gotta do
Baby, this is rolling papers 2
(This is rolling papers 2)
(This is rolling papers 2)

[Chorus]
I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it
(I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, all of the fame just comes with the game
It's a gift and a curse when everybody know your name
How do you make a million dollars and still stay the same
How do you make a hundred millions and still stay sane
You got the money, the clothes, the cars, the girls
Tryin' to do better, but all this shit's in your world
Somethin' regular is what you'd prefer
But it's cool, it's too much pressure, you think you should curve
On the verge of packin' up and goin' back to where I came from
Tired of these rappers, I only run into lame ones
Tired of these girls, we all fuckin' the same ones
I ain't givin' chances no more, I already gave one
Gettin' money, you better save some
Don't be afraid of mistakes 'cause you gotta make some

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes time, but a man gon' be a man and do what he gotta do
Baby, this is rolling papers 2
(This is rolling papers 2)
(This is rolling papers 2)

[Chorus]
I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it
(I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it)

[Verse 3]
No turnin' back, I'm learnin' that
If you ever show someone love, you deserve it back
If you got an ounce and some papers, you should burn a pack
And if you ever do take a loss, you can earn it back
Never slack, never overreact, let your money stack
Look at where you're going and not where you at
You gon' get there if you work hard
When you make it, you'll get exactly what you work for
I want more, couple cars in my garage
A mansion with marble floors
And a butler to open my doors
Couple plaques on the wall
A Hoop court where my friends could ball
It may sounds strange but I'ma need it all
Winter Spring Summer Fall, I hit the road when I get the call
Got some family members that I don't see at all

[Pre-Chorus]
It pays off 'cause a man gon' be a man and do what he gotta do
Baby, this is rolling papers 2
(This is rolling papers 2)
(This is rolling papers 2)

[Chorus]
I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it
(I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it)

[Intro]
New benz
Cop one for you and your friends
Papers two
Rolling papers two
I only do what gangsters do

[Verse 1]
Through with the basics
You think it's a spaceship when I ride through
Feel like I'm on ice, we just glide
Niggas is parasites
I get pussy in a pair of off-whites
Know I want it, you can see it my eyes, surprise
'Cause I visualized it
Always knew I was the man
You just realized it
Don't need a detector, I can see the lies
I'm a different type of being
Drive the type of whip your bitches like to be in
Smoke got my eyes lookin' Korean
Every time that I fly, VIP'n
All of my nigga's ride
Two joints, that's double homicide
Got you rolling papers to me while you gettin' high
We went from coppin' it to supplyin'
Be there at the drop of a dime
All else fails, I can depend on mine
Fuck signs, my niggas gettin' high
Party of flyest, Taylor gang or resign

[Verse 2]
Why you even come back to my crib if you ain't stayin'?
Ridin' with some real niggas, know that we ain't playin'
Pockets on swole and you know that I keep them faces
Money through the roof, I just crash it and replace it
All my bitches bad, I don't fuck her if she basic
Lotta niggas in the game, Khalifa man, the greatest
Blowin' all this money, need someone to help me save it
Lickin' on me all night, she said she love my flavor
Homie, I'm a boss baby, I don't need no favors
Got so many cars, I don't got room for my neighbors
Got a bad broad, but you know me, I might take her
Fuck about a bitch though, I'm all about my paper
Khalifa man will stick to the code, no I don't save her
Suckin' on me good, treat me like a Now and Later
Breakfast in the morn', we can get our dinner catered
Try to hit my phone, I don't pick up 'cause I'm faded

[Chorus]
I've been on my shit, 'cause I'm hot now
I ain't used to get it but I got it now
You can't tell me shit, tell me nothin'
Anything I want, I pull up in
I've been on my shit, 'cause I'm hot now
I ain't used to get it but I got it now
You can't tell me shit, tell me nothin'
Anything I want, I pull up in

[Verse 3]
Anything I want, I pull up and stunt
Parking in the back, we can't do the front
Real niggas pay the papers, a plus
Ain't with the gang, you can't sit with us
Take them bitches phones, ain't no thang, we don't trust 'em
Send 'em for the gangs, why they came, we don't love 'em
Takin' all our time, we don't need to rush
Smellin' like the KK, it's serious
Grind every day, 'cause the process I trust in
Think they the way, but they bluffin'
Baby, I can spend it all, don't care how much it's costing
Grind and you get all this, my niggas is ballin'

[Chorus]
I've been on my shit, 'cause I'm hot now
I ain't used to get it but I got it now
You can't tell me shit, tell me nothin'
Anything I want, I pull up in
I've been on my shit, 'cause I'm hot now
I ain't used to get it but I got it now
You can't tell me shit, tell me nothin'
Anything I want, I pull up in

[Outro]
Two joints, that's double homicide
Got your bitch jumpin' in my ride
She with the gang and she down to fly
Rolling papers up and gettin' high

[Intro]
Got you rolling papers, got you rolling papers
Got you rolling papers, got you rolling papers
Minus the bullshit
Got you rolling papers, got you rolling (uh)

[Verse 1]
Can't do it average, you cool and savage
Makin' niggas do backflips
FaceTime my phone, you be on a jet
Roll my spliffs, send me pics every now and then
When we met, I could admit, I was just after sex
Taught you not to look for results, but trust the process
Plus, you got your paper, ain't no nonsense
Smoke from the bong intense, when she with you, she over it
Faded but focused, I stay posted
Hit me up, the case closed, I leave the gate open
Know what's good, your chain say "Ocean"
Put you on to the finer things
Now when you see designer, you keep your composure
Send a text, say she comin' over
I don't have to send a car, she get her own 'Cause she ain't been sober
No panties on, you ain't needin' those Ron O'Neal, Curtis Mayfield
Hittin' notes, hit the joint, leave the roach

[Chorus]
You don't know
What you do to me lately
I got so much love for ya
Want you to know
How much that I fuck with you, oh
You don't know
What you do to me lately
Wanna roll one up for ya
Want you to come to the back of the club
Show some love to a real one (uh)

[Verse 2]
Netflix and extra long spliffs
Hit it once, she recognize what the difference is
My bottom bitch don't even trip
She see me with other chicks
She hardly drink, but for me, she'll take a sip
Do what you gotta do to pay your rent
Only party with lame niggas at they expense
I'm talkin' good weed, steak and shrimp
Niggas runnin' off with styles that they ain't invent
Tried to grab a towel just to hide the scent
You smell the kush all through the vent
Go through the hallways lookin' innocent
I've been a gangster and a gentleman
Talk to the boss and not no middlemen
Is you with it or against it?
Please make a decision
Smoke a pound a day, eliminate the competition
I'm that nigga, been that nigga
Past and present tenses
You look good, I need a badder bitch to complement you

[Chorus]
You don't know
What you do to me lately
I got so much love for ya
Want you to know
How much that I fuck with you, oh
You don't know
What you do to me lately
Wanna roll one up for ya
Want you to come to the back of the club
Show some love to a real one

[Outro]
It's a gang thing, it's a gang thing
It's a gang thing, it's a gang thing
Don't do me like that
I'm a star too
Sledgro
Everywhere that we go
We blow it by the 0
The K.K., the smoke

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Eh, eh, eh
Uhh

[Chorus]
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
Will I forget you, I might probably never
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
You bring your friends for me like ohh, that's extra
I treat you special 'cause you very special

[Verse 1]
Hotels ain't enough, get the crib like we live there
Been a player, I ain't fucking off
Handle my business, my squad chillin'
Focus on what I'm buildin', you should probably be filming
What I'm smokin' is quality, not for children
Half these niggas is wannabes, I came up different
Call me in the clutch, perfect timin', never rush
Top floor, bring it up, ain't the gang came with us
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Chorus]
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
Will I forget you, I might probably never
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
You bring your friends for me like ohh, that's extra
I treat you special 'cause you very special

[Verse 2]
Love how I treat you, fuck you once, nice to meet you
Your outfit see through, other bitches dying to be you
Niggas wonder why you leaving with me
Tired of him, she wanna ride with nigga who sees what she sees
Hit me up when you need company
Or if you're ever free, I'm never hard to reach
Baby I'm been on this, come to weed I smoke them bombest
Hold it down, maybe the gang is what you could be a part of

[Chorus]
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
Will I forget you, I might probably never
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
I treat you special 'cause you very special
You bring your friends for me like ohh, that's extra
I treat you special 'cause you very special

[Outro]
Imma roll two when I roll through
Imma roll two when I roll through
Hey

Two papers, two rollies
Roll two

[Chorus]
Whoa, you be goin' hard, you be goin' hard

Other bitches, they be slackin', you be on your job

[Verse 1]
Know me from the start, I'ma play my part
I got no heart, I be goin' hard
I be blowin' strong, got my money long
Ain't down for the situation, then you can't grow
Got a fat ass, how do you perform?
Say she love my swag, ask what I got on
Fuck you all night, Uber in the morning
Your girl look good, you should tell her join in

[Chorus]
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
Other bitches, they be slackin', you be on your job
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
Other bitches, they be slackin', you be on your job
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard

[Verse 2]
Baby, bend it over, let me see you twerk
Say that you can't stay, say you gotta work
So big I see that ass underneath your skirt
Smoke weed, so you pass 'cause you need the purp
I be on alert, grindin' from the dirt
Fucked her so good, say I come in first
You just need another glass, then you gettin' turnt
Bend it over, throw it back, put it in reverse

[Chorus]
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
Other bitches, they be slackin', you be on your job
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard
You be goin' hard, you be goin' hard

Other bitches, they be slackin', you be on your job

[Chorus: THEMXXNLIGHT]
Don't fear
Just love me under the moonlight

You gon' regret this if you don't so
Let's get to lovin'
Let's get to lovin'
Let's get to lovin', babe

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm fresh off the dank, got more to bake
Never running out, same goes for the bank
Gas in the tank, top rank
About the cake, we don't use brakes
Too blazed, pilots say we can't get on the plane
No debate, pounds are putting on, I'm making weight
Money safe, put it in there for a rainy day
Niggas hate, don't fuck with them anyway
I hustle too many ways to get comfortable
You know how I'm coming
Call your girl, let's get into something
Money discussions, take my time, I ain't rushing
Want someone you could trust in
Me, I'ma fuck, and get up in the dusk
Got work tomorrow that's two of us
I feel like I can't lose
KK joints 'till I can't move
She happy I came through
Giving rolling lessons to a crew
Smoke like I do
No lie, we the truth
So high, leave the room, gang

[Chorus: THEMXXNLIGHT]
Don't fear
Just love me under the moonlight
The shine on your body
So bright, yeah

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Big money in it or count me out
Burying safes with undisclosed amounts
They all over the place
Plus I fuck with the banks
I got a couple accounts
She got a million dollar mouth
She was born with it
She went to Dr. Miami for the rest of the shit
Stacked out, renegade on the Vegas strip
But she pay me for the game that I gave the bitch
A level headed gentleman with a crazy wrist
Boss player, thirty points plus twenty assists
I'm not selfish 'cause I throw all my niggas in the mix
Don't cuff none
Introduce my homie to the bitch if she want some
Chick will come through, get done, spend money, bang bitches but I don't love one
Hustle 'till the cops come, Ferrari, drive out run
Pull up, hop out
Car stunts I've done

[Chorus: THEMXXNLIGHT]
Don't fear
Just love me under the moonlight
The shine on your body
So bright, yeah
Your beauty's blinding
But baby, tonight I hope
My sight's alright

You gon' regret this if you don't so
Let's get to lovin'
Let's get to lovin'
Let's get to lovin', babe

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Tapping fools out, Bruce in his first bout
I ain't searching for clout, bringing cars out
Large amounts of money, guard the vaults 'cause we stars
Chase paper, smoke strong
All my bitches get along, well informed
What's your nigga doing
Cut your phone off, hit you in the morn'
Said he borin', ain't important
True color showing
My whip look comfortable, don't it
Keep them papers rolling, don't see my opponents
Stay focused

[Chorus: THEMXXNLIGHT]
Don't fear
Just love me under the moonlight
The shine on your body
So bright, yeah
Your beauty's blinding
But baby, tonight I hope
My sight's alright
In the night, I'm in my zone
You gon' regret this if you don't so
Let's get to lovin'
Let's get to lovin'
Let's get to lovin', babe

[Intro]
Hit me up-up, up-up, yeah
Hit me up-up, up-up, yeah
Hit me up-up, up-up, yeah
Hit me up-up, up-up, yeah

[Verse 1]
Diamond rings, Diamond chains
Diamonds on everything
Spend some quarters, dropping chains
Hop on to a private plane
Pay the cost to be the boss
Now I need some time to floss
I hear 'em, don't believe them tho
Paper, I just get and go
Making conversation, problems facing
Not them niggas round the way
I keep a nice long jay
It's no police so I'ma blaze it
I'm taking niggas out the waste
Always rolling up, my killing
Try to get another million in my safe

[Chorus]
Said they'll be there when you need 'em
But I just don't see them, where's the love
And if you down for me, I'll be right there
When you need me, hit me up
Said they'll be there when you need 'em
But I just don't see her, where's the love
And if you down for me, I'll be right there
When you need me, hit me up

[Verse 2]
Couple bangs, popping
Got a couple chain options
Look like rain drops in every ring that I'm rocking
Niggas want me falling off but nigga we ain't stopping
Always hit the mark, 'cause I know how to stay in pocket
Now they stare, mind is clear
I seen yours, mine is rare
Money long, not a
