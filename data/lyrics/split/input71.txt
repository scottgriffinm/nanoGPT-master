care
Blowing strong, down to share
When I'm home, I'm the mayor
Rims gold, like a player
Really cold rocking carats

[Chorus]
Said they'll be there when you need 'em
But I just don't see them, where's the love
And if you down for me, I'll be right there
When you need me, hit me up
Said they'll be there when you need 'em
But I just don't see her, where's the love
And if you down for me, I'll be right there
When you need me, hit me up

[Part I: Karate]

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Chevy Woods]
Cup full of gin, I want her and her friend
I might fuck once, but I never ever call again
Fucked your bitch in my vans, slapped the shit up out yo' man
Fuck the police, I go HAM
Hit her from the back like, "Damn!"

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa & Chevy Woods]
Damn! How you get all that?
All that OG in my joint, how you hit all that?
I be always movin' forward, I ain't never movin' backwards
Natural with the talent, I don't ever have to practice
And since we talkin' practice bitch, I'm ballin' just like Iverson
My new bitch immaculate and I'm so used to traffickin'
I be with the baddest bitch and best believe I'm stabbin' it
I hit her with the magic stick, my car could do a magic trick
You can't lock me down baby, let me live my life
Whip a four into a six, 'cause baby I'm not nice
Ayy, you ain't bossed up nigga, you can't change that price
Tried to short me, got him on the phone like, "Make that right"
Got a plane to catch, we can only fuck for 30 minutes
Say she got a man, but she say she love me when I'm in it
I'm a real nigga, scratch my tattoos when I hit it
Fuck her real good, make her call a Uber when I'm finished
That's my nigga Chev, I get to the bag
Flight came wit' a bed, yo' bitch give me head
Like, "Ooh!", ooh she smart
This a spaceship, this a robot, watch it park

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Chevy Woods]
Cup full of gin, now we're huntin' her friend
I might fuck once, but I never ever call again
Fucked your bitch in my vans, slapped the shit up out yo' man
Fuck the police, I go HAM
Hit her from the back like, "Damn!", (ooh)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa & Chevy Woods]
I can see the plot (ooh)
Ooh, I just bagged a thot (ooh)
Diamonds, they be dancing macarena in my watch
Sippin' Faygo, servin' Legos baby, you know I have blocks, ayy
Mother-fuck the neighbours, they was wishin' that it stop, woo
Gun in my crib and we gettin' it André
Gettin' them Benjamins all day
No I ain't payin' attention, my charm is a artist, my chain a magician
Pourin' and drinkin', I'm sippin', I'm in there one time roll that dank and I'm finished
And my bitch bad like Dennis the Menace, I gave her the business
I just fucked your baby mama, ooh boy, you the enemy
Text and said she sick and need the dick, she want the remedy
I just want the headshot, I just want the Kennedy
Got to rappin' like I'm Wopo, don't know what got into me

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Chevy Woods]
Cup full of gin, now we're huntin' her friend
I might fuck once, but I never ever call again
Fucked your bitch in my vans, slapped the shit up out yo' man
Fuck the police, I go HAM
Hit her from the back like, "Damn!"

[Part II: Never Hesitate]

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Pounds of good smoke
Used to smoke blunts, but now it's paper she roll (two)
And I'm with some gangstas, gangstas
And I'm with some gangstas

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, heaven and glory
She so high tellin' me stories
Puttin' on for the G's before me
We the motherfucking gang, Army, Navy, Air Force
Blowin' KK got me airborne
Gettin' comfortable's what I'm here for
Confidence in my approach, the fans wanna hear more
Therefore, I built this whole belief that I'ma stand on the foundation, that's real
Smokin' on what Beatrix wanted to do to Bill
Chill, as my driver turns the wheel
Rollin' papers, never let the paper stand still
I'm on a mission and I can, will
Eliminate the competition to destroy the enemy, just gotta break the image

[Chorus: Darrius Willrich]
How do I anticipate
What I need in my relationship with you
How do I never hesitate
When I'm afraid and don't understand what to do

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Got your nigga emotional
Goin' through his feelings
Never fit in but always manage to get my dividends
We at the crib, bring your friends
I could show you how I live
Say you want to fuck but it depends
I met her at Penn, leave 'em in the wind
Hardly ever call them again
Swedish bitch, call her Harley Quinn
Nigga, your squad hardly win
I could just send out one call them hoes fallin' in
They cheerin' for the kid 'cause I'm ballin'
Winter, spring, summer, fall, I just want it all
Got a joint rolled for each and every one of y'all
All my clothes is recent, all my hoes is decent
Can't join us or beat us

[Chorus: Darrius Willrich]
How do I anticipate
What I need in my relationship with you
How do I never hesitate
When I'm afraid and don't understand what to do

[Outro]
Got you rollin' papers, got you rollin' papers
Pullin' up to Ubers, wakin' up the neighbors
Got you rollin' papers, got you rollin' papers
Got you rollin' papers, got you rollin' papers
Fallin' asleep, wakin' up days later
Huh-huh-huh-huh
And it ain’t about the clout nigga
It's about getting paid and smokin' out
That's what we about
Hah-hah-hah-hah

[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Look at you go, okay, you bubblin'
Look, go, go, look at you go
Okay, you bubblin', look

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, one in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin'
Look at the cash, look at the cash comin' in
Come get your mans, this lil' nigga buggin' me
Just leave the bag, quit all that jaw-jackery
Don't even pass me that, I don't want none of it (yeah)
These niggas mad about it, had enough of it
Woah, watch what you sayin', all that poppin' and shakin'
Got me hot as a laser, my posse deep and irate
And we act a fool for the paper, had a dream and I made it
El Camino on Dayton's, Vintage Guess over Bape
Put the bread on me, bitch, bitch, you bet I'ma bank it
Piggy flat in a blanket, I might just roll out today
I might just roll out to Vegas, head back to my old ways
Cop a room full of Asian hoes and do blow all day
Look at me, baby, look at me, baby
Don't I look like a million? I'm 'bout to clean out the safe
D-don't I look like somebody that just be bodyin' everything?
All that talkin' is great, but I don't be talkin', I air it out
All the problems have gotten easy to bury
I'd rather drown them in Hendrick's, I'd rather kiss on my Mary
I been broker way longer than I been rich, so until it levels out
I'ma take your mama to the Marriott and wear it out
Took me so long to get it, gonna spread it out
Let 'em know all about me when I'm dead and gone

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
One in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)
One in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)
Look at the cash, look at the cash bubblin' (okay, you bubblin')
Look at the cash (look)
Bubblin' (go)
One in the hand (look), one in the hand (go)
One in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)
Look at the cash, look at the cash bubblin' (okay, you bubblin')
Look at the cash (look)
Bubblin'

[Break]
Yo, Anderson .Paak, Busta Rhymes!

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Every time I come I hit a nigga in the middle
Hit a nigga high, hit a nigga low (Aye!)
And as I fuck it up a little more
Kill 'em and I get 'em
And they whine when they hit the floor (Yeah!)
And while I'm guzzlin' a little bit of yack 'cause the spot bubblin' my nigga, where the dough? (Where it at?!)
Now put the motherfucking money in the bag
Hurry up my nigga right now, gotta go
So much truth in the nigga head
Like the water gonna pop
Boilin' and bubblin' and its takin' everything I got
I got a boy and he strugglin' no matter how they wanna pop
Boy we be husslin' and try to make a nigga stop
We huntin' and then moshin' and then messin' and then we beat him in the head
'Til we got him tumblin' and shufflin' and mumblin' and tusslin'
And have a hard time recoverin'
Back for more than truce (ay ay ay)
One's in the air, everybody better put 'em up
Everybody better get to the back
Stack money, nigga get it up
Know what I mean
Every time we pull up niggas wilin' on the scene
Step back, look jack, fuck around and make a nigga
Black back till you sound like a fiend
Any time that I come and I get up in the buildin'
Niggas already know there's gonna be a killin'
And I give you more, hit 'em with the raw
Uncut pure raw coke, that'll keep a nigga shiverin'
See me I don't give a damn
When I smoke this gurkah
Bitches they be fightin' and be bickerin'
Niggas know to give it up
And nothing to question, better believe we be deliverin'
(let's go!)

[Interlude: Sample]
"Get over here and empty your pockets."
"I don't do that."
"You're my prisoner—you do what I tell you to do—get over here."
"Haha, he's gonna get nasty about it!"
"Fuckin' bitch!"
"Frank! Cool it, huh?"
"Stay the fuck outta this!"

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
One in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)
One in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)
Look at the cash, look at the cash bubblin' (okay, you bubblin')
Look at the cash (look)
Bubblin' (go)
One in the hand (look), one in the hand (go)
One in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)
Look at the cash, look at the cash, bubblin' (okay, you bubblin')
Look at the cash (look)
Bubblin'

I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy (Enemy)
Your enemy (Your enemy), your enemy

[Chorus]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 2]
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away (Walk away)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me

[Chorus]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse

[Verse 3]
I jump in that pussy like jumpin' jacks
I saw my old bitch, now she want me back
I don't got nothin' for you, bitch, callin' racks
I smoke loud in the Jag, that's a Thundercat
They thought I was doin' bad 'til they noticed that
I didn't need 'em for jack and they noticed that
I walked in with some cash and I throw them racks
Honeymoon, kiss on the table
Hoe, no candy, but I see you later
And my ring is so big like equators
All I want is acre, fuck a neighbor
If you silent, nigga, tell them nothing
That my jeans are ice cream, so I cake her
Promise to

Brand new Irvings an' they Suaders

[Chorus]
Excuse me, Patrick Ewing
All white with a bubblegum bottle, ayy
I'm pursuing, I won't ever ruin, ruin
Oh, baby, I won't call 'em
Oh, baby, I won't call 'em
Oh, baby, I won't call 'em

[Chorus]
My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out
Of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

[Verse]
In my own way, this feel like livin'
Some alternate reality
And I was drownin', but now I'm swimmin'
Through stressful waters to relief
Yeah, oh, the things I'd do
To spend a little time in Hell
And what I won't tell you
I'll prolly never even tell myself
Don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you inside all day?
I wish it was nice out, but it look like rain
Grey skies are driftin', not livin' forever
They told me it only gets better

[Chorus]
My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out
Of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Well, okay

[Chorus]
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Shame on you (Yeah)
Everything is strange (Strange), that's just a game (Game)
Everybody trippin' (Woo,) throwin’ it away (Yeah)
We was gettin' lifted, now we gettin' paid
Shame on you (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
A—a'ight, a'ight
I paid the cost to see apostrophes
That means it's mine (Yeah,) keep to myself, takin' my time (Uh-huh)
Always into some bullshit, and outta line
Drivin' with my eyes closed, missin' all the signs
Turn the ignition, I'm driven and sittin' pretty (Pretty)
Listenin' to Whitney and whippin' it through the city, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Man on a mission, figure it out
Puttin' way too much on my shoulders, please hold me down (Down, down)
I keep my head above the water (Water)
My eyes gettin' bigger, so the world is gettin' smaller (Smaller)
I be gettin' richer but that only made me crazy
Mama told me I was different even when I was a baby
That Mercedes through the P.A. when I pull up (Pull up), soundin' like a concert
Or a (or a), or a monster truck, I'm trippin' but I'm fallin' up
Always said I want it all, but it's not enough
Well, o-kay (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Shame on you (Yeah)
And everything is strange (Strange), that's just a game (Game)
Everybody trippin' (Woo,) throwin’ it away (Yeah)
We was gettin' lifted, now we gettin' paid
Shame on you (Yeah)

[Bridge]
We only just begun
No, we don't wanna hurt your feelings
'Cause it’s only just begun
No, we don't wanna
Hurt (Hurt) feelings (Feelings)

[Verse 2]
Down go the system, long live the king (King)
Turn the power off and get your water from the spring (Spring)
I'm bringing everyone with me when shit get iffy (Yeah)
I give a hundred and fifty percent
This is the shit that I'm dealing with, but I wish I'd forget
Used to be feelin' depressed, now that I'm livin' I'm a little obsessed, yes
High in Jacuzzis, I be hittin' the jets
I'm showing her some love she been givin' me sex (Bless, bless)
Respect to Adonai
Don't fuck around and be a victim of your pride, why you lyin'?
(Why you lyin'?) Tell the truth, just step aside
I don't got the time to let it slide (Yep)
I'm too grounded, push whips that move mountains
New cribs, blue fountains, these are my surroundings
I've been going through it, you just go around it
But it's really not that different when you think about it

[Chorus]
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Shame on you (Yeah)
And everything is strange (Strange), that's just a game (Game)
Everybody trippin' (Woo,) throwin’ it away (Yeah)
We was gettin' lifted, now we gettin' paid
Shame on you (Yeah)

Feelings

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute wit' it, fuck a little
What's the use?
Never superficial, you gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Okay, we're colder than the breeze
But the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker, hol' up
You don't need to hol' up, yeah
And I can show you how I seem
What it is, what it truly might be, nothin' that you know of
You don't need to hol' up
I'm so a-bove and beyond
You take drugs to make it up way up where we on
Space shuttle, Elon
Time, we don't waste much, fuck when we wake up
Then I have her sing just like Céline Dion
Catch me if you can but, you'll never catch me, damn
Whole lotta, "Yes, I am"
All the way in wit' no exit plan
Already left and the jet don't land
Yeah, the time is tickin', come take a ride, get inside
This is highly different, I'm talkin' fly, got a pilot wit' 'im, uh
Can I mind my business?
Why you trippin'? Give you somethin' that your eyes can witness
Ooh, you're too close
I don't understand why you doin' the most

[Chorus: Mac Miller, Snoop Dogg, Mac Miller & Snoop Dogg]
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just (I just) want a (Want a) 'nother ('Nother) minute (Minute) wit' it
Fuck a little, what's the use?
What's the use? (Use)
Never (Never) super- (Super) -ficial (Ficial)
You gon' (You gon') know it (Know it) when it (When it) hit you (Hit you)
Get a (Get a) little (Little) senti- (Senti) -mental when I'm off the juice (Turn it up)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Well, I'ma give you what you came for, yeah
Shit, I've worked too hard to have a clue who you are
Set the bar so far above par, we can parlay all day
Crib long range with the yard
I know I should probably pray more but you gotta love me
'Cause I save the day, spend money
When I had nothin', shit, it wasn't so funny
Made a promise to the homies nobody go hungry
Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name
But it never worry my brain
Heads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'
Tell the sun, "Get up outta my shade"
If they don't get the picture, cut 'em outta that frame, shit
I'm up thirty thou' miles plus change
It's been a while but I'm down 'til I'm out
And it is what it is 'til it ain't, yeah

[Bridge: Thundercat]
Ooh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh, I just wanna fly
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ha

[Chorus: Mac Miller, Snoop Dogg, Mac Miller & Snoop Dogg]
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just (I just) want a (Want a) 'nother ('Nother) minute (Minute) wit' it
Fuck a little, what's the use?
What's the use? (Use)
Never (Never) super- (Super) -ficial (Ficial)
You gon' (You gon') know it (Know it) when it (When it) hit you (Hit you)
Get a (Get a) little (Little) senti- (Senti) -mental when I'm off the juice (Juice)

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
You can love it
It just freaks me out

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's worth it
Who really has the time at all?
It ain't perfect but I don't mind
'Cause on the surface I look so fine
But really I'm buggin', buggin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, as hard as it gets: cool, calm and collected
Holdin' my breath, this ain't what I expected
Don't argue to death, pull my heart out my chest
The cards is all on the table, I'm callin' it
Don't say it, I swallow it
When livin' off of borrowed time
Often I'm on the fence, on a line
Addin' up what's on my mind
My feet on the clouds, head on the ground
That we goin' down, bet you know me now

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm treadin' water, I swear
That if I drown, I don't care
They callin' for me from the shore, I need more

[Chorus]
Well, it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's worth it
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is It?)
Who really has the time at all?
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is It?)
It ain't perfect but I don't mind
'Cause on the surface I look so fine
But really I'm buggin', buggin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it feel like the weekend on a Tuesday, I can move dates
"I got somethin' else to do" day, always do hate
If I do say, the D'USSÉ with the homies like it's Kool-Aid
Me? I'm just tryna play it cool, J (Anyways)
Yeah, mind over matter, I'm purer than alkaline
Been stuck on album time, I gotta get out to shine
Fly on the wall, shit, I was buggin'
Miss me like you gettin' withdrawal, I keep that comin', yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm treadin' water, I know
If I stop movin', I'll float
They nothin' new, it—
Just play it cool, baby, just play it cool
You know, cool

[Chorus]
Well, it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's worth it
Who really has the time at all?
It ain't perfect but I don't mind
'Cause on the surface I look so fine
But really I'm buggin', buggin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'

[Outro]
Yeah, tell me you love me, spin me around
Pretty please, pick me up in the air and don't put me down
Seen it all unfold, sat back and watched
Knowin' time don't give a fuck about clocks until they stop
Bare feet, runnin' late, her car started
Even though the only thing that she drivin' a hard bargain
More important is I'm kinda sorta out the door but
She put me back together when I'm out of order
Perfect

[Intro]
Yeah, well

[Verse 1]
I got a bone to pick like roses (Roses)
I ain't feelin' broken no more
Balled a fist, they gossipin', I notice
Talkin' shit, I wander through the motives
Wonder who the fuck we're supposed to be
I ain't worried now 'til I leave
I'm just tryna ride and feel the breeze
With somethin' bad beside n' next to me
Wind in my face, don't stop now when it feels so great
You can run 'til you slip on the sidewalk
And the same bone that you picked gon' break, that's a motif
(That's a motif) Yeah
When it's comin' right back, so familiar, never been realer
Never felt so damn good where I'm at
I don't know what it's all about
Runnin' through too many thoughts to count (That's way better)
Still ain't addin' up, I'll let you know when I've had enough, yeah
Yeah, well

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd put some money on forever, but I (Hey)
Don't like to gamble on the weather, so I
Just watch while
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, I know
Hey, well

[Chorus]
These are my wings
These are my wings, yeah
These are my wings

[Verse 2]
Yeah, well
Movin' so fast, the clock look slow (Slow)
Water my seeds 'til the flower just grow, yeah
Love so much that my heart get broke
I don't really know how the normal shit go, so
I guess I just play it by ear, silence is all that I hear
Listenin' close as I can
Growin' up (One, two, three), jump
Nobody holdin' my hand, no
Trust is a problem, never knew how, yeah
That's why I just keep to myself
Get what I need, then I'll be out (Please tell me)
Who can surf the universe with me?
Lucifer is human, so are we
All I ever want is what I need
And that don't include your time and company
Follow me, we on the up and up
Remember when I owed a hundred bucks?
Now, I look around like, "What the fuck?"
If you don't fuck with me, you fuckin' up

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I need to watch my temper, so I
Don't ever gamble on the weather, but I
Just watch while the
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, no, no
Yeah, well

[Chorus]
These are my wings
These are my wings
These are my wings

[Chorus]
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it take
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

[Bridge]
Can't stop, then you won't stop
I know just how that feel
When you're on top, 'til the ball drop
You've never seen it be so real
It feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

[Verse 1]
Feel it a little, feel it a lot
I'm swimmin' a bit, but deeper in thought
Keepin' my head on top of my shoulders
Into some shit, I'm out of the box
This the level I'm on
Needin' it all right now, when forever is gone
Baby, the weather is strong
Whether it's hot or cold
I'm comin', knockin' on yo' door
Well, I'ma, I'ma maintain how I'm stayin' so high
Put the ladder all the way up 'til we touchin' the sky
And you know you're dead wrong, you're in love with a lie
All I, all I, all I wanna do is free yo' mind
We don't see no lines, we don't color inside
It's a very small world, we don't fuck with the size
Yeah, see the bigger picture when it's beneficial
Lovin' how I fit you
Blow the whistle when you run out of time
Yeah, wakin' up, I open up my eyes
Do you mind if I blow yo' mind?
A little closer, baby, don't be shy
Why you worried that it's gon' be fine?
I guess it's that kinda day
It's really all I'm tryna say
We don't have a lot of time to waste
Somehow we gotta find a way

[Chorus]
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

[Post-Chorus]
I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot yo' shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
All the- lights flickerin', hittin' the right switches
I'm livin' this life different and missin' the flight bullshittin'
I had a plan to change, you can't stand the rain
Little delayed, but I came and you cool wit' it
I don't trip, flip or lose my grip
And I don't know it all, but I do know this
Before you know me, better know self
I've been in this shit so long that it don't smell
I turn the hotel to a castle
Livin' like a king for a grand
I don't do nothin', that's a hassle
Besides, even that castle made of sand
Just might slip into the sea
Fuck it all, if it all ain't me
Maybe we inside the maze
Somehow we gotta find a way, okay

[Chorus]
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

[Post-Chorus]
I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot yo' shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got

[Instrumental Outro]

[Chorus]
We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet, we don't speak the same language
This is an occasion, ain't it?
I'm feelin' good and they hate it
Shit, I don't recognize these faces
Yeah, where you from, who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top, now I'm in the spaceship
In a spaceship, shit is spacious

[Verse 1]
Swear your life is basic
All you do is sit around the house, you gettin' faded
That ain't entertainment, yeah
You missin' every single shot that you ain't takin'
Hey kid, you could use a little bit of your imagination
It could do you right, improve a life you busy wastin'
Said it's your money if you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, why you always hatin'?
Lacin' up my sneakers, I be runnin' out of patience
Yeah, it ain't your money 'til you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation

[Chorus]
We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet, we don't speak the same language
This is an occasion, ain't it?
I'm feelin' good and they hate it
Shit, I don't recognize these faces
Yeah, where you from, who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top, now I'm in the spaceship
In the spaceship, shit is spacious

[Verse 2]
Everybody famous, everybody wild, everybody dangerous
Get a couple dollars, now they act the strangest
Now they wanna give a couple statements
When you really 'bout it, you don't say shit
Pocket full of aces
Take over my city, yeah, that's really home invasions
All my homies wit' me, gettin' busy, no vacations
They ain't on my wave but they wavin'
Stop it, boy, you runnin' through your savings

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I just feel amazin'
My head up in the clouds but my feet be on the pavement
Yeah, it ain't your money 'til you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation

[Chorus]
We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet, we don't speak the same language
This is an occasion, ain't it?
I'm feelin' good and they hate it
Shit, I don't recognize these faces
Yeah, where you from, who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top, now I'm in the spaceship
In the spaceship, shit is spacious

Yeah, make people so mad
Yeah, they want her so bad, hmm
Well, we was fuckin', almost missed my flight
I wasn't even trippin', I said, "It's alright," yeah
Goddamn, we was hit last night
Wouldn't you rather get along?
Wouldn't you rather get along?
You was coughin' when you hit my weed
But I've never seen you feel that free
So cute you wanna be like me
Wouldn't you rather get along?
Wouldn't you rather get along?

[Chorus]
Until, until there is no longer
Let's get lost inside the cloud
And you, you don't gotta work harder
I can calm you down

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Well, I was busy when you hit my phone
But you miss me, told me come back home
Yeah, and you don't really like to sleep alone
But I'm takin' too long, I'm always takin' too long, yeah
Baby, we don't need a trip, we could be right here
When the shit get weird, we could switch up gears
I wanna see them lips, kissin' ear to ear
I wanna hear your song
Oh, I wanna feel just how you feel
Touch you one more time so I know you're real
We could spin that wheel, wouldn't you rather get along?

[Chorus]
Until, until there is no longer
Let's get lost inside the cloud
And you, you don't gotta work harder
I can calm you down

[Outro]
I think we just might be alright, thank God
I think we're gonna be alright, alright, okay
Hold me close, don't hold your breath
This feelin' your favorite, I know

[Chorus]
Okay, okay
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel

[Verse 2]
Hundred-twenty on a car that I don't whip (Woo)
I don't even pull it up the driveway
Throwin' up shots like I don't miss (No)
Never put a limit on the high stakes (No)
Try to pull my card, tell them, "Go Fish" (Woo)
You ain't gonna find a lie in my face
I pick it up and let it go quick
They wanna get pussy from my—(Uh-oh)
Yeah, I don't say nuttin' that I don't know
Jumpin' out the womb wearin' Polo
Everybody wanna jump in, but I'm old school
Lone wolf, take 'em on solo, yeah
I don't need nobody (I don't need nobody!)
I don't need to be nobody (I don't need to be nobody!)
I'm just doin' my thing
Kick it at the crib, I don't see nobody, no
So over there with that bullshit
We don't need it on this side
I'm pullin' up in that new shit
You always whippin' that dick ride
I demand your respect
I won't share my connect (No)
Let's get this clear, I am here
I don't care who got next, young vet (Goddamn)
Feelin' like they forget, I let it slide, this time
Like twenty-five years I've been high and no less (Yes)
Shit, I know, I don't guess
Rather glow, I won't stress
Better say that shit with your chest

[Chorus]
Okay, okay
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel (Jet fuel)
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel (Jet fuel)

[Part II: Now Is Only Now]

[Outro]
Fate in your hands
While you're waitin' for me
I'm already there
Fallin' in deep
Now is only now
Head back to the ground, dear

[Intro]
Yeah
Eric
Well

[Chorus]
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

[Verse 1]
Yeah, okay, you gotta jump in to swim
Well, the light was dim in this life of sin
Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's all right with me
Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me
Send you back home with a light that's beamin'
The whole team 'bout to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter about
And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm
Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah
Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
I was yea high and muddy
Lookin' for what was lookin' for me

[Chorus]
But I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for
Well, because I've never been this high before
It's like I never felt alive before
Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war
See, me and you, we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'
Take my time to finish, mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it, I was diggin' me a hole
Big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own
My own, with these arms I can carry you home
I'm right here when you scared and alone, and I ain't never in a hurry
You don't ever gotta worry
Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job
But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard
I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm

[Chorus]
Because I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

[Intro]
*Dog barking*
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, um
(What?) Yeah
('Sup?) Well

[Chorus 1]
You could have the world in the palm of your hands
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
I tell 'em, "Red light, stop it"
Shit, that give me more headaches than alcoholics

[Verse 1]
There was nothin' in my wallet, just a lot of dreamin'
I built a crib on top o' the Promised Land, we'll call it even
Hmm, I bring more flavor than all the seasons
Winter, spring, summer, fall
The grass is always greener 'til I cut it all
Please leave me to my studies, I give you no applause
My hands been countin' money, and it's hard to be the boss
But somebody gotta do it (It gets so exhausting)
Often with the bullshit, and, baby, I been through it
Enough for the both of us
So come over later and we won't let no one close to us
We could be posted up
Yeah

[Chorus 1]
Okay, well, you could have the world in the palm of your hands
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
So it goes
It's like, in every conversation, we the topic
This narcissism, more like narcotics
So it goes

[Chorus 2]
Well, everybody gather round
I'm still standin', sit down
Whoa-oh
And I know I been out (And I know I been out)
But now I'm back in town (But now I'm back in town), so I
Show you the ropes
So it goes, so it goes, so it goes
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
So it goes (Ya! So it goes)
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da, da-da-da
So it goes

[Verse 2]
Well, this is a special delivery, comin' to you live with the
Endless artillery, always down to ride
My eyes on the enterprise
Nine lives, never die, fuck a Heaven, I'm still gettin' high
Never mind, did I mention I'm fine?
'Cause her pussy gettin' wetter when the weather dry
Clementine, peelin' off and everyone get left behind
I'm only 5'7'' 'cept I'm feelin' like I'm 7'5"
Damn it, cross planets, interstellar
Never land, not a Jackson, packed with action
So what's happenin', my man?
No relaxin', kickin' back, this ain't exactly in the plan
I can't get no satisfaction, goddamn
They sayin' I been gone too long
I could just tell 'em, "Fuck you," but that come on too strong
My God, it go on and on
Just like a circle, I go back where I'm from

[Chorus 2]
Well, everybody gather round
I'm still standin', sit down
Whoa-oh
And I know I been out (And I know I been out)
But now I'm back in town (But now I'm back in town), so I
Show you the ropes
So it goes, so it goes, so it goes
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
So it goes (Ya! So it goes)
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da, da-da-da
So it goes

[Verse 1]
I can feel the neon on my skin
Pink and purple colours sinking in
We got electric yellow lightning bolts
They're running through my veins in Tokyo
I think your lips taste just like lemonade
We're spinning through a video arcade
You are the number one, the perfect prize
I see my heartbeat drowning in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So bright, drink sake in Shinjuku
Think I really like you
Now's the time

Let's fall in love in Japan

[Verse 2]
And now the cherry blossom starts to bloom
We lost the keycards to our hotel room
No, I don't need a fancy restaurant
Yeah, I just need your body in my arms
And even though we've got a million lights
You're still the rarest diamond in the sky
You are the fortune, you're a lucky charm
I see our future written in the stars

[Pre-Chorus]
So bright, drink sake in Shinjuku
Think I really like you
Now's the time

Let's fall in love in Japan

[Intro]
Hey

[Verse 1]
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you, baby
Caught my attention

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed, I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it, it, it, oh!

[Verse 2]
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Bridge]
Cause us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
It's innocent, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh yeah
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Outro]
Thank you!

[Verse 1]
I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don’t eat meat
And drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it’s almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

[Chorus]
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys

[Verse 2]
You’re so sad maybe you should buy a happy meal
You’re so skinny you should really Super Size the deal
Secretly you’re so amused
That nobody understands you
I’m so mean 'cause I cannot get you out of your head
I’m so angry 'cause you’d rather MySpace instead
I can’t believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup, and

[Chorus]
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even...

[Breakdown]
Hey, oh yeah
Give it to me
Oh, you're so...

[Bridge]
You walk around like you're oh so debonair
You pull them down and there’s really nothing there
I wish you would just be real with me

[Final Chorus]
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like

No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like...
Penis
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Thank you!

[Verse 1]
Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

[Verse 2]
You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth, oh
He pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your...

[Bridge]
You're the best
And yes I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
And now, now the lesson's learned
I touched it, I was burned
Oh, I...oh you should know, baby

[Final Chorus]
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I, I was looking into your
Your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh, won't you walk through
And bust in the door and take me away
No more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes I'd like to...
Stay, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high, but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends

[Chorus]
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost

[Verse 2]
Caught in the eye of the hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down
My mother said I should come back home, but
Can't find the way, 'cause the way is gone
So if I pray, am I just sending words into outer space?

[Chorus]
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever, have you ever, been, yeah
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
Oh
Is there a light?
Is there a light?
At the end of the road
Cause I'm pushing everyone away, 'cause I can't feel this anymore
I Can't feel

[Chorus]
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so, so lost
So lost, oh yeah
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so...
Have you, Have you ever been, been so lost

[Outro]
Da da da da da dum
Thanks

[Verse 1]
You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi
'Cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake I.D
But you lost the motel key
Spare me your freaking dirty looks now
Don't blame me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You wanna cash out
And get the hell outta town
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me

[Chorus]
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

[Verse 2]
Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don’t call your mother
'Cause now we’re partners in crime
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me

[Chorus]
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

[Bridge]
You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S
And get some cash out
We’re gonna tear up the town
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
You told me
You told me, yeah

[Chorus]
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

[Outro]
Oh yeah
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter, yeah
Gimme some cash out, baby
Gimme some cash out, baby
Woah, oh, yeah

[Outro]
Thank you!

[Verse 1]
Many long years amongst the trees
Many long years in the ground
To be with one that's never seen
The one that stands and watches over

[Chorus]
I wonder when we'll realize
This is what we got left
And it's our demise
With the water rising
And the air so thin
Still the children smiling
Can we see no sin?

[Verse 2]
This is what we all have seen
Too many years tearing down
Even though we couldn't believe
It's only clearer in a mirror now

[Chorus]
I wonder when we'll realize
This is what we got left
And it's our demise
With the water rising
And the air so thin
Still the children smiling
Can we see no sin?

See no sin
Say no sin
Oh woah woah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah, no!

[Verse 1]
Oh, my holy Lord
Sets my soul on fire
Flames of love and sweet perfume
She's my heart's desire
She's an angel straight from Hell
Draws me to the deep
In the darkness way below
It's my heart she'll keep
Yeah

Thunder underground
Watch the castle fall
Sound of wind it takes the sky
And winter takes us all
Mountain high against the sky
Watches as we pray
Laughing loud and smiling proud
This is where we lay

[Chorus]
Lover
Leaver
Taker
Believer

[Verse 2]
Oh God hellfire
Witch of Endor raised
Saul would fall to his knees, watch the fire blaze
Satan plays his flute for him
The sound it burns his ears
Watches as the peace of man slips and disappears

Lover
Leaver
Taker
Believer

[Intro]
(One, two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
Well, you're so pretty and I love you so
You know I'm your biggest fan
I saw your picture and it's the best
The finest in the land

[Pre-Chorus]
Camera, lights, and action
Yeah, the words you know so well
You're in and out of fashion
In Hollywood of Hell

[Chorus]
When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all, no

[Verse 2]
Well, I love you in that movie show
Can I have your autograph?
It's so funny you have such charm
The whole thing made me laugh

[Pre-Chorus]
Obetrol and cocktails
You're counting all your rings
They all said they loved you
Didn't they, darling?
Well, they've taken all your things

[Chorus]
When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all, no

[Bridge]
Well, listen, darling
It's been real swell
What can I say?
You've got it all
You're a one woman show
But I'm not gonna lie to you
You could use a little work
Well, at your age
Well

[Guitar Solo]
What you got, baby?

[Chorus]
When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all

[Outro]
Goodbye, baby
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
The sun shines brighter from above
And you're the woman that I love
Climb the mountain even higher
To kiss the sun and fight the fire
Oh well

[Chorus]
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine

[Verse 2]
Take me with you when you go
To be with you is all I know
As we ride, we light the fire
The second sun's our love's desire
Oh well

[Chorus]
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine
Oh well

[Bridge]
The sun shines brighter from above

Kiss the sun, fight the fire

Stop! I ain’t ready yet
Wait! Let me fix my hair, yes, yes
Yes ma'am, yes ma'am
Now pass me my dress, yes

I think I’m ready
Been locked up in the house way too long
It’s time to get it

And my girls are so real
Said it’s been a minute since I had some
He’s been acting up
But he won’t be the only one

Keep tellin' me how my outfit’s so nice
Little did he know
Ha, my man gon' take it off tonight

In your dresses and your best digs with no reason
Get ready to freakum, freakum

When you put it on, it’s an invitation
When they play your song, get on up and shake it
Work it out your back, you don’t have to waste it
Spin it all around then take it to the ground and
When you put it on, it’s an invitation
When they play your song, get on up and shake it
Work it out your back, you don’t have to waste it

Hey!

[Verse 1]
I got the ice
You got the fire
I've got the stuff
To take you higher
Ahhh, that's how you played it
I got the brains
You got the money
This is a race
Let's go fast, honey
Ahhh, that's how you played it

[Verse 2]
Come on pretty baby
I'll be takin' you down
They say you got crazy
Like, all over town

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight

[Verse 3]
I got the brains
You got the money
This is a race
Let's go fast honey
Ahhh, that's how you played it
Come on pretty baby
I'll be takin' you down
They say you got crazy
Like, all over town

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

[Verse 1]
Oh, sweet mama, lay me down in my grave
Leave me, baby, I'm too far gone to save
The snow is comin', all the village folk know
This wicked shiver chills me down to my soul

[Chorus]
Only time will tell
Take the ox to town and you can sell
Leave me in my bed today

[Verse 2]
The Yankee peddler bargains with you on his way
Woe sweet mama's gotten herself a new dray
Keep the children snug as the wagon rolls on
When the cold wind blows most of them will be gone

[Chorus]
Only time can tell
Take the ox to town and I'll get well
Leave me in my bed today
Only time will tell
You take the ox to town and you can sell
Leave me in my bed today

[Verse 1]
Let the new day shine its light on me
Shake the old way, nights too dark to see
Free tomorrow, it's bright with something new
Believe the righteous, and it will come true

[Chorus]
You're a child in the garden
You're growing up, I'll watch you bloom
And your dreams are not forgotten
You'll be a woman soon

[Post-Chorus]
Love isn't greed, it's a need that goes unspoken
Love doesn't leave when you fade away
Pain isn't vain if it means your heart's been broken
Pain is the same as a means to heal

[Verse 2]
Let me try love, you know I'm only one
Live or die love, I tried and to me won
We're the future, it's hard to say we know
And the suture is what we have to sew

[Chorus]
You are a child in the garden
You're growing up, I'll watch you bloom
And your dreams are not forgotten
You'll be a woman soon

[Post-Chorus]
Love isn't greed, it's a need that goes unspoken
Love doesn't leave when you fade away
Pain isn't vain if it means your heart's been broken
Pain is the same as a means to heal

[Outro]
Love doesn't fade away
Love doesn't fade away

[Verse 1]
Long day
Heat wave
Out of trouble in the making
I'm let on the loose

[Verse 2]
Madre
Don't worry
It's time I rock it
Love every minute
And make my move

[Chorus]
What if I can't get back
What if my heart leaps too high off the track
I've been gone as the thunder moon
Takes rise from my wasted youth
Summer nights fade a wild sunburn
Staying alive as the old wheels turn
Fast furious and wonderful
I tip my cap and watch the rip tide roll
Away I sing another tune
With no other place in time to lose

[Verse 3]
Heartache
Field day
Catching follies
Off the horizon
I wreck my ruin

[Verse 4]
Old bear
My hearts here
Struck by lightning
My days arriving
To make my move

[Chorus]
What if I can't get back
What if my heart leaps too high off the track
I've been gone as the thunder moon
Takes rise from my wasted youth
Summer nights fade a wild sunburn
Staying alive as the old wheels turn
Fast furious and wonderful
I tip my cap and watch the rip tide roll
Away I sing another tune
With no other place in time to lose

[Intro]
In an age of darkness light appears
And it wards away the ancient fears
March to the anthem of the heart
To a brand new day, a brand new start

[Verse 1]
To wonderlands of ice and snow
In the desert heat where nothing grows
A tree of life in rain and sun
To reach the sky it's just begun

[Chorus]
And as we came into the clear
To find ourselves where we are here
Who is the wiser to help us steer?
And will we know when the end is near?

[Verse 2]
A beauty lives in every soul
The more you love the more you know
They pass the torch and it still burns
Once children then it's now our turn

[Chorus]
And as we came into the clear
To find ourselves where we are here
Who is the wiser to help us steer?
And will we know when the end is near?

And as we came into the clear
To find ourselves where we are here
Who is the wiser to help us steer?
And will we know when the end is near?

[Verse 1]
I can't help remembering the day when you came
Home to stay, summer vacation
My Malibu always cruising right beside you
Radio on you fell asleep in my arms
I made one too many mistakes
Always pretending that everything was okay
My car had an overheated engine
I wouldn't drive so you found someone else to take you driving

[Chorus]
I lost my heart and my car
And on my lonely days have nothing left to lose
Goodbye baby, you're driving me crazy
With the thought of someone else driving with you

[Verse 2]
She was out of my little league
Catching the wind out the window in my passenger seat
I held her close as my words would mellow yellow
A couple years and we'd be happily together
But I made one too many mistakes
Always lazy waiting, another excuse
My car, it was one year past inspection
I wouldn't drive so she found someone else to take her driving

[Chorus]
I lost my heart and my car
And on my lonely days have nothing left to lose
Goodbye baby, you're driving me crazy
With the thought of someone else driving with you

[Bridge]
Let's grab a beer when we get older and
Laugh about all those days when we were younger
When the world would spin us in any direction
You were holding my hand in my little silver Chevy of love
My little silver Chevy of love
My little silver Chevy of love

[Verse 1]
A swing for the fences
Carving out my name
Hang a ten on the breezes
A little too deep to change
Well I will be here
I will be there
Stealing bases
Long before I realize I'm gone

[Chorus]
Although I haven't left home plate
In so long
That I begin to see
Days when all that I'd need's
Still right here next to me
Loan wing lost in the garden
Red seams and sun on the dawn

[Verse 2]
The grass is looking greener
Growing wild without a care
What kind of jig bone dreamer's
Never been one to take a dare
I will be here
And I will be there
Taking a lead off
To run from every chance I could wrong

[Chorus]
And still I haven't left home plate
In so long
That I begin to see
Days when all that I'd need's
Still right here next to me
Loan wing lost in the garden
Moon rings, sand in my shoes
Songs I keep running back home to play

[Verse 1]
I've got to swim through
Give this a try
Dive off a free fall
Into the sky
My brain's an urchin
My heart, a stingray

I'll sink beside you
Billow up off our feet
Arms 'round my shoulder
Brittle star weave
Out to the ocean
Life aboard a submarine

[Chorus]
Well, I'd really like to know you
But I find it hard
To go where you are when you speak in sonar
Days from the deep end
An echo off the ocean floor

[Verse 2]
I never thought that
We'd ever come this far
Chasing a jet stream
By the fin of a shark
Gone for the weekend
Batten down the hatches for a storm

Well, I'll dance beside you
Stick to the beat
Fossils in the city park
Got dolphins in my dreams
Bottom of the ocean
Samba sun on the ceiling

[Chorus]
Well, I'd really like to know you
But I find it hard
To go where you are when you speak in sonar
Days from the deep end
An echo off the ocean floor

Well, I'd really like to know you
But I find it hard
To go where you are when you speak in sonar
Days from the deep end
An echo off the ocean floor

[Verse 1]
Wake up
Jump outta bed
And I'm sneaking in
Always late for class
And now the bell rings
Dancing down the halls
And I'm feeling so fine

[Verse 2]
Weekend
Hitch up the road
By my best friend's side
Licking sugar cubes and smiling
Real love dropped in like a car crash
How it hit me so hard

[Chorus]
Things have changed
And I ain't never felt like this
In my life before
Things have changed
Life ain't the same as it used to be

[Verse 4]
Michael
Hang up the phone
You know the cops are out there
Tappin' to our zone and now
What've I gotten myself into
I'm feeling so high

[Verse 5]
Well too late
I started to smile
You know I'm feeling out there
Hanging on a tropical isle
With a pillow
Passed out on the front yard
How it hit me so hard

[Chorus]
Things have changed
And I ain't never felt like this
In my life before
Things have changed
Life ain't the same as it used to be

[Chorus]
Things have changed
And I ain't never felt like this
In my life before
Things have changed
Life ain't the same as it used to be
Things have changed
Life ain't the same as it used to be

[Verse 1]
I just can't fake it no more
She sees right through me
Ain't no star in a movie
A life caught in a mystery
And she'll help me figure it out

[Chorus]
Oh dear if there's one thing
I happen to wreck
It's the one thing that I'll forget
And just can't get to at all
Oh dear if there's one thing
That I could pretend
It's the light in the right time of day
Making me shine again

[Verse 2]
I've been waking early
To see her on her lunch break
But I'm never on time
And I ain't got much money
But I've got plenty of sunshine
Spinning my dimes

[Verse 3]
Well spin it away with me one more day
Save my world with your super powers
Run your telekinetic waves on me
Spin it away, spin it away, spinning

[Chorus]
Oh dear if there's one thing
I can't seem to erase
It's the smile left upon your face
As I say I'll catch you tomorrow
Oh dear if there's one thing
That I could pretend
It's the light in the right time of day
Making me shine again

[Chorus]
Oh dear if there's one thing
I happen to wreck
It's the one thing that I'll forget
And just can't get to at all
Oh dear if there's one thing
That I could pretend
It's the light in the right time of day
Making me shine again

[Verse 1]
Since you've been around
We've been living out the backseat of your car
Melted chocolate bars
A voodoo doll
And lost credit cards
Taking me out dancing
In a rocksteady dive
Twisting cross the floor
On view master slides

[Chorus]
I have been such a happy camper
Forgot about my lonely home
I have been such a happy camper
Forgot about my lonely home

[Verse 2]
Since you've been around
We've been stealing our own tickets to see the stars
In the baseball park
Swimming after dark
In our neighbors yard
Sleeping in all day long
Headed for a Rocky Mountain home
See you in dreams tonight
Of Honda bikes cross supernovas

[Chorus]
I have been such a happy camper
Forgot about my lonely home
I have been such a happy camper
Forgot about my lonely home

[Outro]
Happy campers
When we're together
Like coins in a hamper
Life's merry’ander

Happy campers
When we're together
Lost in the banter
Life's merry’ander

[Verse 1]
Gone away as a wild wave
Ride high on the day
I've been away so long
It's been nice getting to know you

[Chorus]
Well, as it seems, I was seventeen
When I first let out on a bike ride
Hit the brakes, now I'm wide awake
Was it just a matter of time
A year ago
Can't believe that I was spinning out of control

[Verse 2]
Gone away as a wild wave
Ride high on the day
Out on an ocean liner
It's been hard seeing you go

[Chorus]
Well, as for me, I was seventeen
When my first true love broke into my heart
Castaway, where I've lived for days
On an island now drifting us apart
Still, here I go
Best believe there's not a day I don't look back on

[Verse 1]
It's my day
No ones gonna be bringing me down
Shovel me like a root to the ground
'Cause I'm up in the clouds of my neighborhood

[Verse 2]
And my baby
Ya I've been treating her kind
Ya she gives me chills to the spine
As I climb up the vine
To kiss her goodnight

[Chorus]
When everything has gone wrong
I lay around with my puppy dog
When everyone's got me crying
He runs away and I join him for the ride

[Verse 3]
You know it's my day
Ya I think that love conquers all
Ya I bet you think that I'm small
But I'll be rockin' my paw
On this electric guitar

[Verse 4]
How lovely
Works all done and I'm homeward bound
Dancing as the records spin round
And the suns slipping down
Cross my living room

[Chorus]
When everything has gone wrong
I lay around with my puppy dog
When everyone's got me crying
He runs away and I join him for the ride

[Verse]
My sister says
I'm going out of my head
Jade, she tells me
She's playing games with ya, kid
My best friends tell me
I'm gonna wind up dead
But I'm the only one
Who really understands

[Chorus]
That I'm lovesick for you
And there's nothing anybody can do
Ya I'm lovesick for you
It's like an old crush we used to have in school
When the teacher'd call the nurse on the intercom
We've gotta dizzy boy here with love goggles on
And now I can only see straight when I'm with you
I'm with you

[Verse 2]
My momma says
I gotta hold up my chin
My puppy tells me
I could use a friend
My uncle tells me
To join a rock-n-roll band
And write a little song
Break some hearts
And learn to be a man

[Chorus]
But I'm lovesick for you
And there's nothing anybody can do
Ya I'm lovesick for you
And I'm running down a fever of a hundred and two
Well I will be here waiting
Calling everyone even the operator
I ain't got the flu
I'm just lovesick for you

[Verse 1]
All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean singing your song
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
That's how you sang it
Loving you forever can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
That's how we played it

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no remedy for memory, your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
(Dead, like you)

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

[Verse 2]
All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em when you find true love, it lives on
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
That's why I stay here

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no remedy for memory, your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
(Dead, like you)

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight

[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

[Bridge]
There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
(So tell me)
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

[Verse 1]
Suspended in nostalgia
I find your name hanging in my memories
I fill myself up with your gaze
Oh, what a maze you've put me in

[Verse 2]
I spy with my little eye
Your wide eyes that take me time traveling
It feels like, swimming, swimming with my eyes closed
Nose to nose, you just, you just fucking know

[Verse 3]
Oh, remind me of your name again
As you take me on that train again
Back to the pavements that we walked, and walked
Oh, the drugs that made us talk and talk

[Verse 4]
And I'll take you dancing, I'll take you round and round
I'll lead you to the hilltops, and I'll take you on the ground
I may be daydreaming, but I'll be wondering what it's like
To be under your skin
'Til I get in
Until you let me out
Until you see my insides
Until you're inside out, I'll
Lick my wounds, feels like I've had them since the womb
Sing myself a tune, fall back and swoon

[Outro]
And I'll take you dancing, I'll take you round and round
I'll lead you to the hilltops, and I'll take you on the ground
I may be daydreaming
Oh what a feeling
Daydreaming about you
I never knew a lot about her
Her friends never let me know
We sat in circles wasting the summer
She didn’t mind
She was waiting for snow

Its been a long day
Now I’m working on it
Why let this go to waste
It’s something that I’ve wanted

Why let this go to waste
It’s something that I’ve wanted

She sat there crying in her mom’s car
Her friends never let her know
We sat in circles talking about her
It didn’t mind
It was only for a show

It’s been a long day
Now im working on it
Why let this go to waste
It’s something that I’ve wanted
Why let this go to waste
It’s something that I’ve wanted

[Intro: Chris Brown]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
No, no, no, no, no, I just wanna get
Oh, oh
Let me talk to you for a minute

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Go to the kitchen, let's do it now
You got it coming, uh, I'ma lay you down
Give it to me, girl, uh, I wanna feel
Baby, I'm about to seal the deal
Now I wanna touch, let's warm it up
And you got what I need, make me bust
Oh, I want your body, let me get it from the back
Girl I'm about to attack

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, and knock you up
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, and knock you up

[Interlude: Tyrese]
Do you mind if I talk to you sexy ladies for a minute?
Ooh
Do you mind if I talk to y'all for a minute?
Listen

[Verse 2: Tyrese]
Jump in the shower, it's soaking wet
I'ma give you something I know you won't forget
Just let me come in, open your door
I'ma put it all in, and girl, you gon be sore
I'ma do you on the bar
Wanna play me turn the lights down, down
Lick your ice cream, you can have this chocolate bar
Tonight I'm a take this way too far

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, and knock you up
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, and knock you up

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Now usually I'll leave the club with a girl who has a man
And take her to the hotel for just a one night stand
See I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates
But much like my Patron, man, I'm just tryna take it straight
Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty
The sweetest girl in the world and I mean it and on top of that she's a cutie
I ain't seen nothing like her around here in a while
And if I had a girl, she'd be the one to bear my child
Telling myself I'm a playa so I keep tryna shake it off
But I keep on seeing this big old house with a picket fence and a dog
Never felt nothing like this, she's more than a mistress
I'm about to handle my business, now put that girl in my kitchen

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (that's what I told her)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (ooh)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, and knock you up
Chevy chevy ridin' high
Dawn and day 305
If them boys wanna chase
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
I say

Gimme a bottle in the m-therf-cking car
So million my dollars can keep a f-cker
I said
Gimme a bottle in the m-therf-cking car
So million my dollars can keep a f-cker

Break down
Pasamela woteya (Pasamela woteya)
You're flying high
But I'm falling to pieces
Trapped under your spell
Until it releases

I'm drowning without your love
Oh, sweet suffocation
Are you real?
Are you real?
Are you real?
Are you real?
Are you really my creation?

Well there I go
Dreaming that dream again
But it seems so real, to taste, to feel this love I'm in

I know you're out there somewhere dreaming of me
I know you're out there dreaming of me
I know you're out there somewhere dreaming of me
I know you're out there dreaming of me
Here I go

[Verse 1: Tom Odell]
Remember all those nights
When all our neighbors could hear us sing
Remember all the fights
And all the makeups that they would bring

[Pre-Chorus: Tom Odell]
But now those days are gone
And summer's turned to fall
You know how much I know
But please I beg don't call

[Chorus: Tom Odell]
I'm trying to leave you alone
I've been dying to pick up the phone
Yeah, and around and around and they always go
And I can't love you again
I can't love you again

[Drop]

[Verse 2: Tom Odell]
Remember all those days
All those days we were drunk in love
Remember all those waves
All those waves we would sober up

[Pre-Chorus: Tom Odell]
But now those days are gone
And summer's turned to fall
Let's leave it in this song
So baby please I beg don't call

[Chorus: Tom Odell]
I'm trying to leave you alone
I've been dying to pick up the phone
Yeah, and around and around and they always go, yeah
I can't love you again

I'm trying to leave you alone
I've been dying, I know that you know
And around and around and they always go
And I can't love you again
I can't love you again
I can't love you again
I can't love you again

[Verse 1]
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Verse 2]
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)

[Bridge]
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown (You should see me, see me)
Your silence is my favorite sound (You should see me, see me)
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

You stick out of the crowd, baby, it's a no-brainer

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Don't look rich, I ain't got no chain (Huh)
Not on the list, I ain't got no name
But we in this bitch, bitch, I'm not no lame
And I keep it Ben Franklin, I'm not gon' change
Lot of these hoes is messy (Messy)
I just want you and your bestie
Y'all don't gotta answer for whenever you text me
It's multiple choice and they all wanna test me
She ch-ch-ch-ch-choosin' the squad
She tryna choose between me, Justin, Qua' and Asahd
She told me that she love that I make music for God
I told her I would love to see that **** applaud

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]
You stick out of the crowd, baby, it's a no-brainer
It ain't that hard to choose

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
Walked down, had me sittin' up
Demanded my attention, had to give it up
Look like somebody designed you
Drop-dead gorgeous, you make me wanna live it up
Your presence is critical
Movin' my soul, yeah, you're spiritual
They hate it when you notice me
Like everybody else invisible (Ooh)
Breakin' all the rules (Oh-oh)
So above the law (So above the law)
I'll be your excuse (Damn right)
Uh, and you won’t go wrong, no

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]
You stick out of the crowd, baby, it's a no-brainer (No-brainer)
It ain't that hard to choose
Him or me, be for real, baby, it's a no-brainer

[Outro: DJ Khaled & Justin Bieber]
It's We The Best Music
Way high
It's Father of Asahd
Another one

[Verse 1]
Yesterday I learned to fly
Show my moves at everyone
I got careless in the sky
Flying too close to the sun

[Hook]
Oh oh-oh, I just don't wanna lose you
Oh oh-oh, I just don't wanna lose you
Oh oh-oh, I just want us all to have a good time

[Verse 1]
Words slip off my tongue, I don't
Need no one to speak for me
With you, I know all the things to say
Soft the touch to the lips, I kiss you
Blue-eyed beauty, I miss you
I shed a tear every time you are away

[Pre-Chorus]
Could you stay? Ah-ha
Could you stay? Ah-ha

[Chorus]
Love on me, give me your time
Love on me, I'll make you mine

[Verse 2]
I used to run away whenever I fell
In love with somebody but now I am
Ready to let go of all of my fears
I like it when you fall into a daydream
So comfortable when you lay here with me
You are my favorite fantasy

[Chorus]
Love on me, give me your time
Love on me, I'll make you mine

[Bridge]
You got me feeling some kind of way
And I really like it
But I'm kinda confused
But I know I like you

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
I might just add a verse for no reason, fuck it
Ayo

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
I sit in my garden and play Stevie Wonder
And get foot massages while Clancy talk numbers
He threw me some game and I swear I won't fumble
Might cop me a Bronco to ride for the summer
Marni the trousers, tell Risso to holla
The carnival sell out, the stadium Dodger
Cut off some homies, but Taco my brodie
Until he score millions, I won't leave the goalie
Pass 'em the mittens, he never betrayed me
The E30 sitting, the LT my daily
The engine is stupid, I drive like a tutor
When I move, it moves, the transmission like Luda
Ketchup like packets, my new nigga pretty
Your new bitch is tacky like Busta Rhymes jackets
Want smoke? I can match it, that second-hand action
We exhale you inhale and asthma attack
Teeing off, niggas nauseous as fuck
Fuck you thought? Bitch, it's GOLF

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
This shit going crazy, I swear I go crazy
I never met him but man shout out Lil Baby
We running the thing *gibberish* I just ran out of words

[Lyrics from Snippet]
Use me, 'cause everyone else is
What's the difference?

When you're lookin' at my lips
And not being legally allowed to kiss them

[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Billie Eilish]
You make me sad, boy
Well look who’s sad, daddy

[MadeinTYO]
Givenchy on your kisses (I would)
Wanna lay down with your misses
(Oh yeah)
Wanna hear your heartbeat (listen up)
When we're apart we

[Intro]
Three, two, one!

[Verse 1]
I've got a man that doesn't love me
He's got a girl that doesn't love him
She's got a brother down in Cali
He's got a tattoo for his cousin

[Pre-Chorus]
Another picture perfect family
Should've known they'd keep bad company
Another house on fire by Venice beach
She's got a man she doesn't love who doesn't  love me

[Chorus]
I don't need to know
Who you can't let go
Cry 'bout so and so
(She's got a man, got a man, got a, got a man)
I don't need to know
Who you can't let go
Cry 'bout so and so
(She's got a man, got a man, got a, got a man)

[Verse 2]
Mom and dad are getting worried
They've got a man outside the building
He's got a Jag' with tinted windows
He makes a killing for a living

[Pre-Chorus]
Another picture perfect family
Should've known they'd keep bad company
Another house on fire by Venice beach
She's got a man she doesn't love who doesn't  love me

[Chorus]
I don't need to know
Who you can't let go
Cry 'bout so and so
(She's got a man, got a man, got a, got a man)
I don't need to know
Who you can't let go
Cry 'bout so and so
(She's got a man, got a man, got a, got a man)

[Outro]
Three, two, one!
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
I don't know
I just wish I wasn't breathing
If I wasn't breathing
Would that change your mind?

[Verse 1]
Tough tension, I'm reckless
Harmony Korine
They hate me, they love me
I'm indifferent, I'm indifferent
There's ivory on the handle
Jesus on my dash
Neutral colors on the centerfold
Fuck it, let's go fast

[Chorus]
I'm gonna crash the car
I'm gonna crash the car

[Verse 2]
Two tone on the visual
Mixing colours with the grey
Bloody nose like in cinema
I don't got time for this today
I gotta pick me up a check
Get myself a gig
Look at that sunset
One sec, lemme take this pic
It's pretty

[Chorus]
I'm gonna crash the car
I'm gonna crash the car
I'm gonna crash the car
I'm gonna crash the car

[Verse 3]
Work is at seven
That's two hours from now
You got time for me, I know you do
Staying up late
My insomnia's acting up
Or I am in love with ya? I don't know
Tracing the V on your abdomen
Like Siamese twins
You're making me feel precious
Your little treasure
I could never let go of you
Even if I tried, even if you let me
I could never survive without you, without you, without you, without you

[Verse 1]
Wake me up when the days are over
Reminiscent of a life I had
I smile on and feel the closure
I finally feel like me again
Sacrifice the sweet attention
You have to give before you get
Another lie, another lie
I'll get it right

[Chorus]
It starts right now
Now
It starts right now
Right now
Oh I could never ever, ever, ever lose it, no
It's all I ever, ever, ever, ever wanted, oh woah

[Verse 2]
Controlled myself, realized I couldn't
Too special to stay on the track
They look the same
I tried to fake it
But it left a bad taste in my mouth
I know I sound better when I'm nervous (yup)
Well, honestly I can't complain (no)
I'm feeling like, I really can, oh yes I can

[Chorus]
It starts right now
Now
It starts right now
Right now
Oh I could never ever, ever, ever lose it, no
It's all I ever, ever, ever, ever wanted, oh woah

[Outro]
Run home
Get back to where you came from
Don't be so afraid, no
This is what you're made for (run home, run home)
Run home (run)
Get back to where you came from (with your friends)
Don't be so afraid, no  (get your life, get it right)
This is what you're made for (yeah)

[Verse 1]
You know, it's a free world
You can leave when you want
Take the money and run, run, run to me

[Verse 2]
Freeway, it's a free world
You can leave when you want
Take the money and run, run, run to me

[Refrain]
Who are you when I'm not around?
Who are you when I'm not around?
White lines, you've been working all the time
Need to cool you down
I've been on the sidelines and I watch it fall apart

[Chorus]
All my cash is in Euros
All my coins are in Yen
All my boys European
All my money is gone

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna rent cars, I wanna crash cars
I'm feeling NASCAR in mom and dad's car
I'm not suicidal, I'm too afraid to die
Wanna feel something other than sadness sometimes
Damn
I can't relate to the people who relate to me
Always late to the party that I don't wanna be
Can't trust them anyway, can't trust them anyway
They don't see me for me

[Bridge]
You are special to me
You are special to me
You are special to me
You are special to me
You are special to me
You are special to me

[Outro]
I'll subtract all the gold
Reach a couple of goals
Take a trip to the bridge
See what it's really worth
All my cash is in Euros
All my coins are in Yen
All my boys European
All my money is gone

[Intro]
You've been on my mind
And I wonder if you will ever be mine
I'd like that
You've been on my mind
And I wonder if you will ever be mine
I like that

[Verse 1]
When you walk in the room stops talking
The boys all flock in
They want you
Keep my distance
'Cause you're with him
Make a decision
Is he your lover or boyfriend?

[Chorus]
Party's over
Wishing on a four-leaf clover you'll come over
When we're over this
Party's over
Wishing on a four-leaf clover you'll come over
When we're over this

[Refrain]
We could be friends
We could be more than friends if you want to

[Verse 2]
I don't know them
They're not my friends
I just have them come over so I have a reason, to see you
You are a superstar
Seen every movie that you've been in
Let's make a movie tonight

[Chorus]
Party's over
Wishing on a four-leaf clover you'll come over
When we're over this
Party's over
Wishing on a four-leaf clover you'll come over
When we're over this

[Outro]
I don't wanna leave without you
Couldn't see my life without you in it
I'd probably lose my fucking mind
I don't wanna leave without you
Couldn't see my life without you in it
I'd probably lose my fucking mind

[Intro]
In one-thousand feet, turn left on South Figueroa street
After this I might call you an Uber back to yours, so I don't have to drive there and then back to mine
"You're going to buy me an Uber?"
Yeah
"Your money"
Hmm?
"I said 'your money'"

[Refrain]
When you've got friends
And you got that money
Honey, they're your friends until the money's spent
Pay that bill
Trigger pulled too fast
Now you're driving home and you are all alone

[Chorus]
Call me good, call me bad
Don't care what you say just call me back
Money comes and people go
But I won't live forever (that's the way it goes)
Call me good, call me bad
Don't care what you say just call me back
People talk and walk away
But I won't live forever

[Verse]
I can't pay your rent today
I can't even pay attention
Been living at home for way too long
My job is robbing me
I called my friends today (Hi)
I'll call my friends tomorrow (Bye)
I call but they're not picking up
What the fuck?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What did I do wrong?
Someone else to fill my shoes
Who else are they counting on?
Did they find a place without me?
It can't be the same without me, without me
Without my money, money, money, money, money!

[Refrain]
When you've got friends
And you got that money (and you got that money)
Honey, they're your friends until the money's spent
(farewell my love)
Pay that bill (pay that bill)
Trigger pulled too fast
Now you're driving home and you are all alone

[Chorus]
Call me good, call me bad
Don't care what you say just call me back
Money comes and people go
But I won't live forever that's just the way it goes
Call me good, call me bad
Don't care what you say just call me back
People talk and walk away
But I won't live forever

[Bridge]
Money, money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money, money!

[Outro]
Mmm, what's it to ya?
I can see through ya
When it comes down to it
Tell me what really makes you happy?
Do I make you happy?
What's it to ya?
I can see through ya
When it comes down to it
Tell me what really makes you happy?
Do I make you happy?
Do I make you happy?
Ooh, do I make you happy?
Money, money, money, money, money!
Does my money make you happy?
Do I? Do I make you feel all those things?
Money, money, money, money, money!

[Chorus]
God is real
He was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him my favorite song

[Verse 1]
My love, he caught me crying
Freedom can die so hard
When you have a broken heart
Tears of joy
I pray to the open sky
This is the one I wanted
This is everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me more of your love
I believe in Heaven above
Come and give me life
Show me what it's like to fall into your arms

[Chorus]
God is real
He was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him my favorite song

[Verse 2]
My love is my religion
Preaching to choir, fueling the fire
Oh my God, you know I need ya
If I'm going to hell, I'm taking you with me
I'm taking you with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me more of your love
I believe in Heaven above
Come and give me life
Show me what it's like to fall into your arms

[Chorus]
God is real
He was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him my favorite song
God is real
He was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him my favorite song

[Outro]
So what do you think it is?
I don't know, I'm totally freaked out
It's probably aliens
No it's probably the government
Totally aliens, completely coming in to invade the, the you know the world right now with everything that's going on
I would be okay with that

[Verse 1]
Suburbian royalty
'Cause his neighbors let us use the pool
He gave me pleasure underneath the water
And it felt so good
Now we're power sliding 'til the flat spots stop us
They call the cops on us
The time tick tocks, you drop me off

[Chorus]
Summer's over when I die
Can't let go of the heat, can't let go of your hand
I roll into the deep end
'Cause I wanna feel the wind blow while I ride
Sun's up, I glisten
You're good at transition

[Verse 2]
You could pass for masculine
But that's not why I like it (no, no, no, no)
And we share a couple cigarettes before we go to bed
And you got the plastic
That's fucking fantastic
Now were powersliding 'til we can both pass out
You got the TV on with the volume down
For colors in the background

[Chorus]
Summer's over when I die
Can't let go of the heat, can't let go of your hand
I roll into the deep end
'Cause I wanna feel the wind blow while I ride
Sun's up, I glisten
You're good at transition
Summer's over when I die
Can't let go of the heat, can't let go of your hand
I roll into the deep end
'Cause I wanna feel the wind blow while I ride
Sun's up, I glisten
You're good at transition

[Bridge]
Get lost!
His muscles flex when he takes a puff from his cigarette
He's looking tough and so friendly
I'm impressed
Get lost!
You stop, I'm taking your picture
Crack a smile through the lens
My god, I swear this is perfect
Let the sunset take us down
Get lost!
Ahh, ahh
Get lost!
Ahh, ahh

[Outro]
It's cold!
Ryan could you skateboard for us?

[Verse 1]
You got that tattoo from your best friend in your bedroom
You let him stick and poke you
You like French rap and the Fuji cam flash and Goku
It's good to get to know you

[Chorus]
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you do speed?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you do speed?

[Verse 2]
I got my bleach hair and my hand-me-downs
And my Kafka tee (Czech!)
I saw it on the TV
Feel my pulse pump from the 808 drum like amphetamine
If you know what I mean

[Chorus]
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you do speed?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you do speed?

[Verse 3]
Baby girl is on the run (two sugar, no cream)
Pocket full of coins and gum (vanilla donut and a magazine)
Watch her flash her *beep* for cash (Take the white man's money)
Slushee lips and cherry wishes
Blow the candles out (Happy birthday)
God bless America
(She can use her body for whatever)
Do what you want America
(He can use his money on whoever)
God bless America
(She can use her body for whatever)
Do what you want America
(He can use his money on whoever)

[Verse 1]
Making the money to get by
Smoking the Pink Floyd every night
And I'm feeling sad 'cause everyday I pay the price
Taking a walk to shake it off
I'm trying to believe in what I want
I don't what else I can say
I'm made this way

[Chorus]
They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday
They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday

[Post-Chorus]
I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special
I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special

[Verse 2]
Mom and dad moved away from home
To Santa Clarita years ago
Just so that I could catch my dream (I owe them everything)
Honestly I could really cry
I hope that they look back on their life
And see that I tried, I tried, I tried

[Chorus]
They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday
They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday

[Post-Chorus]
I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special
I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special, special
I'll find a place somewhere special
I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special

[Verse 1]
Hand to my chest
I promise I won't cry
Try to impress
Fall into the sky

[Chorus 1]
Life flashes before my eyes
I'm not ready to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
I'm so afraid
I see you in the dark
Don't say my name
I'd probably fall apart

[Chorus 2]
Days like this are the reason why
I'm not ready to say goodbye
I, I

[Bridge]
And before you realize it I'll be gone
And before you realize it I'll be gone

[Chorus 1]
Life flashes before my eyes
I'm not ready to say goodbye
I, I

[Outro]
I don't like it when you don't like me
Well I don't like it when you don't like me
I'm glad we're agreed
Huh?
I said I'm glad we're agreed
Yeah, me too

[Verse 1]
Big boy, new life, jean jacket with the rhinestone
Cool kid said I'd never fall in love but I might though (I might though)
Got me feeling ways that I never feel, but I like the feel
First time so fast, it was tight though

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That's a body modification!
'Cause you pierced my soul
Forever changed, forever known
Going down as a legend
Going up with the sky, fly, butterfly fly (alright)
Fly high

[Chorus]
Come fly with me
There's so much more to see out there
You'll agree
It's better when you're right next to me

[Verse 2]
Flight down got me passing out fast from a cheap thrill
Woke up after noon, feeling good, took a Advil (that's real)
But the jet lag ain't that bad, I'll get used to it (I'll get used to it)
Never seen your sky at nighttime

[Pre-Chorus 2]
That's a new area code
But you still look the same
Forever changed, forever known
Going down as a hero
Going up with the sky, fly, butterfly fly (alright)
Fly high

[Chorus]
Come fly with me
There's so much more to see out there
You'll agree
It's better when you're right next to me
Come fly with me
There's so much more to see out there
You'll agree
It's better when you're right next to me

[Verse 1]
Pitch black
I'm on the opposite side of the fence
Sneaking out for a kiss, yeah
Just to tell you I like you
There ain't nobody like you

[Pre Chorus]
Who you gonna dance with?
Who you gonna dance with?
Who you gonna dance with? (Mmm)

[Chorus]
He's the only one on my mind
He's the only one I call when I'm feeling reckless
Tell me that you're mine
Open up your heart for a minute
Let me see the things you got hiding in it

[Verse 2]
Cupid got us fucked up
Drawing hearts on my skin
With our initials in it
Ain't it nice out here, on the baseball field, when we're alone?
Press your lips against my neck
With me you don't pretend like with you're with your girlfriend
She's nice but she's not me
She's nice but hates me
Date me, I'm just playing
Didn't mean to say that
Sometimes kids say the dumbest things
But if you're down, so am I
I can't lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Who you gonna dance with?
Who you gonna dance with?
Who you gonna dance with? (Mmm)

[Chorus]
He's the only one on my mind
He's the only one I call when I'm feeling reckless
Tell me that you're mine
Open up your heart for a minute
Let me see the things you got hiding in it

[Bridge]
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I'll give it to you, you just gotta ask, yeah
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I'll give it to you, you just gotta ask, yeah

[Outro]
And when we get older
And y'all break up someday
And this is not a secret
Maybe then you'll say you love me back
But until then I'll be dreaming about that

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Still trynna make it to tomorrow
My purposes redefining, but my heart still feeling hollow
I stare out the window of my Apollo
It feels like an Impala when I'm whipping thru' the cosmos, alone
Waiting for the reception from the other side
I built this shit to get away from what I couldn't hide
But didn't think that it could turn into my coffin, so far away from home
That love is foreign to my conscience
They said "do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or do you draw the line for when it's better days?
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me "do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or do you draw the line for when it's better days?
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame?

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why (why?)

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Phone ringing, never outgoing, homebody
Never outgoing, put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish adding notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wide out, wide out
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off kilter, off kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gon' make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a dead head zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't giving up, you should set it off
Tell me "time's up", let the water run, let my body run

[Intro: Jim Jones]
"You’re not free with your Cadillac! You’re doing just exactly what the Man wants you to do: Buy his goods, so you’ll never have any real economic freedom. He wants you to buy everything he advertises on TV, so he’ll keep you perpetually owing your soul to the company store. You’re not free, you’re a slave—!"

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz

[Verse 1: Joba]
What's with these superficial people from my past?
Dancin' 'round the fact that I did everything the motherfuckers bet against
They be like, "Gather 'round, place your bets!
This young man won't ever be shit!"
Well my bad, I guess I just pursued this shit
While you chose to settle down to have some kids
I mean, it's okay to fall in line, just don't look back
That's a long ass line that I'm not in
I just never found the time, or had the chance
Truth is, you can kiss my ass
Never been the one to bow down
Never been the one to air out any situation, but right now
When it's all your fault, I'm here now

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Thrift like a five hundred discount
I move it, I move it like Madagascar
Flip it like eight ball to inside of nose, it get raw
Bloody leaf color like fall
When you were calling, they said I'll be nothing
Well, suck on my dick and then lick on my balls
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Th—th—they want to boot up my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
Look what we did in a year
You need a neutral career
I hate on myself when I look in the mirror
Piddling voices all up in my ear
Why do I care how I look?
Why do I care what they say?
I do not care what they say! (Rrrah!)

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk (niggas talk too much!)
They forgot how to listen (listen!)
'Til the prophets arisen
We mix New Edition with nuclear fission
I don't do auditions, I don't ask permission
Ain't no politician, don't ask my opinion
You got an addiction to what ain't your business
Make the admission, I make like magicians and hit my Houdini
Why they so soft like linguine? I murder this music routinely
I know that you see me, don't see you searching the meaning
I think that’s why you won't believe and the future is leaning
Revolutions started streaming
The reason why you see me beaming
I'm dreaming of making moves like the government
You better think about who you fucking with, get back!

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't

[Bridge: bearface & dijon]
(Freak, ah, ah) Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me now that you're free (Free, free)
Oh yeah (Yeah)
Won't you come this close to me, baby?
Baby, yeah (Yeah)

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
And if I could erase who you thought I was
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
And if I could erase who you thought I was
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
Follow me under and never to be too unique
Definitely a trap, she'll get ya body and you're starting to feel weak
Maybe a thing that you wanted is all that you need
Don't have to fill no expectation that aren't the thoughts that you conceive

[Bridge]
Promises, promises, promises left that you know
Changing with time
Promises, promises, promises left that you know
Changing with time

[Chorus]
Follow me under and never to be too unique
Definitely a trap, she'll get ya body and you're starting to feel weak
Maybe a thing that you wanted is all that you need
Don't have to fill no expectation that aren't the thoughts that you conceive

[Verse]
Choose your hair and choose to get off
Waste your time and pretty the thoughts
Nothing is forgiven, black skin and my rhythm
And you know that it's all at a cost
Find a means to drive away grief
Choose your sex to find a relief
Nothing is forgiven, black skin and my rhythm
And you know that it's all at a cost

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse]
Choose your hair and choose to get off
Waste your time and pretty the thoughts
Nothing is forgiven, black skin and my rhythm
And you know that it's all at a cost
Find a means to drive away grief
Choose your sex to find a relief
Nothing is forgiven, black skin and my rhythm
And you know that it's all at a cost

[Verse]
When you wake up
It's not the first thing that you wanna know
Can you still count
All of the reasons that you're not alone?
When you wake up
It's not the first thing that you wanna know
Can you still count
All of the reasons that you're not alone?

[Chorus]
No one wants to be the odd one out at times (No one wants to be, yeah)
No one wants to be the negro swan (Swan)
Can you break sometimes? (Sometimes)
Can you break sometimes? (Sometimes, ooh)
Charcoal make it start and make me liked at times (No one wants to be, yeah)
Lick me till it cleans all of the world
Can you break sometimes?
Can you break sometimes? (Yeah, sometimes)

[Verse]
When you wake up
It's not the first thing that you wanna know
Can you still count
All of the reasons that you're not alone? (My friends)

[Chorus]
No one wants to be the odd one out at times (No one wants to be, yeah)
No one wants to be the negro swan
Can you break sometimes? (Sometimes)

Charcoal make it start and make me liked at times (No one wants to be, yeah)
Lick me till it cleans all of the world
Can you break sometimes? (Sometimes)

[Interlude]
Can you break sometimes?
No one, no one
Can she break sometimes?
No one, no one

No one, no one

No one, no, no one

[Outro]
Can you break sometimes?
Can you break sometimes?
Can you break sometimes?
Can you break sometimes?

[Verse: Aaron Maine & BEA1991]
I got to see you live for more
You said it before
You wish I'd seen the saint you were before
Your skin's a flag that shines for us all
You said it before
The brown that shines and lights your darkest thoughts

[Verse: Devonté Hynes]
Ay
I had to see you live for more
You said it before, uh huh
You wish I seen the saint you were before
Your skin's a flag that shines for us all
You said it before
The brown that shines and lights your darkest thoughts
Oh, ay

[Verse: Devonté Hynes & Adam Bainbridge]
Your skin's a flag that shines for us all
You said it before, mmm
The brown that shines and lights your darkest thoughts
Uh

[Interlude: Devonté Hynes & Ava Raiin]
Spreading all my love for you
You never tell me all that you do
Quiet when it's done, will you ever run?
Spreading all my love for you
You never tell me all that you do
Quiet when it's done, will you ever run?
Quiet when it's done, will you ever run?

[Outro: Devonté Hynes]
I got to see you live for more
You said it before
You wished I'd seen the saint you were before

[Verse 1: Devonté Hynes]
Take your time, it's all you've ever known
And nothing gets complete when you're home
I pull you up so far
You can't keep placing yourself below
Waiting for your headache to go
What do I know so far?

[Refrain: Ian Isiah]
So far
So far
So far
So far
So far
So far

[Verse 2: Devonté Hynes & Ian Isiah]
Cruise your phone, make sure your body's warm
Let's link up, tell me when you are home
What do you know so far?
You can't keep placing yourself above
Touch is something short of true love (Oh, true love)
What do I know, know, so far?

[Refrain: Ian Isiah]
So far
So far
So far
So far

[Intro: Devonté Hynes]
Follow that sea
Chase what you know
Cover your weave
Jump in the flow

[Verse 1: Tei Shi & Puff Daddy]
Yo, yeah, yo
Uh, uh, uh
Is this the way that you want it to end?
Is this the way that you leave me?
Already told you I don't wanna be friends
What's it gonna take for you to believe me?
Is this the way that you want it to end?
Is this the way that you leave me?
Is this the way that you wanna pretend?
Is this the way that you see me?

[Chorus: Tei Shi & Diddy]
Is this the way that you, way that you are?
Yeah, bring hope when you come around
Yeah, I still smile when you come around
Is this the way that you, way that you are?
Yeah, bring hope when you come around
Yeah, I still smile when I come around
Is this the way that you, way that you are?
Is this the way that you leave me?
Yo, yo, yeah, bring hope when you come around
Yeah, I still smile when you come around, yeah

[Verse 2: Tei Shi]
What's it like where you are from?
Are you the star of your town?
Power up and make it your home
Apparitions of your love
Have you seen them falling short?

[Chorus: Tei Shi & Diddy]
Is this the way that you, way that you are?
Yeah, bring hope when you come around
Yeah, I still smile when you come around
Is this the way that you, way that you are?
Yeah, bring hope when you come around
Yeah, I still smile when you come around
Is this the way that you, way that you are?
Yeah, bring hope when you come around
Yeah, I still smile when you come around
Yeah, I bring hope, what
Is this the way that you leave me?
I bring hope, yeah
I bring hope, yeah
I bring hope, yeah
Bring hope when you come around

[Interlude: Puff Daddy & Tei Shi]
Yeah, gee, I don't, sometimes I ask myself, like
You know, what is it going to take for me not to be afraid
To be loved the way, like, I really wanna be loved?
But that I know how I really wanna be loved
But I'm, but I'm, like, scared to really, really feel that
You know, it's like you want something
But you don't know if you can handle it
I'll love again
You are the only one
You give me that hope that, um
I'll love again
Maybe one day I'll get over my fears and I'll receive
You'll be the only one
You'll be the only one

[Outro: Devonté Hynes & Tei Shi]
Follow that sea
Chase what you know
Cover your weave
Jump in the flow
Follow that sea
Chase what you know
You'll be the only one
Cover your weave
Jump in the flow

[Intro: Janet Mock]
So, like, my favorite images are the ones where
Someone who isn't supposed to be there
Who's like in a space, a space where
We were not ever welcomed in, where we were not invited
Yet we walk in and we show all the way up
People try to put us down by saying
"She's doing the most," or "He's way too much."
But, like, why would we want to do the least?

[Chorus]
Cheap on your skin, smooth
Jewels that ring
Shine hit your eyes, black kiss the ring
Ruby ebony sides, it's time
Change my eyes for something, cool

[Verse 1]
A dream never leaving my sight
A sun never leaving my side
A feeling, a door starts to close
I'm feeling the burn in my eyes
The eyes of a heavy basset
Suited to staying indoors like a good nigga
I treated the hope like my home
And destroyed it, go figure
Still proud, best of my abilities
Still I think about an exit
No one ever will appreciate
The way you bare your soul for them too
I'm through
I'm through

[Chorus]
Cheap on your skin, smooth
Jewels that ring
Shine hit your eyes
Black kiss the ring
Ruby ebony sides

[Verse 2]
Nigga, I'm feeling myself
(Nigga, I'm feeling myself)
Nigga, I'm still in my zone
(I'm still in my zone)
Got big books but I'm broke, (I'm broke)
Nigga, I'm feeling myself
(Nigga, I'm feeling myself)
One time for the help
(One time, one time)
Two times 'fore I fell
Three times for the hopeless feeling
Look at how I'm spending my wealth
(Look at how I'm spending my wealth)
And I'm feeling myself looking up
But then the thoughts start filling me up, me up
Nigga, I'm feeling my, nigga, I'm feeling myself
(Nigga, I'm feeling myself)
One time for the help
When the news is way too fi'
And a man get shot on the passenger side
Too bad 'cos a nigga went live, (went live)
Nigga, I'm feeling my, nigga, I'm feeling myself
Seek what you need to get by
Awake with one eye closed
In dark black clothes
Red and blue lights on my stone
Go back to being unknown
Relax your hair
Tuck your shirt
Put your glasses on
Play your guitar

[Interlude: Janet Mock]
You asked me what family is
And I think of family as community
I think of the spaces where you don't have to shrink yourself
Where you don't have to pretend or to perform
You can fully show up and be vulnerable
And in silence, completely empty and
That's completely enough
You show up, as you are, without judgment, without ridicule
Without fear or violence, or policing, or containment
And you can be there and you're filled all the way up
So we get to choose our families
We are not limited by biology
We get to make ourselves
And we get to make our families

[Verse 1: Devonté Hynes]
Dreaming Orlando, get it?
Give it time
Walked these steps before
Sixteen-year-old boy
Confused and knowing that he’s different he wants to give in
After school, sucker punched down
Down and out

[Refrain]
First kiss was the floor
First kiss was the floor

[Verse 2: Devonté Hynes]
Thinking it won't make a difference if you don't get up
Timing is all
I don't know, tell us more
What do you want me to think?
I’m changing anyway
All that I know was taught to me young, lesson one, when I cried in front of you all
Seen it all before

[Refrain: Devonté Hynes]
First kiss the floor
First kiss the floor
First kiss the floor
Shoot, baby, shoot

[Outro: Janet Mock & Devonté Hynes]
Life on the floor
You know, it's an insult we often put onto
Beneath the world
A lot of folk is, like, oh, you're doing too much
So like, a couple years ago I was like
You know what? My resolution, my internal resolution will be to
Sand in your pearls
To do too much
Yes, I love it

[Verse]
Give it some time
See how it goes
She'll change her mind
Go past the goals
Home is ahead
Homies are close
Sometimes the gods
Just answer hope, ooh

[Verse 1: Ian Isiah]
Lord, I just wanna be
Rooted and grounded in thee
Lord, place me
Lord Jesus, place me, yeah
I wanna be centered in thy will

[Chorus 1: Eva]
In thy holy will
In thy holy will
In thy holy, holy, holy, holy, holy will

[Verse 2: Ian Isiah]
Lord, I just wanna be
Highly favored in thee
Lord, make me in
Lord Jesus, place me
I wanna be centered in thy will

[Chorus 2: Eva & Devonté Hynes]
In thy holy will (Holy will)
In thy holy will (Center me)
In thy holy, holy, holy, holy, holy will (Holy will)
In thy holy will (Center me)
In thy holy will (Center me)
In thy holy, holy, holy, holy, holy will

[Interlude: Devonté Hynes]
Something you see
And it's all that you know to be true
Something you need
It's all that I know to be true
Something you see
All that I know to be true
Something you need
It's all that I know to be true

[Outro: ? & Devonté Hynes]
Be true
Lord, place me
Lord, place me

[Verse: Devonté Hynes]
We received our bloody circles in the mail
Only see what's really important when it's nailed
As a teen, my Lord and savior was a male
Tightened truss and six steel strings that keep me frail
It's the worst I've ever felt, when it hailed
Broken teeth and bloody nose but least it snowed
Instantly dry, oh, I cried and cut a line
In my eyebrow acted like the boys in town
Then my teacher told me that this, made her sad
Had to act just like the others to get around
Friday nights alone in Ilford with my board

[Outro: Janet Mock]
Like, growing up I have always heard or like, I was always hyperaware of
The things that the people around me who were charged with my care
Or told me, like, be silent or be quiet
Or be ashamed or hide
Or perform a version of myself that wasn't really me
And so, I think that through my life I've always been hyperconscious and aware of not going into spaces and seeking too much attention
Um, because part of survival is, like, being able to just fit in
To be seen as normal and to, like, quote-unquote belong
But I think that so often in society in order to belong means that we have to, like, shrink parts of ourselves

[Intro: Tommy Wright III]
My man Rico MDB in the house
My dog C-9 with the date
My dog TC over here, grinnin' all golden
And he finna come up
Street smart-

[Verse 1: Devonté Hynes]
Switchin' up your style, but you've waited too long
Funny until now so it's wrong
Pacing yourself, and racing yourself in the name of truth
But what's true?

[Refrain: Devonté Hynes & Tommy Wright III]
Brother, baby, we've seen it all
And we're tired, so, what you want from me?
Grinnin' all gold

[Chorus: Devonté Hynes & Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'

Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Tell me what you want from me

[Verse 2: Devonté Hynes]
Nothing can replace me if you're not taking my lead
Better to be broken than in need

[Refrain: Devonté Hynes]
Brother, baby, we've seen it all
And we're tired, uh, so what you want from me?

[Chorus: Devonté Hynes & Project Pat]
Tell me what you want from me
(What you want from me baby)
Tell me what you want from me (Grill on froze)
Tell me what you want from me (Want from me)
Tell me what you want from me

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Lookin' for the chewin', for the jaw
Blowing like the time, word of mouth
Shawty told me that this world is ours
Selfish with that pussy like it's mine
Peppermint, double-mint, spearmint type of shit
She the type of chick to get right on the dick
Ride on the dick, with no license and shit
No relatives, sentimental
It's detrimental, still compared to this relevance
She the type of chick to get right on the dick
Ride on the dick, with no license and shit, oh
Back and forth, wall to wall, use the jaw
Losin' drawers in the sauce, now
On the job, never off
That pussy got, won't let her on, and it's so good
Shout out my ex though, she was the best though
Got on my damn nerves, hella fresh though
I bought that Guess shirt
She had that mesh shirt, I turned it to a sweatshirt
Throw on that sweatshirt, she fuck with Earl too
She fuck with girls too, I fuck with her too
Tell her quit the chattin', jaws made for chewin'
If you fuckin' with me, bet you know what you doin', like

[Outro: Project Pat & Tommy Wright III]
Vavet, get the new CD, "Feel Me Before They Kill Me"
Right now, fear me in person
Buy "Feel Me, Before They Kill Me"! You heard me?
Patta, I like the dirty, dirty, I love to beat it, beat it
Tell her lies and and I promise whole lot of shit
She'll never get, bend over let me hit
A North Memphis nigga bitch, he is very slick
Ho, don't beat a bih, and they see you break
That ho love a rich nigga, I got plenty cake
She get it like she do, 'cause she pretty freak
Pretty hate, I got choppas, call me pretty Drake
Patta

[Verse 1]
Dreaming of the place
Bring myself away
Like in Barking days

[Verse 2]
Scared my fears away
No one to complain
Baby, what's the grade?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm riding switch, I can't escape
Future back into the gate
I bust it up on Ilford Lane
A pleasure flip up to my grade
I'm riding switch, I can't escape
Future back into the gate
I bust it up on Ilford Lane

[Chorus]
Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics (Always feeling)
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical

[Verse 1]
Dreaming of the place
Bring myself away
Like in Barking days

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm riding switch, I can't escape
I bust it up on Ilford Lane
A pleasure flip up to my grade

[Chorus]
Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics (Always feeling)
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical (Always feeling)

[Chorus]
Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics (Always feeling)
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical

[Verse: Devonté Hynes]
Demons on my neck, neck
Summer take a toll
Lamp in my eyes shined bright on my soul
Girls awful wet slip, fall, break the pain
And the same anxiety's coming up again
I've been losing out on something
So I'm told by my friends

[Chorus: Devonté Hynes & Georgia Anne Muldrow]
Runnin' in circles
Looking for something to hold on
Runnin' in circles
Knowing there's nowhere to go
And it's harder to be on your own (So hard)
And it's hard when the night owns your soul
And it's harder to think on your own
You're runnin' on my mind
Yeah, you're runnin' on my mind
And the summer is taking it all
I know you're runnin' on my mind
Runnin' on my mind
It all
It all
It all
Yeah, you're runnin' on my mind
I know you're running' on my mind
Runnin' on my mind
I promise you, you're running' on
Yeah, you're running on my mind

[Verse: Devonté Hynes]
Demons on my neck, neck
Summer take a toll
Lamp in my eyes shined bright on my soul
Girls awful wet slip, fall, break the pain
And the same anxiety's coming up again

[Interlude: Georgia Anne Muldrow]
You and your soul are never not one
I said, you and your soul are never not one
Whoa, rise and shine, rise and shine
'Cause you and your soul are never not one
Hold on, yes
You gonna be okay, you gonna be okay
Everybody goes through it
Everybody goes through it
You're gonna be alright
Just hold on to your mighty way of being

[Outro: Janet Mock, Devonté Hynes, & Amandla Stenberg]
Live for the floor
If I called you would you answer me?
So, you were, like, talking about this idea of being called upon
And for some reason the first thing I heard was, like
This faint, irritating, incessant buzzer
And I think I heard it three times in my life
The first was, was within myself
Um, to stop pretending
To stop performing in ways that people wanted me to
Life for the floor
To actually show up for myself
And to be myself

[Intro]
See, on me

[Verse 1]
Balance in my hair, I'm pretty as fuck, ay, ay
Choosing what you wear and getting this far
Tricking on my own time, what is it worth?
Got throat on my neck, neck, shatter your first
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear

[Refrain]
It's a long time, long time
See 

[?]
See..

[?]

[Verse 2]
Pretty woke, I'm pretty as fuck
Trick coat
Choosing what you wear and getting this far
Waiting for the smoke to clear

[Refrain]
It's a long time, long time
See 

[?]
See..

[?]

[Outro]
The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills within
The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills within
The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills within
The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills within
The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills within
The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills within
The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills within (My heart and my soul)
The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills within

[Verse 1]
Irony is okay, I suppose
Culture is to blame
You try and mask your pain in the most postmodern way
You lack substance when you say something like, "Oh, what a shame"
It's just a self-referential way that stops you having to be human
I'm assuming you'll balloon when you remove the dirty spoon and start consuming like a human, that's what I am assuming

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sure that you're not just another girl
I'm sure that you're gonna say that I was sexist
I feel like you're running out of all the things I liked you for

[Chorus]
Why can't we be friends, when we are lovers?
Because it always ends with us hating each other
Instead of calling me out, you should be pulling me in
I've just got one more thing to say

[Verse 2]
And why would you believe you could control how you're perceived
When at your best you're intermediately versed in your own feelings?
Keep on putting off conceiving
It's only you that you're deceiving
Oh, don't have a child, don't cramp your style, I'll leave it

[Chorus]
Why can't we be friends, when we are lovers?
Because it always ends with us hating each other
Instead of calling me out, you should be pulling me in
I've just got one more thing to say

[Outro]
I'm just pissed off because you pied me off
After your show when you let go of my hand
In front of some sket who wanted bit on your
Nah, I’m just messing

[Intro: Steve + Stella Monye]
Steve, oh
Oh, I was burning out desire, so I needed a woman to put out this fire
She said: "check it, check it, check it"

[Verse 1]
Sitting by my window
Watching the moonlight
In my home
Suddenly my mind
Is bringing out desire
In my home
So I got a woman
To put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Chorus]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire

[Verse 2]
Soon I had a phone call
From a woman
In my home
She was burning
Burning of desire
Just like I do
She wanted me to
Put out this fire
Burning in her soul

[Chorus]
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Verse 3]
Suddenly my woman
Was in my arms
In my home
She was loving me
69 times
In my home
She was putting
Putting out the fire
Burning in my soul

[Chorus]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul

Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire

Only you, baby
Only you, baby
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Only you, baby
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Only you, baby
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Only you

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Six-inch walker, big shit talker
I never play the victim, I'd rather be a stalker
So baby take me in, I'll disobey the law
Make sure you frisk me good
Check my panties and my bra
Wild'n out, a crazy house
With my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

Hey, hey, hey
I don’t understand it
Tell me, does it show?
Feel overwhelmed by
A lack of control
Kick back and leave me in the cold
It’s fine, I’ve never needed anything to hold onto
Now you say you want another lover at your door?
No, I don’t wanna play the same game anymore
You wanna leave tonight
Leave before the light
Can offer us a bit of life

I never found out that peace of mind
Was an illusion bound and tied
Behind thick walls of blues and greys
The haze we’d dreamt up to disguise the pain
Hold on now, the feeling that it brings
Is just a temporary pain
And I’m never gonna bring it back ‘round here again
I’m gonna leave tonight
Leave before the light
Can offer us a bit of life
Sever the chord that ties
These tiring eyes
To the dark in wait behind
I didn’t know where we would stand
My head in my hands
But I never wanna see your face again

Didn’t know where we would be
We’re nothing to see
But I know that I never wanna do it again

You just stand outside my window
And watch me bleed out
You’re running again
Running scared
You’re at it again
Running scared

In my head
You’re always in my head
I should’ve kept my own part clean
In my head
You’re always in my head
I couldn’t stay astray
Stray
I don’t know where we went wrong
Was it dead all along?
I just know that I never wanna feel that again

I don’t know what I could say
To take it away
But I know that I never wanna hurt you again

You just stand outside my window
And hear me scream out
You’re running again
Running scared
You’re at it again
Running scared

In my head
You’re always in my head
I should’ve kept my own part clean
In my head
You’re always in my head
I couldn’t stay astray
Stray
I don't want your money
You can't afford love
I'm feeling it all collapse
Right under my nose again
And kick out with the wind

I don't want your hours
I don't have the time
You corner me when I'm down
Down and out again
The only time you ever call me

I'm ready for love
Are you?
Maybe I'd be better off in Berlin
Or as an artist's muse in London
Drifting from hand to hand
Maybe I was born to be a sailor
Drop my anchors in Antigua
As a travelling fisherman

But I am home wherever you are near
There's no life in anything
When you're not here

What could take my love away?

Maybe I was destined for philosophy
Leading leftist ideologies
At the Paris-Sorbonne
Dreaming up the splendid demise
Of the societies we despise
At Café de Flore

But these things lose all their meaning and allure
If you're not there to
Witness the grandeur
What could take my love away?

Maybe we'll be missionaries in the Congo
Revolutionaries in Cuba
Perhaps we'll build a home
In the shadows of the forest
Along the east coast, or the west coast
I forget where we decided

As long as I'm with you when we do it
I could trade the views in
For any pallet

Nothing can take my love away
No, nothing can take my love away

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
It's gettin' late, I'm making my way over to my favorite place
I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate, yeah
Who knew that you'd be up in here lookin' like you do
You're making stayin' over here impossible
Baby, I'ma say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I wanna take you away, let's escape into the music, DJ, let it play
I just can't refuse it, like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it

I wanna take you away, let's escape into the music, DJ, let it play

Don't you feel the passion ready to explode?

Possible candidate, yeah
Who knew that you'd be up in here lookin' like you do
You're making stayin' over here impossible
Baby, I'ma say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I wanna take you away, let's escape into the music, DJ, let it play
I just can't refuse it, like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music
I wanna take you away, let's escape into the music, DJ, let it play
I just can't refuse it, like the way you do this

Baby, are you ready? ’Cause it's getting close
Don't you feel the passion ready to explode?
What goes on between us, no one has to know
This is a private show, oh

You're looking at me like I tried to take you down
No, no, that's not what happened at all
There's no sound, I'm waiting on your next move
A showdown and I know where to hit you
But no, no, it's not how I wanted this to go down

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now we're fighting dirty
Won't somebody come say, "Break it up"?

[Chorus]
And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And why you taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby, let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So gloves off, if this is how you want it
We had it all, but you couldn't keep a promise

Is she here? Is she standing on the sidelines?
Oh, oh, can't you tell this is breaking my heart?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now I'm fighting dirty
But I ain't going down ‘til they break it up

And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And why you taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Now we're standing in the ring
Breaking everything that we've been building up so long
And I don't wanna do this, break it up
But you're not who I thought you were
And this is looking more like a war
Looks like we're going to war

[Chorus 2]
And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And I'm trying not to break down crying
No one's gonna give you a medal
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby, let's go, oh, oh
Looks like we're going to war
Oh, oh

[Outro]
The first shot's fired, everybody's gathered around
You're looking at me like I tried to take you down
No, no, but if you wanna fight, baby, let's go

[Intro: Mark Avery & Eddie]
Meet Eddie, 23 years old. Fed up with life and the way things are going (I'm going fucking insane), he decides to rob a liquor store (I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more, homes). But on his way in he has a sudden change of heart (Shit is mine), and suddenly (I gotta do this) his conscience comes into play (I gotta do this).

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre, & Eddie]
Alright, stop (Uh?), now before you walk in the door
Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence
(Who are you?) I'm your mo{therfuckin'} conscience!
That's nonsense! Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs (Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Bump that, do that {shit}! Hit that lick!
Can you afford to blow this hit, are you that rich?
Why'd you care if you scare her to death? Are you that chick?
Do you really think she gives {a fuck} if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right!)
Not over this lick (Stop!), drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

[Hook: Eminem]
These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow all these voices
These voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow all these

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Stan, 21 years old. After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom. Once again, his conscience comes into play.

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little chicken's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
How could you take advantage of her? She's passed out
It's easy, just cut these lights out, that's how
Then pick this chicken up, get her off Brad's couch
And leave her on the front porch in her mom and dad's house
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest (Doobiest)
D'you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Bump that, drop her off, ring the door bell then bail

[Hook: Eminem]
These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow all these voices
These voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow all these

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker. After coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man.

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Start breathin', man? You just caught your wife cheatin'
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off
Forget gettin' divorced, cut this chicken's head off!
Wait, what if there's a good explanation for this?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his {dick}?
Alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna grab her?
Kick her out the house, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
(What you say?) What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
(I'ma kill you, you little m{otherfucker}!) Huh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the hell you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
{Aw, fuck it,} what am I sayin'?
{Do 'em both, Grady! Where's your gun at?}
I heard she sang a good song, I heard she had a style
And so I came to see her and listen for a while
And there she was this young girl, a stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with her fingers
Singing my life with her words
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly with her song

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt she found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that she would finish but she just kept right on

Strumming my pain with her fingers
Singing my life with her words
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly with her song
She sang as if she knew me in all my dark despair
And then she looked right through me as if I wasn't there
But she was there this stranger, singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with her fingers
Singing my life with her words
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly with her song

[Intro]
The one

The one
The one
The one
The one
The one that got away
The one
The one that got away

[Verse 1]
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
Be us against the world, be us against the world
Be us against the wo-o-o-o-o-rld
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

The one (the one)
The one (the one)
The one (the one)
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The quiet regression
A single sentence
Reaching some comfort
In a method less used

But please stop to think
Of what I mean
And If I mean nothing
You know what to do

Same as the other day
When it softly rained
I sat in silence
Wanting to see your face

Turns out my heart was broken wide
And suprised
How could you do this
Bringing tears from my eyes
It’s getting harder to say
I want you to be with me someday
And time is getting away
From that place we were yesterday
(Repeat)
Dreams im slowly drifting in
In them they feature me and you
Like bonnie and her handsome friend
Under the moon

I told you about a story once
It didn’t get through to you
Something that I cared about
Something carelessly blue

And hate
Runs through
Me too
Just not for you

Night falls on him perilous
A painting would be fitting now
Of his demise entirely
At the meeting of you and me

I’m working on a newer me
A newer me entirely
One to fit the mold you’ve made
To sing a custom serenade

So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
Away, away, away, away, away, away...
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay...

[Post-Chorus]
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (the one that got)
(the one that got)
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (the one)
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
Away, away, away, away, away, away...
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay...

[Post-Chorus]
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (whoa)
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (the one that got)
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (the one, one, one)
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (the one)
(one, one)
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (the one)
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
The one that got away

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Looks like you've been starving
You've got those hungry eyes
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in
You want what I'm cooking, boy

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
Let me take you
Under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby

[Post-Chorus: Katy Perry]
That you want
Bon appétit, baby
That you want
Bon appétit, baby

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Sweet potato pie
It'll change your mind
Got you running back for seconds
Every single night

[Verse 4: Quavo]
Sweet tooth, no tooth fairy
Whipped cream, no dairy
Got her hot light on, screaming, "I'm ready"
But no horses, no carriage

We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time

I'm the one they say can change your life (take off)
No waterfall, she drippin' wet, you like my ice? (Blast)
She say she want a Migo night
Now I ask her, "What's the price?" (Hold on)
If she do right, told her get whatever you like
Offset

[Verse 5: Offset]
I grab her legs and now divide, aight
Make her do a donut when she ride, aight
Looking at the eyes of a dime, make you blind
In her spine and my diamonds change the climate

[Verse 6: Quavo & Katy Perry]
Sweet tooth, no tooth fairy
Whipped cream, no dairy
Got her hot light on, screaming, "I'm ready"

[Verse 1]
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Drop: Dave Audé]

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic

Lead me into the light, into the, into the light

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick

[Verse 1]
This was never
No, I don't
This was
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Verse 2]
No, I don't
No, I don't
No, I don't
No, I-I
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Bridge A]
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't
No, I don't

Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it

[Verse 1]
There's always somebody taller
With more of a wit
And he's equipped to enthrall her
And her friends think he's fit
And you just can't measure up no
You don't have a prayer
Wishing you had made the most of her
When she was there

[Pre-Chorus]
They've got engaged
No intention of a wedding
He's pinched your bird
And he'd probably kick your head in

[Chorus]
Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts
You're better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Oh no

[Verse 2]
He might be one of those boys
That's all pretty and vain
Likes to go in the sunbed
And stays out of the rain
So that he don't get his hair wet
You wouldn't want that
At least he hasn't got a Nova
Or a Burberry hat

[Pre-Chorus]
They've got engaged
No intention of a wedding
He's pinched your bird
And he'd probably kick your head in

[Chorus]
Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts
You're better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Of course you were

[Verse 3]
Have you heard what she's been doing?
Never did it for me
He picks her up at the school gates
At twenty past three
She's been with all the boys
But never went very far
She wagged English and Science
Just to go in his car

[Pre-Chorus]
They've got engaged
No intention of a wedding
He's pinched my bird
And he'd probably kick my head in, oh
Now the girls have grown
But I'm sure they still carry on in similar ways

[Chorus]
Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts
So I'm better off without her anyway
I said I wasn't sad to see her go
But I'm only pretending, you know
Yeah, I'm only pretending, you know
Yeah, I'm only pretending, you know
Oh I'm only pretending, you know

[Verse 1]
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight

Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

This is the part of me
This is the part of me

[Verse 1]
Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Verse 2]
Throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul

You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I'll let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on

Let's run away and don't ever look back

Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

And get mad when it don't go your way (Go way)
I know y'all look at me like I don't go through things, but I'm human (Human)
I know it's hard sometimes, but try to keep in mind that I'm human (Human)
Fuck all the fortune and fame, forget the name, I'm a human (Human)
I can't believe all the under-the-table shit they doin' (They doin')
I'm tired of fingers pointed at me (At me)
I'm tired of all this weight on me (On me)
I'm tired of everybody wanting a piece of me (Yeah)
Shit, I'm not an ATM machine (No, hey)
What do I do when I can't do what I do? (What)
How can I win, if I can't win with truth? (Oh)
Got a couple of dead homies that I promised I would make it out this shit (Sorry)
And I know that God's hand is on me nigga
I'm gonna make it out this shit (We are)
No weapon formed against me (Amen)
Shall prosper (Amen)
Not claiming either (Amen)
That the storm is over (Amen)
I admit I talked to Ms. McGlenn (Yeah)
FYI, that's my second mother (Mama)
I admit that I asked her, "How am I gonna get the world off my shoulder?" (Oh)
She said, "Son, don't you lose it (Lose it)
Sometimes, you gotta go through it (Through it)
They can say what they say, but at the end of the day
They cannot deny your music (Oh, Woah)
'Cause your music (Yeah) has touched people (Yeah)
It inspired (Yeah) all people (Yeah)
Overseas (Yeah), everywhere (Yeah)
Don't worry, don't care (Care)
'Cause the anointed (Yeah) is on you (On you)
And that's why these haters are at you (At you)
So just keep on doing you, baby (Yeah)
You don't have to give these fools an explanation" (Yeah, oh)

[Chorus]
I admit it, admit it (I admit it)
I admit it, I did it  (I did it, yeah)
I admit it, I did (I)
I admit it, I did, did it

[Verse 7]
What's the definition of a cult?
What's the definition of a sex slave?
Go to the dictionary, look it up
Let me know, I'll be here waiting
Now I admit I got some girls that love me to pull they hair (They hair)
Now I admit that they love me to talk dirty when I pull they hair (They hair, yeah)
Some like me to spank 'em and
Some like to give brain and
What some of these girls want is too much for the radio station
Look, I'm just a man, y'all (Man, y'all)
Not a monster or beast (No, no)
But I admit there are times when these girls so fine out here, that a nigga fall weak (Oh, fall weak)
Now I admit I love Hugh Hefner (Hugh Hefner)
And through the years supported Hugh Hefner (Yeah)
But when he left this world, he had a million girls (Yeah)
But we gon' always love Hugh Hefner (Oh)
To Jim DeRogatis, whatever your name is (Whatever your name is)
You have been tryna destroy me for 25 whole years (25 whole years, yeah)
Writin' the same stories over and over and over again (Stories, stories, yeah)
Off my name, you done went and made yourself a career (A whole career)
But guess what? I pray for you and your family (Prayed for you)
And all my other enemies (Enemies)
I'm not gonna let y'all steal my joy (My joy)
I'm just gon' keep on doin' me (Doin' me)
Now I don't know what else to say except "I'm so falsely accused"
Tell me, how can you judge when you've never walked in my shoes?
So easy to mess up someone else's life
Through social media, the devil in disguise
I admit I miss my brothers (Brothers)
But I admit they weren't acting like brothers (Brothers)
Yeah, we've had our differences
But you don't turn on your brother (No)
For nothing (No), for no one (No), nada (No)
Mama (No) Joanne (No) is watching
She must be turning over in her grave (Yeah)
I admit I had to borrow a couple of M's from the label (Label)
All these hits out but I couldn't put food on the table (Table)
I was told I had to sell my cars (Cars)
I was told I couldn't get a loan (Loans)
Said I owed 20 million to the IRS and they was comin' to get my home (Oh, oh)
I admit I was feeling stupid, stayin' in the Homewood Suites (No disrespect)
Sippin' Hennessy, tryna figure out what happened to me (Happened to me)
There was so much going through my head (My head)
'Cause I knew that something wasn't right (Wasn't right)
I just couldn't put my finger on it (No)
But my spirit had better eyes (Better)
It told me what it saw (Saw)
And it scared the shit out of me (Me, yeah)
It said get rid of them all (All)
It's nothing but vultures 'round me (Me)
I admit that I love my fans (My fans)
For all the push and support they've shown (Yeah, you)
I admit if it wasn't for them (For them)
I would've never stayed strong (Oh)
Now I'm not trippin' on all of these rumors, that don't bother me
And I'm not payin' attention to these haters, that don't bother me (Oh, oh)
But what blows me is when certain people turn phony (Phony)
They say, "Rob, I got your back; Rob, you the man"
But they really doubtin' me
Bitch, you know who you are (Yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I bought you a car (Yeah, yeah)
Bitch, you stayed in my crib (Yeah, yeah)
I loved you with all my heart (My heart)
Now I don't like to brag when it comes to me (Comes to me)
But I've given back to the community (Community)
From the nonprofits to the charities (Charities)
But of course, you never hear that about me (About me)
To them niggas that drink my liquor and smoke my stogies
How come you ain't on Facebook takin' up for me?
While you 'round me most of the day (Oh)
When you know that I'm a good brother
Always got your hands out, it ain't no doubt (Yeah)
That y'all niggas ain't nothing but bloodsuckers
Plus, y'all ain't bringing nothing to the table (No, no)
Yeah, nigga, and you know it's real talk (Real talk)
Taking pictures with me for your Instagram
But when I need you, you quick to get lost (Can't find you)
Mm, oh, mm, oh, oh, oh, no, no, ooh, woah, I
Robert, Jay, and Joanne, my kids
What you hearin' out here about Dad, guys, I'm sorry for this (Sorry)
I'm so sorry, I can't imagine what y'all must be goin' through (Goin' through)
Every day its somethin' about me, my God, it must be killin' you (Killin' you)
I promise there'll be better days (There'll be better days)
Just keep walkin' straight (Just keep walkin' straight)
I know you must be worried but just know that I'm okay (Oh, I'm okay)
For me, things have gotten rough (Rough)
Right now I can't say too much (Say too much)
But for y'all I will stay tough (Oh, oh)
Daddy just need y'all to trust (Trust)
And believe in me (In me)
I admit that I've told the truth (Told the truth)
And still not free (Not free)
Still wanna hate me (Yeah), still wanna stone me (Stone me, yeah)
Still wanna chain me (Chain me, yeah), I think they wanna kill me

[Chorus]
I admit it, admit it (I admit it)
I admit it, I did it  (I did it, yeah)
I admit it, I did (I)
I admit it, I did, did it

[Verse 8]
Now, no disrespect to Chi-Town, my home (My home)
But we've got to learn how to support our own (Our own)
I admit that my heart cries for my city (My city)
'Cause we're losing young lives in the city (My city)
Instead of judging me (Judging me)
Y'all should be using me (Using me)
To help these kids, raise them out of depression and poverty (Oh, oh)
Now, I'm not saying I'm no savior (No savior)
But I can be an inspiration (Inspiration)
This is an invitation
Man, I admit I go through so much day to day (Day to day)
Got 23 lawyers, three or four managers
What am I doing? Show me the way (Oh)
The only thing I have left is my voice (My voice)
And now I have to use it for my protection (Yeah)
Because they left me no choice (No choice)
See my work has nothing to do with my private life
So stay the fuck out of my business and tend to your own damn life (Life)
So go 'head, say what you want to say (Want to say)
About who I want to date (I want to date)
But you won't say that shit to my face (To my face)
'Cause you know it ain't shit to say (Oh, oh-oh)
Next nigga bring me some dumb shit (Dumb shit)
It's gon' be a misunderstanding (Yeah)
'Cause niggas, they listen to dumb shit (Dumb shit)
Are niggas that be on that dumb shit (Dumb shit)
They need a light 'cause they ain't got no life
So they always conjuring up dumb shit (Dumb shit)
Blockin' my path (Path), they don't know the half (Half)
And so they make an assumption (Assumption)
Since when do assumptions (Since when?)
Cost a man his whole career? (Whole career)
Found guilty when you're innocent, is the only times that I fear (I fear)
There is one thing that's for sure (For sure)
And I want to make this shit clear (Clear)
I done lived my voice (Yeah) and represented my country (Yeah) for 31 fuckin' years (Yeah)
Damn it, I admit

[Outro]
I admit, I admit, I admit (Yeah)
I admit, I admit, I admit (Yeah)
Lyrics from Snippet

Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
Choking on your smoke
Smashing on your mirrors
Gonna vacate the fake so I see clearer
Running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care

Don't you wear your own mouth?
Walking around and throwing shade
Caught up in your mind games
But did I think you'd ever change?

I'm running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
I'm running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
Choking on your smoke
Smashing on your mirrors
Gonna vacate the fake so I see clearer
Running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
And I tried, and I tried, and I tried
But it just doesn't feel right
Like a night, like a night, like a night
With a sunrise

I'm running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air

You are looking two faced
You need another pair of shades
ok ken (and david). as much as i hate to make you guys famous or even respond to you directly. we all die one day and you’re old so fuck it. yea yea my 2013 performance at the grammys was absolute shit. technical difficulties, blah blah. thanks for the reminder. very much appreciated. fuck that performance though. you think that’s why i kept my work out of the grammy process this year? don’t you think i would’ve wanted to play the show to ‘redeem’ myself if i felt that way? in reality, i actually wanted to participate in honoring prince on the show but then i figured my best tribute to that man’s legacy would be to continue to be myself out here and to be successful. winning a tv award doesn’t christen me successful. it took me some time to learn that. i bought all my masters back last year in the prime of my career, that’s successful. blonde sold a million plus without a label, that’s successful. i am young, black, gifted and independent.. that’s my tribute. i’ve actually been tuning into cbs around this time of year for a while to see who gets the top honor and you know what’s really not 'great tv’ guys? 1989 getting album of the year over to pimp a butterfly. hands down one of the most 'faulty’ tv moments i’ve seen. believe the people. believe the ones who’d rather watch select performances from your program on youtube the day after because your show puts them to sleep. use the old gramophone to actually listen bro, i’m one of the best alive. and if you’re up for a discussion about the cultural bias and general nerve damage the show you produce suffers from then i’m all for it. have a good night.

[Verse 1]
She was looking forward to some time without a guy
Scattered small, shitty hair, but so am I
I grew up in Derby and you grew up way too fast
Death haunts the past, you just wanna lie on the grass
I can wait a while, I can wait a while

[Chorus]
Burnt out star (Burnt out star)
No matter where you are (You are)
Try to understand
That you're only a man

[Verse 2]
Oh, perfect body that they'll never tear apart
First they'll have to tear my head from your heart
She said it'd be romantic if I didn't use the door
Safe to say I don't see windows the same no more
I can wait a while, I can wait a while, yeah

[Chorus]
Burnt out star (Burnt out star)
No matter where you are (You are)
Try to understand
That you're only a man

[Bridge]
Well, I might, I might go and shack up in Tasmania
Before the ozone goes and paradise burns in Australia
Who knows? Who?

[Outro]
1917, 3017
1917, 1-9-1-7
1917, and I couldn't have known
And I couldn't have known, hey
1917, 1917
I can sit down on Jakarta, Jakarta streets
Jakarta street
No, woo, hey
Jakarta
Oh, 1917
Remember 1917
I can sit down on Jakarta
I can sit down on Jakarta streets
Hey, seems like... it hard
Old lady with bad feet, yeah
Wishing that you were high
Rain is getting hard but it doesn't fall
Doesn't fall so hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
Remember 1917, 1917, 1917
Remember, woo
Sit down on Jakarta
Break, break, break it down
And the rain is getting hard
Ha-ha-ha-ha-hard, woo
Sit down on Jakarta
Sit down on Jakarta
Yeah, 1917, 1917
1-9-1-7, 1-9-1-7
1-9-1-7, 1-9-1-7
1917
Sit down on Jakarta, woo
1917, 1917, 1917, 1917
1917, 1917, 1917, 1917
Wishing that you were high
Rain is getting hard but it doesn't fall as far on me
Yeah, it's 1917, 1917

[Verse 1]
And be my mistake
Then turn out the light
She bought me those jeans
The ones you like
I don't want to hug
I just want to sleep
The smell of your hair
Reminds me of her feet

[Pre Chorus]
So, don't wait outside my hotel room
Just wait till I give you a sign
'Cause I get lonesome sometimes

[Chorus]
Save all the jokes you're going to make
Whilst I see how much drink I can take
Then be my mistake

[Verse 2]
I shouldn't have called
'Cause we shouldn't speak
You do make me hard
But she makes me weak

[Pre Chorus]
And don't wait outside my hotel room
Just wait till I give you a sign
'Cause I get lonesome sometimes

[Chorus]
And save all the jokes you're going to make
Whilst I see how much drink I can take
Then be my mistake

[Verse 1:  Anne-Marie]
I don't wanna lie, can we be honest?
Right now while you're sitting on my chest
I don't know what I'd do without your comfort
If you really go first, if you really left

[Pre-Chorus:  Anne-Marie]
I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Read and repeat every conversation
Being with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday you've got me praying

[Chorus:  Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Pre-Drop: Anne-Marie]
Don't leave me a...

[Drop: David Guetta & Anne-Marie]
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha

[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
I don't wanna call and you not answer
Never see your face light up my phone
Never see you singing "Tiny Dancer"
Everytime my head hurts, everytime I'm low

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
'Cause I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Everything about you uncomplicated
Here with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday, you've got me praying

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Pre-Drop: Anne-Marie]
Don't leave me a...

[Drop: David Guetta & Anne-Marie]
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha (make me, alo..)

[Bridge: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me
Don't you ever go
Don't you ever leave me
No, oh

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Outro: Anne-Marie]
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone
I've been down countless halls
And once you've seen one it's like you've seen 'em all
And I've seen two open doors
And I can't help but wonder what the second is for

I can't tell myself anything
Even when it feels so seamless
Even when it feels so seamless
Don't get caught in the dirt
The dirt

There's a weight and I feel it and it's pressing down
And it won't be for nothing and it won't stick around
If it is about anything that I can fix
Then I'll see you on the other side if it really exists

I can't tell myself anything
Even when it feels so seamless
Even when it feels so seamless
Don't get caught in the dirt
The dirt
No more clean air, it burns my lungs
No more second guesses, I've had enough
No more clean air, it burns my lungs
No more second guesses, I've had enough

Let's forget it now
Baby when I'm 30 I'll laugh about how dumb it felt
Baby when I'm 30 I'll laugh it out
And oh god it's not funny, it's not funny, it's not funny
But I know we can laugh it out

[Verse 1]
Oh garden slug
What would you give to live like one of us?
Or would you rather wait in the shade?
Just the same as everyday

[Verse 2]
Oh useless thing
What does another useless day bring?
Did you just lie in place?
Emulated by the way I lie awake

[Chorus]
And in the waves I could've sworn that I saw my own reflection
And it was someone else's in the back
I could've waited my whole life to
Know the difference
But I should've just known better than that

[Verse 3]
And oh is it easiest to hide?
Under covered rocks
Or would you rather cut it all down?
Just to keep it from dragging you around

[Chorus]
And in the waves I could've sworn that I saw my own reflection
And it was someone else's in the back
I could've waited my whole life to
Know the difference
But I should've just known better than that

[Outro]
So if you look death right in the face, don't thank him
Because there's nothing and there won't ever be
And in moss covered springs you'll never find anything
So what's the use in hiding under our feet?

[Verse 1]
Haven't felt right in a week
And I'm thinning out
And it hurts bad
I gotta get back

[Hook]
Hot head and dreamless sleep
I could just slip down
And on the wrong track
I gotta get back

[Verse 3]
I wanna spend the entire year
Just face down
And on my own time
I wanna waste mine

[Verse 4]
And spend the rest of it asking myself
"Is this who you are?"
And I don't know
It just feels gross

[Bridge]
I don't think there's anything wrong
I don't think there's anything wrong
And I don't think there's anything wrong
I don't think there's anything wrong

[Verse 5]
Sunlight on the back of my arms
Just thins me out
To a different time
I wanna waste mine
Shutters on my house
Keep the sunlight in
If that's not enough to keep the people out

Then I don't wanna know what's on the other side

Turn on the TV
I wonder who thinks of it all
We could be watching the same thing

But I always shock myself when I plug it into the wall

So should I ask?
Are you home?

I can't keep anything down
All I hear is static buzz
And it's all echoing through my bedroom wall

Cover me in flies
They're breaking through the door
That'll show the garbage man
What everyone else is always so bitter for
So should I ask?
Are you home?

I can't keep anything down
All I hear is static buzz
And it's all echoing through my bedroom wall

[Verse 1]
Do you dream about the people that wrong you?
Do you see those faces again and again?
And what holy thing has come to possess you?
Or does it all just blend together in your head?

[Chorus]
And did things work out for you?
Or are you still not sure what that means?
And it's a hard trip to the kitchen sink
'Cause I can't wash this one clean, clean

[Verse 2]
Did you tell all of your friends?
Did you tell all of your friends?
Maybe I could understand
What is it about them?
Would they stick around?
What is it with them?
And would they stick around?

[Verse 3]
Up late for six nights in a row
Figures in the dark, oh they move so slow
Sleep with the lights on in the hall
And you'd leave the door open
It won't mean a thing at all

[Chorus]
And did things work out for you?
Or are you still not sure what that means?
And it's a hard trip to the kitchen sink
'Cause I can't wash this one clean

[Post-Chorus]
Did you tell all of your friends?
Did you tell all of your friends?
Maybe I could understand
What is it about them?
Would they stick around?
What is it with them?
And would they stick around?
Would they stick around?
Would they stick around?

[Outro]
It doesn't matter
They're up and they're down
And I'll bet
That they're at home
And I wouldn't worry
Who's happy alone
Even when it doesn't make sense

[Verse]
The blank pages of my diary
That I haven't touched since you left me
The closed blinds in my home
See no light of day
Dust gathers on my stereo
'Cause I can't bare to hear the radio
The piano sits in a shaded space
With a picture of your face

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (Saw a light in the sky)
But the sun will escape me (So why did I try?)
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (Saw a light in the sky)
But the sun will escape me (So why do I try?)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
From the thread to the needle, middle to end
When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend
The rain then sends dripping an acidic question
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes tightly shut
Looking through the rust and rot and dust
A spot of light floods the floor
And pours itself upon the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (Saw a light in the sky)
But the sun will escape me (So why did I try?)
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (Saw a light in the sky)
But the sun will escape me (So why do I try?)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forgive me
But the lies have piled up

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
And as the wheels go round and the sunset creeps
Past the street lamps, cars, chain-link, and concrete
A window then grows and catches the eye
Cries out a yellow light as it passes it by
A small black figure sits in front of a box
Inside a box of rock with the needles on top
Nothing stops in this land of the pain
The sane lose not knowing they were part of the game
And then the insides change, the box stays the same
The shame, shovel up the pieces of the pain
You can try to hide yourself in this world of pretend
But when the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (Saw a light in the sky)
But the sun will escape me (So why did I try?)
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (Saw a light in the sky)
But the sun will escape me (So why do I try?)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forgive me
But the lies have piled up

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Now I got you caught in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
Now I got you caught in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
Now I got you caught in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
Now I got you caught in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
(Are you afraid of the truth?) Now I got you got in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
(Afraid of the truth?) Now I got you got in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
(Are you afraid of the truth?) Now I got you got in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
(Afraid of the truth?) Now I got you got in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forgive me
But the lies have piled up

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forgive me
But the lies have piled up

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
I know this 1942, it got you so gone
Nah, this ain't a interview, ain't shit to prolong
She let me touchdown, I tell her go long

Come and get it, baby, do it with your hands off
You gon' get it like I put it in the hand-off
Get to shootin' in that pussy like a standoff

[Verse 1]
I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrows

[Chorus]
How can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

[Verse 2]
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow

[Chorus]
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
And how can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

[Bridge]
La la la la la la, la la la la
La la la la la la, la la la la

[Outro]
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

Da da da da
Da da da da, da da da da da, da

[Verse 1]
Never guess and never know
Losing everything you own
But just before you hit the red
Your best ideas hit your head

The ones you love will call you back
The regulars will treat you bad
A bolt of lightning from the blue
Now it’s really clear to you

[Chorus]
Things may not work out how you thought
Things may not work out how you thought
Maybe it is good, maybe it is bad
Either way the only truth we have, is
Things may not work out how you thought

[Verse 2]
Use a coin to scratch away
Your desperation on display
A different era starts to show
So different friends will come and go
The one you love will hurt you bad
But a stranger has your back
It’s sunny when it starts to snow
And that is when you really know

[Chorus]
Things may not work out how you thought
Things may not work out how you thought
Maybe it is good, maybe it is bad
Either way the only truth we have, is
Things may not work out how you thought

[Outro]
Things may not work out how you thought
(These are the rules)
This is brought to you by Alchemist
(That's right)
Mr. Porter
Umm...

And if it is with an urgency in your rush to emergency surgery
You cannot be burned in third-degree
(At all) At all
And if you're gonna murder me
It cannot be like you never heard of me
You gotta know it's you have to know me
(You can go to surgery for a burn but it just can't be third degree)
Yeah yeah you could go if it's
If it's a second-degree burn okay
You can be rushed to emergency surgery
But there can be no urgency
Absolutely not
No urgency
(If you want to be a pimp) you cannot have a limp

Yes you you know

You can be either or
You can be a pimp, and if you are a pimp and that's what you choose to do that's fine
It's all good, just do not have a limp
(Absolutely not)

You cannot be a mobster and eat lobster

If you are a mobster
Stay the fuck away from lobster

(And, and for anybody that want to start a war
And you want to drop a bomb
It cannot be on Vietnam
Vietnam's already over you can't drop bombs)
You cannot drop a bomb like Vietnam
(You cannot drop a bomb like anything. Fuck that. No more bomb dropping)
If it's gonna be a missile it cannot be a SCUD missile
It cannot be a SCUD missile
If you're gonna freestyle it cannot be 'til you're senile
So, you can freestyle that's fine, but do not do it until you're senile
Just before you're about to push to the point of senility
You cannot die hard
You cannot die hard like Bruce Willis
(Yes, yes)
No more no more
(Your poems can't be popular
They can't be popular
Can't be off of the dome)

No more off the top of the head
Off the top of the dome
Off the cerebellum
None of that shit
No more, no more
(Now if you're getting brains from a girl
There's no way you can become smarter from that
You cannot become smarter from brains
You can, like she gave me brains and I'm fucking genius? No. No)
If a girl gives you brain it cannot make you smarter
(You gotta be dumb as fuck)
You can get brain that's fine
Just do not come out of it a smarter person
(No, no)
Speaking of smarter person: knowledge and college
You are not allowed to, you can have knowledge
But it better not be from college
(You better be in high school)
(No, no)
You cannot manage to do damage
No more
No more manage to do damage
If you're gonna manage something it cannot be damage
Stay away from damage
(If you have, if you have
For anybody that's got one skill
Do not use it for any means, by any means to pay bills
Your skills cannot pay the bills)
If you have skills you cannot use them to pay the bills

(You think just because you're in the booth it's the fucking truth?
No! You can lie in the booth too)
From now on, lie in the booth
Because you cannot be in the booth to spit the truth to the young youth
No more
If you're in the booth you have to stay away from truth
(You can lie in the booth)
Yes you can have have a backpack
This is serious, this is serious
(Listen to this)
I don't care if you have a backpack in your first verse
You got three verses and you try to have a knapsack in the third verse?
(Uh uh. Absolutely not!)
No! You cannot have a backpack and a knapsack!
(Get the fuck outta here. Pick another song)
You pick one or the other
(Pick another song. Go to hell)
Pick a fucking fanny pack, I don't care
But you cannot have a backpack and knapsack
(What is wrong with you)

And if there's gonna be violence it cannot rhyme with silence
(No, no no)
In advance we're telling you that

(You know what ? I'm gonna just go out there and say this
No more jewelry temperature
I don't care how cold, what temperature degree your fucking jewelry
Jewelry doesn't have a temperature)
Yes no, it cannot be frozen below 400 million degrees
Like it just has to, if you're gonna-
It cannot be a temperature
(It's true. What if it's 90° outside and you got jewelry on? You fucking hot. Stop lying. You ain't cold 'cos you got jewelry. That's a lie. Stop lying to the people)

You cannot be on the level with the devil
You cannot -
(Party. You can't party, don't party with a lil Bacardi)

You're gonna be, if you're gonna be lyrical
You better not -
You better stay the fuck away from miracles
(That's it. No miracles)
(You just a regular mortal human you don't perform miracles if you lyrical)
No no no
No more love in the club

If I go in VIP they don't need to see ID, right
(No more come on )
(They know who you are if you're going to VIP they know your face, you paid for it)
If you're gonna get buried it cannot be in the cemetery
If you are in the cemetery you cannot be buried
No more
(Leave it alone)

And you can't, you cannot
If you go to jail you cannot make bail
If you're gonna have swagger
You cannot be like Mick Jagger
(You gotta be like Lou Ferigno or someone like that)
You can be like Mick Jagger but you... it's one or the other
You have to have one or the other
No more rhyming Mick Jagger with swagger, no
No more spectacular with vernacular
(You got to stay away from that one)

Why do you feel that you have to say that a pencil is a utensil
A pencil is a fucking utensil! Right or wrong?
It's already a utensil you don't have to make
(It's a double negative!)
Once you got the pencil you already have the utensil
The utensil is the pencil so you don't need to

You cannot use a vest to protect your chest
(Come up with some other shit
Come up with something else for it to protect. Get creative)
Maybe the vest protects your abdominals

(If someone's gonna murder you they obviously heard of you right? How do you...?)
I think we went we went over that but  I do think that is important to stress
Because if I murder you like I never heard of you
What is the difference?
Do I not feel as bad because I murdered you because I never heard of you?
(It's fucking stupid)
And if I did hear of you I might actually feel bad, it my weigh on my conscious or something?
(Royce: ...What kind of gratitude do you get from murdering a person you don't know anyway?...Yeah you wanna know...)
(You get no points. It makes no sense)

If you're gonna be near death it cannot be on your last breath
You cannot
You can't be on your last breath near death
But if you've got bodies it's not like John Gotti
You cannot have bodies like John Gotti
You cannot rhyme casket with basket, no more
Money, funny, honey, bunny, no more
(Static, attic, no, it's over)
If you like static, you cannot be an addict for it
(Moderation. Static in moderation. No addictions)
Moderation, static in moderation, static in moderation
(You cannot be addicted to static. Forget it. Those days are over)
You can't you can't
You can start static, if you start static just you cannot get addicted to it
If you become an addict for static, it's automatic
(Ooh you can't be automatic either. It has to be manual)
It cannot, yeah, yo
Manual and it cannot be -
The static has to be...
The static cannot be automatic

I think this is- I think this is good
(It's a good start)

(I think they'll be a better MC if they follow these rules)
Yes, this will make you
If you really want to be if you really want to be considered one of the greats
(Mmm-hmm)
You can't do any of this shit
And if you're gonna keep it real, you cannot pack the steel
You can pack the steel but you probably shouldn't keep it real
Keep it fake
(Royce: Be a fake ass motherfucker)
Yep be fake with the steel or be real without the steel
You cannot keep it real and pack the steel
You cannot rip shop in hip hop to the tip-top, you just can't
You can't
(Stay ground level stay ground level)
Ground level
If you're gonna make me drip drop cuz I flip flop
I cannot be in flip flops

If you're a new up-and-comer right in hip-hop and you don't understand the history of hip-hop, that these things have been rhymes way too many times by now, we're just giving you, you know what I'm saying, “The Don'ts”

Listen I'm telling you something, I'm trying to talk to you, I'm telling you something I'm telling you something young 'un. You're coming up in this game? These are the fucking rules, like it or not. You cannot say this shit, and if, (Facts! Big facts!) and if you come up missing it cannot be like Hoffa. No. No more missing like Hoffa. I think they found Hoffa anyways, didn't they? Yeah they found Hoffa. So you can't. No more missing like Hoffa

She was born in a handbag
Love left
On a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
'Cause nothing seems to make a dent
Going to find her some money, honey
Try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about
(Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Stay in) Stay in

First thing she learns is
She's a citizen
Some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
Someone rings a bell
And it's all over
She's going out of her way
Stealing for that one good rush
(Ah)

[Verse 1]
I've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Time will crawl
'Til the 21st century lose
I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon, and he—
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot and he—
He made him fly through a hole
'Til he grew real old, and he—
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

[Chorus 1]
Time will crawl
'Til our mouths run dry
Time will crawl
'Til our feet grow small
Time will crawl
'Til our tails fall off
Time will crawl
'Til the 21st century lose

[Verse 2]
I saw a black, black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm, warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

[Chorus 2]
Time will crawl
Time will crawl
Time will crawl
'Til the 21st century lose
(Go!)

[Interlude]
Time will crawl
Time will crawl

[Verse 3]
You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask went off
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep
Time

[Chorus 1]
Time will crawl
And our heads bowed down
Time will crawl
And our eyes fall out
Time will crawl
And the streets run red
Time will crawl
'Til the 21st century lose

[Chorus 1]
Time will crawl
And our mouths run dry
Time will crawl
And our feet grow small
Time will crawl
And our tails fall off
Time will crawl
'Til the 21st century lose

[Chorus 1]
Time will crawl
And our heads bowed down
Time will crawl
And our eyes fall out
Time will crawl
And the streets run red
Time will crawl
'Til the 21st century lose

[Chorus 1]
Time will crawl
For the crazy child
Time will crawl
We'll give every life
Time will crawl
For the crackpot notion
'Til the 21st century lose

[Chorus 1]
Time will crawl
La la la la la la la
Time will crawl
La la la la la la
Time will crawl
'Til the 21st century lose

[Outro]
Time will crawl
Time will crawl

[Verse 1]
Photograph king, watches you go
Now, fashions may change, heaven knows
But you still leave a stain on me
Only to go
Colours may fade
Seasons may change, weather blows, but you still leave a mark on me
Wrong, negative fades, never the twain, reckless and tame

[Chorus 1]
I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
I'd like to beat on your drum
I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum
(I'd beat it; I beat it; can't beat it; I feel it)

[Verse 2]
Disco brat, follow the pack
Watching you peel, heaven knows, prison can't hold all
This greedy intention
Only to go, picture you now
Music may change, hi-di-ho, keen to follow your nose
Wrong love out of tune
Sweet is the night
Bright light destroys me

[Chorus 1]
I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
I'd like to beat on your drum
I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum
(I'd beat it; I beat it; I beat it; I beat it)

[Chorus 2]
I'd like to beat on your drum (oh, yeah)
I'd like to beat on your drum (ah)
I like your face in the crowd
I'd like to beat on your drum
(I'd beat it; I beat it; you beat it; I beat it)

[Interlude]
Can't beat it
Can't beat it
I beat it
Ah yeah

[Chorus 2]
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to yell it out loud
I'd like to beat on your drum
(Can't beat it; can't beat it; I beat it; I beat it)

[Outro]
Can't beat it
I beat it
Beat it out loud
Beat it out of the crowd
Beat it
Beat it
Beat it
Beat it

[Verse 1]
When I believed in nothing
I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint
In some place
I called her name
And though my days are slipping by
And nights so cruel
I thought I'd die

[Prec-Chorus]
She danced her little dance 'til it made me cry
She was shaking like this honey doing that

[Verse 2]
When I needed soul revival
I called your name
When I was falling to pieces
I screamed in pain
Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real
Swept over me

[Pre-Chorus]
You danced a little dance 'til it made me cry
She was shaking like this honey doing that

[Chorus]
Never let me down
She never let me down
Never let me down
She never let me down

[Verse 3]
When all your faith is failing, Call my name
When you've got nothing coming, Call my name
I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head
Until the bad stuff breaks

[Pre-Chorus]
Dance my little dance 'til it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that

[Chorus]
Never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

[Outro]
Oh no

[Intro]
Up until one century ago there lived
In the Zi Duang province of an eastern country
A glass-like spider
Having devoured its prey
It would drape the skeletons over its web
In weeks creating a macabre shrine of remains
Its web was also unique, in that it had many layers
Like floors in a building
At the top of this palace-like place
Assembled with almost apparent care
Were tiny, shining objects
Glass, beads, dewdrops
One could almost call it an altar
When the breeze blew through this construction
It produced sounds of wailing, crying
Tiny wails, tiny cries
The baby spiders would get scared
And search frantically for their mother
But the glass spider would have long gone
Having known that the babies
Would survive somehow on their own
Oh, the glass spider had blue eyes almost like a human's
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries

[Verse 1]
Don't you hear this wasted cry, life is over you
(Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
But you've seen who's in Heaven, is there anyone in Hell?
(Gone, gone, the waters all gone)
(Mommy come back 'cause it's dark now)
(Oh-hoho-oh)
(Oh-hoho-oh)

[Verse 2]
Take care, take care
(Mommy come back  'cause the water's all gone)
Somewhere she glows divine, somewhere she wakes alone
But you, you've promised in your loving eye
God it's dark now
(Mommy come back 'cause it's dark now)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)

[Verse 3]
Gone, Gone the water's all gone
(Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
Stay low on the ground
The fire can drive you, savage and afraid
Spitting the dawn, come along before the animals awake
(Gone, gone, the water's all gone)
(Mommy come back 'cause it's dark now)
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left
If your mama don't love ya' then the riverbed might
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
(Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)

[Bridge]
Gone gone the water's all gone
Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Gone gone the water's all gone
Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Gone gone the water's all gone
Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone

[Outro]
Mommy come back 'cause it's dark now
(Oh-hoho-oh)
(Oh-hoho-oh)
Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
Mommy come back 'cause it's dark now
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
Mommy come back 'cause the water's all gone
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
(Ja ja ja ja ja)
Mommy come back 'cause it's dark now
(Oh-hoho-oh)
(Oh-hoho-oh)
Mommy come back 'cause it's dark now

[Verse 1]
Eddie boy lit like paraffin
Spending two weeks
In a crack house
Burns on his brain
Like Chernobyl
Dean was seen
With a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed
Someone for pray for
'Til I met you

[Pre-Chorus]
Life is like a broken arrow
Memory a swinging door
I could be your great misfortune
I can make you happy
Every day of your life

[Chorus]
Making my love
Like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far

[Verse 2]
Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice
Because love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice
I've touched down with vermin
Cowardice, lice
And I say
Nobody cares what you do
Please be yourself to death
I could be your great misfortune
But you'll never find a, bet you'll never find a better man

[Chorus]
Making my love
Like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far

[Verse 3, Laurie Anderson]
Peter met Frank
Formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads out of shape for the name of Trotsky, Sinn-Fein, Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover this page
With debts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs
Threw it all away
Another life in the grave (a life in the grave)

[Pre-Chorus]
Life is like a broken arrow
Memory a swinging door
I could be your great misfortune
Well, I could make you happy
Every single day of your life

[Chorus]
Making my love
Like a shining star
Like a shining star
If that's what you are
Like a shining star (oh)
Making my love (making my love)
Like a shining star (like a shining star)
Taking my love (taking my love)
Just a touch too far (just a touch to far)
Making my love (making my making my making my love)
Like a shining star (like a shining star)
Taking my love (making my love)
Just a touch too far (just a touch to, uh, far)
Making my love (making my love)
Like a shining star (huh, like a shining star)
Taking my love (taking my love)
Just a touch too far (touch to far)
Making my love (mmm)
Like a shining star (mmhmm)
Taking my love (mmhmm)
Just a touch too far (mmhmm)
Making my love (mmm)
Like a shining star (mmhmm)
Taking my love (mmhmm)
Just a touch too far

[Intro]
Here it is

[Verse 1]
Do you see that thing (that thing)
I'm sure it's love (it's love)
Would you do one thing
New York's in love
The city grew wings
In the back of the night
The clouds are stuck
Like candy-floss
She sees the rich trash
Having all the fun
Makes her wonder where they get the energy from
There's nothing you can do to her
This city's all clean and waiting
I don't mean to wait too long
But this joint can't get much higher

[Chorus]
New York's in love
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New York's in flames
New York's in love
With the way she talks (t-t-talks, t-t-talks)
And the way she walks
New York's in love
Goo goo goo goo goo goo

[Verse 2]
My, oh my, it's a tom-tom beat
No-one knows they've had their day
We can dance and we can see the singles swing
Everybody's waiting for the Go-Go Boys
You're turned to stone by the family
It's now the dead speak to the living
Nothing left here
But a raging blaze
I don't mean to wait too long

[Chorus]
New York's in love
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New York's in flames
New York's in love
With the way she talks
And the way she walks (walk that walk)
New York's in love
Goo goo goo goo goo goo

[Outro]
Pretty as a picture
New York, New York
Ugly on each side
New York's in love
New York's in love
New York's in flames
New York's in love
New York, New York

[Verse 1]
It's just a one dollar secret
A lover's secrets in the UK
Torn apart in the UK
In the dribble of May-Day
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
And there's nothing inside
And there's nothing in mind (no)
And only you
Rocket on through the sky

[Chorus]
Well, it couldn't be done
Without dogs
It couldn't be once
Without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry

[Verse 3]
When the days were the days were the days boys
When blue ties
Were for the biggy guys
Frannie dressing down for the enemy
You saw him hanging on the enemy
And there's no one in love
And there's nowhere to scream
And only you
Race on to wonder where

[Chorus]
Well, it couldn't be done
Without dogs
It couldn't be once
Without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry

[Verse 4]
You can't make love with money
You can't make mistakes with babies
Nothing looked good on you
That's how I liked you best
Now you're ready for the real McCoy
Deep in the heart of Cupid
Murders on the heels of love
Just the ghost of a story
Just a one dollar secret
Baby these were the sounds
Baby these were the sounds (yeah)
And only you
Whisper these things aren't true

[Chorus]
Well, it couldn't be done
Without dogs
Well, it couldn't be once
Without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry

[Outro]
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry (cry, cry)
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry (cry, cry)

'87 and Cry (cry, cry, cry, cry)
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry (cry, cry, cry, cry)

'87 and Cry (cry, cry, cry, cry)
'87 and Cry

Hey
Hey

Young girls they know what they're after
Young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Rockets shooting up into space
Buildings they rise to the skies

[Chorus]
Bang bang, I got mine
Bang bang, reach for the sky

[Verse 2]
I keep a good friend on videotape
He'll drive his sports car until it's too late
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonight
'Cause love is my bet and it's the best yet

[Chorus]
Bang bang, I got mine
Bang bang, sun don't shine

[Chorus]
Bang bang, you are angels
Bang bang, now, you all oughta' be in pictures

Bang bang, I got mine
Bang bang, and you are next in line

[Chorus]
Bang bang, reach for the sky

Whatever movie setting you choose
Just, just try to do better
And don't let them stretch you too thin, new leather, yuh

[Bridge]
I tip-tip-tip-tip toe in this bitch

Incredible with commas I, make ya stretch like Violet mama in
I go Dash and handmade ones the, neck Frozone like papa's partner, nigga

[Outro]
Runnin' in that bitch
At the bottom of the bitch
Had the doubles in the bitch
Double O, double O, double T
I was in a meeting, fucking with me
I ain't say nothing this off top of the dome
Shoutout Carti

[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
There's somethin' 'bout the way you pick your (cherry bomb) cherries, cherries
You blow me away

[instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Drowning in all the work that I don't want to do
I know how to run, but don't know how to think things through
Running out of time, every day is like the last
I don't do shit and I wonder why it's going so fast

[Bridge]
And it feels like I'm tumbling down
All the things I love has hit the ground
And the shapes I thought I'd never see
Seem to be running around me

[Chorus]
And it feels like I'm tumbling down
And it feels like I'm tumbling down
All the things I love is tumbling down
Everything I know is tumbling down
All the things I know are tumbling down
Everything I know is tumbling down
All the things I know are tumbling down

[instrumental]

[Verse 2]
I don't need your love. I've just gotta get through the day
While you check the time, I will think of something to say
I don't need your drugs, I've just gotta get through the night
I get distracted by the night lights, tryna figure out my life

[Bridge]
And it feels like I'm tumbling down
All the things I love has hit the ground
And the shapes I thought I'd never see
Seem to be running around me

[Chorus]
And it feels like I'm tumbling down
And it feels like I'm tumbling down
All the things I love is tumbling down
Everything I know is tumbling down
All the things I know are tumbling down
Everything I know is tumbling down
All the things I know are tumbling down

[Intro]
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, yay!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Kiss the shoulder, hop in the Corolla
These bitches talkin' shit like the bottom of porta-potties
Bright ass yellow teeth, you a shit talker, gossip
Legs movin' like a salsa dancer
Drunk, fallin' out ya car like a flaccid dick
Aww man, god damn, what the fuck wrong with ya?
Say it to my face, pussy ass boy
Need a Altoid for your hot breath, life a hot mess
Pop your biceps, cue the roid rage

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I think I got like five more albums inside my mind
This that shit, that do or die, make your grandmama cry
Keep some baggy jeans on me, keep a Billie Jean on me
Got that New Orleans on me, smellin' like a queen to ya

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Cu—cu—cucumber lemonade, I need something fresh today
Barber make the texture fade, actin' out like it's charades
Strawberry sweater fleece, baby, give me something sweet
We don't gotta be discreet, moonwalking between the seats

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
Hit on that beat and then stop (Ahh!)
Hop on that booty like who the hell cutie

My momma ain't raise no bitch ass
Ain't no kiss ass, ain't no—

[Burp]
Get the fuck out of my way now
You are so far off my level
Stop!

[Verse 5: Kevin Abstract & Dom McLennon]
In the barber shop with my niggas, ay

[Verse 6: Dom McLennon]
Uh, lordy lordy, testify, yeah

Made a deal with Father Time, yeah
Told me "Find a way to shine," yeah
"I can make you live forever
All you gotta do is dance until you die," yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop talking shit and give us more, more
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit

[Outro]
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, yay!
Whether he gets tired of holding your hand
Leave you down, cause he knows he can
I'll be right here if you want to come home
Bring you close cause I know you're alone

If he doesn't know what he has when he's with you
If only my love was something you knew
If he can't give you all that you need
Drop all the baggage, come running to me

And come home

Late nights alone I start losing my mind
Thinking about how you've been wasting your time
So, I sit here wishing for tables to turn
Wishing that one of these days you will learn

Please come home
Please come home
I've been told this takes time
It's something I don't get, but it's something on my mind
Ooh

And we can dance if we want
I'm good at forgetting 'bout whats going on
Ooh

But I always cared for you
Fall on both knees, too
Let me tell you something true
Can't make it off but these things never do, aye

Oh, I'll never be fooled
Even though now I want to
Don't you know it's true?
Roll out the punches, never through

And she said
Don't you worry 'bout me
You know I'm on my own team
And I can find another you
One that loves me more, too
I don't need to play games
I sense the brother doesn't feel that way
Ooh
Self control I don't like
But if you hold me, I always hold you back
Ooh

But I always cared for you
Fall on both knees, too
Let me tell you something true
Can't make it off but these things never do, aye

Oh, I'll never be fooled
Even though now I want to
Don't you know it's true?
Roll out the punches, never through

And she said
Don't you worry 'bout me
You know I'm on my own team
And I can find another you
One that loves me more, too

Oh I never, oh I never
Oh I never, ever put you down
Oh I never, oh I never
Oh I never, ever put you down
Tattoo, so vivid
Sunlight, oh, i's living
In time, i can get over
What happened, oh, last summer

Don't need you
Oh yes, i'm fine, too
No, I don't need you
Yes, I'm fine, too

I feel summer caving in
I just can't hold it back in
Up on the rooftop balcony
I came to just relax and
Pass time, bout a year ago
I thought id never see her
Another year under my belt
This time, and i don't need-

Remember what you're saying
You're giving, I'm just taking
I know, you're out in town, fishing
One bit, yet i'm living, yeah
Need you
Oh, yes, im fine, too
No, I don't need you
And still, im fine too

I feel summer caving in
I just can't hold it back in
Up on the rooftop balcony
I came to just relax
This time bout a year ago
I thought'd never see me
Another year under my belt
This time I'm not lonely

I know that you can't find me
Sometimes you can't find you
I know that you can't find me
Sometimes you can't find you
Cause you're there, I'll be over here
Don't know how to call you, so, I disappear
I probably can give you what you want
I'm just too withdrawn, don't know how to be confident

You know that my heart beats strong, don't forget it
Watching it close to come, don't sweat it
I know if I take that chance, I'll regret it
Anything than this

Cause you're there, I'll be over here
Don't know how to call you, so, I disappear
I feel myself dive into you
I know that somethings gotta give soon

My heart beats strong, don't forget it
Watching it close to come, don't sweat it
I know if I take that chance, I'll regret it, yeah
Anything than this

Let me tell you now
Let me tell you now
Let me tell you now
Anabell, youre the only one for me
Anabell, youre the only one to me
Came to think, maybe its not you its me

Anabell
Anabell, 

[?]

Anabell, youre the only one for me
Oh, Anabell, youre the only one to me

I can tell, everyone loves you, not me
Oh, Anabell

Oh Anabell, 

[?]
Anabell

Anabell, 

[?]
I feel you
Know that you're feeling me, too
I think of you
Know that you're thinking of me too

And now I'm home
And I'm so alone
I'm alone, it's not known
But I'm not that strong

Ooh
I see you
Losing your mind
And I am too
I think of you
Know that you're thinking of me too

And you in your home
And I'm so alone
I know it's not known
But I'm not that strong

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
I sold that dope in the dormitory
I know my roommate informing on me
I told my momma she shouldn't worry
Stop taking student loans from the country
I will pay that shit off 'til I'm forty ('til I'm forty!)
I don't want to have to make McFlurries
Sellin' students single sacks got boring
My college kids facing keys like both quarters
My thug life to every lad sandstormin'
Set up shop, exhibit product like it's a car show
The shit is pure man, while he sell the Sweet'n Low
Catchin' hell in my BM convertible
Deep Dallas in the winter, place so hard
Put that gold jump rope on the floor

[Chorus (Reversed): Merlyn Wood]
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
F—fuck with the cops, they beating the cases
I see the pistol 'round waist and they aiming
White doesn't fly with carnations, they pain me
Family need a little sleep and serenity
Popping cherry cola like her virginity
Confidence sink on the brink of a better me
I keep an eye up on your bitch in bed with me
Knowing that you will just bet on the death for me
I got the fragrance, throw me the cologne
Sipping so long, they love your cologne
Fuck the percentages, I want the leverage
I want the leverage
I be reserved, I do not blurt
Keep out my face with your petty little urge
Life like a blur, learn 'bout the curves
Skin and my body, I've been insecure

[Chorus (Reversed): Merlyn Wood & Kevin Abstract]
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Joba]
Yeah (yow, yow, yow, yow)

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I am from another dimension
Better step to me with nine hitmen
Freeway Ricky I'm a line kingpin
This present moment's a divine vision
Saw my past and took a dive to dig in
Couldn't make myself a pot to piss in
Motivation lacking my decisions
This felt like a holy intervention
I put that pack in my undergarments
Them boys had locked the pharma department
Packing up pills at the base apartment
I did a taste and thought it was garbage
Never had figured to ask who grabbed it
Noticed my friends had developed habits
Men and women both reduced to savage
Just to satisfy what needed scratching
MDMA mixed with bad karma
Spliffs from Newport's rolled with marijuana
Someone broke and sold the plug
Sent the law to his moms to put a slug on 'em
Boys woke him with the straps out
They ain't know about the stash house
Couple decades got evaded
'Cause he moved the last piece before he passed out

[Bridge (Reversed): Kevin Abstract]
Self, hurtin', hurtin' my
And I got diamonds that's hurtin', hurtin'
I light the spliff and I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my, hurtin'
And I got diamonds that's hurtin', hurtin'
I light the spliff and I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself

[Outro: Joba & Kevin Abstract]
I keep dancing dancing
I keep dancing dancing
I keep dancing dancing (yow, yow, yow, yow)
Dancing, dancing, dancing

[Chorus: bearface]
(Freak ah, ah) Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me now that you're free (Free, free)
Oh yeah (Yeah)
Won't you come this close to me, baby?
Baby, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 1: bearface]
Taking time, faking mine
Let your hair lay on this side
Bless your mind, baby it's over and done (yeah, yeah yeah)
'Cause I know the way to make-
You know I hate to lie
But you are, you are, you are baby
But you gotta be free

[Chorus: bearface]
(Freak ah, ah) Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me now that you're free (Free, free)
Oh yeah (Yeah)
Won't you come this close to me, baby?
Baby, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 2: bearface]
Over eighteen with the windows fogged
Her brown skin with our fingers locked
Feel the air like it's sunny out
But I don't want you to go girl cause I'm tired of the waiting
Tired of waiting (ay, ay, yeah)
Tired of waiting, but you gotta be free

[Chorus: bearface]
(Freak ah, ah) Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me now that you're free (Free, free)
Oh yeah (Yeah)
Won't you come this close to me, baby?
Baby, yeah (Yeah)

[Intro - guitars]

[Chorus]
Well have you ever lived down in the ghetto?
Have you ever felt that cold wind blow?
Well if you don't know what I mean
Won't' you stand up and scream?
Cause there are things going on that you don't know
-let it roll

[Solo]

[Verse 1]
Too many lives they've spent across the ocean
Too much money they've spent upon the moon
Well until they make it right
I hope they never sleep at night
They better make some changes and do it soon – do it now – do it good

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Well they're gonna ruin the air that we breathe
Lord have mercy
They're gonna ruin us all, by and by
I'm telling all you beware
I don't think they really care
I think they just sit up there
And just get high

[Piano solo before last Chorus]

[Chorus]
Well have you ever lived down in that ghetto?
Have you ever felt that cold wind blow?
Well if you don't know what I mean
Won't' you stand up and scream?
Cause there are things going on that you don't know
Well if you don't know what I mean
Won't you stand up and scream?
Cause there are things going on you don't know

-tell it
-tell it, tell it

[Solo]

[Intro Sample: Interviewer and Princess Diana]
"What effect did the depression have on your marriage?"
"Well, it gave everybody a wonderful new label, 'Diana's unstable and Diana's mentally imbalanced', and unfortunately, that seems to have stuck on over the years."
"Are you saying that label stuck within your marriage?"
"I think people used it. And it stuck."
"According to press reports, it was suggested that it was around this time things became so difficult, that you actually tried to injure yourself. Is that true?"
"Mhm. When no one's listening to you, or you feel like no one's listening to you, all sorts of things start to happen . For instance, you have so much pain inside yourself, that you try and hurt yourself on the outside, because you want help, but it's the wrong help you're asking for. People see it as crying wolf or attention seeking, and they think because you're in the media all the time, you've got enough attention, inverted commas, but I was actually crying because I wanted to get better."

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood, Matt Champion, & Dom McLennon]
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, now
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me now, give it to me now, now, now
Give it to me now, give it to me now, now, now
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, now, now
Give it to me now, now, now
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract & Merlyn Wood]
Sometimes I be mad that I ain't sexy
Sometimes I be shy to show my blessings
Poppin' like a carbonated beverage
The cops poppin' niggas Orville Redenbacher
Ian, you sexy!

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Most times I give friends more time than family
You remember when I used to feel like I don't understand me
Now we speakin' the same language
I don't listen like I can be
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Sometimes I feel like I'm way too sexy
Most the singers found me in the desert
Minimi-, minimi-
Handle my business, don't talk to me directly
No one above me actin' like they all so lovely
Recogni-, Recogni-
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Heels switchin', finger clicking
Kick on me like I’m James Bond on a role
They want the boot of my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
You need a neutral career
Look what we did in a year
Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 4: Joba]
Oh, I'm lonesome, and hopeless
But hopeful, but hopeful
What's a boy to do lost in the world trying to find a balance
Sippin' out his chalice with its jewels dancing
Fluid like the potion
That pours when I get down some
Just trying to find a port in the sky where
The sun can shine down some
Jesus is lord, I put that on god
What more do you want from me?
He's in the dark, he's just a child
They turned their backs on me
Nevermind what it was
I see enemies
Don't want what's best for me
Best believe

[Bridge: Joba]
I'm lonesome
But hopeful, But hopeful
I'm lonesome
But hopeful, But hopeful

[Verse 5: Kevin Abstract]
'Times, it be so spot on it hurts
Like when auntie couldn't decide between going to work or church
I been in my feelings on that island in the dirt
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
I said I tried vacation, I tried to run away
I deleted Facebook, I'd trade fame any day
For a quiet texas place, and a BBQ plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for ya

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
Is that good for ya?

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Give it to me, Give it to me
Give it to me now, Give it to me now
Give it to me now, now
Give it to me now, Give it to me now, now, now

[What is roughly known of the song so far, as of 10/20/18]

[Verse 1]
Over fires rising, there's thunder up above
Giving good or giving bad I will give you love
See the darkness rising, over many hills
Take me back to older days I will love you still

Fires in disguises, old in any ways
Different shapes and sizes bringing back the days
Older than the new ones older than the floor
See the distant fire rising from the ground, oh

[Chorus]
Oh the light oh the light the light light, yeah
Oh the light oh yeah oh the light

[Verse 2]
Overly kills are made door leads small

How the candid forces won I'm the only one who would

[Chorus]
Oh the light oh the light the light light, yeah
Oh the light oh yeah oh the light

[Verse 1]
With the news, there's something every day
So many people thinking different ways, you say
Where is the music?
A tune to free the soul
A simple lyric, to unite us all, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
Your opinion only knows the one thing
That you seem to want to have most
And you chose
To save yourself in your own time you'll have to
Stay and open up your own mind

[Chorus]
And every glow in the twilight knows
That the world is only what the world is made of
Just you and me can agree to disagree
That the world is only what the world is made of

[Verse 2]
In all the noise facing every day
The colored world has turned into a grey, you say
And from the void, the place in which we came
Can we step back and see we want the same?
Oh Lord

[Pre-Chorus]
Your opinion only knows the one thing
That you seem to want to have most
And you chose
To save yourself in your own time you'll have to
Stay and open up your own mind (Hey)

[Chorus]
And every glow in the twilight knows
That the world is only what the world is made of
Just you and me can agree to disagree
That the world is only what the world is made of

[Chorus: Choir]
And every glow in the twilight knows
That the world is only what the world is made of
Just you and me can agree to disagree
That the world is only what the world is made of

And every glow in the twilight knows
That the world is only what the world is made of
Just you and me can agree to disagree
That the world is only what the world is made of

And every glow in the twilight knows
That the world is only what the world is made of
Just you and me can agree to disagree
That the world is only what the world is made of
I’m focused on lies, all through the skies
Couldn’t even imagine, this is one hell of a high
Pressure is on, all in my zone
No interruptions, I gotta turn off my phone, yeah
Normally I ain’t the type to do it
But I had to see what it’s like so I took a little bit to calm my nerves
Ended up dancing through the nights
Everything around me came to life
Music got loud, it’s only right
Kept on going, the sun was rising
Damn, done missed my fucking flight
I’m off to imagina, stayed a few days at a time, oh yeah
Feel like I’m loosing my-
Feel like I’m loosing my mind, oh yeah
Gotta regain control, gotta regain control
Before my mind explode
But I do not wanna turn back, can I stay right where I’m at

[Chorus]
Cause I love this feeling, oh yeah
I love this feeling
Different strokes for different folks (Different strokes)
Everybody got they own preference
All I wanted was some time, with you (Some time)
But you kept comparing me to, your ex dude
I don’t wanna go back to the man that I used to be
But you might make me, you might make me, yeah
So if you keep pushing me and I decide to go
Please don’t hate me, please don’t hate me, yeah
You know, it seems one sided
I can feel the breeze, and I like it

[Chorus]
We’re going different ways
We can’t go head to head, with each other
I know you tried to keep, that secret
Now you can’t hide it
We’re going different ways
You decide to go
You know that I will be here for a couple things, oh
And finally you decide to talk
But I can’t speak right now girl, I’ve been moving round town
I can’t say it’s a test, it’s only what you did
And I can’t even lie, it fuck me up a bit, oh yeah
But I can’t focus
I’m taking notes to your actions
You think I don’t know about your shit
I think that we missing that
Wanted to make sure you were straight but it wasn’t enough
Take you to the moon and back
I took your ass outer space but it wasn’t enough

[Intro:]
CashMoneyAP
Oh man it's the chronic don't even worry bout it
CashAP got the beat tied

[Chorus: 1]
I've been getting money like Monopoly
Run up on the come up with the bag like a prodigy
You know that I got control and every part is quality

Run up on the come up with the bag like a prodigy

[Verse: 1]
Yeah, yeah

Bring Me Back to life4x

[beat cut]
This ain’t what I pictured, it wasn’t my vision
I know one things for certain, no I don’t feel like I’m living
We used to be vivid? Seem to fade into distance
Not tryna seek for somebody back
But it’s a long road and I’m just out here walking
And there’s no way I’m pushing through the darkness
{Verse 1}
No one ever thought anyone could pull the wool over my eyes, yeah
But you're not just anyone, you're a master of disguise, oh yeah
I swear you put on one hell of a performance
You were just using me to get what you wanted
And I ain't see it coming, no, I couldn't see it coming

{Pre-Chorus}
'Cause you had me fooled (Oh)
Thinking that you were the one for me
Thinking that you were the one I need when I'm alone, huh

{Chorus}
I was just, I was just
Loving a stranger, loving a stranger
Loving, loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
Loving a stranger

{Verse 2}
Oh, I can't feel my heart, really this is how you do me?
I told you that I loved you, oh
And that's not something I say loosely
No, not often, yeah
And that's not something I say loosely
Ooh, ooh
No, oh, woah
{Pre-Chorus}
'Cause you had me fooled (Oh)
Thinking that you were the one for me
Thinking that you were the one I need when I'm alone, huh

{Chorus}
I was just, I was just
Loving a stranger, loving a stranger
Loving, loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
Loving a stranger

{Bridge}
Maybe it's karma, maybe it's bad luck, maybe it's all coincidence
Maybe I gave you confidence, maybe
I'll forgive you, already miss you
But right now, I ain't got time for that
Make you to hit the road, hope you comin' back
No, ooh
You crossed that line when you walked outside when I said goodbye, oh
Victim of your crimes, taking back what's mine, put your pride aside
Wish I could rewind, but I know that I can't take back time
I can't take back time, I can't take back time, so, woah

{Chorus}
I'm hoping that you learn how it feels to be loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
Loving, loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
Loving a stranger

[Outro]
Loving a stranger

[Interlude: Jeff Goldblum, Interviewer]
"—Stem from show business, uh, generally... I mean I have, I started out with many, many desires as far as, uh, as far as this business goes and uh... I so surpassed all of them that I, that I, that it-it's, uh, it's not as meaningful to me anymore. I really love the work itself. I've examined myself on several occasions: Why am I really doing this? Am I doing this because I want to be famous? And I think there was an element of that when I started out; I wanted to be a rainmaker."
"Well, we should talk about that one for a quick second. What does that mean?"
"It means, uh, I think I wasn't necessarily seeing as much or as, uh, apparently as I wanted to be when I was a kid. I had, I had a job, uh... at least in my own mind and that was to make my mother feel better. She was, uh, kind of, uh... very ill in many ways. And that, so it was to make her feel better. And I think ultimately I imitated my father. He was a very funny guy. But also, I felt some need—I, I don't if maybe they created it or I created it—but I had a need to make them feel like their life was worthwhile, that they did something special by the very fact that they bought me into the world. From a very young age, I wanted to convince them that I was a miracle... and then I wanted to convince the world that I was a miracle."

[Interlude: Kevin Abstract]
"Yo, yo, yo, this is Kevin Cinema. You're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio on Beats 1. Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bow! When I remember my first experience with a pool, you know? It was in Corpus Christi, I was visiting my sister. I'm telling you, I swear to God, It was either 1999 or 2000—1999, the only year that I remember... Seriously, I mean it. So, I'm standing, like, towards the edge of the pool. There's a bunch of people there, like my, my sister, my brother, I think my mom. It's a pool on this apartment complex in Corpus. I'm just looking at the water, like, I'm telling myself, like, "Jump in, I'll figure it out. I, I know I can swim..." So, as soon as I jump in, I panic and I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just 

[inhales deeply], it sounds like this 

[frantic water splashing] and I can hear people, I can hear people screaming outside. Like it just sounds muffled. They're like "Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh my god!" and I'm just going crazy underwater. Oh, my God, I'm probably about to die—Looking back, this is how I feel. Who knows what my young brain was actually thinking and, like, processing in that moment? Next thing I know, my brother comes into the pool 

[diving, splash noise] grabs me, pulls me out 

[chokingly exhales] and like I was scared of the water ever since then, I will never ever get back into the water. But then I learned how to swim. It was great. This is Kevin Cinema and that's one of my earliest memories with water."

[Interlude: Kevin Abstract, Merlyn Wood, Dom McLennon]
I got all my money saved, I'm with them boys my momma hate
That's fire
I take the time to celebrate, ah...
Ah, hah, ah, hah, I got all my money saved, I'm with them boys my momma hate. I take some time to celebrate, my hands to the sky
That's so good
I love that
What made you think of that?
It just felt right, coming after Dom's verse, yeah...

[Intro]
Too many, too many times wasted

[Verse: Dom McLennon]
Wait a minute where my dogs at?
Players who ain't scared of love's at?
What's the point of saying "Fall back?"
Reaper gon' come  and stall that
Karma comin' where your false at?
Let em stunt on us we floss back
I keep my treatment to the sky, let my friend fly
Feel like y'all don't notice how I peace of mind
I got a lot to say and much to think about
Shrugged the haters off my back now I'm relieved of doubt
Lookin' deep into the ocean tell me what emotions that you dream about
I just want devotion from the moments that I 

[?] when I'm screamin' now
I'm lookin' for a partner that I'll share my pain with where we gon' do the same shit

[Interlude: Merlyn Wood, Kevin Abstract]
"This is Merlyn. This is what the sunset feel like in Malibu."
"My uncle used to have the lake house. We would go there every summer. Every Fourth of July, right after the fireworks. Go fishing, go swimming, take the boat out, all that. Get the whole family together, man, it was the best. I'ma buy that house back one day."

[Interlude: Shawn Mendes]
Cosas que perdimos en el fuego
"Hey, what's up, it's Shawn Mendes and you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio."

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need a gun in my neighborhood
Back when I was, I was on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in my neighborhood
Now I wish a nigga would (now I wish a nigga would)
Now I wish a nigga would
I don't need a gun in my neighborhood
Back when I was, I was on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in my neighborhood
Now I wish a nigga would (now I wish a nigga would)
Now I wish a nigga would

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Probably gon' shoot me if they see me
Now I'm on your TV, looking for a genie
Told him I was genius, I don't do bleeding
I need another season, they ain't seeing what I'm seeing, no?
You might never wan' be me, no?
Even when my skin greasy, no?
McDonalds would've been the more fire option
The barely famous shit is getting really fucking toxic
I used to wanna be Ali, I tried to be a boxer
Until you told me I could sing just like Mariah
And started—right?

[Outro]
Ooooh—stop

Hey, this is Davy, with, uh, Davy's, uh-uh, Pool Cl—Pool Heater and Cleaner cool spots and I just wanted to throw a little ad out here.

But uh, yeah go get it. It's on the market. Right now, you can get it at your local Lowe's or your local Home Depot or your local Home Improvement, anything such.

[Verse 1]
At the best of times I'm lonely in my mind
But I can find something to show you
If you have got the time
Why would I rely on the things that I did right?
She said, "I gave you four years of my life"

[Chorus]
So, what about these feelings I've got?
We got it wrong and you said you'd had enough
What about these feelings I've got?
I couldn't be more in love

[Verse 2]
I could have been a great line
I could have been a sign
Or overstay my time
Say what's on your mind
Maybe I'll rely on all the things that made it right
Because I'd give you all the years of my life

[Chorus]
So, what about these feelings I've got?
We got it wrong and you said you'd had enough
But what about these feelings I've got?
I couldn't be more in love

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
And what about these feelings I've got?
We got it wrong and you said you'd had enough
But what about these feelings I've got?
I couldn't be more in love

[Intro]
There comes a time in a young man's life
He should settle down and find himself a wife
But I'm just fine 'cause I know that you are mine

[Verse 1]
I fight crime online sometimes
Then write rhymes I hide behind
And my switch, her wine, both crying
I'm fine if you are fine

[Verse 2]
Looking back on 2009
When people said that it was raining all the time
I see sunshine 'cause I know that you are mine

[Verse 3]
When you say that I'm wasting your time
Then I smile and tell you things will be fine
For some reason, I just can't say "I do"

[Outro]
There comes a time in a young man's life
He should settle down and find himself a wife
But I'm just fine 'cause I know you are mine

The boy been gone a few summers, too long for road runnin
Trunk full of old hundreds. Of course my old level was gory grow grubbin. Don’t tell me they don’t hunt us for sport
I chose substances
No cuddles, the bases is all covered. Niggas come in the door and smoke somethin. Choke up on the slugger for home run hitters
Nigga it’s on. Chest up his head tucked on the floor. We pressed up on the boy. No more bluff-in
Cold summers, don’t tussle with strangers
Some of those keep one in the chamber
Three spliffs had my wing tips clipped
I was stuck in a hanger. Nigga
Muffle my pen and muzzle my brain up
Really I’m just making sure my promise is kept
Chump confused if he know it’s the end
Kept the truth and I’m pounding my chest
See it through, keep a noose hangin off of my neck
You got the juice? Niggas corny as shit
We on the loose, niggas know what it is
We makin moves. You niggas corny as shit
We got the juice
There's no truth behind those eyes
And that autumn house
Is where I wanna be today

Easy, son, a girl can be forgotten
Still, that autumn house
Is calling me back to the bay

Should I run, or should I stall?
That autumn house, my autumn house

[Snippet]
So break out the frame you’re in
Find that adrenaline
Whatever advice you like
Just save me some tonight

[Interlude: Kevin Abstract]
"You know, I don't really remember the first time I got in that water, but I remember one time at my brother's birthday party. I jumped off the edge. I remember, as I was going through the air I looked to my right and everyone was doing GIFs and I just sunk to the bottom of that bitch, just sunk down. And I remember sitting on the bottom of the pool with my eyes open, knowing that I couldn't get up. Knowing that I couldn't swim up. And the craziest part is that I remember that but I don't remember how I got out. I'm still alive and, uh, yeah, man. Wear those floaties if you need 'em! Slow down when you get excited because, shit, you might just die."

[Interlude]
"Matt has been surfing since he was sixteen, and he taught me how to surf when I was in middle school I think... Maybe freshman year of high school, and we went out. I had my wetsuit on. I was so nervous, because I didn't wanna fall off. I didn't know if I could stand on the board and stay there. I had so much fun waxing the board, and like putting on the leash, and... I knew my dad was good at surfing, so I figured it must be in my genes. Until we went out, and we paddled out... I'd back out and be like "Oh, I'll be ready for the next wave, like okay I'm gonna stand on this one. I know I'm gonna stand on this one... And, I stand up on the wave."

[Interlude: Jaden Walker, Kevin Abstract]
"First experience with, like, a body of water would probably be when I went to the lake with my dad, he rode the Jeff Gordon jet ski that he got on eBay.
"What color was it?"
It was rainbow. Like, it looked just like Jeff Gordon's car. And it said "24." He met Jeff Gordon when he bought it. He loved it, so I rode on it with him in the Lake Havasu probably? Maybe it was in Arizona or something, I don't know, I don't remember. Um..."
"What'd the sky look like, was it bright? Was it sun out?"
"Yeah, the sun was definitely out."

[Interlude: Merlyn Wood]
"Hi, this is Merlyn Wood and you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio on Beats 1. I think I was about eight when my parents got me a fish tank and some of those fish with the see through skin, so you can see their skeleton. And I also had a blue fish... They're all dead now, um, and I buried them in the backyard. I mean if, if water kills fish, what chance do I got? What chance do I got? I mean, if water kills fish, what chance do I got?"

[Interlude: bearface]
"Hi, this is bearface and you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio, and uh... I'm waiting on, uh, pizza right now."

[Interlude: Jaden Smith]
You know, I really love pools, and I love water because it's really fun to be in water and be in pools... And I like to drink water, and um, I went to go see BROCKHAMPTON at their house in Beverly Hills and they had a pool and there was water inside of it. And we made a song, um, but yeah that's why I've just always loved pools and water."
"Hold on, hold on, hold on! Is that what I think it is? Is this what I think it is!? Is this new BROCKHAMPTON!? Oh, they about to play a new BROCKHAMPTON song!? I think we about to play a new BROCKHAMPTON song! Let's go!"

[Interlude: Kevin Doan]
"And then I had like, um, my mom and dad had, like, nail shops and I would, like, go to my mom's and she would have the pedicure chairs. I would sit in them sometimes and just fill them up and put my feet in the water like this and I would make sure it's really high and then like, sometimes, like McDonald's had, like, their happy meals and their toys. And I remember they had surfs up and I got, like, the penguins and stuff and they had, like, the surfboards and l would like, put them in the water and we'd play with them. The toys in the water. And like, I can't imagine, like, I guess adults, like going in to get their nails done would just, like see this kid playing with toys in the water. And this is Kevin Doan, you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio."

[Interlude: Jabari Manwa]
"My first experience with water could've been 2001. Father took me to the beach, taught me how to swim and... it didn't work. Beautiful memory though."
Lover Leaver Taker Believer

[Verse 1]
Oh my holy lord
Sets my soul on fire
Flames of love and sweet perfume
She’s my heart's desire
She’s an angel straight from hell
Draws me to the deep
In the darkness way below
It’s my heart she’ll keep
Thunder underground
Watch the castle fall
Sound of wind it takes the sky
And winter takes us all
Mountain high against the sky
Watches as we pray
Laughing out and smiling proud
This is where we lay

[Chorus]
Lover
Leaver
Taker
Believer

[Verse 2]
All night hellfire
Erase your memories
So he’ll fall to his knees
And watch the fire blaze
Satan plays his flute for him
The sound it burns his ears
Watch his eyes
His piece of mind
Slips and disappears

Rollin' and Tumblin'

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm rollin' and tumblin'
Cried the whole night long
Well, I'm rollin' and tumblin' baby
Cried the whole night long
Well, I woke up this morning
And I didn't know right from wrong
If the river was whiskey baby
And I was a diving duck
If the river was whiskey baby
And I was a diving duck
Well, I'd go down oh yeah
And I would never come up
I'd go down yeah
And I would never come up

[Verse 1]
You're a picture perfect page
Paper romance for a face
Yeah, I'm a lucky star
And my wish won't come true
I'm about to fall apart
Wish I held your rhinestone heart
But you would never open
You would never glow for me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're with another girl
I'm never getting out
You'll never gonna know
These secrets in my mouth
I never knew before
But now I realize
I blossom like the moon
When I fall through your eyes

[Chorus]
Ah, ah-ah, ah, magazine
Ah, ah-ah, ah, I can feel you baby
Ah, ah-ah, ah, next to me
In these magazines

[Verse 2]
Lost in a corner of my mind
You sit and tangle of my lines
I read a thousand stories
Your whisper never starts to fade
I can smile and stare right through
Only happiness for you
Alone I cry an ocean
Ink and poisons starts to stain

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I should've made my move
But it's too late to try
I lose myself to love
When I fall through your eyes

[Chorus]
Ah, ah-ah, ah, magazine
Ah, ah-ah, ah, I can feel you baby
Ah, ah-ah, ah, next to me
In these magazines

[Bridge]
Lines, space in your mind
You don't even know my heart is breaking
Ahh oh, ahh-ah-ah, oh

[Chorus]
Ah, ah-ah, ah, magazine
Ah, ah-ah, ah, I can feel you baby
Ah, ah-ah, ah, next to me
Ah, ah-ah, ah, can you see me?
Ah, ah-ah, ah, magazine
Ah, ah-ah, ah, I can feel you baby
Ah, ah-ah, ah, next to me
In these magazines
In these magazines

[Intro]
They're in soldier mode, they're in toy soldier mode right now
They can't move their hands off their sticks
'Cause they a bunch a' cowards

[Verse 1: Moses Sumney]
Watch them assemble
Looking for trouble
March in formation
March for our nation

[Refrain 1: Moses Sumney]
Now I don't care what I've been told
Hey, two, three, four, five, six
This police state is much too cold
Hey, two, three, four, five, six
Cut from crooked cloth and mold
Hey, two, three, four, five, six
This police state is much too old
Hey, two, three, four, five, six

[Chorus: Moses Sumney]
Puppets, erect
With batteries set
They charge for a while
And fall right into rank and file
When they forget
That we cut the checks
They get really riled
And fall right into rank and file
They fall right into rank and file
They fall right into rank and file
Fall right into rank and file
They fall right into rank and file
I paid you to arrest me?

[Verse 2: Moses Sumney]
Now watch how they tremble
Without credential
Orders they follow
Skin deep and hollow
Their governing master
To their hip is plastered
Say protect and serve us
But murder's not service

[Refrain 2: Moses Sumney]
Now I don't care what I've been told
Hey, two, three, four, five, six
To kill so quick is animal
Hey, two, three, four, five, six
Now I don't care what they might say
Hey, two, three, four, five, six
It's gon' come back around one day
Hey, two, three, four, five, six

[Chorus: Moses Sumney]
Puppets, erect
With batteries set
They charge for a while
And fall right into rank and file
When they forget
That we cut the checks
They get really riled
And fall right into rank and file
They fall right into rank and file
They fall right into rank and file
Fall right into rank and file
They fall right into rank and file
They fall right into rank and file
They fall right into rank and file
Fall right into rank and file
They fall right into rank and file

[Interlude]
Hey, two, three, four, five, six
Hey, two, three, four, five, six

Hey, two, three, four, five, six
Hey, two, three, four, five, six
Hey, two, three, four, five, six
That's too much power

[Verse 3: Moses Sumney]
If we make you nervous
What is your purpose?
Worship your trigger
And ignore the figures

[Outro: Moses Sumney]
You're tumblin' into rank and file, and
Crumblin' into rank and file, and
Stumblin' into rank and file, and
Mumblin' into rank and file
You're humblin' into rank and file, and
Fumblin' into rank and file
You're tremblin' into rank and file
And fall right into rank and file
She's been sneaking in my room these days
It's okay
Showers in the afternoon
She's been sneaking in my room these days
Back then
Covered in her gloomy afternoon

Come and keep me warm
In the heart of the storm
And then loves comes down
And turn those songs on love

She's been sneaking in my room these days
She's been sneaking in my room these days
Take my love away
Yes, take my love away

Oh, love lagoon

[?]
Oh, love lagoon

[?]

Wait, let's clean our slates
Yes wait, they've been erased

Oh, love lagoon

[?]
Oh, love lagoon

Straight drop records from that Bouldercrest Road
Fo' sho', fo' sho', fo' sho'

[Verse 1]
I blow my nose with money, bitch I keep snot on my knot
I keep my pistol cocked back and my fork in the pot
My money fallin' out my safe, when I open my lock
I bring a briefcase full of faces when I purchase them blocks
I still got 'dro for the low, amigos growing them crops
Convicted felons facing five 'cause they toting them Glocks
See, I be selling to them niggas who be selling them walls
I got employees working for me, like they punching the clock
You heard Gucci fucked your bitch, and you ain't even shocked
You told your buddy 'bout that shit, and he can't give you props
You told him, "Gucci Fucked my chick, and I loved her a lot"
And even though I filthy rich, I still don't pay for no cop
And that's fo' sho'

[Chorus]
We got that hydro going for the low-low

[Verse 2]
My scale is covered in snow, 'cause I be weighing the blow
I bought a whole one yesterday, I got a baby to go
Now you can catch at Glen' and we're chillin' and blowing the 'dro
Or in Sun Valley with my niggas tryna get out the door
And don't ask us 'bout no credit, bitch, you already know
We shot a junkie yesterday for tryna sell some soap
I caught a case at Texaco and I wasn't going to court
My P.O. put out a warrant 'cause I failed to report
You can call Gucci collect, but bitch, you can't call me fool
And if you try to rob me, bitch, I'm gonna cut off your throat
And if you try to stop my clique then black you gon' go
I'm tyin' concrete to your brain so your body won't float
And that's fo' sho'

[Chorus]
We got that hydro going for the low-low
Fo' sho', fo' sho', fo' sho'
We got that cocaine cookin' on the stove
Fo' sho', fo' sho', fo' sho'

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Orange suit, shower, shoes, jail house tattoos
I keep money on my book, I live the life of a crook
Ain't no sunshine nigga, i'm just doin' my time
When I touch down on the block i'm poppin' bottles of wine
Gucci Mane, i'm a motherfuckin' G
I'm looking out for twelve cus they looking out for me
And if I see them crackers then a nigga gotta skeet
Can't let them pussy boys play a nigga off the street
And plus a nigga gotta pack a fat gun, if he tote a crack bomb
Never caught a dope case? Don't try to catch one
First one to skeet on my feet be them air force ones
Running like a slave in them days of the hot sun
You gone get locked up, you froze up, they rolled up
Popped and got hit with that billy club, it's swole up
Mama mad as hell cus she gotta bail your tail out
Tired of the stress, so she put your stupid ass out
Back doing the same thing, selling crack cocaine
Police know your name, but you just won't lay low man
It's a dirty game when you slangin' them birdies
Got caught with a brick, and they hit the trick with 30
Probably gone do 10 but a dub on that paper man
Trappin' in Decatur better run from them haters man
You better run from them haters man
Better run  from them haters man

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
The police, DCPD the crime rate gone increase

[And if i'm rusty?]brave bring your Glock and leave your pepper spray
A paddy wagon full of yay, is you asking where I stay?
Getting paid off the money from a drug raid
Idolized by the innocent American youth
I'm with these billy clubs, big gats and them bulletproofs
That's why these cop killer bullets in my clip
I'm infiltrating your vest and drawing some smiley faces on your chest
9-1-1 in my community is a waste of time
They don't prevent the shit, but come when you commit the crime
Then put a flag on a casket when a pig drops?
What about my boy who got popped by that corrupt cop?
We got the right, to get our ass whopped on sight
Police man by day, a fucking Klans-man by night
I'm shooting birds at your ass standing on the corner
Fuck dodging 12, lil jits go waiting on em

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
There go 12 my nigga
You better bail my nigga
Can't be locked down in no motherfuckin' cell my nigga

Say cheese, the grill so bright, the picture can't be seen
The ice on my pinky, it got my pinky game green
These hoes on my dick, but bitch, please
No kissin or touchin, my whole clique stay clean
Say cheese, the grill so bright, the picture can't be seen
The Light hit me right, and now my trophys on gleam
You think I'm a trick, but bitch, please
No kissin or touchin, my whole clique stay clean

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Give me an average lookin' trick, I'll turn that bitch to the bomb
Have her in and out the nail shop and beauty salon
I'm breakin' bread by the loaf, I drop a pigeon some crumbs
Where we goin', sneaker wearing chickens can't even come
You a dime piece, so say cheese, let the world see your pretty teeth
Your main squeeze, you can keep him, I'm your plan B
Financial problems, you can call me
And we can ball, hit the mall, and it's all free
I have you south beach falling off a jet-ski
Or blowin' purple under shade from a palm tree
We in Biloxi eating free, sippin' Dom P
Go coast casino hopping gambling bettin' a hundred Gs
I play the crap table, you gone break the slot machine
Give me them digits, we can kick it like a soccer team
I'll make your wrist freeze, your fingers gang green
I have you shining like a chandelier with bright?

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Say cheese, the grill so bright, the picture can't be seen

[Verse 2: Miss Angel]
I'm a top notch Georgia peach, jet beauty of the week
Face of a model, with the curves of a Coke bottle
Yeah, you grilled out, by the mouth, and yo game tight
You can take me out, but you gotta have yo bank right
Money over bustas, a dime stacking Benjamins
Playboy I'm the hustler, just watch me put this pimpin' in
Can you pay my rent? buy the bar? get me iced out?
Purchase me a car, a credit card and a nice house?
I put this punany on you, make you kick yo wife out
Got daddy divorced and mommy when I cut the lights out
Figure eight shape, ain't no fries with the shake
For a bankroll, I might jump up out the cake
Break bread till the day your dead, if your're scared, say your're scared, but a closed mouth never get fed
Better stay down till you come up, grind till your knockin' numbers
If you see me in the club, come and tip a bitch a hundred

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Say cheese, the grill so bright, the picture can't be seen
The ice on my pinky, it got my pinky game green
These hoes on my dick, but bitch, please

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
We gettin' to the money now, we dead fresh, everyday, never bummy now
We pullin' up in bubbled up trucks, jumpin' out
We throwin' paper like a lil boy on a paper route
We iced out, iceberg down, knockin' round, streets from the cleaners
Iceberg sized stones, shining bright on our fingers
We choke it up like Venus and her sister Serena
Chickens act like they never seen a techno marina
We grilled out (grilled out!)
By the mouth (by the mouth!)
We goin' shine bright, even when them lights out
My whole clique big ball, go and buy big shit
Big rims, big stones, big bottles of Cris
Bitch picture this, the bracelets, the necklace, the crushed out faces, of the Rolexes
Zero to eighty six seconds in that new Lexus
Room services bringing me, and yo bitch breakfast

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Say cheese, the grill so bright, the picture can't be seen
The ice on my pinky, it got my pinky game green
These hoes on my dick, but bitch, please

We got the money, the hoes and the cars, and the gangsta lean

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I live my life on the go, another day, another ho
Another bitch on my team, another slut on a strole
My bags rollin, stay swolin, all my clothes stay creesed
But I never trust these bitches, farther than I can see

But a ghetto celebrety I was destand to be
Fuckin bitches in the ? the sweets and every damb every day of the week

And I don't fuck with no crisp, bitch, I pop bottles of wine

Get off the wall and join the party
Don't be afraid to shake your body
Get off the wall and join the party
Don't be afraid to shake your body

[Verse 1]
Is it the pill, the liquor, or the gold in my grill
That got you payin' attention to every word that I spill?
They wanna go outside, try to size my rims
Figure out my shoe size, then they buy my Timbs
I'm pimpin' in, gator boots, stretched fur with the brim
She gave her girlfriend the keys and said, "I'm leavin' with him"
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, I'm born and bread 

[?]
When I tell a chick to jump, she gon' say "How high?"

[Chorus]
Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane

Get off the wall and join the party
Don't be afraid to shake your body
Get off the wall and join the party
Don't be afraid to shake your body

[Verse 2]
If you're broke tryna get on your feat (Get on)
Or on your own, movin' thangs, puttin' 'cain on the street
It don't matter, nod your head to the beat (Nod your head)
'Cause if you feel it in your bones, you gon' get out your seat
I'm Gucci Mane and I stay so high
That you can catch a contact when I roll by
I'm Gucci Mane and I stay so fly
That I keep two or three dimes at all times
I got a bright time piece, big stones inside
Big thang down there, and I don't get tired
I hurt your girlfriend's back, and it hurt your pride
You want your girlfriend back, but your girlfriend's mine

[Chorus]
Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane
(G-U-C-C-I-M-A-N-E)
Gucci Mane, I'm Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane
Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane

Get off the wall and join the party
Don't be afraid to shake your body
Get off the wall and join the party
Don't be afraid to shake your body

[Verse 3]
I got that man up in my trunk, beatin' hard at the light
See my grill through my tint 'cause it's shining so bright
My braids kept, turn back with a fresh pair of Nikes
I swing them thugs to the left 'fore I turn to the right
I get it crunked when they give me the mic
So get drunk, pop a pill, player, do what you like
I'm still trapping every day, every night
They told me, "Stick to the rapping," so I took their advice
Fast money burn fast livin' this fast life
I pronounce it Gucci Mane, pimp, and don't ask twice
G-U- and you don't even have to say it
It ain't no cussin' so the radio got to play it

[Chorus]
Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane
(G-U-C-C-I-M-A-N-E)
Gucci Mane, I'm Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane

Pop that bubble cush, and put some on your toung
Now everything was great, until your bitch came in
Bout the same time that thang get lit
Her face ain't too pretty, but she got a nice body
I'm geeked up, thinkin of bussin her body
Go back to your trailer, cause you look like Joseph Jackson
I'm on three double stacks, and I'm lookin for that action
Gucci Mane, you stupid mane, I love the way you flowin
Riding in my drop, but I don't know where I'm going
On 2 85, I be ridin in the Serka
This side, I spend time drinking that purple
Gucci show time, in like 5 more minutes
I'm gonna cool on juice, cause I'm really really trippin
Went to the strip club, then requested I'm the man
The next thing you know, I was throwin rubber bands

[Hook: Macboney and Gucci Mane]

She always tellin me, she ain't ever sucked a dick
Never took a pill, or never ate a bitch
You a lier, but I ain't gon get upset right now
But I wish I had a lot of types of techs right now
You say your man a bitch, he might be
But I bet your husband ain't icey like me
Keep standing on BC, in my ash and black t
Got them dope man Nikes, and them Jordan jeans
Got paper, but I still keep that Threx on me
I'm the shit in East Atlanta, baby, ask about me
Pop 1, pop 2, 2 halves, that's 3
Ain't no Wafel House, baby, eat like KD
Gucci good like your hood, man, he's so street
Wearin doces in the club, cause you know the boy geeked
Drop the top on the thang, let you see my seets
We been rollin, rollin, rollin, and we ain't slept in weeks

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane LaFlare, nigga, get yo mind right
Order Krisp by the 12, like I'm kissin Bud Light
Sell cush by the bell, so you know my shit tight
7:30 in the morning, then an all night flight
I'm high like Fabo, hood like Shaudy
So tell me where to go, like my name E-40
A rich rockstar, nigga, I'm goin party
Got a party pack of pills, that's at least bout 40A bomb in your hand like like a pack of jellybeans
Take 4 these pills, call me in the morning

Candy painted cars on chroam

Atlanta niggas, we run for so long
Trap niggas got it goin on

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Ralph with the bidnis, trap boy easy
Pint like beasty, blazed like chearch bisket
Rhims like didgets
Offset 6s
Cartier lenses, 20,000 dollar bridges
Came to the club, me and 3 or 4 bitches
8 or 9 bitches, shaudy and shaudy sisters
But now I'm so loaded, the junkies think I'm kidding
Paint so wet, like the K stop spittin
Rims real big, like Jay-Z lips
When I hit the bar, bring 3 or 4 clips
3 or 4 chicks, bet you I hit
Spent 12 racks, Gucci Mane the bank man

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 2: Young Ralph]
I'm just a work dealer, I still play with work
Barney never round me, I still play with Perks
Stop verses, make calls whenever I ride in
Lamborghini doors up, just dive in
King sized place, still with bubble cush
And the seets in my car feel like a cushen
These niggas mad cause I took off
Bring myself up, and brushed that dirty look off
Yeah, I ball hard, and spend a lot of cheese
Young Ralph and Gucci Mane, that's a lot of cheese
Piss yello diamonds, they'll make you freeze
It's a weather change, bet my neck will make you sneeze

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

Me and my bad lil braud
Damb, ma, my stacks is tall

[Verse 3: Young Ralph and Gucci Mane]
Gucci rock the Gucci, Ralph rock the Luie
I can't even lie, the rimms get a lot of cucci
Ralph switched up with Gucci, and Gucci switched up with Prodda
Haters get ba-da, bitches get na-da

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
We leavin outside to kill m all
Me and my bad lil braud
Damb, ma, my stacks is tall

Gangstas don't plot, we just kill yo spot

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]

Imma hit m with the chopper, man
The only thing that can save his home is an avlanch

Niggas hating, but I'm still here
Won't hezitate to put a nigga in a wealchair
Or should I say a pie buss
I'm runnin deep on your street, with 9 gloccs
And they all got extended clips, pistol grip, pistol slip, you get pistol whipped
I make m take they clothes off, fuckin load the pistol, then shoot a nigga nose off
I'm in the hood, I never leave, bustin heads with Jody Breeze
I killa nigga on the spot, nigga

Goin fill your ass up with bullets from the Skriller
No questions asked, see, I'm goin blast you
Jack The Ripper, I'm a real nigga splitter
I specialise in sweepin up game with Breeze, nigga
Let my work sizzle, I let the dope cook up, nigga
Dropping is great, so this cake, I get it
Tryna be slick, I rob then shoot your face, my nigga
I'm blast your mother, for thinkin I ain't
Have your brain slide the wall, like some brand new paint
And ride off in some brand new wet, go check, you bet we ain't in nobody det
If you o me, Gucci or Jody, we goin collect

Dissrespect the flex, put them thangs right to your neck

[Verse 3: Jody Breeze]
I walk around without a bodyguard, cause you niggas is not as hard
As you say you was, if you was, you wouldn't have to have a bodyguard
45 in my belt, try me, hoe
They goin find your legs on land, but the rest of you, it goin float
Get pumped, I'm put the rest of you in the trunk
Don't mess with the pump, less you wanna get pumped
Make m have to go down, I ain't scared of a dump, nigga
Leave you in the forest, like your last name gump

With 2 or 3 rooggers, that's what we shootin, man
Hold up, nigga
Bitch, show nough, nigga
When I'm shootin, I'm aimin from your throat up, nigga
Cause you haters bout to make me put my glocc in yo face
Show you pussys what it's really like to ride the wave
So lean back, nigga, I mean that
Nigga, I squeeze back, trigger, cause I'm back, nigga
The bumper same color as the Indiana pacer, man
Redgy getting old, so I'm stikin with the purple, man
I'm the young thug that go up and down in here
If you rich, nigga, let me see you sign yourself

[Hook: Jody Breeze]
Once the glocc go pop, your body bout to pop, dog
Might as well, go head, give us what you got, dog
Run, you get shot and killed, fuck the cops
Gangstas don't plot, we just kill yo spot
Hard luck is the fortune of all woman kind
They're always controlled, they're always confined
Controlled by her parents until they are wives
Then they're slaves to their husbands the rest of their lives

I once knew a girl and her story is sad
She'd oft times been courted by the wagoner lad
He's courted her truly, by night and by day
Now his wagon's all loaded, he's pulling away

Your horses are hungry, go feed them some hay
Then sit down beside me for as long as you may
My horses ain't hungry, they won't eat your hay
So fare thee well darlin I'm pulling away

Your parents don't like me they say I'm too poor
They say I'm not worthy to enter your door
I work for a living, all my money's my own
And if they don't like me they can leave me alone
An earthly nourris sits and sings
And aye she sings, Hi lilly wean
And little ken I my bairn’s father
Far less the land where he dwells in

For he did step to her bedside
And a grumly guest I’m sure ‘t was he
Saying « Here am I, thy bairn’s father
Although I be not commonly

I am a man upon the land
I am a silkie in the sea
And when I’m far at far frae line
My home it is in Sule Skerry

And he did take a purse of gold
And he did place it upon her knee
Saying, give to me, my little young son
And take thee up thy nouris fee

And it shall come to pass on a fine summer’s day
When the sun shines brightly on every stone
That I shall take my little young son
And teach him how to swim the foam
And you shall marry a proud gunner
And a right fine gunner I’m sure he’ll be
And the very first shot that e’re he shoots
Will kill both my young son and me

[Verse]
I've been a God way before a synagogue
Liquor drops used to hit the spot like a cinderblock
This is not what you wanted, but this is what you got
You live with what you got
Elixir that I'm mixin' like I'm in the kitchen whippin' rock
I'm in the spot like the middle of a prison box
And you ain't nothin' to the planet but a little dot
Suddenly hit the water like the line that's on a fishin' rod
Simple thoughts got me itchin' like the chicken pox
Knitted socks, with fingers tryna scratch a lotto ticket off
When I made it, I was gettin' all the bitches off
See, I was faded, now I'm countin' up the minutes lost
I throw 'em back like opponents hit a homer
My mind, it holds explosion like a pose that's on a poster
I'm out the holster with it
I overdid it like the way the roller coaster spinnin'
Homie, that's inertia
I'm the moon to the sun, how I birth ya
Turn ya, back to ya old ways, reverse ya
Curse ya, witchcraft
You get nothin' but a whole lot of nothin'
With your mothafuckin' bitch ass
You simple as a whistle, never pick a side
Shit, you always in the middle, never down to ride
I was high like I'm born to fly
Never die, I'm immortalized, here before ya eyes
Lord of the flyest, I is your highness
And no diamond when the shine ultraviolet
You on your bullshit, I'm on assignment
And I be on it like a stylus on a PalmPilot
I'm God's finest work, this way beyond timeless
Copped the new presidential Rollie, keep the watch silent
'Cause everybody tickin' me off
I got the world with her legs open, lickin' the box, shit
She home wet, sweatin' me for phone sex
Don't stress, daddy'll be home soon
And assume I'm down low with the post moves
I come through and hit the hole like Jones-Drew, yeah
My old chick is old news
But add fuel to fire, what I won't do
So, I just kick it with the homies like I'm supposed to
And we go back like gold hoops
Well, this the cold feelin', bone chillin', borderline dope dealin'
I'm goin' up with no ceilin', shit
Out of body, got my soul swimmin'
And no different, good head keep my toes twitchin'
You know Larry been fishin' since he in the womb
This the scoop up the Big Dipper, you the little spoon
Went from invisible and minuscule
To invincible, dancin' with the Benes moves
I made a million and it killed me
My second million got me mothafuckin' filthy
You ain't nothin' 'til you die and come back to life iller
They haven't made a mo'fucker realer, Mr. Miller, yeah

You don't want a girl like me, I'm too crazy
But every other girl you meet is fugazi (okurrrt)
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call? Bardi, Cardi
Come and rev it up like a Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden?
I'm coming to you now doin' 20 over the limit
The red light, red light stop, stop (skrrt)
I don't play when it comes to my heart, let's get it though
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage

I need you right here 'cause every time you call
I play with this kitty like you play wit' your guitar (ah)

[Intro]
I'm scared of dying (Don't go)
Is that on fire?
Am I a liar? Ooh (I can't be quiet)
I'm scared of dying
No gun required, ooh
My skin is fire, it's so desired

[Verse 1]
Is that designer?
Is that on fire?
Am I a liar?
Oh, will this help me lay down?
My skin is fire, it's so desired
No gun required
Oh, will this help me lay down?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm scared of dying, it's fine
Oh, what's a fiver?
Being young in the city
Belief and saying something

[Chorus]
Would you please listen?
Would you please listen?
We can see what's missing
When you bleed, say so we know
Being young in the city
Belief and saying something
Would you please listen?
Would you please listen?
We can see what's missing
When you bleed, say so we know
Council, being listed
Man I kinda miss it, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm a designer, unite pariahs

Oh, will this help me lay down?
Kids don't want rifles, they want Supreme
No gun required
Oh, will this help me lay down?

[Pre-Chorus]
We're scared of dying, it's fine
What's a fiver?
Being young in the city
Belief and saying something

[Chorus]
Would you please listen?

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars (eeoow)

[Verse]
Don't pay no dentures
I make a deaf n***a listen
RIP Benjamin Franklin
Had to tuck in the chain to a danglin'
RP truth, I was never a saint
Then my bitch and buy her, I'ma bang it
I had built this bitch up from the ground

[?] and I claimed it
Yeah
I just poured some drank and I mixed it

[Chorus]
With percocets and a addie
Money callin' momma phone 3 or 4 o'clock in morning
She don't answer
I got my chain out o' safe deposit, it was cold as a attic, wooh
I was drinkin' on 

[?], wooh

[Verse]
Kill it, crocodile, put it on a purse like a leopard, wooh
White car, peanut butter seats like a sandwich, yeah
Take the beef, turn the shit to pieces like Manwich
Yeah, I was born this shit
Nick says
Away from hittin' licks
N***a, yeah
I was 

[?], on the Crips
N***a, yeah
I could make him punch you in your lips
Pussy ass n***a, yeah
I could make him punch you in your lips

[Chorus]
With percocets and a addie
Money callin' momma phone 3 or 4 o'clock in morning
She don't answer
I got my chain out o' safe deposit, it was cold as a attic, wooh
I was drinkin' on 

[?], wooh

[Intro]
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Verse 1]
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know
I let my father mold me

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Verse 2]
The deeper I go
All is fair in love she said
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Bridge]
Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Outro]
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
You've got to just let your body move to the music
You've got to just let your body go with the flow
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
I can't keep from falling in love with you
You know there's nothing better that I'd like to do

[Chorus]
I don't know you
And, you don't know me
And, you got the wrong one, one, yeah, yeah
You must have the wrong one, one, yeah, yeah
You must have the wrong one
(Picked the wrong bitch, wrong one, wrong queen, yeah, picked the wrong bitch, wrong one, wrong one hoe, picked the wrong bitch, wrong queen, wrong one hoe, you picked the wrong bitch, you picked the wrong bitch, yeah)

[Interlude]
“Man your best bet is to take the little bit that you're getting and sit your little ass down
Like calm down, before I humble you and you know like I know that I will humble you. So carry on.”
(Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2]
Carry on (Carry on, bitch)
Just carry on (Just carry on)
Get that derrier (Get that, get that)

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't wanna tempt me (You don't wanna tempt me)
Should keep a, chopper in my Bentley

[Chorus]

Chaz    TYM
Don't think we've had enough
We're all holed up
Yeah that's fine

Another one wouldn't hold that line
I gotta grow up
And get outside

Madeline
You're all orange-eyed

I can't hear; the TV's on
You sound all wrong
The picture's fine

But when I'm gone you're a different kind
I won't be long
I'm just outside

Madeline
You're all orange-eyed

[Intro: Beyoncé]
Baby
Baby

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

[Hook: Beyoncé]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & (Beyoncé)]
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B. (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to sting, stand back

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

[Hook: Beyoncé]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yes, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro
'Cause you gonna need help tryna study my, bounce
Flow, blow, what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
Thats a no-go my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s, like I'm from the H-
O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my- (OH!)

[Verse 4: Beyonce]
Seeing, things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin' past me almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it

[Hook: Beyoncé]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

[Instrumental Break]

[Hook: Beyoncé]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

[Hook]
Go, go, go, goooo
Go, go, go, goooo
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light

[Verse 1]
For some strange reason
You're done pleasin' me like it's okay, ooooohh
Like a perm that's been left too long (it's starts to burn)
The result is it just won't take,  ooooohh
(I can see)
Now it's all coming so clear to me now
(I can see)
Misinterpreted all my naiveness
Was just thinking if I had no you than I can't do
My stock just went up over 2 million

[Chorus]
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light

[Verse 2]
Some see me, say I should be trophied
Cause it gets no stronger
Ladies y'all know (yeah girl, ya'll know)
This pimp *ish gets no older
Is that a threat? (What's another threat?)
Yep! (that's another threat)
I'm immune, you can get no colder
You got the green light, you the king, right?
You holdin' up traffic, green means go!

[Hook]
Go, go, go, goooo
Go, go, go, goooo
Go, go, go, goooo
Go, go, red light, green light
(I said you're holdin' up traffic, green means go!)

[Chorus]
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light (green light, baby)
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light

[Bridge]
(Go, go, go, go)
Ain't no problem, you can go
I will find somebody else
(Go, go, go, go)
Go, go, go, goooo
Go, go, go, goooo

[Bridge]
I gave all I could give
My love, my heart
Now we're facing the end
From what you did from the start, my love

[Chorus]
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
(I said you're holdin' up traffic, green means go!)
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
In the heavens, stars are dancing
And the mounting moon is new
What a rare night for romancing
Mind if I make love to you?

Since the dear day of our meeting
I've wanted to tell you all I long to do
Dawn is nearing, time is fleeting
Mind if I make love to you?

If you'll let me, I'll endeavor
To persuade you I'm your party for two
And from then on you will never
Mind if I make love to you

Mind if I make love to you?

[Verse 1]
Green are the colour of the eyes of the man I love
He's hard to take and hot to touch
And green is the color of the sea in the early month
Of mid-July, te amo much

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You get so mad when I complain
You think I'm crazy but
I hear them talk they say my name
They're fucking tired of

[Chorus]
All these beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful people and god knows I've got them
She wants to die (la-la-lie)
And she should fucking try (lie-la-lie)

[Verse 2]
Red is the color of your mouth when you drink rum punch
You like July and yellow sun
And red are the color of your eyes when drink too much
You pack your place, you pack a punch

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You get so tired, tell me to stop
I'm ruining our love
When I walk by, I hear them talk
They're fucking tired of

Oh, oh, oh
She wants to die (la-la-lie)

[Outro]
All these beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful people and god knows I've got them
Beautiful people with beautiful problems (Oh, oh, oh)
Beautiful people with beautiful problems

I'm not giving my heart away, baby
Please don't give up
I'm sorry that I'm
Hard to love

[Verse 1]
You don't ever use your swimming pool
'Cause you're drowning in green bills
I don't care about the things you do
I just wanna love for real

[Pre-Chorus]
What's underneath is the key, quit your masquerading
If you wanna get it right
Show me the person behind all the money making
If you want me for life

[Chorus]
Keep your dollar signs
Don't need expensive things
Just give me your heart in my pocket
Heart in my pocket tonight
Please don't waste my time
Don't buy me diamond rings
Just give me your heart in my pocket
Heart in my pocket tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Give me your heart in my pocket
Give me your heart, heart
Give me your heart in my pocket
Give me your heart, heart

[Verse 2]
See you dripping in designer clothes
But now I wanna see some skin
So much ice up on your wrist you froze
Open up and let me in

[Pre-Chorus]
What's underneath is the key, quit your masquerading
If you wanna get it right
Show me the person behind all the money making
If you want me for life

[Chorus]
Keep your dollar signs
Don't need expensive things
Just give me your heart in my pocket
Heart in my pocket tonight
Please don't waste my time
Don't buy me diamond rings
Just give me your heart in my pocket
Heart in my pocket tonight

[Bridge]
Don't need Bentleys, chauffeur, sightseeing
New York vacay, five star lux dream
Just need your love, your kiss, your touch
You are my drug, let's go deep you make me pop

[Chorus]
Keep your dollar signs
Don't need expensive things
Just give me your heart in my pocket
Heart in my pocket tonight
Please don't waste my time
Don't buy me diamond rings
Just give me your heart in my pocket
Heart in my pocket tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Give me your heart in my pocket
Give me your heart, heart
Give me your heart in my pocket
Give me your heart, heart

[Hook]
Took my love and broke my heart
You let me down, I hate you now
I'm so (so) messed (messed) up (up)
From (from) what (what) you've (you've) done
You let me down, I hate you now, woah-oh

[Instrumental]

[Hook]
Took my love and broke my heart
You let me down, I hate you now
I'm so (so) messed (messed) up (up)
From (from) what (what) you've (you've) done
You let me down, I hate you now, woah-oh

[Instrumental]
Look how far the river took us
How far the river took my son
But the boats gone 'round the harbour
And I gotta know the sinner
And I wait

There's a boat goin down the road and sea
A tumble will begin
It's the world you're living in

The boat will sign the bottom
And I hit down the button
Oh, I can't describe the stage you put me in
Oh, yeah

And I'm so sorry
I've been known to hurry
And baby I hope that I'm sorry
Cause tonight

[Intro]
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, hold on, yeah
Yeah, okay, let me tell it
Okay, yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
All I wanted was respect
Just want to be accepted
Too focused on being perfect
And now that I reflect
I was blind and I shouldn't have listened to what you said
Now there's a disconnect between me and you
Now I'm true to myself and I make my own moves
I used to try and be cool, impress the kids at school
But I wasn't being true to my Goddamn roots
Hol' up

[Verse]
I speak from my heart, not my throat
Said no longer I'd be told
The person I am, still finding myself
I really don't need you to hold me back
No holding me back, no more discussions 'bout that
Boy, it's a wrap
Used to worry about so-called “friends”, but they'd never hit me back
Like damn, look at how far I've come
But I've only just begun
I tried to run from the person that I was
Goddamn, how I was so dumb
But I don't need your judgement
Was somebody I wasn't
But now I'm here to change that
And take over the country, oh man

[Chorus]
All I wanted was respect
Just want to be accepted
Too focused on being perfect
And now that I reflect
I was blind and I shouldn't have listened to what you said
Now there's a disconnect between me and you
Now I'm true to myself and I make my own moves
I used to try and be cool, impress the kids at school
But I wasn't being true to my Goddamn roots
Hol' up (Hol' up)

[Verse 1]
It's always the same, found the pain after midnight
Fucking, then we fight, make a mark 'til it feels right
Then you self-destruct, and you tell me it's my fault, yeah (mm)
I already know all the words to this phone call

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we were always back and forth, and 'round again
All the bitter cycles, no they never end
Every time you thought that we could still be friends
You fuck it up

[Chorus]
Maybe in the next life
Maybe I would think twice
Maybe I would take my pride and walk out the door
Maybe in the next life
There won't be no goodbyes
Maybe I would read those signs I used to ignore
I know you're sorry but it doesn't matter no more

[Verse 2]
Wish that I had known from the way that you kissed me
From all of the scars, and the wounds, and the history, yeah
Looked in the mirror and you said we were perfect, yeah
Now I'm lookin' in the mirror all alone, was it worth it?

[Chorus]
Maybe in the next life
Maybe I would think twice
Maybe I would take my pride and walk out the door
Maybe in the next life
There won't be no goodbyes
Maybe I would read those signs I used to ignore
I know you're sorry but it doesn't matter no more

[Bridge]
'Cause I can't believe all the things that you said
And then you walked alone
And all of the things I regret

[Chorus]
Maybe in the next life
Maybe I would think twice
Maybe I would take my pride and walk out the door
Maybe in the next life
There won't be no goodbyes
Maybe I would read those signs I used to ignore

[Outro]
(Maybe I'll see you in the next life)
(Goodbye)
(Maybe I'll see you in the next life)
(Goodbye)

[Chorus]
Big blue, for once in my life, I felt close to you
I was so overcome with emotion
When I was hurt and in need of affection
When I was tired and I couldn't go home
Then you offered protection
So am I learning my lesson?
Or am I back on my own?

[Chorus]
Big blue, for once in my life, I felt close to you
I was so overcome with emotion
When I was hurt and in need of affection
When I was tired and I couldn't go home
Then you offered protection
So am I learning my lesson?
Or am I back on my own?

[Chorus]
Big blue, for once in my life, I felt close to you
I was so overcome with emotion
When I was hurt and in need of affection
When I was tired and I couldn't go home
Then you offered protection
So am I learning my lesson?
Or am I back on my own?

[Chorus]
Big blue, for once in my life, I felt close to you
I was so overcome with emotion
When I was hurt and in need of affection
When I was tired and I couldn't go home
Then you offered protection
So am I learning my lesson?
Or am I back on my own?

Angie:  It's Hot 97, and I got my man on the phone. You know 7 billion dollars first week in at the box office, on 8 Mile. Can we have one time please Eminem *clapping* is on the telephone.

Eminem:  Angie, Angie, Angie. *Angie laughing* What's up?

Angie:  Wh.. why the stress in your voice?

Eminem:  Wh.. why the stress?

Angie:  Yeah?

Eminem:  No distress.

Angie:  You know what I have to say to you before we talk about anything, just congratulations man 'cause..

Eminem:  Thank you Angie, you too!

Angie:  Thank you man!

Eminem:  They're banging the single out here. They're banging.

Angie:  I was in Detroit two days ago, I like it there.
Eminem:  Yeah, I told them to!

Angie:  Oh that's what it was? *Laughing*

Eminem:  I told em' to!

Angie:  I actually.. I actually used the "Lose Yourself" instrumental to come out to.. I figured you know, I was in your town, it would work, it was big for me

Eminem:  Well right, being the 

[?] I figured that was the right thing to do

Angie:  Yeah yeah, thank you. No man, but the 8 Mile thing just you know, just received so well and just, you know, and incredible job man, so congratulations on all that

Eminem:  Thank you I've had a beautiful time

Angie:  So how you feeling man? What's 

[?] some 

[?]

Eminem:  I'm good, success is good, everything is..

Angie:  I'm not used to this side of you

Eminem:  You're not used to this side?

Angie:  No *Laughing*, you sound very grown up

Eminem:  Um, I'm growing up a little bit, I'm trying

Angie:  Alright, talk to me man, what the hell is going on?

Eminem:  Alright, I did.. first of all, I want to make a little comment, you know, I just want to comment on this whole thing that's going on, this little, this little whatever it..

Angie:  Feud?

Eminem:  Yeah, this little feud.

Angie:  I saw it on MTV yesterday, it's official now!

Eminem:  It's crazy!

Angie:  You and Benzino..

Eminem:  First time he's ever been on TV, I want to congratulate him. The first time he's ever been on MTV and he did 106 & Park, so I want to congratulate him on that too.

Angie:  So he's getting public.

Eminem:  I'm definitely bringing a lot of success to this man, but you know what, like honestly, like this dude, I buried him already. He's speaking from the grave Angie, this dude is speaking from the grave.

Angie:  Oh would you be referring to the song on the Green Lantern Mixtape?

Eminem:  I'll be referring to, I'd be referring to the one, the new one that he has. The newest one, the.. the one with the.. the fake "Victory" beat. I think he calls it “I Lost”…

Angie:  Oh the one Benzino did? Right right, but you then came on the, I the joint I heard came from you was on the Green Lantern Mixtape
Eminem:  Yeah see, I'm gonna tell you the story what happened

Angie:  Okay

Eminem:  He dissed me on a record, I didn't respond right, I didn't respond. Then he dissed me again, went back in the studio again. I think he was mad that I didn't respond.

Angie:  He finally..

Eminem:  Not that it didn't hit my radar 'cause this dude owns half of The Source  magazine. That's why it hit my radar, but my manager, once again, Paul Rosenberg, you know, tried to talk me out of it. "Don't respond, it's not worth it". The second time he did it I said "You know what, I'm gonna let him have it". So I gave it to him. Two songs.. two songs, to his two songs.

Angie:  Right

Eminem:  Now this next time, now I already buried him. I put the nail in the coffin, I kick the dirt on his grave.

*Eminem with muffled voice imitating the buried Benzino*

"This 

[?] is 

[?].. I'm never gonna get out! Somebody please let me out!"

Angie:  *Laughing*

Eminem:  He's done. And all the stuff that, you know, all this.. all this gangster shit that he wants to talk, mr. Tough Guy and this and that. Let me tell you something. This dude talks about killing my daughter on the record, he does not want to take it there, he does not? want to take it there. If he really wanted to take it there, and take it on a street level, like he's saying and screaming and jumping up and down in his records he would.. he would not have went back in the studio 'cause a mic can't fight you back dawg, a mic cannot fight you back. He would not have went back in the studio..

Angie:  Okay okay, would.. okay. Ca.. can I just take it back to the beginning with the first song where he came at you. Just the jump off to this whole thing..

Eminem:  It's not a song.

Angie:  A freestyle.

Eminem:  It's not even a free.. I hope to God he was freestyling 'cause if he wrote that, I really feel bad.

Angie:  Alright, let's you took, uhm, I'm talking of exhibit A. The first thing from Benzino. Di.. did you, I mean, did something happen to spark that between you and him, did anything happen, I mean..

Eminem:  Angie, i swear on my daughter's life, I never met this dude, I never met this man, this girl in my life. I never met this woman, she is obsessed with me. I can.. I cannot understand it, you know what it is? I think that.. I think Angie, a lot of times being that I've been out for like, you know, the last four years or whatever, I think people are starting to forget a little bit, that I came from the bottom

Angie:  *Softly* Mhm, right

Eminem:  You know what I'm saying? I took those cards and I remember Denaun.. Kon Artist from D12 told me some deep shit the other day. He said: "Remember when we was flipping burgers at Gilbert's, and you was mad, you was always punching walls and breaking mirrors, and saying "I can't get a deal 'cause I'm white, can't get a deal, I'm white I'm white, it's 'cause I'm white, it's 'cause I'm white". And then I took the cards I was dealt in life, and I flipped them. I flipped the cards and now I'm selling so many records because I'm white, you know what I'm saying?

Angie:  Right.. Right

Eminem:  So I flip the cards I was dealt, but this dude is a fat 40 year old, shriveled up, wrinkled prune, with a big puffy.. big puffy clown hair. So take them cards you were dealt with and say that in your rap, flip them cards. You know what I'm saying? Take them cards that you're dealt. Stop being mad at me, stop concentrating on my life so much and get one on your own.

*Hot 97. com the hottest hiphop spot on the web!*

Angie:  Is it fair to say that you are, not just from Benzino, but just in general, like you're just tired of hearing people beef about that?

Eminem:  I'm sick of the excuses, that everybody making excuses, like if people must not listen to my songs, like in "White America", like I clown about it. You know what I'm saying I.., but the truth of the matter is that I flip the card Angie, I flip the card. Everybody has a set of cards you're dealt with in life, then flip them. You got to take them cards and flip them. If he doesn't have.. is smart to flip them cards, don't blame me. Don't blame me 'cause you suck. This dude, Angie, I think could very well, after hearing his last record, I truly believe, and I'm not even exaggerating, this dude, could possibly be the worst rapper in the world.

Angie:  In your opinion?

Eminem:  In a lot of people's opinion. Well I'm serious like I've never, I've never thought I would see the day where I met or heard, the whackest rapper in the world. I've heard a lot of whack rappers, but he very well, possibly could be, the worst rapper in the world, going against one of the best. And that's not to say, to toot my own horn, I.. I.. I.. never would consider myself the best, if anything.

Angie:  Do you.. do you not?

Eminem:  No.

Angie:  'Cause some people would right now consider you, right now, the best out.

Eminem:  I would not consider myself best out.

Angie:  Who is?

Eminem:  You got Jay-Z, you got Nas, you got Fifty. All of them guys, all of them cats, Redman, all of them guys, are.. are the best at what they do and, you know what I'm saying? I think a lot of times, maybe it, I don't know, maybe it bugs some people's mind a little bit, that I'm not only.. I'm not only rapping, but I'm making the beats too now. I'm making the beats, I'm doing the producing, you know what I'm saying?

Angie:  At least you're getting a lot of money, some people get tight about that man.

Eminem:  It' not even, Angie, it's not even about the money, because I have yet to charge for a track.

Angie:  Really?

Eminem:  I did a track for Jay, I didn't charge. I did a track for Nas, I did a track for Xzibit, I don't even charge for the tracks. I'm free! If I respect you as an artist, and I like your shit, I'm gonna give you a track, I'm gonna give it to you. 'Cause to me it's not about the money, it's about hip hop.

*Hot 97 - Hot 97 - Hot 97.com*


Angie:  Eminem is still on the phone, I have a million questions about the whole 50 Cent thing, but let's pick up where we left off before, just for a second.

Eminem:  Going back to what we was talking about, as far as just..

Angie:  If you just tuned in Eminem is on the phone. He's kinda talking about his side, his perspective on this whole thing that happened with Benzino and..

Eminem:  You know, I guess. They say... they say this when you.. when you hit forty, that you go through your second childhood, so I think that is what this man is going through. It's the second childhood, but I haven't got there yet.

Angie:  Did you ever speak.. Have you ever spoken to him?

Eminem:  I've never even spoke to this man, you can't speak to him, because he record conversations. I might.. what if.. what if I call this man and I threaten him over the phone

Angie:  How do you know that? How do you know that?

Eminem:  Huh?

Angie:  How do you know that?

Eminem:  Because he took a tape. He called Paul and was taping, was taping Paul the whole time, and Angie, you know Paul. Paul's not a fighter. It's Paul's job to de-escalate the situation, so he took that screaming at Paul, and put that on the beginning of his song.

Angie:  *To someone in the studio* You heard that thing?

Eminem:  Now this man is not talking to me, he's talking to my manager, it's my manager's job to de-escalate the situation. I'm on probation. Paul has seen before how I've reacted to certain things and thought he was doing the right thing, by trying to squash it. This dude trying to play dirty pool

Angie:  Wow

Eminem:  What this dude is, I think it's a mid-life crisis Angie, he's going through a mid-life crisis. He's done everything from Will Smith records, to "Rock The Party", trying to come back to the streets.

Angie:  Is he really getting under your skin? No, I mean I can't, I mean..

Eminem:  The only reason.. The only reason that I responded to this clown in the first place, is because of the extortion that is going on between him and Dave Mays. Nobody wanted to address it. Everybody in the business you talk to, any rapper in the business, and I'm not gonna put you on the blast Angie, but we all know what's going on at The Source. Ray Benzino has Dave Mays shook. And you can't play two sides of the fence, you can't be a rapper... you can't be a rapper and own a magazine... own half of a magazine. Because then what happens is, you call rappers that you like, you call them and you want them to make a guest appearance on your album, and if they don't want to do it because you suck. He's gonna  then he's gonna shut you out of his magazine, so you can't play both sides of the fence like that. You just can't do it.

Angie:  So that's what motivated you to see...

Eminem:  That's what motivated me..

Angie:  Was that something that was bothering you, before he started getting at you?

Eminem:  You know what used to bother me it's been.. it's been the mic.. the mic rating system in The Source. Like, when I was a kid growing up in the early 90's on hip hop, The Source as we used to know it, was the bible of hip hop. Like what... it was... their word was gold. If somebody got a four mics you was going to cop it. If somebody got five mics you was going to cop it. If somebody got three and a half, yeah, you know, you wouldn't know, but their word was gold and it was usually right. Now what's happened is this dude is doing the mic rating system, he even said so in his song "The five mic giver". I give the mic, I distribute the mics, but I'm a rapper too. You can't do that. He's fucking the game up and like...

Angie:   I know that you have yet to receive a five mic review in The Source. Is that something that has...

Eminem:  I have yet to receive even a four and a half. Everybody gets a four, everybody, like that's the standard now, that's the standard. If you get a four and a half that must mean that Benzino wants you on his album, you know what I'm saying? And as far as my contribution to hip hop, him calling me a culture stealer and an invader and all that stuff. As far as my contribution to hip hop. How was my contribution to hip hop any different than Dave Mays and Jonathan Shecter when they started The Source twelve-thirteen years ago, was to make hip-hop bigger and expand it. If I can take hip hop and open more white people's ears to hip hop so that artists like Nelly, and Ja Rule, and Jay-Z, and Cameron, and Ludacris and Nas can sell more records, then that's my contribution to hip hop. You know what I'm saying?

Angie:  Right

Eminem:  I'm just.. I'm only.. I'm only.. being real and I swear to you Angie, this dude can.. can.. he can scrounge up change and call you from a payphone after this interview and he can.. can scream, he can jump up and down and scream all he want, he can make... go in the studio and make a hundred thousand more records about me, and base his whole life around mine, I will not make another song about this man. He cannot afford to pay the bill when I 

[?] for the studio time. Then he owes me back. This dude is so whack, I can't even get D12 to do a song about him. They're screaming at me like "why are you even giving this guy the energy?" Because unfortunately I'm in a position where the more attention I pay to something, the bigger it get.

Angie:  So how you gonna... how you gonna... how you gonna not now. What if the dude just keeps making song after song after song, and every now and then he say something that get on your nerves, you just not responding anymore?

Eminem:  I'm done. Anything he does from.. from now on
*Eminem in muffled voice* "Will be like this" Speaking from the grave, I buried him, I buried him, I put the nail in the coffin, I threw the dirt on the top of his grave. I don't even think I'll put him in the coffin, I think I just buried him in a hole and threw the dirt on his grave.

Angie:  What happens if you see this dude man?

Eminem:  What happens if I see him?

Angie:  Yeah?

Eminem:  I'm on probation. I'm on probation, so I really would not like to comment on that, but I will let it be known that I got three months left of probation.

Angie:  Alright, but you don't want to jeopardize any of this..

Eminem:   No, I'm not trying to yo. I'm trying.. yo I'm trying to stay in the studio, I'm trying to release my records, make my artists big and spend time with my little girl.

*Hot 97.com Hip Hop's hottest spot on the web*

Angie:  Your song is No.1 today...

Eminem:  That's a beautiful thing.

Angie:  How do you decide who you respond to?

Eminem:   If I get 10 people coming to me on the street saying why is such & such dissin' you, if it gets to the point where I hear it everywhere I go. But this woman here, she is done... she is outta my life.

[Intro]
If she don't, if she don't, if she don't, if she don't
Want your lovin'
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it right to me
If she don't, if she don't, if she don't, if she don't
Want your lovin'
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it right to me

[Verse 1]
Yes, it's true that a fool and his wealth will soon come to part
And the cost is much the same when it's a broken heart
She don't seem to realize that of her is all you think
She's so busy playing the field that she forgot about the love you gave

[Pre-Chorus]
And darling, all I'm trying to say is that when you run out of patience with her
I'll be waiting just outside your world
To be the lover in which you can believe

[Chorus]
If she don't want your lovin', give it to me
And I'll take it
Let me take you off her hands
And show you what you can do with a real woman
Oh, if she don't want it, your lovin'
Give it to me, 'cause I'll take it
Gladly take you off her hands
And show you what you can do with a real woman, baby

[Verse 2]
Comes a time when everyone must draw the line
And that time is overdue for you
You gave it all that you had to give
But it's clear she loves someone else and not you
No sense in continuing to rub salt in your wound
If she can't see your love for her
Oh, she don't deserve it anyhow

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, all I'm trying to say
Is I wish you'd give my love a try
Ooh, and when you do, you're gonna find
Just like you, it's worth the time

[Chorus]
If she don't want your lovin', give it to me, boy
I said I'll take it
Let me take you off her hands
And show you what you can do with a real woman, yeah
(Come here, boy, and let me show you what you can do with a real woman)
Oh oh, yeah, give it to me, I'll take it
Gladly take you off her hands
And show you what you can do with a real woman, baby

[Outro]
Sweet thang, I mean, really now, really
Why don't you back up off that girl and give her some room
'Cause I'm the work, baby, and you are too
Don't you know that, huh?
She don't want it, she don't want it, if the girl don't want it
And she don't want it
I can show you, let me show you
I mean, let me show you, baby
Gladly take you off her hands
Show you what to do with a real woman, baby
She don't want it, she don't want it, if the girl don't want it
I can show you, let me show you
Hey, let me, let me, let me
Gladly take you off her hands
Show you what to do with a real woman, baby
She don't want it, she don't want it, if the girl don't want it
I can show you, let me show you
Gladly take you off her hands
Show you what to do with a real woman, baby
She don't want it, she don't want it, if the girl don't want it
I can show you, let me show you
Gladly take you off her hands
Show you what to do with a real woman, baby
She don't want it, she don't want it, if the girl don't want it
I can show you, let me show you
Gladly take you off her hands
And if she don't like that, tell her come see Sugar Ray Aretha
Show you what to do with a real woman, baby

[Intro]
Ooh, boy

[Verse 1]
All I think about
Is your love and how you really knock me out, boy
You mean more to me than any gift that you can give
Because your love is what I live for
More than the pretty flowers you send me every hour
There is no only reason why I'm in love

[Chorus]
It's just your love, love, love, love, love
Your love, love, love, love, love
Your love, love, love, love, love
Your love, love, love, love, love

[Verse 2]
Oh, what a mystery
Loneliness was holding me and promise not to let me be, no
Then quite suddenly
Quells some bad, supposed to be, I thank your love has saving me now
There are no odd reasons, I've got a love attraction
If I could know the answer, I would feel so much better
Maybe it's how you kissed me whenever you had missed me
So many whys to think of, that's what I knew

[Chorus]
It's just your love, love, love, love, love
Your love, love, love, love, love
Oh oh, your love, love, love, love, love
Your love, love, love, love, love

[Bridge]
I still remember that day
You put my love please now
It was so cool and tender, that's why I still remember
If I have to name just one thing that makes my heart keep smiling
It wouldn't be hard to think of, I'd have to say it's just your love
Your love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, your love
It's your love, baby, your love

[Outro]
(Love) It is, it is, it is
(Love) It's your love, yeah, yeah
(Love) It's your love, ooh ooh
(Love) Your love, yeah
(Love) Shoo-doo-be-doo-dwey-do
(Love) Doo-doo-doo-dwe, doo-doo-doo-dwe, doo-doo-doo-dwe, doo-doo-doo-dwe
(Love) It's your love
(Love) Oh oh, your love
(Love) It's your love, yeah

[Intro]
I'll make it up to you
I'll make it up to you
I'll make it up to you

[Verse 1: Aretha Franklin]
I wanna make it up to you
(Yes, I do)
For all the things I put you through
(Yes, I do)
Please forgive me for the lies
(Tear-stained eyes)
I sincerely apologize

Darling, realize
It's too much to let go now
If I wasn't sure, believe me, this I know now
You're the only one
Come back, my morning sun
(All I wanna do)
I wanna make it up to you, boy

[Verse 2: Levi Stubbs]
I wanna love you in the night, yeah
(Do it right)
Let's do this thing, girl, do it right
(Keep it tight)
Let's put the pieces back in place
Put 'em there, baby
(No time to waste)
No one will ever share your space

I've gotten over you (Yes, yes)
Everything about you now (Yes, pretty baby)
But still I reminisce (And I'm free)
Yes, I really doubt you now
Restore my trust and faith
Come back, don't hesitate
(All I wanna do)
I wanna make it up to you, girl, yeah

[Bridge: Aretha & Levi]
You know if we could try, just one more time
Hey baby, I promise you
That my star will shine, oh yeah
And if you should ever reach for the moon
And fall among the stars
Just let me be, well
Wherever you are, wherever you are
Oh darling, ooh darling
Oh darling, oh darling
Sweet baby, sweet baby
Gotten over you, gotten over you
And everything about you now, everything about you now
Still I reminisce, still I reminisce
Yes, yes, and I really doubt you now, really doubt you now
Restore my trust and faith, do it, do it, do it, girl
Come back, don't hesitate
'Cause all I wanna do, all I wanna do

Yeah, I wanna make it up to you, boy
Mmm, baby

[Outro: Aretha & Levi]
(Make it up to you, girl)
Make it up, make it up, make it up
Your big brown sexy eyes, baby
(I wanna make it up to you, boy) (Make it up to your, girl)
I'm so glad, so glad I realized
(Hey, wanna make it up to you, girl)
I love everything about you, girl
Do you really? Tell me about it
Yes, I do
Tell me now
All night long
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Those brown shoes are gonna rip and fall apart
Pretty red dress, you say you need it
I'll find a way somehow
Well, well
I love, I love, I love, I love the way you handle yourself
And I love it when you love me, girl
In a room full of other men, you rise and you stand above everybody else
I can see the envy of their eyes
Oh baby
When you and I walk off, hey girl
Sweet thing
Sweet baby
Sweet, sweet thing
Sweet thing
Aw, won't you do it again now
One more, one more, one more
Hey, one more time
One more, one more, one more
Make it up to me, baby
Do the best I can
Make it up to me, baby
Do the best I can
Love ya, love ya, love ya
Be the kind of man
(Make it up to you, girl - make it up, make it up, make it up)

[Intro]
Hey, I got a secret
Sweetest daydream

[Verse 1]
You and me
I'm the land, you're the sea
Rushing me and tenderly kissing me
All along the shore
Love forever more

[Chorus]
Just my daydream (daydream)
Though it may seem (may seem)
Vague and far away, I dream it every day
It's just my day dream (daydream)
Though it may seem (may seem)
Too good to be true, that's 'cause it's all about you

[Verse 2]
You're the night, and I'm on cloud number 9
A private place we can find in our mind, hey, I can share with you
I'm always there with you too
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Just my daydream, though it seem
Vague and far away, I dream it every day
Hee, just my daydream, though it may seem
Too good to be true, that's 'cause it's all about you

[Bridge]
Crazy, crazy, crazy, that's what they call me
Lately I'm beginning to feel they may be right
'Cause anyone who's sane would have to be crazy to lie around
Daydreaming at night (daydreaming at night)
Daydreaming at night (daydreaming at night)
Daydreaming at night (daydreaming at night)
Daydreaming at night

[Verse 3]
You and me, I'm the land, you're the sea
Rushing in tenderly kissing me
All around the shore
Love forevermore

[Chorus]
It's just my daydream (daydream)
Though it may seem (may seem)
Vague and far away, I dream it every day
Just my daydream (daydream)
Though it may seem (may seem)
Too good to be true, that's 'cause it's all about you

[Bridge]
Ooh, crazy, crazy, crazy, that's what they call me
Lately I'm beginning to think they may be right
'Cause anyone who's sane would have to be crazy to lie around
Daydreaming at night (daydreaming at night)
Daydreaming at night (daydreaming at night)
Daydreaming at night (daydreaming at night)
Daydreaming at night

[Outro]
You and me, out of nowhere, suddenly
(In the nightfall, in the night)
And it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good
It's good to know you're there
Whatever's fair, sweet baby (in the nightfall, in the night)
(In the night) Thank you for the love
(Dream about you all the time) You set my way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(In the nightfall ... in the night ... in the night)
And I've got a secret (dream about you all the time)
Sweetest daydream (in the nightfall)
Said I've got a secret (in the night)
Sweetest daydream, oh, yeah
You and me, baby
Out of nowhere, suddenly, oh
Thank you for the love
Mmm, mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shabba-dabba-dwee-da-dwee...
This is love, my darling
Can't you feel it?
When you really had me, concealing
I just can't be that way with you
The light of my life
And you don't even even  know it
How many ways can I show it?
Wherever you are, I wanna be with you, baby

The joining of our hearts
The joining of our hands
With this ring, I thee wed
The love of my life
I'll trust you with my heart, dear
Trust you more when you're not here

This is your last chance
There'll be no backward glance
Are we on or are we through?

This is your last chance
There'll be no backward glance
Are we on or are we through?
You feel it in your heart
Feel it down in your soul, baby
Oh yeah yeah...

[Intro]
Extra, extra
Read all about it
Extra, extra
We heard the good news

[Verse 1]
We've come this far by faith
Pick up your pace and don't you be late
I'm here to tell you about the good news
There's something about the path that we choose, y'all
Wisdom has built this house now
Integrity will bring your pride out
If you know how to pray the situation out
You'll get an answer, and there ain't no doubt

[Chorus]
Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better and
Sunday, we heard the good news, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
He won't stop blessing you
Look here, what He'll do is keep testing you
And a beggar's no less than you
'Cause one day it could be you
So get your folks together for some church
Some good music, prayer, and service won't hurt, y'all
Even if you don't like the preacher
There's bound to be a thing or two he can teach you

[Chorus]
Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better and
Sunday, we heard the good news, yeah

[Bridge]
Deceit is in the heart of them who imagine evil
Righteousness is the fruit of the tree of all people
And if you want to live your life upright
Pray that the Lord will hold up the light
What you need is love on your side
The power of love won't be denied
I feel comfortable giving you this advice
Don't make the same mistake twice

[Chorus]
Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better and
Sunday, we heard the good news, yeah
Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better and
Sunday, we heard the good news

[Bridge]
These are the greatest days of our test of time
We need to be walking with a made-up mind
Walk by faith, oh, not by sight
Then all your battles, you know He'll fight
If the sky changes colors there's so many ways
This world's going to be a better place some day
If love and unity you just believe
Then all your blessings I know you'll receive

[Bridge]
Glory to God in the Highest
Glory, glory, glory
Jesus, woo yeah, man who walked on water, y'all
Jesus, He's alright, He's alright

[Chorus]
Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better and
Sunday, we heard the good news
Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better and
Sunday, we heard the good news
Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better and
Sunday, we heard the good news

[Verse]
Pay me on the first, niggas know I broke the curse
How it feel when the roles is reversed? Nigga got it out the dirt
Bad bitches 'round, I'ma flirt and I'm goin' for my eighth like Kerr
Do you concur? Catch me if you can lil' purp
I go Kyrie Curry on the verse, ball like a Nerf
Meet me on the turf, I don't mean Pharrell group, but these niggas nerds
Full of that syrup, you will get served
My niggas make you hide your face like H.E.R
And I like her, titties and furs
Big green Phantom got 'em hooked, Larry Bird
Give 'em the bird, fuck what you heard, I'm the best rap-per-er
Niggas call me tiger, that's whiter than a iceberg
I'm nicer than your favorite rapper on percs
I might curve if she don't got good slurp
Be nicer, put you on a R.I.P shirt
Yes sir, ridin' in a two-seater
I love Hov but I still gotta bang Ether
Believe it or not, came back from the sunken, now I'm cream of the crop
I need cash on spot, I don't want the deposit
I got DMs from every IG thot
But I'm locked in, studio 24-7
I just popped in, fuckin' with the Leakers, when I leave, its gon' reek here
On my way to yo' house, my girl's top tier
If we talkin' overall, I'm top ten
Flows, cars, bitches, ice
King in Dubai like fuck the price
Lookin' at yours, I'm like "fuck my life"
Lookin' at yours, I'm like "you're right"
I might go psych, go might (might, might might)
It's redrum, on sight (sight, sight, sight)
Bitch, I'm always right
Everybody wanna be like Mike
Big bank take lil' bank
Ayy, fuck around, I need another bank
Ayy, thirteen hundred stars in the Wraith
Woo, and I'm on that forty-two man

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Yeah, bought you brand new Fiji water, I wanna braid your hair
Bought Chanel shoes 'cause I wanna see them C's when you step
Got you new condominium keys, don't you go nowhere
And it's just us, dripped out love
Bentley coupe for you, paddy wagon'd it up
Flossin' in Belize, you a diamond in the rough
Christian Dior, love the smell of when we hug
The pain I get from you, I don't wanna go numb
Doin' overtime and develop us a bond
Straight-jacket on 'cause for you I go dumb

Make love, oh, love me
There was a time in history
I thought you were the enemy
You and I had a go between then
Harder than it's ever been
You told me when you went away
Standing in the summer rain
I'd never see your face again love
I'd never see your face
I've been alone longer than you
Gave it all for nothing like so many do
We got love between each other
All the air we can breathe
We can change it all my love
If we just believe
It's a brave new world and
You got to be a lover
When you finally get a part to play
When the rain starts falling
We turn to one another
It's your body and mine in the shape of things to come
Where does our love go
When the world is overrun?
God bless you and me
It's the shape of things to come
Time to grow strong
Seems your love is sailing by, oh
Time to turn the tide
Not like it was
Ain't nothing better than
The best of us
I've been alone longer than you
Gave it all for nothing like so many do
The love between each other
All the air we can breathe
We can change it all my love
If we just believe
It's a brave new world and
You got to be a lover
When you finally get a part to play
When the rain starts falling
We turn to one another
It's your body and mine in the shape of things to come
Where does our love go
When the world is overrun?
God bless you and me
It's the shape of things to come
And now I got you next to me
I'll tell you what you did to me
I nearly died of a broken heart
I nearly died of a broken heart
I've been alone all through the night
Gave it all for nothing with
Nothing to hide
Just believe in me girl
That's all I can say
I'm the one to steal your heart away
It's a brave new world and
You got to be a lover
When you finally get a part to play
When the rain starts falling
We turn to one another
It's your body and mine in the shape of things to come
Where does our love go
When the world is overrun?
God bless you and me, you and me
It's the shape of things to come
It's a brave new world and
You got to be a lover
When you finally get a part to play
When the rain starts falling
We turn to one another
It's your body and mine in the shape of things to come
Where does our love go
When the world is overrun?
God bless you and me
It's the shape of things to come

[Chorus: Chingy & Nicki Minaj]
She say she want a balla got stacks there by the bar
She say she want a balla like me, that's a star
She say she want a balla that drive a lil' Civic
Put a pistol in his lap 'cause in the streets your balla hit it
He say he want a broad like me that's thick
He say he want a broad like me, a real chick
He say he want a broad that get it in the bed
Let him hit it from the back, then give him good head

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
She want that good shit, that good shit, gone with that bullshit
Soulja Boy and Chingy players, Gucci, that's the dream team
No 

[?] on my mansion, party at the Hamptons
Soulja Boy a murderer, Gucci got it down
Made my H2 Hummer of them H, got 'em climbin'
Aw, not pretentious but my field of view declinin'
I'm rockin' yellow diamonds, neck plates shinin'
I'm Gucci Mane prodigy so I keep grindin'
Blind out A8, if I'm in London you can't find me
A big bank roll and got 12 right behind me
Ain't gon' pull it over, shawty in the passenger
My car is European, my 'dro is straight from Amsterdam
Gucci bandana, while I be in the Carribean
I'm sipping on Dom Pérignon, ain't no tussin, man
I'm flyin', my eyes tight, how much more can they tighten?
Soulja Boy tell 'em, Gucci Mane the alliance

[Chorus: Chingy & Nicki Minaj]
She say she want a balla got stacks there by the bar
She say she want a balla like me, that's a star
She say she want a balla that drive a lil' Civic

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Baby, I'll be your co-pilot, mama do the drivin'
Let me take you shopping, baby, you can be my stylist
Let me be the treasurer, et cetera, et cetera
More lettuce than a caesar salad, get my lady 

[?]
My yellow girl, my yellow car, them off-road parts scream be cautious
Gucci bag with Gucci rings and Gucci shoes, they hundred dollars
Probably just some 

[?] polos, 

[?] I was just a balla
Have your dolly 

[?] then walk in Gucci hunnids
Here's a warning, if you want me, when you gettin' pretty like 

[?]
Keep a hundred on me, I keep it a hundred, honey

I don't wanna shoot you, homie, I'm just tryna fuck, lil buddy

[Chorus: Chingy & Nicki Minaj]
She say she want a balla got stacks there by the bar

[Verse 3: Chingy]
Star-

Had a bad asian broad to clean my house and do the dishes
Ain't gotta tell her, we'll do something and you know that 

[?]
Let's sync interest with the gay, whipin' it up in the kitchen, ay
I'm one of the freshest left, girl you know I'm fresh to death

[?] by myself, the sink was full just like a F
My eyes long as 30 streets, truck fit no 30s, b

He say he want a broad like me, a real chick
He say he want a broad that get it in the bed
Let him hit it from the back, then give him good head

[Verse]
Yeah
My mind state feel like the crime in the summertime
Higher than average, lot of cabbage
Thank God I never abide by the established
Guidelines that keep niggas inside of fabrics
Commissioned by the state, I skate by the masters
Like "Yoo-hoo" with a new-new ridin' passenger
Shout out Oak Cliff, I'm 'bout to fly to Dallas
Decade from now, I might just buy the Mavericks
What up, Mark Cuban?, I am only part human
Half-man, half-amazing, plus, I'm good at math like I'm Asian
Hate to use stereotypes
But that's light compared to what a nigga get from Caucasians
No race-baitin'—treat the beat like PlayStation
Reporting to you live from the International Space Station
I'll probably vacation on Mars
The flow is out of this world and so is the bars
Blow the facade right off of your squad
Lil' rappers, I love you, but you ain't shit 'til you got offers in Prague
Look that shit up, a book, nigga, pick that shit up
Expand your vocab, I'm giving out toe tags for no cash
All summer long plus three seasons after
Please CC a rapper, tell him meet me
It's absolutely imperative that my heat speak to rappers
The problem with this game is this weak sea of rappers
I'm the answer on the low, I'm a cheat sheet for rappers
I came up 'round AC to DC adapters
Plug talk, what I'm really sayin' is a shame but
My niggas move 'caine like HBCU Kappas
Whole town full of CC Sabathia's
You think niggas gettin' fat pitchin' crack? Not really
This is not the eighties, don't be silly
Now we push pills and sell heroin to Billy
Now Billy momma want the judge to pardon his addiction
How many black addicts that got caught up in the system?
With no sob stories on your prime time television
I can smell a blatant contradiction, man, listen
Don't want to fuck up my vibe
Let's end it on a positive note, come see me live
KOD—album of the year, undebatably
My cadence be the greatest we've seen
Since the late MC whose name was The
Notorious—Dreamville stacked like the Warriors
Winning back to back, next up to bat
Is my nigga Bas, after that, Jiddy-J.I.D
That's a New York City kid, plus ATL
Me, I'm from the 'Ville, but I know them towns well
Before I had a deal, I was givin' niggas hell
Now I'm givin' niggas deals and they givin' niggas hell

[Pre-Chorus]
You wet my eyes
But I don't mind it
I tell you lies
But it's only sometimes
You pick a fight
And I'll define it

[Chorus]
I swear that I (Swear that I)
I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times?
I don't think it was three times
It can't be more than four times
I think we need to rewind
You text that boy sometimes
Must be more than three times
I didn't mean to two-time, two-time you

[Verse]
She said that I should have liked it
I told her "I only use it sometimes"
Except when I need reminding
I'm petrified

[Chorus]
But I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times?
I don't think it was three times
I didn't mean to two-time, two-time you

[Pre-Chorus]
You wet my eyes
But I don't mind it
I tell you lies
But it's only sometimes
You pick a fight
And I'll define it

[Chorus]
I swear that
I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times?
I don't think it was three times
It can't be more than four times
I think we need to rewind
You text that boy sometimes
Must be more than three times
I didn't mean to two-time you, two-time you
To two-time, two-time you

[Chorus]
I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times?
I don't think it was three times
It can't be more than four times
I think we need to rewind
You text that boy sometimes
Must be more than three times
I didn't mean to two-time, two-time you

[Outro]
(One time, oh, one time, three time, four time
Three time, four time, two time, three time)
Two-time, two-time you
(One time, oh, one time, three time, four time
Three time, four time, two time, three time)

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Big up all the Monsta Island massive
And beware before I triple dare you like the last kid
Who asked me what we don't got that you got son
For one flow that's elementary my dear Watson
Secondly, ever since I was little
Not so much to riddle, least rhyme to the syllable
Keep tracks that make a Arab thief clap
With no hands, I chopped these drums off, truly yours, G Rap
Actual fact, relax
In this land of lyrical lost, black, I'm not the cool sleestak
The one who might stop and talk to you
Poisoned a few, niggas who be biting styles I'm like pork too
Ooh, what you got to lose? Let mud fly
When I got blues I chew whole crews that's bud dry
So I ask why the styes from the cess
Shit be fucking with my eye as I pull it to the chest
The super motherfucking villain grip the mic with an iron hand
Throwing MCs to the fire from out the frying pan
It ain't no use in trying, man, son stop crying
Fronting like you death-defying, you need to stop lying
Speak your piece only once you're spoken to first
Now let me hear your verse while I'm choking you
With well refined rhymes like a editor
Throw them to my collections of skulls and spines like Predator
Fuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound (Who?) was Jet Jaguar and James Brown
(yeah yeah, only them two)
Ain't you glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up (True, true)
I'd like to say, "Hi, it's Sci.Fly the odd Merlin"
That's quick to whip up a script like Rod Serling
Who eye on bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling
Who see God toke but never see God hurlin'
My man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost
Me myself I got flavors that out-taste most
With numb gums, some rhymers is lactose
Back to you MF DOOM, you late show host
S to the U to the P E R-uh
Who chronicle these times in a 3D horror
Thriller porno co-starrer in a realer drama
Who break bread with stingy kin-men, indian borrower
Lone gunman who candidly flip fly flows
Single-handedly with one eye closed
In a fly pose, no shirt Alayé
May see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay
That's that n a smash way how he did it
Motherfucker probably couldn't peep it past a minute
Exquisite scripts, that quick shit, go with flow
That's how we do it though

[Verse 1]
It's 4:30 Friday, I get off at 5:00
I come into your place, you come into mine
Got a bottle of Jack and cheap red wine
Yeah, our own little world
Wanna open em up, close all the doors
Spin you around on that kitchen floor
'Cause all week long, I've been waitin' for
You and me girl

[Chorus]
Just chillin' on the weekend, weekend
Sippin' something on the cheap end, cheap end
Skinny dippin' in the deep end, deep end
Or bass fishin' with your feet in, feet in
Up all night then we sleepin', sleepin'
But we were never really sleepin', sleepin'
Tangled up in the sheets in, sheets in
Goose bumps just a creepin', creepin'
Yeah, we chillin' on the weekend
Just chillin' on the weekend

[Verse 2]
We can watch a whole season of Seinfeld or Friends
While I watch that afternoon sun shining in
Right through the blinds and onto your skin
Yeah, that's something to see
Three days just ain't enough and times ticking
So keep that cherry red lipstick sticking on me
Yeah, let's just keep

[Chorus]
Just chillin' on the weekend, weekend
Sippin' something on the cheap end, cheap end
Skinny dippin' in the deep end, deep end
Or bass fishin' with your feet in, feet in
Up all night then we sleepin', sleepin'
But we were never really sleepin', sleepin'
Tangled up in the sheets in, sheets in
Goose bumps just a creepin', creepin'
Yeah, we chillin' on the weekend
Just chillin' on the weekend, weekend

[Bridge]
Nothing to do, nowhere to be
Nothing to do, nowhere to be
But right here with you and you with me
Right here with you and you with me

[Chorus]
Just chillin' on the weekend (Oh)
Sippin' something on the cheap end (Yeah)
Skinny dippin' in the deep end
Or bass fishin' with your feet in (Oh)
Up all night then we sleepin', sleepin'
But we were never really sleepin', sleepin'
Tangled up in the sheets in, sheets in
Goose bumps just a creepin', creepin'
Yeah, we chillin' on the weekend
Oh yeah, yeah we chillin' on the weekend (Oh)
Just chillin' on the weekend, weekend
Chillin' on the weekend (Weekend, weekend)

[Intro]
Yeah...

[Verse 1]
That lit up ringing buzzing good for nothing phone in your hands
The directions to the party that's just started with that cover band
That old school radio station, let's just drive until it's faded
Girl, let's lose it, tonight

'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flipping your hair, baby, I swear

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat tonight
Close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancing, swaying to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Verse 2]
Let's start with them Luccheses, baby, kick 'em to the floorboard
And bobby pins holding your hair up, girl, you don't need 'em no more
That dress hanging off your shoulder as you move a little closer
Yeah, let's lose it tonight, yeah girl

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat tonight
Close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancing, swaying to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Bridge]
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flipping your hair, baby I swear

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat tonight
Close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancing, swaying to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Outro]
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Monologue: 50 Cent]
Yoooo!
This is the invasion
I'll beat you motherfuckers, and get invaded
Shady Records, Aftermath
Get down and pray

[Skit/Background: Eminem]
"Eminem..."
"No..."
"Eminem!"
"No..."
"Hahaha. Wake the fuck up, motherfucker."
"What do you want from me?!"
"Hahahaha. Remember me?"
"I killed you!"
"You thought I was dead, didn't you?"
"What do you want from me?!"
"I'm alive..."
"Oh, God..."
"Get up."
"No."
"Get up and look in the mirror."
"I don't want to!"
"Look in the mirror, it's just a reflection. Haha"
"Leave me alone!!!"
"Look in the mirror! You're nothing! You're nothing without me! Look in the motherfucking mirror!"
"Leave me alone!!! Leave me the fuck alone!!!"

[Eminem punches the mirror, breaking it.]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa shizzel, my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so

[Outro: Eminem]
Yo, yo, yo, yo

[Verse]
I'ma get snuffed, ‘cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I'll pipe down when the White House gets wiped out
When I see that little Cheney dyke get sniped out
Lights out, bitch, adiós, goodnight 

[gunshot] (AHH!)
Now put that in your little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute, ‘cause the hype just died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America; fuck the government!
Tell that C. Delores Tucker slut to suck a dick
Motherfucker ducked, what the fuck? Son of a bitch!
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
Shit's like a samurai sword; a sensei
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way, still tell that ut-slay itch-bay
Uck-say my ick-day, 'scuse my ig-pay atin-lay
But uck-fay you ig-pay (50!!!)

[Chorus]
You always pick up your phone, asleep
With friends, alone
The weirdest times I call you, you’re there
Glowing, in my dark room
You always pick up your phone, asleep
With friends, alone
The weirdest times I call you, you’re there
Glowing, in my dark room

[Verse]
I don’t always understand the things I do
Maybe it’s best if I never figure out the truth
Learned the names of all your stuffed animals
In too deep now everywhere I feel the bedroom walls
Never be desperate they always said
But getting something while you’re desperate feels the best

[Chorus]
You always pick up your phone, asleep
With friends, alone
The weirdest times I call you, you’re there
Glowing, in my dark room
You always pick up your phone, asleep
With friends, alone
The weirdest times I call you, you’re there
Glowing, in my dark room

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Just a little bit (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 2]

I'ma make you talk down like Pootie Tang
I'ma bo-bo-boom, boom, bo-bo-boom, boom
Give me that pu-pu-pum, pum, pu-pu-pum, pum
Remember when you walked in all serious
Now you like a freshman, bi-curious
It's like bo-bo-boom, boom, bo-bo-boom, boom
You want that pu-pu-pum, pum, pu-pu-pum, pum

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Deep down, we're only animals
I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Show me that freaky side of you

[Chorus]
You a good girl, that's the way California raised ya
You looking good, girl, huh, shaking what your mama gave ya
You know it's alright, 'cause we all naughty by nature

[Post-Chorus]
Just a little bit (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ba-bad behavior (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Just a little bit (Hey, hey, hey)
Slow it down on 'em (Hey, hey, hey)
Just a little bit (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ba-bad behavior (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Just a little bit (Hey, hey, hey)

[Bridge]
Drop the bass on 'em
Bo-bo-boom, boom, bo-bo-boom, boom (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Give me that pu-pu-pum, pum, pu-pu-pum, pum (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm-I'm bo-bo-boom, boom, bo-bo-boom, boom (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh (Ihh, ihh, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1]
Got a letter just this morning, it was postmarked Omaha
It was typed and neatly written, offering me this better job
Better job and higher wages, expenses paid and a car
But I'm on TV here locally, and I can't quit, I'm a star
I come on the TV grinning, wearing pistols and a hat
It's a kiddy show and I'm a hero of the younger set
I'm the number one attraction in every supermarket parking lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks a lot

[Chorus]
Kansas City Star, that's what I are
Yodelee-da-lady, you ought to see my car
I got a big old Cadillac with wired wheels
I got rhinestones on my spokes
I've got credit down at the grocery and my barber tells me jokes
I'm the number one attraction in every supermarket parking lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks a lot

[Chorus]
Kansas City Star, that's what I are
Ha-delee-da-lady, you ought to see my car
I drive a big old Cadillac with wired wheels
I got rhinestones on the spokes
I've got credit down at my grocery store
And my barber tells me jokes
I'm the number one attraction in every supermarket parking lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks a lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks a lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks for nothing

[Intro]
Uh, mmm, kyuh
R.I.P. to B.I.G. 
Classic shit

[Verse 1]
I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
"I used to pray for times like this" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said "Go to hell"
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp tests and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit, uh

[Chorus]
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (Barbie dreams)
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (B-B-B-Barbie dreams)
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (B-B-B-Barbie, B-B-B-Barbie dreams)
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers (Barbie dreams)
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin'

[Verse 2]
I remember when I used to have a crush on Special Ed
Shoutout Desiigner 'cause he made it out of special ed
You wanna fuck me, you gotta give some special head
'Cause this pussy have these niggas on some special meds
Like Mike Tyson, he was bitin' my shit
Talkin' 'bout, "Yo, why you got these niggas fightin' and shit?"
On the, on the real, I should make these niggas scrap for the pussy
Young M.A and Lady Luck, get the strap for this pussy, uh
And I woulda had Odell Beckham bangin' the cake
'Til I saw him hoppin' out of cars dancin' to Drake
I been a five-star bitch, man, word to Gotti
I'ma do that nigga Future dirty, word to Scottie
Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speakin'
Ain't no fat nigga tellin' me what he ain't eatin'
YG and The Game with the hammer yellin', "Gang! Gang!"
This ain’t what I meant when I said a gang bang
Tekashi want a ménage, I said "tre-way"
Curved him and went the Kim and Kanye way
Em, cop the Barbie Dreamhouse, then you can play the part
I-I ain't tryna bust it open in a trailer park

[Chorus]
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (Barbie dreams)
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (B-B-B-Barbie dreams)
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (B-B-B-Barbie, B-B-B-Barbie dreams)
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers (Barbie dreams)
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (B-B-B-Barbie dreams)
(Barbie Dreams)
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (B-B-B-Barbie, B-B-B-Barbie dreams)

[Verse 3]
You know I'm all 'bout them dollars
I be supportin' them scholars
I let him give me some brain, but he wanted me to ride it
So I said, "Fuck it, I'm in"
He wanna cut like a trim
And if he act like he know, I let him fuck it again
I got them bars, I'm indicted
I'm poppin', I'm uninvited
I said, "Just lick on the clitoris, nigga, don't fuckin' bite it"
I ride his **** in a circle
I turn Stefan into Urkel
I go arounds and arounds and I'ma go down in slow motion
The-then I pick it up, look at it
I said, "Daddy, come get at it," uh
Yellow brick road, he said that I am a wiz at it
Yeah, they want it, want it
You know I flaunt it, flaunt it
I'm a trendsetter, everything I do, they do
Yeah, I put 'em up on it, on it
¡Dimelo, papi, papi!
Yo quiero sloppy, sloppy
I'll give it to you if you beat it up like Pacqui, Pacqui
I-I-I-I'ma kill 'em with the shoe
No ceiling is in the roof
And I'm big, give me the loot
12 cylinders in the coupe
I get dome with the chrome, no tellin' when I'ma shoot
I just bang, bang, bang, real killas is in my group
Gorillas is in my unit, vacationin' where it's humid
And I shine, shine, shine, got diamonds all in my cubans
I'm in LA Times more than when niggas lootin'
And my flow spit crack, I think that nigga usin'
He done bodied everybody, in closing, these bitches losin'
Usin', usin' up, a bitch movin'
No, I ain't stuttered and no, I ain't Ruben
Damn, a bitch snoozin'
Shoutout to my Jews, l'chaim, Rick Rubin
Big fat titties, yes, they be protrudin'
I be like, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, bring the lube in
I be like, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, bring the lube in

[Verse 1]
Don't be goofy, bring some passion to the table, what you doin'?
Don't be stupid, I'm the realest bitch you know, yeah, I'm the truest (True, true, true)
When you pull up, gotta pull up on me like you already knew it (Mmm, already knew it)
Yeah, you keep saying you the truth, well, nigga, you gon' have to prove it (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's been a minute since I trusted somebody
'Cause I don't never put my trust in nobody
I hate to picture you out fuckin' some body
So, I don't ever put my trust in nobody

[Chorus]
Who am I to deny?
Yeah, you say who am I to run and hide?

[Verse 2]
Don't be jealous, put some trust inside your text when you be textin' (Mmm, textin')
Tell the truth when you get tired of me askin' all them questions (Askin' all them questions)
I prayed to God for peace and love, I'm lookin' at you as a blessing (Bless up, bless up, bless up, yeah)
You told me life been lookin' up, so take that past shit as a lesson (Oh, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's been a minute since I trusted somebody
'Cause I don't never put my trust in nobody
I hate to picture you out fuckin' some body
So, I don't ever put my trust in nobody

[Chorus]
But who am I to deny?
Yeah, you say who am I to run and hide?

[Intro: Swae Lee, Young Thug & Future]

Pull up with no top
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Fall off in the spot, every girl comin' like a shark
And you know my necklace, sittin' on ski resort
Fall off in the spot, every girl comin' like a shark
Put that thing in park, I'ma let my fin pick you apart
Glowin' in the dark, fifty some' girls on board
Runnin' with the marksmen, everything on point like, "En garde!"

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I'm me, I'm Barbie drippin'
DB9, Barbie whippin'
If he say he don't want me back, he be lyin'
Bitch, I'm the sauce, Barbie dippin', I'm the boss, Barbie sippin'
They keep tellin' me work it, I ain't got no chores
I'm all yours, Barbie kissin', call the stores, Barbie shippin'
Out or indoors, baby, I'ma floss
What? Why of course, Barbie tippin', I endorse, Barbie strippin'
Mink carpet, but I ain't got no flaws
Doors look like wings, Barbie sittin', bada-bing, Barbie trippin'
Curve niggas like they arm in a sling
Hopped off the swing, Barbie swingin', to the ring, Barbie blingin'
Good box, so he called Don King
Who the fuck gon' party with them dollies? No, I never do the mollies
If I hit you, then you probably gon' sue
Who the fuck gon' come through with the body, always lookin' like a hottie
Always sayin' what somebody won't do?
Who the fuck gon’ pull up in your city, lookin' every bit of pretty
With the itty bitty titty bitch crew?
Who the fuck gon' beat him with the .22 if he don't lose the attitude
And run off with his credit cards, too?

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Fall off in the spot, every girl comin' like a shark
And you know my necklace, sittin' on ski resort
Fall off in the spot, every girl comin' like a shark
Put that thing in park, I'ma let my fin pick you apart
Glowin' in the dark, fifty some' girls on board
Runnin' with the marksmen, everything on point like, "En garde!"

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Thousand dollar massage
I don't ever miss my mark
Anything I like goes in the cart

If she lick her lips then I'ma join
Indo I'ma spark
When I cash out, that's her favorite part

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
They delivered my Lambo, all white with a tan bow
My body's a work of art, he eatin' this Van Gogh
I'm not in the bando, I'm Pablo Sandals
White beaches, candles, we sexin', Anglo
Wh-wh-what you think all these niggas wanna cuff for?
A lot of Bloods, what you think they in the cut for?
Yeah, it's a sweep, I ain't talkin' when the dust fall

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Fall off in the spot, every girl comin' like a shark

Ahahahaaah! Rrrrr!
I love my fans, I love you so much

[Chorus]
I just took her name and made that bitch a LLC
Stuff a couple stacks up in there, bitch, get on your feet
You'd make twice as much if you switch it up, just to see
To you, he's rich and famous, but he's just a guy to me

[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm King Kong, name still going ding-dong
It's two girls gettin' more money, and they don't rap, they sing songs
I stay with that pink on, pink furs and them pink thongs
Goons out if they blink wrong, think hard, but don't think long
Pink Friday had Eminem, spit hard but I'm feminine
Iconic trio on Monster, Goblins and Gremlins
What's left that I didn't do? You bit the forbidden fruit
You thought you'd get my spot? Who the fuck was kiddin' you?
Took a lil' break, but I'm back to me
Tryna make a new Nicki, where the factory?
They'll never toe to toe on a track with me
There'll never be another one after me
'Cause the skill level still just a half of me
Blasphemy, my niggas will blast for me
All these low IQ hoes baffle me
Tell 'em that I wash bitches take a bath for me
Bunch of trophies in my crib like a athlete
I see them giving fake love but that trash is weak
Man, you know that I ripped, every rapper beat
You know Nicki gon' eat, Bon Appétit
Used to get real hype off a half a mil'
Used to get real high off a half a pill
We don't pay niggas to front like they like my shit
We don't pay niggas to come in and write my shit, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Now carry on, now carry on
Now carry on, now carry on
Swish, swish, I'm just gettin' my Curry on
G6 flow, all Louis V carry-ons

[Chorus]
I just took her name and made that bitch a LLC
Stuff a couple stacks up in there, bitch, get on your feet
You'd make twice as much if you switch it up, just to see

Yo, you made me do it, hoe, I told you, get low (Told you get low)

I'm New York Nick, I'm ballin', where Carmelo? (O.K. 'Melo)
I'm wavy, word to Shawty L-O, hello
How your jacket say Porsche and you never rode a Porsche?
How you supposed to make the quota when you never went North?
How the fuck you got Ferraris when you never went sport?
All that hoopin' and hollerin', still ain't scorin' on the court (Rrrr)

[Bridge]
You made me, you made me, yeah
You made me, you made me, yeah, yeah
On blood, you made me, you made me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Ayy yo, look at what they made me do, they made me do
Switched the foreign on 'em, navy blue to baby blue
Look at how they started pussy poppin' when 80 flew
All my niggas move that Britney, Ari, yeah, Katy, too
Niggas gassed on the really though, gas I pumped them
Straight trash on the really, yo, yes, I dumped him
Push the limits, I'm a pushy bitch, yes, I bumped him
Pushed past being filthy rich, ask I trumped them
'Cause I scare her, scare her, my biggest era, era
Never been clearer, clearer, don't force it, Farrah, Farrah
Because you'll never be me, that's word to Bella, Gigi
Dolce Gabbana, DG, pretty gang rated PG (Woah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now carry on, now carry on
Now carry on, now carry on
Swish, swish, I'm just gettin' my Curry on
G6 flow, all Louis V carry-ons

See, a bitch got more coins than a game room
So we ain't ever hatin' in TheShadeRoom (Nah)
See, I keep my sons in a playroom
So me and you ain't ever in the same room

[Chorus]
I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't never cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' "push" for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And whenever he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up, I'm in a good foreign
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on, come on, come on
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on

[Verse 2]
I slick, slick drop the top like nip slips
So he tryna smash like when the whip flips
I hit licks just to floss with this wrist
And when I leave my bitches we all say, "Kiss, kiss"
I'm in that new new De La Renta, channeling Bugs Bunny
'Cause all I want is karats and some big drug money
I'm only loyal to the niggas that'll bust guns for me
The jig up, it's a stick up, run me the money (Go!)

'Cause I be the baddie, B, Barbie tings, banging body B (Go!)

See a bitch get more press than a key pad
Before you suck me off, get a knee pad
See, I pull the strings like a tea bag
I'm prolly with my jeweler playin' freeze tag

[Chorus]
I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't never cheat because I'm good to him

I ain't really finna tell y'all how to get away with murder and shit

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Just the other day I was out in Miami
Got the low-low on them Percs, low-low on them Xannies
Nigga's know my bitches petty, I ain't talkin' mani's
Pull up with a lot of baddies, don't forget the Addies
When I run up in the town, I ain't chitty-chatty
Got some real pretty titties, they come with a fatty
Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy
I'm La Belle of the ball, you could call me Patti

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I flew in from Trinidad, peep this nigga pressin'
I think that he popped a molly 'cause look how he sweatin'
I'ma let my niggas rob him as soon as it set in
None of you bum bitches can't sit with me and Gretchen
It's the biggest, a bitch ain't cough one time, it's the sickest
I don't never clique up, but they know who the clique is
Fast little bitches, but of course I'm the quickest
Mortal Kombat, ninja Nicki, who ya pick is?

[Interlude: Patty Duke]
Ayo, queen, got the customers out here, man
They lovin' this shit, man, they lovin' this shit, man
Where you at, man? Where you at, man?
We need you here, man, I know you in Miami

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Just the other day I was out in Miami
Got the low-low on them Percs, low-low on them Xannies
Nigga's know my bitches petty, I ain't talkin' mani's
Pull up with a lot of baddies, don't forget the Addies
When I run up in the town, I ain't chitty-chatty
Got some real pretty titties, they come with a fatty
Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy
I'm La Belle of the ball, you could call me Patti

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, you could take all of my bitches out to Abu Dhabi
Let one of my besties confiscate your Maserati
You should throw a party on the yacht for everybody
If we fuck your shit up, OMG, I'm very sorry
You could call me Barbie, 'cause I look just like a dolly
Yes, I bury them when they come for me, call me Halle
Since I finished her, my niggas call me the finale
I'm a busy bitch, I'm filthy rich, no time to Polly
Ayo, swerve to the palace, this the Queen’s like it’s Hollis
Put 15 million dollars, on it, ask LL, I'm doin' it
Don't get cute and ruin it, all my skill, I hone it
I pity opponents, it look easy don't it
(It look easy don't it, it look easy don't it)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Just the other day I was out in Miami
Got the low-low on them Percs, low-low on them Xannies

'Cause niggas know that bag heavy, boy, that bag heavy
Niggas get fuckin' dropped 'round here
Queens get the money, man
Never fakin' it, always makin' it, ya heard?
Iconic shit, man

[Verse 1]
Come, come see what I've been up to
Come, come see about me
I know you had a lot of work to do
Ooh, you got used to things without me, baby
Yeah, you got used to every thing I never did
You got sick of being sick of all my flaws
You got over all the pain I ever caused
And I didn't mean it, no, but-

[Pre-Chorus]
They say it's all what you make it
Maybe it's all in the making
Love's always love, you can't fake it
So please don't try to deny me of that, no
You know my heart couldn't take it
Maybe it's all in the making
Love's always love, you can't fake it
See, baby, ooh you know I need you to-

[Chorus]
Come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
Know it can't always be about me
Just come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
I'm doing good, boy, I'm up where we belong at
You know I'm still trying to find where we went wrong at
So come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
Come, come, come see about me
It won't hurt just to see what we could be
So come see about me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Want you to see how much I changed up
Ooh, I just hope I'm not too late
I know you're hesitant about it, but-
I got a lot I wanna say to you
Hate that I could never measure up
Hate that I could never be the one you needed
'Cause now I'm the one who needs you, but, baby-

[Pre-Chorus]
They say it's all what you make it
Maybe it's all in the making
Love's always love, you can’t fake it
So please don't try to deny me of that, no
You know my heart couldn't take it
Maybe it's all in the making
Love's always love, you can't fake it
See, baby, ooh you know I need you to-

[Chorus]
Come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
Know it can't always be about me
Just come, come see about me (Right here)
Come, come see about me (Right here)
I'm doing good, boy, I'm up where we belong at
You know I'm still trying to find where we went wrong at
So come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
Come, come, come see about me
It won't hurt just to see what we could be
So come see about me, yeah

[Bridge]
About me, about me, about me, about me
About me, about me, about me, about me
About me, about me, about me, about me
About me, about me. about me, about me

[Chorus]
Come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
Know it can't always be about me
Just come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
I'm doing good, boy, I'm up where we belong at
You know I'm still trying to find where we went wrong at
So come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
Come, come, come see about me
It won't hurt just to see what we could be
So come see about me, yeah

[Verse]
I said I'm cool on it, baby, yeah, I'm straight
You say it's love, I don't it want it, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
You do too much, too little, yeah, too late

[Chorus]
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, I'm cool on it, I'm straight

[Outro]
You shoulda been listenin', listenin' in
Too busy glistenin', glistenin' in
Why you ain't listen then, listen back then?
Now you're too much, too little, yeah, too late

[Verse 1]
You say that you’re leavin', but I don’t think I can let go
When you put the phone down, I began to cry
What are you to do, when the person that you love just says no?
Boy, get yourself together, move on with your life

[Pre-Chorus]
So I’m gonna play my favourite rhythm
Got to get you out my system
I would do anything to keep you off my mind
I’m gonna have to call my sisters
Be around the ones who listen
Anything to drown you out tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, you make me crazy
Why’d you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don’t think about you ‘til tomorrow

[Verse 2]
It wasn’t enough, but you could’ve had the guts to face me
It would have meant so much, if you’d looked me in the eye
Why do I always fall for the ones who have no courage?
I must see some kind of beauty in their lies

[Pre-Chorus]
So I’m gonna play my favourite rhythm
Got to get you out my system
I would do anything to keep you off my mind
I’m gonna have to call my sisters
Be around the ones who listen
Anything to drown you out tonight
Tomorrow
Mmmm
Mmmm, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
Baby, you make me crazy
Why’d you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don’t think about you ‘til tomorrow

[Intro]
Oh, I, nanana-nanana-nanana-nanana, woah
Before you get a boyfriend

[Verse 1]
Please pardon me for keeping distance
It's not that I don't seek persistence but
I like what this is, how it is
So I hope you don't look at it as me being different
Because you know I don't got no secret mission
I reside between your thighs, baby switch positions
Now we're looking eye to eye, I hear your thoughts, listen
Baby I already love you but just won't admit it
Maybe I fell in love with you the day I saw you
Maybe you fell in love with me the night we did it
Maybe you already love me and just won't spit it
One thing I can say our love is how you ain't tripping
Ain't tripping over the hoes
Ain't slipping under unknown
Just kissin', rubbing your kitten
Got fingers all in your
Ain't dipping in the with O
Just slipping out of the clothes
Dipping out of the robe
It's getting out of control like

[Chorus]
Oh, I, nanana-nanana-nanana-nanana, woah
Before you get a boyfriend, girl
Oh, I, nanana-nanana-nanana-nanana, woah
Before you get a boyfriend

[Verse 2]
She got them hips turn style hot
I'm ready to rock and roll
Proper spliffs, well she got, she know how to scroll
All this place is pain but she paid the toll
And when I'm in a rush she understands the give and go
The dominance is prominent, the mutual is crucial, girl
Put my metal in your microwave (So we could watch it blow)
And if you need anything don't hesitate to let me know
And I'll be there in a jiffy with a stiffy in the piffy (Like ah)
When it comes to you I have not because I asked nice
You're spaced out, I'm an astronaut
Letting time fly by and what not
But you never throw shade though the sun hot
We don't need no sunblock
My closure blinker
Feel the love but never speak up
While I get to know you deeper
While I mix the track while you mix the margarita
While you start dance while I'm turning up the speaker
No, I'm not that type to link up but I kinda
'Cause I'ma see another bad drip and wanna holla
But maybe we could build, if it's not a problem
But either way I just had to keep it honest like

[Chorus]
Oh, I, nanana-nanana-nanana-nanana, woah
Before you get a boyfriend, girl
Oh, I, nanana-nanana-nanana-nanana, woah
Before you get a boyfriend

Oh, I, nanana-nanana-nanana-nanana, woah
Before you get a boyfriend, girl
Oh, I, nanana-nanana-nanana-nanana, woah
Before you get a boyfriend

[Verse 1]
Tough choice? Don't make me laugh
My life's a joke, your life's a gas
You broke my heart at midnight mass
Now I'm the ghost of Christmas past
The only choice you gave to me
Is one I took reluctantly
'Cause when we play democracy
You always take immunity

[Chorus]
How long 'til we sink to the bottom of the sea?
How long, how long?
How long 'til we sink and it's only you and me?
How long, how long?

[Post-Chorus]
How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la-la)

[Verse 2]
What's the point of getting clean?
You'll wear the same old dirty jeans
What's the point of being seen?
Those eyes are cruel, those eyes are mean
What's the point of human beings?
A Sharpie face on tangerines
Why's it felt like Halloween since Christmas 2017?

[Chorus]
How long?
How long, how long?
How long 'til we sink and it's only you and me?
How long, how long?

[Post-Chorus]
How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la-la)

[Verse 3]
Getting to the top
Wasn't supposed to be this hard
The house is on Mulholland Drive
The car's on Sunset Boulevard
The registration's here with me
Neither of us has the key
We can live down in the flats
The hills will fall eventually

[Chorus]
How long 'til we sink to the bottom of the sea?
How long, how long?
How long 'til we sink and it's only you and me?
How long, how long?

[Post-Chorus]
How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la-la)

[Outro]
How long?
How long?
How long?
How long?

How long 'til we sink to the bottom of the sea?
How long, how long?

[Hook]
Get up out of my face like
Who'd you think you are?
Talking all this trash like blady-blady-blah
Oh way oh, nah-uh
Oh way oh, nah-uh
Get up out of my face like
Who'd you think you are?
Make me wanna laugh like hady-hady-hah
Oh way oh, nah-uh
Oh way oh, nah-uh

[Chorus]
I know you like
The way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right
You're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it

[Verse 1]
Got you hooked, boy, I'm like a drug
If you want my love
Better smoke it up
You can look boy but don't you touch
If you want my love
Make me give a fuck

[Chorus]
I know you like
The way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right
You're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
Every time I think you’re gonna tell me something real, I’m way off
I’ll listen, but I’m wishing you could tell me something else

Every time I think it’s gonna be a simple thing, I’m way off
I’ll stop searching, and start learning how these all seem to go

Every time I think this little moment’s gonna stay, I’m way off
What was lasting, is now passing through on to something else
Real life
(LC motherfucker)
Real life

All the shit I ate, fighting all the hate
Saved by a magic fridge, since ’86
When my car won’t start, cloned my debit card
I’m pregnant with future me, I’m my baby

So much believing, made it a real thing
(So now)

Getting crazier everyday
Never sleeping always awake
The endless party is here finally
From now on that’s real life baby
Real life is crazy, real life baby
Real life is fucked up, real life finally
Real life is crazy, real life baby
Real life is fucked up, real life finally
See another place, can I slap your face?
Get all my sleeping in, crowd surf napping
Get that extra glance, in my donut pants
Shitstorm is right on time, 30 looks fine

So much believing, made it a real thing
(So now)

Getting crazier everyday
Never sleeping always awake
The endless party is here finally
From now on that’s real life baby

Real life is crazy, real life baby
Real life is fucked up, real life finally
Real life is crazy, real life baby
Real life is fucked up, real life finally
You said you would always be around, nothing to think about
But where were you when things came crashing down, nowhere to be found

Now that it’s the end and it’s just me, all by myself, I’ll
Hold my breath until the earth stands still

You said you would always be around, nothing to think about
But where were you when things came crashing down
You said you would always be around, nothing to think about
But where were you when things came crashing down

How can you hang me out to dry
Feeling that everything I do is wrong
And maybe we don’t see eye to eye
All that I ever do is try
Sometimes it’s hard to just let go
Alone in your world can be so cold
Why does it have to unfold
Maybe it’s just a misunderstanding

You said you would always be around, nothing to think about
But where were you when things came crashing down
You said you would always be around, nothing to think about
But where were you when things came crashing down
Maybe it’s just a misunderstanding
A feeling I can’t explain
The last time you went away
Some nights I still believe
You’re laughing right next to me
Just like the brightest star
Still dark when you are far
Watching your tail lights fade
Killed me in such strange ways

(Yeah)
Fantasies in my pantasies baby
Runaway fast paced fat ass fantasy
Fantasies in your pantasies baby
Runaway first place full face fantasy
Fantasies, fantasies

Fantasies in my pantasies baby
Runaway fast paced fat ass fantasy
Fantasies in your pantasies baby
Runaway first place full face fantasy
Fantasies, fantasies

Let me freak out the fan base
Are you around late?
Can I borrow your face?
I got blood that needs veins
(freaky times I have with you)

You are a psycho
I am a weirdo
Imperfections better
Nightmares getting wetter
(freaky times I have with you)
Harder than your best picture
Softer than a corpse whisper
If our friends only knew
(the freaky times I have with you)

Teeth are crooked but the stars are straight
And both point to you
(yeah)

This whole thing is nice and kinda strange
Both are the truth
(yeah)

Fantasies in my pantasies baby
Runaway fast paced fat ass fantasy
Fantasies in your pantasies baby
Runaway first place full face fantasy
Fantasies, fantasies

E.T.A. stretching
Feeling kinda sexy
Empty road’s ready, for my Buick
(freaky times I have with you)

At least cloud 8, doing
In-flight refueling
High above cliches we will never use
(freaky times I have with you)
Scratch mark taker
Scream translator
I’ll introduce you to the neighbors
(freaky times I have with you)

Right amount of scary
Skim my dictionary
Good and evil left the room
(the freaky times I have with you)
Freaky visions from your room
Freaky times I have with you

With you
With you
With you
Freaky times I have with you
Right now
Somehow
You got to have it
Built up
True love?
You believe it
(thinking): “Baby, it’s amazing, this conversation”

You see, a dream, through the boulders
But then…

You blew your load, it’s over (yeah, yeah)
That love was just a loaner (yeah, yeah)
Now real life’s taking over (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you don’t know what the hell you’re doing there

In bed
So dead
And so damn different
It took no time
To remind
Where things line up
(thinking): “Baby, it’s amazing, the talk got smaller”
Shrinking, thinking, real thoughts again
Because…
You blew your load it’s over (yeah, yeah)
That love was just a loaner (yeah, yeah)
Now real life’s taking over (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you don’t know what the hell you’re doing there
Everything is good
Don’t you see
You say I gotta go
Now I need more time

More time
Does it have to end?
I don’t want it
Can I just stay right here a little longer?

I really thought a lot of time was left
Just a big surprise you can’t expect
Right when things are fine
It’s gotta end
My life is what I want
And now it’s spent

More time
Do I have to go?
I don’t want to
Can I just stay right here a little longer?
More time
Does it have to end? I don’t want it
Can I just stay right here a little longer?
A little bit more, a little bit more
Time

Now the sky is blue, no more gray
Why’s it have to end?
Please I pray for more time

More time
Do I have to go?
I don’t want to
Can I just stay right here a little longer?
More time
Does it have to end?
I don’t want it
Can I just stay right here a little longer?

I knew at some point I’d have to go
I guess it’s right now
I didn’t know
Right when things are good
I must leave
Right when life is good
I can’t believe

More time
Do I have to go?
I don’t want to
Can I just stay right here a little longer?
More time
Does it have to end?
I don’t want it
Can I just stay right here a little longer?

I’m not done
I need more time
I need just a little longer
I don’t want to leave now
Can I stay a little longer?

A little bit more
A little bit more
Time
What is that sound? Thats me scraping the ground
Under the hype, my B-2 bomber life
Deep in the hunt, my paycheck is my gun
The unending fight, to call myself alive

I’m
Trying not to die
Trying not to die
Trying not to die
Trying not to die
Trying not to die
Trying not to die

You maybe might, just use the wrong pipe
Driving a car, and barely move your arm
Need help to sleep, a little bit too deep
The unending fight, to call yourself alive

We’re
Trying not to die
Trying not to die
Trying not to die
Trying not to die
Trying not to die
Trying not to die
I’m trying my best
Would I care at all in heaven, so amazing to even get in
Would it even be as nice, as a drive with you at night

Would I care at all in space, the most endless possible place
Would it even reach as deep, as a memory of you and me

Would I care if I reach my dreams, before my time to leave
Would that even be as cool, as dreaming about you

And when it comes that time, and all my life goes by
I think I just might, see a drive with you at night
People, hand in hand
Have I lived to see the milk and honey land?
Where hate's a dream and love forever stands
Was this a vision in my mind?

The law was never passed
But somehow men feel they are truly free at last
Have we really gone this far through space and time
Was this a vision in my mind?

I'm not one who make believes
I know the leaves are green
They only turn to brown
When autumn comes around

I know just what I say
Today's not yesterday
And all things have an ending

But what I'd like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful
Or do we have to find our wings and fly away
To the vision in our minds
I'm not one who makes believes
I know that leaves are green
They only turn to brown
When autumn comes around

I know just what I say
Today's not yesterday
And all things have an ending

But what I'd like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful
Or do we have to find our winds and fly away
To the vision in our minds

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
You know I met her in Miami, that my baby
She know a young nigga ballin' just like McGrady
I'm tryna give her the keys to that Mercedes
I take her over the seas because I'm wavy
And we not really in love but we go crazy
Shawty I can't blame you, you can't blame me
Shawty I can't play you, you can't play me
'Cause you do your thing two, I do my thing three
Any way that you put it, look it's the same thing
Bitch I'm wavy, I done pulled up in a 'cedes
Pockets on young and rich, let a nigga hate me
I'ma young rich nigga, can't believe I made it
Man I came from Kraft dinner, eatin' KD
Sleeping on the floor mats in the basement
Life hit me hard and I had to face it
I could never tell you niggas what them days did
You was with a nigga through the time I wasted
Smoked up, drinked up, I was wasted
Fame on the way and I could nearly taste it
They left me for dead, I could never rate it
Hit the block with me, niggas with me, they did
I just came from the bottom and it's back to basics
Shawty held me down, now when I'm famous
I just wanna ball hard, I know where my lane is
I'm feeling sedated, you got me waitin'
Shawty you know you're fine
And yeah you know you remind me of a bad little baby
Touching and tasting, when I get you alone
I send tingles up your spine and baby you know I

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
'Fore I made it out the gutter I was dreaming
'Fore I made it out the gutter I was dreaming

Met her in Miami walking outta Fingalicking (Nyamin')
Half innocent, half Video vixen (Want two of her)
Low mileage pussy, she want commitment (Woah)
I don't know too much about love
Ay, I'm from Memphis where your girlfriend and best friend are witness and co-defendant (Big facts)
Shit crazy, the world that we live in (Damn)
Snitches still livin' while real niggas get sentenced
('Fore I made it out the gutter I was dreaming)
They love me for dead, I point out the hating (Hating)
Fast forward things, blues bustin' out the jean (Jean)
I bet on myself first, now I'm all in (Bet on me)
Will you be my b-a-b-y? (Bae)
All them hoes man and I see why (Yeah)
I was switching planes, mid lanes of the G5 (Touring)
Good in any hood from the south to the east side (Bagg)

Rolling the dice

Revenge is sweet
Come and taste this, uh-oh

Please just shut your mouth, mouth
Knock it back, swallowed it right down, down (Uh)

Play your cards right, you'll win my heart
Thought I knew you but you're not so fair

China Girl is a little girl
From a town, that's all ya need to know
Lolita was a man-eater
Clocked him like a taxi meter
Fuck gold, she was platinum digger
Shakin-ass-making moves on a mover
Visa, then a plane ride to ya'
Peace out, she'll kill you like Uma

She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her
And sucked on a lollipop

[Verse 2]
Chinna Girl grew up to be a big girl
Had her sights set on a bigger world
Dial-a-Bride from Sri Lanka
Found herself a Yorkshire banker
Need a Visa? Got with a geezer
Need some money? Paid him with a knees-up
Year later, started to ease up
Got her own way, shouted out "see ya"

She skipped away to the shop

Damn, those is your sisters
You did somethin' unholy to them pictures
Damn, you need to be locked up
Nah, we need a bigger hot tub

[Chorus]
Now let me see your back, back, back, back
Time to get the bag, bag, bag, bag
We don't throw stones, we throw stacks
That's why they goin' mad, mad, mad, Max
If you don't say your name then I won't ask
She got a smartphone, but a dumb ass
I thought of all of this on Ecstasy

[Verse 2]
You got sick thoughts? I got more of 'em
You remember bad bitches that you smashed? I recorded 'em
She said, "Fuck weed," 'cause she love X

And we gon' score a hundred on this drug test

Now let me see your back, back, back, back

[Verse 1]
Look, I ain't never had a benzo
Nope, I pushed me an Ac wit the tintzo
Nosey niggas is peakin' in my window
Have a hard time looking
I tell you second hand that's a hard grind cooking
Cause my pop was in it so deep
If his son wanted in it these dealers would probably drop percentage
Instead, I drop bars like I'm two months sober
Its my time now so them you months over

Yeah if I want it I find me a way to get that
I'm trying to get to the point where I can sit back
Took a lot of patience and action
I grind so I'm anticipating relaxing
I'm thinking bout replacing the Jacksons on top of the charts
I don't need brothers fillin' space in the back than
So from the kid with the sun tan flow
The hottest ticket in town to this one man show

[Chorus]
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E

[Verse 2]
I can easily make'em admit to bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah you best believe that I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So they don't like me and throw parties and yet they never invite me
I can't lie sometime it bother me slightly

Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm and its obvious so who can tell
And no this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection though we both got the light complexion
Couple things that I do that well
And the way that I Jack-son you think that Drake new Sam-L 

[As in Samuel Jackson]
I've been real though 

[?]
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble but I live vain
With more deals on the table than a bridge game

[Chorus]
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E

Ay-ah, ay-ah
I don't got nothin' to prove
Bible, the bible, the truth
Fuck it, I know you know
Fuck it, I know you know
Ay-ah, ay-ah

Imma take you offline, offline

[Chorus]
I'm doing this shit, mama, I'm doing this shit big
I just copped the new foreign, a lil' over a quarter million
It cost me like 260, (260)
I eat with the 5 stars
That perc got a nigga high, (geeked)
Right now I'm a flyin' star
You can get popped with the 12 gauge
Don't let the cops get the shell case
I should just work for the president
'Cause a young nigga don't leave a fucking trace
Bitch, I'm so high than the nosebleed
Lil' bitch got a booty like Rakishi
Lil' bitch looking hot as a Taki
Beat all these boys like I'm Rocky, ayy

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I got green like a lobster
Fuck all these hoes like a pornstar
My momma she said I'm a born star
We got that stuff white like a corn starch
I tatted my body like king toes
We let that shit fly like flamingos
That bitch done lucked up like a bingo
I think that I'm Future, the peacoat
I told her come get some these cash, baby
I know that you heard by these last, baby
You going against me you gon' cry, baby
You going against us, it won't last, baby
We sit back, get geeked and just laugh, baby
We ball like we play with the Cavs, baby
Lil' momma she's tall, she a stall', yeah
Her dirt in the bird like a falcon
Penny loafers, girl, I thought I told you, birds like Robbins
Coming down bleeding on that Texas floor just choppin'
Cash, cash, cash, cash, cash never stoppin'
Pull up in a Jag, nigga, splash 

[?] choppa
Baby I know you gon' tell if I smoke 'em
Meanwhile, just suck on my dick like a sucker (Yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a big B, no honey, no poker
Bitch, I'm a slime, I'm a snake, I'm a cobra
No slippin', not going out bad
No going out sad, don't do that
Never slippin', grab the mac
Never slippin' grab the mac (Ah no!)
Catch me fucking all your folks
Catch me stroking like a boat (Oh yeah)
Got her slurpin' 'til she croaks
Rhyme like a book, nigga, coat
Twist your flag like a Taliban
Kill your man like Afghanistan
I'm gettin' cheese like a Packer fan
I ran it up then I bought the Lamb' (Woo)

[Chorus]
I'm doing this shit, mama, I'm doing this shit big
I just copped the new foreign, a lil' over a quarter million
It cost me like 260 (Quarter)
I eat with the 5 stars (Yee)
That perc got a nigga high (Got a perk)
Right now I'm a flyin' star
You can get popped with the 12 gauge
Don't let the cops get the shell case
I should just work for the president
'Cause a young nigga don't leave a fucking trace (Prezzy, Prezzy)
Bitch, I'm so high than the nosebleed
Lil' bitch got a booty like Rakishi
Lil' bitch looking hot as a Taki
Beat all these boys like I'm Rocky, ayy
(Thugga)

[Verse 2]
Pour up some Actavis and park the car
I just now ride the Bentley, fuck the law
Hop out another foreign right beside you
Hop out and watch them bitches drop their jaw
Put on some ice and watch them niggas Porsche
Hit like Mike Tyson, watch a nigga box
Looking so righteous, niggas get the point
Let all these real niggas out of the joint
Hittin' their grandma's go get it
I'm on their head like a fitted
I'm a badass like them Billy's
Pull out and nut on them titties
I might bless her with a baby
Left her shocked like a taser
In the club with some players
I kept grindin' and now I'm paid up, ayy
(Really rich, really rich, yeah)
Wheezy Beats
(Hey!)

[Chorus]
I'm doing this shit, mama, I'm doing this shit big
I just copped the new foreign, a lil' over a quarter million
It cost me like 260, I eat with the 5 stars
That perc got a nigga high, right now I'm a fly star
You can get popped with the 12 gauge
Don't let the cops get the shell case
I should just work for the president
'Cause a young nigga don't leave a fucking trace
Bitch, I'm so high than the nosebleed
Lil' bitch got a booty like Rakishi
Lil' bitch looking hot as a Taki

[Outro]
Penny loafers, girl, I thought I told you, birds like Robbins
Cash, cash, cash, cash, cash never stoppin'
Baby I know you gon' tell if I smoke 'em
Bitch, I'm a big B, no honey, no poker

[Verse 1]
You said, "I can't take no more"
Lying by the sycamore
And I know we've both been here before
You said, "Fuck, let's leave the blame"
But heartache always feels the same
And I know we've both been here before

[Chorus]
Oh, here I am, settled in at your house
Broken blinds keep the light coming out
And I am just the shape I'm in
Ooh, here I am, settled in, crying out
Finding all the things that I can't do without
Oh, I am giving in
Oh, I'm in retrograde
Oh, I'm in retrograde
Retrograde

[Verse 2]
Standing staring straight ahead
Listening when Stevie says, mmm
"Come out of the darkness"
Feeling all I've ever known
Fall away and letting go
Oh, come out of the darkness

[Chorus]
Ooh, here I am, settled in on your floor
Quieting all the world outside your door
And I am reckoning
Oh, here I am, settling, freaking out
You bring me in to help me, let me get me out
Oh I, I, I, I'm in retrograde
I'm in retrograde

[Outro]
Oh, if only I could give in
If I could get out
If only I could break in
If you could let me out
If only I could let go
If I could sit out
If only I could get back
If I could let me out
Oh, I'm in retrograde
Yeah, mmm
I'm in retrograde
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I remember way back, late night, throwback
Sitting on the front lawn, talking
When I lost it, and oh, I lost it
I remember you were saying you would come back, run back
Find me on the front porch like that
But you waited, so I got wasted

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I've always said
I'd never let myself hold on this long

[Chorus]
'Cause people change overnight
Things get strange, but I'm alright
I'm still here, and I'm still high
And I'll still meet you in the middle of the night
But if you lie to me, lie to me, lie to me
I'm gone

[Verse 2]
I still wonder if I called you, what would I do?
Leave a too-long voicemail that I hate and then erase it
Like I planned it
And I wonder if I still lived in the city, would I see you at a party?
Take a big sip of my whiskey and then leave quickly
And pray you missed me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And though I still know exactly how this ends
I keep holding on

[Chorus]
'Cause people change overnight
Things get strange, but I'm alright
I'm still here, and I'm still high
And I'll still meet you in the middle of the night
You know, I'll meet you in the middle of the night
But if you lie to me
I'm gone

[Bridge]
Oh, I feel it in me, please forgive me
Leave this memory, don't say you miss me
I know it's still in me, please forgive me
Leave this memory, don't say you miss me

[Chorus]
'Cause people change overnight
Things get strange, but I'm alright
I'm still here, and I must still be high
'Cause I'll still meet you in the middle of the night
But if you lie to me, lie to me
Change overnight
Things get strange, but I'm alright (I'm alright, I'm holding on)
I'm still here, and I must still be high
But I'll still meet you in the middle of the night
Oh, if you meet me in the middle of the night
You know, I'll meet you in the middle of the night
But if you lie to me, lie to me, yeah, lie to me
I'm gone

[Verse 1]
Oh, I could feel the change a'coming
Felt it in the breeze
Oh, I could feel the change a'coming
Coming right for me
Oh, I could feel the change a'coming
Saw it on TV
Oh, I could feel the change a'coming
Saw it staring right on back at me

[Verse 2]
Oh, I could feel the shadow coming
Straight on down the line
Masquerading like it was a friend of mine
Oh, I could feel the darkness
Wrapping all its arms in mine
Oh, I could feel the world was turning
All inside my mind
Oh, I could feel the world was turning
All inside, all inside my mind

[Bridge]
I knew it when it started
Felt the shift right as it parted
Saw my feet right down below me
Saw the whole room move around me
Saw my old life and my old friends
Saw me haunted, saw me back again

[Verse 3]
Oh, maybe there's a past life coming out inside of me
Maybe it's the song I'm singing
Maybe everything's just turning out how it should be
Maybe there's a past life coming out inside of me
Oh, maybe there’s a past life coming out inside, inside of me

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Hey, baby
Even though you break my heart
I still love you

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Sorry
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive me (forgive me)
And you can say, baby (baby)
My baby, can I hold you tonight?
And maybe if I told you the right words
Ooh, at the right time
You'd be Nas

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo
That bitch is always flippin'
You niggas never listen
We make a perfect team
Balling Jordan and Scottie Pippen
But I'ma let you dip in
That wax sauce drippin'
Said that when you with a boss bitch, now you can tell the difference
You be like jungle digger
I don't want another nigga
I wanna make you 'bout a legend, but I make you bigger
Tinkerbell, Peter Pan
No bitches badder than me when I pull up
Got 'em screaming like a temper tan'
Ayo, DJ, drop the beat
My gun didn't fall but I drop the heat
I love how we kept it on the low, mad discreet (I'm in a rush!)
Pass me the keys to my jeep (truck)
I hit 'em with it, I'ma kill 'em with that wine wine
Ain't losin' watches, but with me, he always find time
We keep it classy when we eatin' it's that fine dine
But between love and hate, baby, it's a fine line

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Sorry
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive me (forgive me)
And you can say, baby (baby)
My baby, can I hold you tonight?
And maybe if I told you the right words
Ooh, at the right time
You'd be Nas

[Verse 2: Nas]
A mack
I used to mack with the MAC on me
Project parties, lights off, mad horny
Dutty wine and feel the gun I'm hidin'
She still grindin' on me, smilin' at me
I'm like "Hi, I'm Nasty"
"God bless ya, met ya'"
Thought you were sexy as ever
Flexing with your ex, I couldn't disrespect ya'
Later on, I undress ya, couldn't wait to sex ya'
Made a nigga wait so long, but it was special
Light travel faster than sound
Lightning strike one second every point two miles
So when you first saw me emerge from a weed cloud
Electricity touch your soul, that's how I get down
Gangsta love
Completing each other
Touching tongues so close, we could breathe for each other
Untouchable boy with the illustrious girl
But maybe being together's too much for the world, sorry

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Sorry
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive me (forgive me)
And you can say, baby (baby)
My baby, can I hold you tonight?
And maybe if I told you the right words
Ooh, at the right time
You'd be Nas

[Verse 1]
Woman
Caught behind those burning eyes
Tangled up in morning white
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?

[Verse 2]
Woman
Watch her take me by surprise
When she lets me call her mine
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know the loneliness you've known
I don't hear the frosty words echo inside
When you're gone again

[Chorus]
I can't read your mind though I'm trying all the time, oh-oh-ohh
There's something I don't know, I can see it in your eyes
As the night ascends, all will slow again, oh-oh-ohh
I am left in awe of the woman I adore

[Verse 3]
Woman
I never had such a sight
Burn itself onto my mind
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But say the sun doesn't shine for you
I hope you learn that that's not true, in time
When you're gone again
Just as long again

[Chorus]
I can't read your mind though I'm trying all the time
There's something I don't know, I can see it in your eyes
As the night ascends, all will slow again
But I am left in awe of the woman I adore
I can't read your mind though I'm trying all the time
There's something I don't know, I can see it in your eyes
But as the night ascends, all will slow again
And I am left in awe of the woman I adore

[Intro]
1, 2, 3

[Verse 1]
All day permanent red
The glaze on my eyes
When I heard your voice
The distance caught me by surprise again
And I know you claim that you're alright

[Verse 2]
But fix your eyes on me
I guess I'm all you have
And I swear you'll see the dawn again

[Chorus]
Well I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light

[Verse 3]
Relate to my youth
Well I'm still in awe of you
Discover some new truth
That was always wrapped around you

[Verse 4]
But don’t just slip away in the night
And don’t just hurl your words from on high

[Chorus]
Well I know I had it all on the line
But don’t just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light

[Bridge]
If we come back and we’re broken
Unworthy and ashamed
Give us something to believe in
And you know we’ll go your way

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
And I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light

[Chorus]
It's broken
Our love
It's broken
It's broken
Our love
It's broken

[Verse]
Distant stars
Come in black or red
I've seen their worlds
Inside my head
They connect
With the fall of man
They breathe you in
And really nice to be but

[Bridge]
There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to him
He is an outer heart
And the space has been broken

[Chorus]
It's broken
Our love
Broken
It's broken
Our love
Broken
It's broken
Our love
Broken
It's broken
Our love
Broken

[Verse 1: Bootie Brown]
Now in my younger days, I used to sport a shag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at 3 o'clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still, I had to let her pass

[Chorus 1]
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on pa--

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Everybody's here with me
We've got no camera to see
Don't think I'm all in this world
The camera won't let me roll
The verdict doesn't love our soul
The digital won't let me go

[Chorus 2: 2-D]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll pay
When tomorrow
Tomorrow comes today

[Unintelligible]
I loved you for a little, a little while
I think you know that!
It would have worked for a little
Except for that day you...
It's not like you to be here
When you said you won't!

But in the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!
It's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain
It kills me to say this
It really does, it kills my heart!
But I might still love you
Reason we're just fallen apart
But it's not like me to answer
Gonna change my mind!
But in the pouring rain, You changed everything
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!
And it's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain

Oh, am I...
All I torn myself I would be losing!
But in the pouring rain, can you feel my pain?
My tears are falling down from the sky!
In the pouring rain, I can feel...
I wonder who you love tonight
Oh, in the pouring rain
In the pouring rain
Oh, in the pouring rain!
In the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed my mind

[Verse 1]
It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes
It would've been good for you to be there
And every time you always would
Everything seems to have a picture perfect time
And nothing seems to be a blur

[Chorus]
It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one for you

[Verse 2]
Would've been cool to never fall down
But then I never would've seen
The power isn't with the picture perfect person
You told me better things to come from in between

[Chorus]
It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one, saying one, saying one for you

[Bridge]
It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes

[Chorus - Shortened]
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one for you

[Verse 1]
Standing on a street somewhere I don't wanna be
In a town that's made of stone
Some bad directions must have me here by mistake
'Cause this sure ain't what I call home

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can get out of here, and

[Chorus]
Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

[Verse 2]
Standing on a road leading to a barn
With a cat named Eloise
Later on, we'll all go fishing in the pond
But all we'll catch is just a summer breeze

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can stay right here, and

[Chorus]
Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

[Bridge]
When the pond is gone and Eloise floats away
I find myself staring at the same old day
I need to go back, back to where I feel so free
Well, it looks like I'm going back to Tennessee

[Chorus]
I let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
Just me and Eloise
And I'm in Tennessee

[Intro]
Uhm
Uhm
Uhm

[Verse 1]
Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe
I'm on my knees right now

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
I'm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I'm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

[Verse 2]
I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe
I'm on my knees right now

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
I'm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I'm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

[Bridge]
Same old love, I'm so sick of that
Same old love, I'm so sick of that
Same old love, that same old love

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

She told me add the bassline
And everything will be fine
She told me add the sound of the drums, drums

[Verse 1: 2D]
Give up if you wanna survive
Get oh so alive in your life
Everything falling out the sky on top of you
Now what you do?
Set yourself up now
It's the love of your life
Shallowly on me
All I know before it's gone
I always feel it's getting you down
If nothing's wrong
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?

[Verse 2: 2D]
Give up if you wanna survive
Pick the sun back up
You got to get on the song, lonely
What's the point?
It's funny 'til you're left to kill yourself
In this town
So what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna wake up, yes and no
I'm gonna kiss some part of
I'm gonna keep this secret
I'm gonna close my body now

I guess, die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess, die another day

I guess I'll die another day (Another day)
I guess I'll die another day (Another day)
I guess I'll die another day (Another day)
I guess I'll die another day

Analyze this
Analyze this
Analyze this, this, this, this, this

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna break the cycle
I'm gonna shake up the system
I'm gonna destroy my ego
I'm gonna close my body now

[Chorus 2]
I think I'll find another way
There's so much more to know
I guess I'll die another day
It's not my time to go
For every sin, I'll have to pay
A time to work, a time to play
I think I'll find another way
It's not my time to go

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna avoid the cliché
I'm gonna suspend my senses
I'm gonna delay my pleasure
I'm gonna close my body now

I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day

Closing both my eyes
Shutting out the world
Going deep inside
Within me

So much has been lost
In this world
So im looking for love
Within me

Oh i really hope its there
I hope its there

Closing both my eyes
Shutting out the world
Going deep inside
Within me
So much has been lost
In this world
So im looking for love
Inside me
Oh i really hope its there
I hope there's love to spare

[Verse 1]
Come on baby now, let me look at you
Talking 'bout yourself, try to tell the truth
I could stay up half the night, trying to crack your code
I could stay up half the night, but I'd rather hit the road

[Pre-Chorus]
On the night that I met you, I was on the town
On the night that I met you

[Chorus]
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you, I just want it fuh you

[Verse 2]
Come on baby now, help me work it out
I won't let you down so you don't need to shout
I could stay up half the night, playing with your head
I could stay up half the night, but I'd rather go to bed

[Pre-Chorus]
On the night that I met you, I was on the town
On the night that I met you

[Chorus]
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you, I just want it fuh you

[Bridge]
And everyday, in every way
And everyday, in every way

[Chorus]
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you, I just want it fuh you
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you

[Chorus]
Freak like me
You want a good girl that does bad things to you
You never been with no one as nasty as me
Spice up your life, come get a freak
Do, do-do, do-do, do-do
Freak like me

[Verse 1]
Tied him down to my queen bed
Tease him just enough to hate me (Hate me)
Tied it tight enough, he can't break free (Break free)
Keep him waiting 'til he try
This can go one of two ways
We could flip the coin, I'll be your slave (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Call you daddy, give me a nickname (Ah)
I ain't afraid of a little pain (No, I ain't 'fraid of a little pain)
Yo, yo, yo, yo (Ah)
He wanted some'n else and he wanna be selfish
He wanted them three rounds, DC had to come help him
Look, I know your position
Try to squeeze in the full nelson though
Beat on it, beat, beat on it, mercy like a black belt give
Daddy the grand master, daddy, I want it faster
Them bitches you fuckin' with, I know they gon' need some practice
So bring 'em along wit' ya, I'll teach 'em how to smash ya
When I made a little mess on it, he told me to clean my act up

[Chorus]
Freak like me (Tryna freak you down)
You want a good girl that does bad things to you

Spice up your life, come get a freak

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 2]
Hey, I could take a big bat, bet that he thinkin' this a game
Hey, batter, batter swing, you could put it on a swing
Freak like a triple XXX flick, put her on a chain
This pussy off the chain, this kitty insane
I could fuck him in the rain, I could fuck him in the Range (Uh)
I could fuck him every day (Uh), I'ma fuck him 'til he sang (Uh)
Milkshake bring the boys to the yard, I'ma need the whipped cream
Ain't ever been vanilla, honey, just wait until you get a taste
Skirt off, fuck in the backseat
Take that shirt off, baby, put it on me
Got me like, "Yeehaw," ride it like a horsey
Kinda like see-saw, up and down on the D, give it to him

[Chorus]
Freak like me (Need a freak like me)
You want a good girl that does bad things to you (You want a good girl)
You never been with no one as nasty as me
Spice up your life, come get a freak
Do, do-do, do-do, do-do (Now you need a freak)
Freak like me
Freak like me (You never, you never, you never been)
You want a good girl that does bad things to you
You never been with no one as nasty as me
Spice up your life, come get a freak (You need a freak)
Do, do-do, do-do, do-do (You need a freak)
Freak like me (Like me, papa)

[Outro]
Babe, you never been with no one nastier than me
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Hold me in your arms, baby
Squeeze me oh so tight

[Skit: Rickey Thompson]
Sad on your motherfucking b-day? Bitch, what the fuck?! Don’t you realize you popping? Every time you walk in the room, you break necks. Necks?! But you telling me you sad on your motherfucking b-day?

[Intro: Aminé]
Yeah
Yeah
Ahem
Yeah

[Verse 1: Aminé]
I sit here and tell you my problems, that’s how this work, right?
I’m s’posed to be open and honest, but I got time, right?
My niggas having seshes, and I’m doing sessions
Can’t man up if masculinity your only weapon
Man, I’ve thought about suicide a hundred times
But I'd hate to disappoint and see my momma cry
Birthdays these days be the worst days
'Cause I know I’m getting older and not happier
Me and my father love each other, but we barely show it
He hates that I left home, and the lawn is now his to mow it
He look at my generation and think that fashion's over
I'll kill my sister if she ever model Fashion Nova (True)
I'm always on a flight (Mm), or I'm in a hurry (Yeah)
I miss when losing my virginity was my only worry (Yeah)
Back when putting on a condom had me really scary (Scared)
And milkshakes were the only time we'd eat a cherry (*Pop*)
I think learnin' how to eat pussy from someone who eat pussy
Is better than learnin' from someone who doesn't
And that's word to my ex, and that's word to my tongue (Yeah)
And that's word to the woman who had my heart beatin' drums (Drums, drums)
Yeah, love is what I cherished and Ms. Parrish (Yeah)
Flew all the way to Paris and we made out on my terrace (Yeah)
I kept it on the low-low, 'cause I was in love (Love)
And the shade I had in my room was already enough ('Nuff)
I'm going on some dates, and I'm making some plans
But it's hard to find some love if the girl is a fan (Fan)
And after we fuck, she want a picture with me
She got me feeling like Paper Boi, but I cry when she leaves, yeah

[Chorus: Aminé]
These intros ain't meant to be bangers
They meant for you and me so we'll never end up as strangers
Will Ferrell's ass can't even handle this weather
Tune in your speakers and please be my Dr. Whoever
I said, I said, these intros ain't meant to be bangers
They meant for you and me so we'll never end up as strangers
Will Ferrell's ass can't even handle this weather (Woo)
Tune in your speakers and please be my Dr. Whoever, yeah

[Interlude: Aminé]
Yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Woo
Yes, sir
Yeah

Boy, you looking big mad
When you see a young brother up in first class (Yee)
And you damn right, my ego like Lavar Ball (Yuh)
They hate to see a black man who can't get blackballed (Skrt)
I said my paper long (Yuh), my paper long (Yuh)
You damn right, bitch (Bitch), my paper long (Hunh)
It's that yellow, mellow, fellow, yeah, that Yellowstone (Hey)
Play the cello for the fellows, fake as silicone (True)
I went from plaque in my teeth to having plaques on the wall
Gold album with platinum records
Who woulda thought? (Uh-huh)
Young nigga, like Jigga, tryna make me a boss
I'll take my mama to Louis
And take your girl to the Ross, nigga (Rrring)
Back in the muthafuckin' building (Yuh)
Your boo thing want my children (Yuh)
My net worth gon' be billions (Bih)
Shorty gimme head like ceiling (True)
Dick disappear, chameleon (True)
And like I'm motherfucking rolling (Yee)
My whip bought, it's not stolen (Brrr)

[Chorus: Aminé]
These intros ain't meant to be bangers
They meant for you and me so we'll never end up as strangers
Will Ferrell's ass can't even handle this weather
Tune in your speakers and please be my Dr. Whoever, yeah

[Verse 3: Aminé]
Hey, Doc, do I tell em how I actually feel? (Yeah)
Or do I see a therapist and numb the pain with the pills?
This for niggas play tough, won't even smile in mirrors (Nah)
"And we learned to fuck hoes off trial and error"
Friday nights, where them broke niggas ball out
And Aminé be the name that your girlfriend gon' call out (Call out)
To all my niggas with some melanin, let your feelings settle in
If you feeling worthless (Yeah), you should probably go and tell a friend (Tell it)
Yeah, but, I should take that advice
This year has been crazy, what the fuck is my life? (What?)
My best friend got married, you can bet that I cried
I met Spike and Brad Pitt; no malls, I'm Saks Fifth, nigga (Errr!)

[Skit: Rickey Thompson]
Get your shit together, and turn the fuck up!

[Intro: Aminé]

[Chorus: Aminé]
My wrist sore (My wrist), my wrist sore (My wrist)
You don't want no problems, bitch, no hiccups (No hiccups)

[Intro]
Yeah
This sound like
Yeah my momma told me to close the door
I don't wanna close it no more

[Chorus]
Ohh, I wonder why
Yeah, I wonder why, why

Why, why, why, why, why, why, why
(I'm gon' show no frowns)
Why, why, why

[Verse 1]
(Okay drop it) To the floor and I'm back
Had to relax and never relapse
Shoutout to Reese, the sex was like crack
I need love, I'm depressed, I'm a fool, I'm a mess
But my first priority is never second best
(I've been down, PCH with the fam)
I'm that nigga and I know it
(I can feel the sun hittin' on my veins)
Pupils dilated, they don't focus
(I can feel the sun hittin' on my veins)
Can't nobody ever know this, they can't know this
(Ridin' 'round ain't nobody on my brain)
Probably on some fast shit, should've done some acid
Runnin' through my last check, wish I knew some magic
Stressin' out crazy, wish I had a clone-me
Said she wanna talk, but I hope it's not a baby

[Chorus]
Ohh, I wonder why
Yeah, I wonder why, why
Yeah, I wonder why
Me I wonder why, why
Yeah, I wonder why
She wonder why, why
I wonder why
She be wondering why, why

Why, why, why, why, why, why, why
(I'm gon' show no frowns)
Why, why, why (Hey)

[Verse 2]
I just bought my momma a new whip, straight cash
I paid my taxes, so it hurts my racks
I hate when niggas say, "chill out", and they ain't got no chill
They let me skip the DMV line, that's when I knew it was real
I pulled up, like it goin' pretty fast
I'm the type to get the bag (Woo)
Fuck it, let's just count it fast
I don't know why I'm feeling down
I don't know no goofies, or no loose leafs
This ain't a hand out, don't take no cookies
Hey look I'm stressed out, I'm straight from movies
But this is real life, so let's just, you know what, fuck it

[Chorus]
Ohh, I wonder why
Yeah, I wonder why, why
Yeah, I wonder why
Me I wonder why, why
Yeah, I wonder why

Why, why, why (Why)

[Outro]
Running out of breath
Everytime we fuck
The sex is amazing
But it feels like a rush
I’m running out of breath
Everytime we fuck
The sex is amazing
But it feels like a rush (rush)

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna feel like I need ya
You're a catch but I'm not a receiver
I'm nervous what this might turn into
Know my skin glows whenever I see ya

[Chorus]
That's why I'm shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin'
That's why I'm shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin'

[Verse 1]
I fuck up like everyday, I fuck up in every way
I fuck up like when I pull up on Sunday at Chick-Fil-A
My-my dark twisted fantasy, beautiful insanity
When the rain pours, I'm the one you call your canopy
Face be moisturized, sun keep beamin' on your thighs
In Hawaii lookin' fly, my obsession multiplies, yeah
Butter on my fingers I'm nothing like Jerry Rice
When you glow, that's how I glow
So my feelings; they pay the price

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna feel like I need ya
You're a catch but I'm not a receiver
I'm nervous what this might turn into
Know my skin glows whenever I see ya

[Chorus]
That's why I'm shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin'
That's why I'm shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin'

[Verse 2]
Is this shit forever? Where's the evidence?
Should I even bother? I guess that's confidence
We sippin' sake soakin' sun so sofa's never comfy
So sorry summer's over but you still my lil' mami
I wake up, then get up, graveyard shift 'til 5
You stay up, then we fuck, you always down to ride
When she do the tip drill, throw it like a pinwheel
My problems only minor, nonexistent like a kids' will

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna feel like I need ya
You're a catch but I'm not a receiver
I'm nervous what this might turn into
Know my skin glows whenever I see ya

[Chorus]
That's why I'm shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin'
That's why I'm shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin'

[Intro]

Okay okay (yuh yuh), okay okay (yuh)
In my face like Cena so this moola be my soulmate (true)
Tuition in my mouth, your check on my neck (yuh)
Phone off you can't locate, Tee-WaTT, I need more bass

[Verse 1: Aminé]
I'm starin' at the window of this Buick (yuh!)
Hoes say I'm heroic but I told her I'm historic (hey!)
Bitch, ya boy a Borat and a Boris mixed with Maury (true!)
I'm out here with Topanga like I'm white and my name Cory

Looks like you a lame old goofy

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Bitch I'm fresh as hell, these Amiri’s now
Mike Amiri DM’d me on the ‘Gram
Told me do the Amiri challenge
Mixin’ Amiri jeans and jacket with the Guwop shirt
That’s the Amiri balance
Say I'm gettin' money, you accurate
You don't ever see me ridin' no Acura
This a Hellcat, 700 horsepower on that bitch
You can't hear me slide
Bitch, I'm hot, what's happenin'?
Gelato and Percocets one of my habits
Shit, if it shine, I'm buyin', 200, 300k for my diamonds
Ain't talkin' shit, I'm a savage
Reach for this bitch, I'm blastin' (bow!)

Who has nice hair? Me

Did you think this was a petting zoo?
Do I look like somebody's dog?
Do I look like somebody's cow?
Do I look like somebody's lamb? No!
Sit down!

[Chorus: Aminé]
I could be a sugar daddy, but I'd rather not
That's how I keep my money, baby, I got me a lot
I could be a sugar daddy, but I'd rather not
That's how I keep my money, baby, I got me a lot

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Shawty want a first class flight on a jet
I put her on Spirit if she can, South West
Look baby I ain't one of these oldheads
If you give me Blac Chyna I'ma leave you on read
My money is my money so I put it in my sock
Here's some advice bitch, go get a job
Shawty can't stand me, even with ten toes
That's why she got a Cash App and a Venmo
I'm Mike, Bad, Thriller, nigga
Dirty Diana's always in my dresser
La-di-da-di-da-da-da-da-da-da
I'm the hubby bebopa undercover
I got racks on racks on racks
And you know that's facts on facts on facts
Gold diggers want an all access pass
So she give me all access to that ass

[Chorus: Rico Nasty]
I could be a sugar momma, but I'd rather not
That's how I keep my money, baby, I got me a lot
I could be a sugar momma, but I'd rather not
That's how I keep my money, baby, I got me a lot (A lot!)

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
Sex sells, spend it on my retail
You gotta pay attention to the details
Always money when I check my email
Hotel by the seashore, got plenty seashells
I ain't got time for the he say she say
I just bought my own car and I ain't lease it
I can spend it on you but I ain't easy
He want me to buy him shoes, he ain't worth shoestrings
When I get into the show let me pull a few strings
Put the boy on game, he could learn a few things
Every old nigga talk the same old game
Selfish with my money and that shit won't change
You would think he went to school with the head game
I'ma let him break the rules if the head straight
But I'm good, I don't really need the deadweight (Naw)
I don't really need the deadweight, for real

[Chorus: Aminé & Rico Nasty]
We could be your sugar parents, but we'd rather not
We got a lot of money, baby, I know you wanna rock
We could be your sugar parents, but we'd rather not
We got a lot of money, baby, I know you wanna rock

[Intro: Rickey Thompson]
Before you talk that shit about me, how 'bout you clear your throat? I can hear you chokin' on my tenacious dick everytime your dumb ass talks shit about me. Like I said before, bitch, you're not shit, you're never gon' be shit, and you're just a piece of shit. So shut the fuck up!

[Verse]
(Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up)
Two milly in my hand, two milly for a jam
That's four milly in the can, the size of Pac's caravan
My wingspan 7 foot, right hand get a hook
Hit a lick then leave him shook, treat him just like police would
Mask on, niggas hard, mask off, niggas soft
Genius like I'm Steve Jobs, greedy like I'm Steve Jobs
Okay, you really wanna test me today
Okay, I hit em like I'm Bobby Boucher
They see me rollin' now, I'm tryna make a million
I got a new bitch, like I'm Ben Simmons
My ego big as Shaq, rockin' like Fu-Schnickens
Put it in her Ariana, like I'm Mariah's children
I smell the snake on the scene
For heaven's sake let him breathe
Pussy niggas talk shit like they really the man
And when we actually pull up you best don't front on 'em, man

[Chorus]
(Shut the fuck up) and why you whinin'?
(Shut the fuck up) aye, stop cryin'
Keep frontin' on my niggas, keep stylin'
If you sendin' threats then my niggas gon' find 'em
(Shut the fuck up) and why you whinin'?
(Shut the fuck up) aye, stop cryin'
Keep frontin' on my niggas, keep stylin'
If you sendin' threats then my niggas gon' find 'em

[Part I: RATCHET]

And if you ain't got a man, fuck with me boo

[Verse 1: Aminé]
I like when she call me daddy (Yeah), and she look back (Back!)
I like when shawty give me head on the drive back (Nasty)
I call her lil' mama when her lips gloss (True)
I like when shawty do the dummy on my dick raw

[Chorus: Aminé]

You've waited long, forever
A heart is worth the weather
You should go out and get her
And learn to love together

[Verse 1: Amine]
I fucked things up, I see it in this cup (Yeah)
I didn't mean to suck, I'm stuck
Sometimes I'm just too honest (Sorry), admittin' that it's common
I should've used my common sense
So now I've gots to vent (Yeah)
I can't stand you, but I want you
We s'posed to be together forever

[Pre-Chorus: Amine]
Leakin' from the pain, need a Band Aid (Hey!)

Swimmin' through your feelings, how I stay sane (Stay sane)
You're the one I need, I hope this really works (Really works)

Sick in love and baby you're my doctor
Talk to me, don't be scared to go a lil' more deep
Tell you everything like you're my doctor

Yah, yah

Feeling me, feeling you, head feeling warm
Head break, headaches in the Bentley
Crack kills, take a Advil when the bed shake
Steady on it, ready with it, that's a heavy dosage
Check up on it, baby watch it while he check up on it
Feeling hot, cold sweats got the fever now
Need a shot, need the cock, need to see the Doc

Give me life, please kill my pain
Numb this feeling in my veins
Boy prescribe me, I can't wait
Hypnotize me in every way

Open up wide, say 'ahh' when I ride
Take off in the day, house calls in the night
Beat it 'till the kitty sees stars in the night
Put the pussy in the ER in the night
Take one of these, twice, morning and night
And if i'm still walking you ain't tore it up right

Give me life, please kill my pain
Numb this feeling in my veins
Boy prescribe me, I can't wait
Hypnotize me in every way

Sick in love and baby you're my doctor
Talk to me, don't be scared to go a lil' more deep
Tell you everything like you're my doctor

[Verse 1: Vicki Peterson]
All the old paintings on the tomb
They do the sand dance, don't you know?
If they move too quick (Oh-way-oh)
They're falling down like a domino
All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (Oh-way-oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

[Pre-Chorus: Vicki Peterson]
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)

[Chorus: Vicki Peterson]
Walk like an Egyptian

[Verse 2: Michael Steele]
The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (Oh-way-oh)
You drop your drink, then they bring you more
All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings (Oh-way-oh)
They're walking like an Egyptian

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Steele]
All the kids in the marketplace say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)

[Chorus: Michael Steele]
Walk like an Egyptian

[Verse 3: Susanna Hoffs]
Slide your feet up the street, bend your back
Shift your arm, then you pull it back
Life is hard you know (Oh-way-oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac
If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (Oh-way-oh)
They spin the clubs, cruise down the block
All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (Oh-way-oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian

[Pre-Chorus: Susanna Hoffs]
All the cops in the donut shop say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)

[Chorus: Susanna Hoffs]

There’s a little child running around this house
And he never leaves, he will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows, in the dark

[Verse 2]
Baby alligators in the sewers
Grow up fast, grow up fast
Anything you want, it can be done, how?

[Outro]
How did you go bad?
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?
Some things will never wash away
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?

[Spoken]
Goodnight, everybody
Thank you

[Chorus]
Everything is free now
That's what they say
Everything I ever done
Gotta give it away
Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if it doesn't pay

[Verse 1]
I can get a tip jar
Gas up the car
And try to make a little change
Down at the bar
Or I can get a straight job
I've done it before
I never minded working hard
It's who I'm working for

[Chorus]
Everything is free now
That's what they say
Everything I ever done
Gotta give it away
Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That I'm gonna do it anyway
Even if it doesn't pay

[Verse 2]
Every day I wake up
Hummin' a song
But I don't need to run around
I just stay home
And sing a little love song
My love, to myself
If there's something that you wanna hear
You can sing it yourself

[Chorus]
'Cause everything is free now
That what I said
No one's gotta listen to
These words in my head
Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if it doesn't pay

[Intro]
A-one, a-two
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Did you ever get hurt by the words people say
And the things that they do when they're picking on you?
Did you ever get sad by the games that they play
When they're making you feel like a rusty old wheel?

[Chorus]
It's been left in the rain
Who cares what the idiots say?
Who cares what the idiots do?
Who cares about the pain in your heart?
Who cares about you?
I do

[Bridge]
'Cause you're worth much more
Of that, you can be sure
No need to hide
The love you've got inside

[Verse 2]
Did you ever get lost in the heart of a crowd
And the people around keep on pushing you down? (Hmm)
Is it driving you mad and you're screaming out loud
And you're wondering who's going to recognise you?

[Chorus]
You're a ghost in the dark
Who cares what the idiots say?
Who cares what the idiots do?
Who cares about the pain in your heart?
Who cares about you?

[Chorus]
Who cares what the idiots say?
Who cares what the idiots do?
Who knows about the pain in your heart?
Who cares about you?
I do

[Outro]
You've been left in the rain

[Verse 1]
You used to be my confidante
My underneath-the-staircase friend
But I fell out of love with you
And brought our romance to an end

I played with you throughout the day
And told you every secret thought
Unlike my other so-called friends
You stood beside me as I fought

[Verse 2]
In your reflected glory, I
Could dream of shining far-off lands
Where serpents turn to bits of string
And played like kittens in my hand

In our imaginary world
Where butterflies wear army boots
And stomp around the forest chanting
Long lost anthems
Long lost anthems

[Verse 1]
You used to be my confidante
My underneath-the-staircase friend
But I fell out of love with you
And brought our romance to an end

I played with you throughout the day
And told you every secret thought
Unlike my other so-called friends
You stood beside me as I fought
You stood beside me as I fought

[Outro]
You used to be my confidante

[Verse 1]
Wanna give you my heart
Wanna tell you my story
Gonna take it to another level, you and me

[Verse 2]
Wanna give you my word
Let me give you my promise
I will try to make it happen, you can guarantee

[Chorus 1]
Hand in hand
Walking through life and making our plans
Hand in hand

[Verse 3]
Let me enter your light
Wanna show you my passion
We can make each other happy if we get it right

[Chorus 2]
Hand in hand
Walking through life and making our plans
Hand in hand
Taking our time and making a stand

[Bridge]
We can make this dream come true
Only if we wanted to
We can make this dream come true
Only when we understand
Everything in life is planned
Can we make this dream come true?

[Verse 1]
Wanna give you my heart
Wanna tell you my story
Gonna to take it to another level, you and me

[Chorus 1]
Hand in hand
Walking through life and making our plans
Hand in hand
Hand in hand

[Verse 1]
In time, we'll know it's all a show
It's been a blast
As time goes by, we'll laugh and cry
It's in the past

[Pre-Chorus]
We can start to begin
Living in the world we're in

[Verse 2]
From day to day, we'll fight and play
For what we need
We'll soon forget we ever met
And disagreed

[Pre-Chorus]
We can start to begin (To begin)
Living in the world we're in (World we're in)
This is it (This is it), here and now (Here and now)
We can find our way
Somehow

[Chorus]
And lines of dominoes are falling
Into place, ignoring everything in their way
And all the telephones are calling
Constantly, imploring us to come out and play

[Verse 3]
And soon we'll see that you and me
We're really friends
We broke the code and walked the road
That never ends

[Pre-Chorus]
We can start to begin (To begin)
Living in the world we're in (World we're in)
This is it (This is it), here and now (Here and now)
We can find our way
Somehow

[Chorus]
And lines of dominoes are falling
Into place, ignoring everything in their way
And all the telephones keep calling
Constantly, imploring us to come out and play
Hey-hey, hey-hey

[Verse 4]
We'll take our turn and try to learn
To sing and dance
We'll hedge our bets with no regrets
And take a chance

[Pre-Chorus]
We can start to begin (To begin)
Living in the world we're in (World we're in)
This is it (This is it), here and now (Here and now)
We can find our way
Somehow

[Chorus]
And lines of dominoes are falling
Into place, ignoring everything in their way
And all the telephones keep calling
Constantly, imploring us to come out and play
Hey-hey, yay-yay

[Outro]
In time, we'll know it's all a show
It's been a blast

[Verse 1]
Back in Brazil
There lives a girl
Dreams of the future
And a far, far better world
Back in Brazil
She meets a man
He's tall and handsome
And he fits in with her plan

[Bridge]
Bright lights ahead
Music and fun
Nights are for dancing
And the days are for the sun
All kinds of weather
Will surely come and go
But they're together
And together they will steal the show

[Interlude]
Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ban!

[Verse 2]
Back in Brazil
She makes a date
He has to cancel
'Cause they got him working late
Back in Brazil
She feels afraid
Hope starts to crumble
And her dreams begin to fade

[Bridge]
Her lights are out
She's gone to bed
Nights are for sleeping
If a girl's to get ahead
Even the weather
Has started changing too
But they'll be together
And together, they will make it through
Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiban!

[Outro]
So we raise a family
As the clouds roll by
Making pictures of us in the sky
The kids are happy
And they don't ask why
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, you and I

[Verse 1]
Got the time, the inclination
I have answered your invitation
I'll be leaving in the morning
Watch me go

[Verse 2]
I don't know where the wind is blowing
Got directions to where I'm going
Nothing's certain
That's the only thing I know

[Chorus]
Do it now, do it now while the vision is clear
Do it now while the feeling is here
If you leave it too late, it could all disappear
Do it now while your vision is clear

[Post-Chorus]
Do-do-doo, do-do-doo
Do-do-doo, do-do-do
Do-do-doo-ooh, doo-ooh

[Verse 3]
I don't regret the steps I'm taking
The decision that I'm making
Is the right one
Or I'm never going to know

[Verse 4]
Got the time, the inclination (It's not too late, late, late)
I have answered your invitation (You've still got time, time, time)
I'll be leaving in the morning (Follow the beat of)
Watch me go (Your heart, heart, heart)

[Chorus]
So do it now, do it now while your vision is clear
Do it now while the feeling is here
If you leave it too late, it could all disappear
Do it now while your vision is clear

[Outro]
Do-do-doo, do-do-do-do-doo
Do-do-doo, do-do-do-do-doo
Do-do-doo, do-do-doo, do-do-doo

[Chorus]
She's a rock
She's a rock
She's a rock

[Verse 1]
If I could find the words to talk about my woman
Well, I would surely shout them out
But every time I feel my inspiration coming
It's all too much to talk about

[Verse 2]
'Cause she breaks me up, she takes me down
She sends me sideways
She's with me every way I turn
If I'm back to school
She gotta be my favourite teacher
There's such a lot for me to learn

[Chorus]
'Cause she's a rock (Yeah!)
Yes, she's a rock (Yeah!)
She's a rock (Yeah!)
She's a rock (Yeah!)

[Verse 3]
Somehow she always knows exactly what is needed
When I've been running 'round and 'round
And if she wants me, but I know that I've succeeded
I'll be heading back to town

[Chorus]
'Cause she's a rock (Yeah!)
Yes, she's a rock (Yeah!)
Yes, she's a rock (Yeah!)
She's a rock (Yeah!)

[Chorus]
Caesar rock, he's a rock
He's a rock, he's a rock
She's a rock

[Outro]
(Hey) She's a, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a
She's a, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a
Yeah, now she's a rock (She's a rock)
Woo-hoo-hoo
She's got loyalty like the royalty
She's got symmetry, anonymity
She's got all the looks
She got all the books
She got matching teeth
She got matching teeth

[Hunt You Down]

[Verse 1]
I can't find my love
No matter how hard I try
She's giving me the runaround
And makes me wanna lay down and cry

[Chorus 1]
Come on back to me right now
'Cause you don't have to stay away
I won't play no hide-and-seek
It's not a game I wanna play

[Verse 2]
Travelling around the world
Trying to find a perfect mate
I found myself a little girl
But now she's started running away

[Chorus 2]
Come on back to me right now
Don't wait 'til they unleash the hounds
If you don't get back today
They'll follow your trail and hunt you down

[Naked]

[Verse 1]
I've been taken for my younger brother
Life's a basket, but I have no other
I keep waking up when I'm trying to sleep
I've been naked since I was born

[Verse 2]
Born to follow you wherever you go
But my problem is I never do know
Where you're taking me, I don't have a clue
I've been naked since I was born

[Bridge]
Save my soul and set it free
Free to fly home
There's a place I'm meant to be
Back, back home

[Verse 3]
I've been broken in so many places
Put together by a sea of faces
What to make of them
I don't hardly know
I've been naked for so long, so long

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 1]
I've been taken for my younger brother
Life's a basket, but I have no other
I keep waking up when I'm trying to sleep
I've been naked for so long

[Outro]
I've been naked for so long
So long, so long, now

[C-Link]

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
1-2, 1-2

[Verse 1]
You can watch TV and watch the media
President Bush doing takeover
Kate Moss in ads for mascara
All my youth the young offender
The bill payers, the drug dealers
Girls who are magazine covers
The part-time jobbers at the call center
No career plans 'cause you won't go far
Put away change for Ibiza and
Check your credit on your new Nokia

[Hook]
You can be a follower, but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya'
You can be a follower, but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya'

[Post-Chorus]
You leader, you lead can't, do what you do now
What really good that can happen to you?
You leader, you lead can't, do what you do now
What really good that can happen to you?

[Verse 2]
You're prime minister to your employer
Ego lovers need more power
The trendsetters make things better
Don't sell out to be product pushers
The gyro casher and baby makers
Try something new cause it ain't over
All poor people from all over
Lottery's got a rollover

[Hook]
You can be a follower, but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya'
You can be a follower, but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya'

[Post-Chorus]
You leader, you lead can't, do what you do now
What really good that can happen to you?
You leader, you lead can't, do what you do now
What really good that can happen to you?

[Bridge]
It's rough in here, but it's rougher out there
Try'na get up out it, I need to get paid
I feel a type of way try'na talk anarchy
But why should I obey when they don't check me?
It's rough in here, but it's rougher out there
Try'na get up out it, I need to get paid
I feel a type of way try'na talk anarchy
But why should I obey when they don't check me?

[Outro]
It's rough in here, but it's rougher out there
Try'na get up out here, I need to get paid
Hmm, hmm-mm-mm, hmm-mm-mm, anarchy
Uhh, uhh-uh-uh, uh-uh they don't check me
It's rough in here, but it's rougher out there
Try'na get up out it, I need to get paid
I feel a type of way try'na talk anarchy
But why should I obey when they don't check me?
It's rough in here, but it's rougher out there
Try'na get up out it, I need to get paid
I feel a type of way try'na talk anarchy
But why should I obey when they don't check me?

[Verse 1]
Hand off the buck to my bud 'cause I know
That he'll play something we both enjoy
Try to lean in strain my vocal chords
Thin as the song starts to shut out my voice
Watch me pretend like I know where to aim
When I toss up my paper airplane
You've been a friend to me
Can you believe that I'm trying to do you the same

[Chorus A]
Side by side
As I stare at the floor lift my eyes
As I try to meet yours and be there
And pretend like I'm strong enough

[Verse 2]
Hand you a smoke when you're feeling alone
And I'll stand with you watching it burn
Out here existing as hard as I can
Just a phone light to shine in your world
Touch of the hand and a kiss on the head
All that's left when I can't find the words
You've been a friend to me
Can you believe that I'm trying to follow in turn

[Chorus B]
Take my hand
'Cause we're really alone in this world
I can carry you home and be there
And pretend like I'm strong enough

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Queen!

Here I stand (Here I stand)
Look around, around, around, around, around (Look around, around, around, around, around)
But you won't see me (But you won't see me)
Now I'm here (Now I'm here)
Now I'm there (Now I'm there)
I'm just—
Just a new man
Yes, you made me live again, yeah

[Verse 1]
A baby I was when you took my hand
The light of the night burned bright
The people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Don't worry babe I'm safe and sound

[Chorus]
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love you so?
Yes, you made me live again
Come on, everybody
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Ooh, a thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
The beams of your love-light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
The rain running down my face

[Pre-Chorus]
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

[Chorus]
Down in the city just Hoople 'n' me

[Guitar Solo]
Alright
Come on

[Bridge]
Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memory with you

[Verse 3]
Now I'm here (Now I'm here)
Think I'll stay around, around, around, around (Think I'll stay around, around, around, around)
Down in the city just-a you and me (Down in the city just-a you and me)
Ah, yeah

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
Thank you, thank you and good evening, everybody
Oh, it looks really pretty here tonight, thank you for joining us tonight
We're now...

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
We're now going to take you to the battlefield
This is called "Ogre Battle"

[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahh!

[Verse 1]
Now once upon a time, an old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone and the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies, to find a new destination
That is the sign
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight

[Verse 2]
He gives a great big cry, swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies
Palm of a hand, incredible size
Great big eye, has a focus in your direction
And the battle is won
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahh!
Ooh, watch out

[Bridge]
The ogre-men are still inside
Two-way mirror mountain
You gotta stand clear and out of sight
You can't see in, but you can't see out
"So keep a good lookout!"
The ogre-men are coming up
Two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Ogre-men are going home
And then the great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more

[Outro]
Oh-ho-ho
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahh, ooh!

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
Thank you, thank you very much
Okay, right now, right now, Queen would like to drink a special Christmas toast to everybody here and all the viewers, so cheers! Ha, ha, ha

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
Okay, darlings, this is a little, delicate little number called "White Queen"

[Intro]
So sad, her eyes
Smiling, dark eyes
So sad, her eyes
As it began, oh

[Verse 1]
On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow, the lightest kiss
I walked alone

[Verse 2]
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known

[Bridge 1]
The white queen walks and the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

[Chorus]
Needing, unheard
Pleading, one word
So sad, her eyes
She cannot see, oh

[Verse 3]
How did thee fare, what have thee seen?
The mother of the willow green
I call her name

[Verse 4]
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came

[Bridge 2]
White queen, how my heart did ache
And dry my lips, no words can make
Still I wait

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge 3]
My goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's forevermore that I wait
Dear friend, goodbye
No tears, my eyes

[Outro]
So sad it ends
As it began

[Spoken Word: Brian May]
We'd like to leave you in the lap of the Gods

[Verse 1]
It's so easy, but I can't do it
It's so risky, but I gotta chance it
It's so funny, there's nothing to laugh about
My money, that's all you wanna talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But that's not true

[Chorus]
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la, la, la
I can see what you want me to be
I'm no fool

[Verse 2]
There's no beginning, there's no ending
There's no meaning in my pretending
Believe me, life goes on and on and on
Forgive me when I ask you where do I belong
You say, "I can never set you free"
But that's not true

[Chorus]
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la la
Wah, wah, ooh
I'm no fool

[Outro]
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la
Wah, wah, ooh
I'm no fool

It's in the lap of the Gods, everybody
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la
Wah, wah, ooh

[Hook: Lauryn Hill]
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
And listen for a while
And there he was
This young boy, stranger to my eyes

[Hook: Lauryn Hill + (Wyclef Jean)]
Strumming my pain with his fingers (One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words (Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with this song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
Then read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

[Hook: Lauryn Hill + (Wyclef Jean)]
Strumming my pain with his fingers (One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words (Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

[Interlude: Wyclef Jean]
Yo, L-Boy, take it to the bridge

Whoo who-oo
La la la la la la laa

[Hook: Lauryn Hill]
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Yes he was singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Strumming my pain.....

Baby, I don't mean to sound rude
It's crazy, I can do what your man just can't do
So give me the night, I'll show it
If the money is right, I'll blow it
On you tonight, whoa-oh
Side of me, no saddles on it
They say that boy a memory
You are not datin' me no more
Even though you supposed to be standin' right here
I'ma be the side nigga of the year

[Chorus]
Ain't my, ain't my, ain't my girl (It don't matter, no)
Ain't my, ain't my (No), ain't my girl

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
Now then, we're gonna do a nice tasty little medley for you, just like the one we did the other day, yes, and we're going to start off with a little segment from a number called "Bohemian Rhapsody"

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't want to die
Sometimes wish I'd never been born at all, oh

Maddie Maddie Acid
You can spell it with a double D
Yeah I got tits but these fuckers can't fuck with me
'Cause knockery their fuckery is out of my purview
Put the mic down like it's past the curfew
But fuck 'em, they're just a bunch of spoiled brats
Hold the musket give 'em all a blast from the past
But these crabs couldn't act in my class
I don't give a fuck just don't put them in a cast
Like they made a bad batch
And that's being generous so give 'em a groove
You can use all degenerates
Kill, go ham
With a good-ass gram at these Confederate degenerates
You can't fuck with this, I'm just too lucid
Y'all got flutes I got tubas
Y'all got guns I got bazookas
Y'all got nukes I got the doomsday device and I press the button twice
Madison Acid but they call me M80
Everyone says I rap good for a lady
But if they say that I'm just a girl then I say "fuck the world"
And give 'em all that makes 'em jump and twirl
And that's what I call ballet
Shoot at the ground and watch 'em do a sashay
'Cause I'll rock it 'til their eye sockets turn violet
Now they're telling me to stop the violence
But I say let it bleed, trust that to mean
Leaves you with a wound you couldn't soothe with a medic team
No editing it's raw and uncut
Yep, the only cut's just a knife to your gut
They got me going kamikaze, Nagasaki
Sherman's March with a word that's hard but effective
Question later and assault 'em first
Then when I finish on the mic then I salt the earth
Maybe I should just sue you
'Cause you got me a rash over my heart
I can't whisper sweet words to you
We gotta make love ten feet apart

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-achoo
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-achoo
You gotta go now please 'cause you making me sneeze
Allergic to love
Ah-ah-achoo

Oh-ewie-ewie-ewie-ewie-ah-choo
Gooey-goo and never stop
Can you pretty please hand me a tissue?
I'm coming down with a fever hard

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-achoo
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-achoo
Oh baby I can't lose with the stuff I choose
Allergic to love
Ah-ah-achoo
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-achoo
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-achoo
You gotta go now please 'cause you making me sneeze
Allergic to love
Ah-ah-achoo
You of my life
I have seen no one more blue in my life
And I’ve dreamt the taste of dew on your lips
Many nights of my life

All my dreams are disasters
Underling and her master

True and its trite
I have fallen into eyes telling lies
And I’ve slept in dingy rooms
Taking trips
Far away from my life

All my dreams are disasters
Underling and her master

I’ve slept so much that I have huddled
Into nothing but a mass of flesh
So soft and numb that I can scarcely tell where body ends and
Sheets begin if thats the mattress or my skin the bin(?) I’m living in
I only sing for those in love
I only sing for one to love
I only sing for one to love...
Me

Bitches be trying to starters
They go to pressing me harder
Hoping I come through and slaughter
They wanna ride it like I was a Caddy
While calling me daddy like I was the father
Honestly speaking, I'm unimpressed
Thotties will come with a ton of stress
When you connect in the mind, your body, and soul
It makes for some greater sex
If she ain't your homie, your lover, your friend
You might want to go get your feelings back
With the seal and back
Imported my watch in a coniac
I keeping it real, you niggas living on lies
I look her right in her eyes
I done came up on a prize
I gotta stay on my jog

People will play on your weakness
Look at what happened to Rome

The world is turnin'

All my pictures are fallin'
From the wall where I placed them yesterday
The world is turning
I hope it don't turn away

[Verse 2]
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face them day-to-day
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face them day-to-day

But I can't face them day-to-day

[Verse 3]
I went to the radio interview
I ended up alone at the microphone
I went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone
Now I'm living out here on the beach
But those seagulls are still out of reach
I went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone

[Verse 4]
Get out of town
Think I'll get out of town
Get out of town
Think I'll get out of town
And head for the sticks with my boss and friends
And follow the road 'til I don't know where it ends
Get out of town
Think I'll get out of town

[Outro]
World is turning
Hope it don't turn away
Lyrics have been removed after the realization that the original artist on this track was Wash and Trey Songz has never covered it. The original track is called, "I'm 'N Luv" and you can find the official lyrics on Genius *here* My mistake, I apologize

[Intro]
Yo
Yo, what's up, what's up?
Nah, I'm at the studio right now
N-Nah, but I'll give you a call after the session, alright?
Alright, bye

[Verse]
Damn
Isn't it funny how far I came?
Told me my dream was a reach
So I reached for the stars and it since hasn't been the same
And ever since I paved my own lane
They've been looking for directions
And ever since they've tried to clone me
But they don't got the same connection (Woo)
Haven't been posting on Instagram
Keep myself secluded from the rest of them
Hitting up my line, they keep pestering
They ask for features, well it just depends
'Bout to be a boss in the business
'Bout to be a cost just to witness
Yeah, you popping now, enjoy it while you can
It'll last for five minutes
I swear
Had this dream all my life, convinced myself to chase it
Now things are starting to happen
And I'm making moves and landing all these placements
Landing in all these new places
Goddamn, it's outrageous
I've been in it for a minute
Tryna get it, I just gotta have patience

[Chorus]
Boss up, boss up, the young boy done bossed up
Bossed up, boss up, the young boy done bossed up
Boss up, bossed up, the young boy done bossed up
Boss up, boss up, the young boy done bossed up
Boss up, boss up, the young boy done bossed up
Bossed up, bossed up, the young boy done bossed up
Damn, shit, you know I done bossed up, haha

[Outro]
Yeah, hello
Mum, mum
Uh
Yeah, I'm -
Mum, I'm com-
Mum, I'm coming
I'm -
Mum -
Okay, okay
I love you
I love you
I love you
Bye, bye

[Chorus]
Tell me all
Tell me you don't love me
Tell me all
Tell me you don't care
Tell me all the things that I did wrong and look me in my face
I'm probably already replaced
But kiss me anyway

[Verse 1]
Standin' with open arms
Prayin' for miracles
Hopin' that maybe you'll change your mind
But I know you won't
Can't even cry no more
What's the use of cryin' anyway?
I'm already dyin', you're not replyin'
I'm left with this empty space, so go 'head and

[Chorus]
Tell me all
Tell me you don't love me
Tell me all
Tell me you don't care, oh, oh baby
Tell me all the things that I did wrong and look me in my face
I'm probably already replaced
But kiss me anyway

[Post-Chorus]
There's no convincing you to stay
Kiss me anyway
Turn the lights on (Yeah)
Kiss me anyway (Yeah)
Kiss me anyway
Kiss me anyway (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Ignore the chemistry
Block out the fireworks
Act like you know longer in love with me, ha
Even though we're perfect
But before you close that door
You look me right in my eyes
And tell me that you still don't be feelin' these feelings
Somethings just can't be denied

[Chorus]
Tell me all
Woah, oh, oh, you ain't gotta tell me you love me
Tell me all, uh
Tell me you don't care
Tell me all the things that I did wrong but look me in my face
I'm probably already replaced, woah, oh
But kiss me anyway

[Post-Chorus]
There's no convincing you to stay
Kiss me anyway
Turn the lights on (Yeah)
Kiss me anyway (Yeah)
Kiss me anyway
Kiss me anyway (Yeah)
Kiss me anyway (Yeah)
Kiss me anyway (Yeah)
Kiss me anyway (Yeah)

Been dreaming all for you across heaven shores, the angel's canoe

[Verse: Noonie Bao]
We are the wheel of fortune
Spinnin' round and round
We are the lucky, lucky (lucky)
Never going down
So go tell all your girlfriends
To come around
'Cause we don't stop, stop
Drink it up

[Refrain]
Lazy girls club, club
We sleep all day
We're up all night, night
Limousines in neon light

[Verse 1]
She keeps a Moët et Chandon in her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake," she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A b uilt-in remedy, Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation, you can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Anytime)
Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try?

[Verse 2]
To avoid complications, she never kept the same address
In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious, precise

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Anytime)

[Guitar Solo, Transition to "The March of the Black Queen"]
(Medley segue after 'Killer Queen' begins with piano and guitar intro to the fourth verse of the full song that is "The March of the Black Queen", which Queen never performed live in its entirety.)

[Verse]
I rule with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power!
I've got the power, now do the march of the Black Queen
(My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie)
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy, I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the Black Queen
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Guitar Solo, Transition to "Bohemian Rhapsody (Reprise)"]

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
And this number is entitled "Brighton Rock"

[Verse 1]
Happy little day, Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade

[Bridge]
"It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell"

[Verse 2]
"Jenny will you stay, tarry with me pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us
Tell me love, what do you say?"
"Oh no, I must away, to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday"

[Bridge 2]
"It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll say farewell"

[Chorus]
Oh, Rock of Ages, do not crumble, love is breathing still
Oh, Lady Moon, shine down a little people magic if you will

[Guitar Solo]
Ooh, ooh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, didn't you feel surprised to find the cap just didn't fit?
A woman expects a man to buckle down and to shovel
What'll you do for loving if it's the one and the only game?

[Chorus]
I want you
To be a woman
I want you to be a woman, yeah, yeah

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
Thank you
Thank you very much, featuring Brian May on guitar
Okay...

[Intro: Freddie Mercury & Brian May]
Now, now it's time to join in, everybody
Join in
And you can sing along the choruses, give us a helping hand, you can take all your clothes off
Come on, alright
Ooh, yeah, everybody, yes
What about you on the balcony, are you with us?
Everybody at home? Yeah?
Keep yourself alive!
Let's go!
Come on, come on

[Verse 1]
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile
Sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you, "Be a superstar"
Tell you, "Just be satisfied, stay right where you are"

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Come on, rrrah!
Let me see it
Ow!

[Verse 2]
Well, I've loved a million women in a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need, feed my body and my soul
Grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal
Told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, rode a million miles
Still be where I started, same as when I started

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Now shake it!

[Guitar Solo]
Ooh, ack
Ahh
Ooh

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

[Bridge]
Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

[Chorus]
Come on and keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

[Outro]
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Come on, come on (Keep yourself alive)
Come on and get it, get it, get it, boy
Keep yourself alive
Whoo!

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]

I have sinned, dear Father
Father, I have sinned
Try and help me, Father
Won't you let me in?

[Chorus]
Liar!
Oh, nobody believes me
Liar!
Why don't you leave me...?

Sire, I have stolen
Stolen many times
Raised my voice in anger
When I know I never should

[Chorus]
Liar!
Oh, everybody deceives me
Liar!
Why don't you leave me alone?

[Guitar Solo]
Brian!

[Bridge 1]
Liar, I have sailed the seas
Liar, from Mars to Mercury
Liar, I have drunk the wine
Liar, time after time
Liar, you're lying to me
Liar, yes, you're lying to me
Father, please forgive me
You know you'll never leave me
Please, will you direct me in the right way?
In the right way?
The right, the right way
Liar, liar, liar, liar!
Liar, that's what they call me
Liar, every day and every night
Liar, all the time
Liar, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
They keep calling me liar
They know I'm a liar
And that's the way it goes

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge 2]

Mama, I'm gonna try to behave
All day long
Mama, I'm gonna be your slave

Liar, nobody believes you
Liar, they bring you down before you begin
Now let me tell you this
So now you know you could be dead before they let you

[Spoken Word: Brian May]
Thanks a lot, thanks a lot
It's seemed really like a party here tonight
Thanks a lot for making it really something for us, it's felt a lot different
You know, we've taken our show all 'round the world, but we've never got to so many people all at once, and it's felt really good Thanks a lot for giving us a good year ...

[Spoken Word: Roger Taylor]
We're gonna do some rock 'n' roll!

[Verse 1]
Agh
The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a man of distinction
A real big spender

[Pre-Chorus]
Good lookin', so refined
Say, wouldn't you like to know
What's goin' on in my mind?

[Chorus]
Well, let me get right to the point:
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see
Hey Big Spender! Spend a little time with me
Part I: Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 1]
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

[Chorus]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock and roll tonight
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 2]
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

[Chorus]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock and roll tonight
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Come on

[Verse 3]
Number forty-seven said to number three
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
Sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"

[Chorus]
Let's rock, come on, everybody, let's rock and roll tonight
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
One more time

Part II: Stupid Cupid

Stupid Cupid, you're a real mean guy
I, oh, no, no, I don't know, you can't fly
Ooh, it's a crying shame
Stupid Cupid, stop playing that game
Hey hey, set me free
Stupid Cupid, stop picking on me

Part III: Be-Bop-A-Lula

Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula, you're drivin' me crazy
Be-bop-a-lula, goin' insane
Be-bop-a-lula, gonna play that game
A-rock and roll, rock and roll, everybody
Ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
The sad sack was a sitting on a block of stone
Way in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair"

[Chorus]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock and roll tonight
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Outro]
Keep dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Keep dancing to the Jailhouse Rock, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh, ooh yeah, nice

[Spoken Word: Brian May]
Alright, this is where we start I think, but we're on our own now Okay

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
Right, a number we forgot to do in the set
It's called "Seven Seas Of Rhye"

[Verse 1]
Fear me you Lords and Lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers

[Chorus]
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye

[Verse 2]
Can you hear me you peers and privy counselors?
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust

[Chorus]
I swear that you'll be mine
The seven seas of Rhye

[Bridge]
Sister— I live and lie for you
Mister— Do and I'll die
You are mine I possess you
I belong to you forever, ever, ever

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Storm the master-marathon
I’ll fly through
By flash and thunder-fire and I'll survive (I'll survive, I'll survive)
Then I'll defy the laws of nature, come out alive
Then I'll get you
Be gone with you— you shod and, shady senators
Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty Titan and his troubadours

[Chorus]
And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye

[Outro]
Oh yeah, come on let me take you
Come on let me take you
Come on let me take you
To the Seven Seas of Rhye

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
Thank you, thank you very much
We sincerely mean that
Thank you very much for being such a nice audience!

[Crowd]
Long live our noble Queen!
God save The Queen!
Send her victorious
Happy and glorious
Long to reign over us
God save the Queen!

[Applause]

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
(I am titanium)

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Cut me down, but it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud, not saying much

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Stone hard, machine gun
Fired at the ones who run
Stone hard, as bulletproof glass

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You shoot me down (Shoot me down), but I won't fall (I won't fall)
I am titanium
You shoot me down (I won't fall), but I won't fall (I won't fall)
I am titanium
You shoot me down (Yeah), but I won't fall (I won't)
I am titanium
You shoot me down (Oh), but I won't fall (Oh-oh-oh)
I am titanium
I am titanium
You shoot me down
I am titanium
I am titanium

[Verse 1]
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 2]
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 3]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 1: Bibi Bourelly, Charli XCX]
I cut my EP in the closet
I ain't no pop bitch, I'm an artist
The Lord telling me be more modest, young one:
"Stay on your toes, you've got lessons to come"
Lurk, don't get caught on the highway
Made on my way, too many snakes
Beat up on my seas on a-game
I don't do nothing, no man say
Look, my girls in the cut
Smoking they curls
Big dream and the goods
My squad keep grinding for us
In the cut
Smoking they curls
Big dream and the goods
My squad is grinding for us
My squad is grinding for us
No you're naa
My squad is grinding for us

[Verse 2: Alvin and the Chipmunks Sample]
And who's this?
That's Charlie
And that one there is me!
Really? You look so cute!
You know what?
Guess who also has some pictures?
Alvin?
Well, I-

[Verse 3: Charli XCX]
Wherever I go, wherever I go, you wanna be there too
Wherever I go, wherever I go, you wanna be there too
Wherever I go, wherever I go, you wanna be there too
Wherever I go, wherever I go, you wanna be there too
(5 in the morning)
(all in, all in baby)

[Verse 4: Mykki Blanco]
Ghost in a shell
I'm a beast in the sheets
I'm a neutron bomb-bomb, blowin' the beat
Gonna spray that raygun and fall to his knees
I'm a lightnin' rod, I'ma bite that rod
Do you want a femmebot or do you want a ho-bot?
Do you want a femmebot or do you want a ho-bot?
Super Saiyan, supersonic
Hard drive crash, you don't remember

[Verse 5: Lord Voldemort]
You have fought valiantly, but in vain. I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste. I therefore command my forces to retreat

[Verse 6: Charli XCX}
Rollercoaster ride, in the fast lane
Got the roof down
Kiss me hard, in the pourin' rain
Yeah, I can see it, in your eyes
Know you feel the same
Million dollar babe
Trippin' on it, like propane
(Beautiful)
Rollercoaster ride, in the fast lane
Got the roof down
Kiss me hard, in the pourin' rain
Yeah, I can see it, in your eyes
Know you feel the same
Million dollar babe
Trippin' on it, like propane
(Beautiful)
Rollercoaster ride, in the fast lane
Got the roof down
Kiss me hard, in the rain
You got the candy colored eyes
Pink and gold chain
Million dollar babe
Whip it out, like I'm propane
You're on my mind
I'm feelin' kinda nervous, but I like it
Take my t-shirt off, and do it right
You're on my mind
The feelin', like an astronaut
Watchin' the world, all alone, just you and I (you and I)
(Beautiful)
This is just a little samba
Built upon a single note
Other notes are bound to follow
But the root is still that note
This new one is just the consequence
Of the one we've just been through
As I'm bound to be the unavoidable consequence of you

There's so many people who can talk and talk and talk
And just say nothing, oh, nearly nothing
I have used up all the scale I know
And in the end, it's come to nothing
Oh, nearly nothing

So I come back to that first note
As I must come back to you
I will pour into that one note
All the love I have for you
Anyone who wants the whole show
Ré Mi Fa Sol La Si Do
He will find himself with no show
Better play the note you know

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm-hmm

[Verse 1]
Alright, lungs full of weed smoke
Trunk full of C-notes
Always keep a plan and a bitch with a deep throat
Came from the keystone, drink 'til my speech slow
I breathe fire, kill time, collect zeros
Comin' with that heatstroke, every verse a kilo
Whole team flyin' and my name Rick Pitino
We know, but still we fight ego
Feelin' like Michael, but you really like Tito
And all I got is dead heroes, wanna take my girl and move away to Puerto Rico
'Cause it's a freak show everywhere that we go
Shit been different ever since I did a song with CeeLo
Yeah, I make that music you can digest
Take you out your mind and let me become the pilot
Fly jets and sign checks
We don't fuck around, no joker inside of my deck
My head inside of clouds
Show me to the sky and I'll kiss it
If you blink an eye, you gon' miss it
And this will happen once in a blue moon
It's always over way too soon
I spend a hundred twenty on it just to go vroom-vroom
Homie, the wheels lookin' like soup spoons
I ain't worried, I got nothin' left to lose
You gon' be alright if you just follow a few rules

[Chorus]
It's right now, fuck forever, we right here
Rain clouds come before the sky get clear
And just when you thought it was alright
Here come another long night
We can do better, have no fear
Death creepin' slow, don't you shed those tears
And just when you thought it was alright
It might be alright

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Okay, I spend nights lookin' like a deer in the headlights
Sweat like I'm runnin' up ten flights of steps with the left, right
From now to the next life
Only comin' out of the house when the check right
The test score a hundred percent and I don't need to study, buddy I'm comin correct
I go and get a ton of money, a ton of respect
They talkin' a ton of shit, but say it under they breath
The flow fuckin' possessed
On par with Charlotte, got 'em stuck in the web
Darn it, the flow so marvelous, I look so harmless
The sun don't shine though, my mind never low on darkness
Pardon the interruption, excuse me
You was just sayin' somethin', how rude of me
One man but I move like a few of me
I'm not human, I was built more beautifully
Mhm, and every single dream lucid
I could probably fly if these wings keep movin'
All we do is speak truth, put a beat to it
I need music to tune out the bullshit
Yeah, turn off the lights and I glow
Now that I have it, I'ma never let it go
And this for everybody, friend or foe
Yeah, friend or foe (Well, well, well)
I fantasized 'bout this back in my early teens
I'm talkin' holes in my dirty jeans
There's no soup for me, I let the chickens out the coup to feed
See, I'm becomin' somethin' way beyond a human being
Who wanna holler for a dollar with a handout?
A little oochie wally got you feelin' like the man now
I see God every time I pull her pants down
It's the holy water 'til I'm at my only dollar

[Chorus]
It's right now, fuck forever, we right here
Rain clouds come before the sky get clear
And just when you thought it was alright
Here come another long night
We can do better, have no fear
Death creepin' slow, don't you shed those tears
And just when you thought it was alright
It might be alright

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Verse 1: Anne-Marie]
I don't wanna lie, can we be honest?
Right now while you're sitting on my chest
I don't know what I'd do without your comfort
If you really go first, if you really left

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Read & repeat every conversation
Being with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday you've got me praying

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Pre-Drop: Anne-Marie]
Don't leave me a...

[Drop: David Guetta & Anne-Marie]
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha

[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
I don't wanna call and you not answer
Never see your face light up my phone
Never see you singing "Tiny Dancer"
Everytime my head hurts, everytime I'm low

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
'Cause I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Everything about you uncomplicated
Here with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday, you've got me praying

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Pre-Drop: Anne-Marie]
Don't leave me a...

[Drop: David Guetta & Anne-Marie]
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha (make me, alo..)

[Bridge: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me
Don't you ever go
Don't you ever leave me
No, oh

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Outro: Anne-Marie]
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

And I'm gonna be hi-i-i-i-i-i-igh
I'm a rocket man (hi-i-i-i-i-i-igh)
High as a plane! From Spain to Maine, you know what I'm sayin'? Damn

[Verse 2: Young Thug & Elton John]
On a private order (yeah)
I'm a rocket launcher (yeah)
It gotta be the pride of something (bet)
I walked out Magic stumbling (I'm a rocket man, woah)
I stumble upon a mil' (yeah)
I stumble upon a million five
I spent a fortune all on double seals
If I tell you the numbers you'll probably cry (And I'm gonna be-)
If I tell you you fake then you'll probably die
These days if he say that he hit then he probably lyin'
(I'm a rocket man, woah)
If you say you got wings and some fish then you probably fried (that's deep)
Got my karats out of Bonnie & Clyde (woo! And I'm gonna be-)
She let me back in like she never cried
She let me back in like I never lied
I look like a cat with 11 lives
I really kick shit you can ask a fly (I'm a rocket man)
I'm steady chasing like I'm never tired
I'm living scary like a haunted house
Lil mama sexy, I got butterflies, hey

[Chorus: Elton John, Young Thug & Both]
And I'm gonna be high (hi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-igh)
I'm a rocket man, I'm the rocket man, hey! (yeah! yeah!)
And I'm gonna be hi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-igh-igh, yea-yeah
I'm a rocket man
Hi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-igh (ye-yea-yea-yeaah, yeah, yea-ah)

[Outro: Elton John]
And I'm gonna be high
I'm a rocket man

Trippy hippy (Hippy)
I don't know, dawgs (Nah)
Da$H and Vyron (I'm stupid, bro)
That's my homeboys (Homeboys)
You's a trippy hippy (Uh, huh)
I don't know, dawg (No, dawgs)
Do my bitch dirty (Oh yeah)
Like a lone shark (Okay)

[Verse]
Half the niggas you know put cap in it
And the game is my son, I'm the daddy
I'm swattin' them fuckin' finger rolls (No, no, no)
Hit up Spiff for the give-and-go
Good before the shit hits the hole (Pause)
Buddy, I'ma great look
Nigga, it's the swamp, but most of young niggas weight push
Like they in the yard doggin'
Backwood on my lip, hoodie blacker than all my forefathers
You could catch me on an interlude or an interview lookin' bored
Awkward face, chopped and screwed, 'cause I hate the stench when a whore talkin'
It's the nigga with quick wit that the kids in the hall doubted
Never had time for bitches, too busy denyin' counselin'
Thorough niggas only ones worth it to ride out with
Pussy nigga, get your blouse stitched
How's this for starters? (Lit)
Lit 'til the law get 'em
Call the pallbearers in
Watch 'em fall to the beat (Get 'em all at attention)
I ain't honorin' shit
But my mom in some colds and the obvious shit
And my dawgs in the beats and we cloggin' your row
Of your block or your street and your blog and your feed
I bet you wish you could hit the reef, bitch

[Verse 1:  Anne-Marie]
I don't wanna lie, can we be honest?
Right now while you're sitting on my chest
I don't know what I'd do without your comfort
If you really go first, if you really left

[Pre-Chorus:  Anne-Marie]
I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Read & repeat every conversation
Being with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday you've got me praying

[Chorus:  Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Pre-Drop: Anne-Marie]
Don't leave me a...

[Drop: David Guetta & Anne-Marie]
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha

Don't leave me A-
Don't, don't me

[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
I don't wanna call and you not answer
Never see your face light up my phone
Never see you singing "Tiny Dancer"
Every time my head hurts, every time I'm low

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
'Cause I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Everything about you uncomplicated
Here with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday, you've got me praying

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Pre-Drop: Anne-Marie]
Don't leave me a-

[Drop: David Guetta & Anne-Marie]
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha (don't leave me alone)

[Bridge: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me
Don't you ever go
Don't you ever leave me-
Don't you ever-
Don't leave me a-
Don't, Don't me a-

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather
In G5's or better
You know me
In anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay—Rain Man is back
With little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?

He been gone since 3:30
Been coming home lately at 3:30
I'm super cool, I've been a fool
But now I'm hot, and baby, you gon' get it
Now I ain't tripping, I ain't twisted
I ain't demented, well, just a lil' bit
I'm kickin' asses, I'm taking names
I'm on flame, don't come home, babe

[Chorus]
I'm breakin' dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'ma fight a man tonight, I'ma fight a man tonight
I'ma fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man

[Verse 2]
I'm still waiting, come through the door
I'm killing time, you know, bleaching your clothes
I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire
And what I'm burning is your attire
I'm getting restless, I'm getting tested
And I can't believe he's always out every night and never checks in
Is he cheating? Man, I don't know
I'm looking 'round for something else to throw

[Chorus]
I'm breakin' dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'ma fight a man tonight, I'ma fight a man tonight

Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my shirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure released
I put in work
Did more than called upon, more than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)
But it taught me before a decision, ask this question first

Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I make
Make me a fool or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, 'round of applause

Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose
It's entertainment, is that an excuse? (No)

Dear Diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living, it's not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am

That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you

[Verse 1: Rihanna & Ne-Yo / Both]
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did
(But I hate it)
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
(But I hate it)
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Ne-Yo)]
And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (oh whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (oh)

[Verse 2: Rihanna & Ne-Yo]
You completely know the power that you have (power that you have)
The only one makes me laugh (makes me laugh)
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I...
Love you beyond the reason why
And it just ain't right
(But I hate it)
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
(But I hate it)
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
And I hate how much I love you, girl
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, girl
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so

[Bridge: Rihanna & Ne-Yo / Both]
One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah

[Chorus: Rihanna & Ne-Yo / Both]
That's how much I love you
As much as I need you
How much I need you
How much I love you
That's how much I love you
Oh, I need you
That's how much I need you
I need you
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
(I can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
(But I just can't let you go no)
And I hate that I love you so (Ohhh)
And I hate that I love you so, so

Baby, there ain't nothing to it
Baby, who you think you're fooling?
You wanna come and get me outta my dress, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
The way that you stare, starts the fire in me
Come up to my room you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing

[Chorus]
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
Push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
Push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
Push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
Push up on me

[Verse 1]
We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim
Patron on brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case
(They shake the spot, she's just another case)

[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever
We done forever
(Easy for a good girl to go bad)
(Easy for a good girl to go bad)

[Verse 2]
He's staying with a flock of them, oh yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh
(I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh)

[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever
We done forever
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

[Break]
We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh

[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
You better learn how to treat us right
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever
We done forever
(Easy for a good girl to go bad)
(Easy for a good girl to go bad)

[Verse 1]
Footsteps on the stairs aren't really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall, whispers down the hall
When I look, there's nothing to see
You say that you let her go
Turned the page and closed the door
I can't get inside your head
'Cause when I try, she's there instead

[Chorus]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh

[Verse 2]
You say that she's gone, that you moved on
So why do I feel her eyes on me?
Invisible chains keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So, I'm giving up this war
'Cause I can't fight it anymore

[Chorus]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh

[Bridge]
Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave (oh, no)
The walls are closing in, it's so damn hard to breathe
(There ain't nothing I could do about it) No, no

[Chorus]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted (haunted), haunted, ooh
Haunted, haunted, ooh
I don't wanna fight anymore
Someone's walkin' out that door
Haunted, haunted, ooh

[Intro]
You should tell me what's bugging you
And I'ma tell ya 'bout me
Make a wish and tell me your deepest thoughts
And I'ma make it easy
Make a wish tell me what's bugging you
And I'ma tell ya 'bout me
Make a wish and tell me your deepest thoughts
And I'ma make it easy

[Verse 1]
Emotions running wild
I could feel it when I'm next to you
Something's on ya mind
You wanna stay, but won't tell me
It's about ya secrecy
So what are you tryna hide?
I know what the look means
You hold my hand so tightly
Whenever we say goodbye
Standing by the door
I could tell you can't take no more
Blow your secret open wide

[Chorus]
So maybe if you say it (say it)
Tell me what it is you like (like)
Baby, baby, don't be shy (shy)
Maybe you can spend the night (night)
If you say it
But if you playing (not with it)
'Cause you know what I wanna hear (hear)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (clear)
I need to know how you feel
So baby, why won't you (say it)
Say it (say it)

[Post-Chorus]
Won't, won't you tell me
What, what's goin' on?
Why, why you waitin' on it
What you waiting for?
Soon you should tell me or I might be gone
But I'm here for you, baby
You should put me on

[Verse 2]
I won't shoot you down
Make you feel some kinda way
If you'll be honest with me
Put away your pride
I can see it in your face
You want me permanently (uh)
Like how I whine when we dancing
I know how it happened
And I'm right there with you
But I won't be the first to put myself out there
The feeling is mutual
But I bet if you (say it)

[Chorus]
So maybe if you say it
Tell me what it is you like (like)
Baby, baby, don't be shy (shy)
Maybe you can spend the night (night)
If you say it
But if you playing (not with it)
'Cause you know what I wanna hear (hear)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (clear)
I need to know how you feel
So baby, why won't you (say it)
Say it (say it)

[Bridge]
Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryna fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me
And get it off your chest
Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryna fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me
And get it off your chest
So maybe if you say it (say it)

[Chorus]
So maybe if you say it (say it)
Tell me what it is you like (like)
Baby, baby, don't be shy (shy)
Maybe you can spend the night (night)
If you say it
But if you playing (not with it)
'Cause you know what I wanna hear (hear)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (clear)
I need to know how you feel
So baby why won't you (say it)
Say it (say it)

Type to get my—the type to get my
Type to get upset—cry—cry
Type to get my—the type to get my
Type to get upset—get
Type to get my—the type to get my
Type to get upset—cry—cry
Type to get my—the type to get my
Type to get upset—get

Type to get upset—cry—cry
Type to get my—the type to get my
Type to get upset—get

[Verse 1]
I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got that whole "in love" thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time, it didn't mean a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

[Chorus]
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

[Verse 2]
Did it happen when we first kissed?
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me, baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

[Chorus]
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

[Bridge]
How did I get here with you?
I'll never know
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry (cry, cry, cry)

[Break]
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry

[Chorus]
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life (you'll never see me cry)
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
All my life
Cry, all my life
Cry, all my life
Cry, all my life
Cry, all my life

[Verse 1]
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressin', incessantly pressin' the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me callin' out for help

[Chorus]
S-O-S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard
I can't take it, see, it don't feel right

[Verse 2]
Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see you, it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (over heels)
Boy, you keep me hangin' on, the way you make me feel

[Chorus]
S-O-S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard (Y-O-U are)
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night
This time please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it ('cause you on my mind)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it

[Bridge]
Boy, you know you got me feelin' open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said boy, I'm tellin' you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm goin' crazy over you, I'm beggin'

[Chorus]
S-O-S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard (why you makin' this hard for me, baby?)
You got me tossing and turning, can't sleep at night
This time please, someone come and rescue me (someone rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it

[Intro]
J'adore les femmes riches, oui-oui
J'adore les femmes riches

[Verse 1]
Saturday, I'm wakin' up
Hungover, my coffee cup
Turn on my TV
Wish that, wishing that was me
I'd like to buy them shoes
Yeah, me love them Jimmy Choos
It's mad expensive when you're livin' like a princess

[Pre-Chorus]
Gossip columns, magazines
Places they go to be seen
So many celebrities
Can't help myself, I wanna be

[Chorus]
Damn, it's good to be rich and famous
Just like Paris

Everybody loves an heiress
Damn, it's nice to have cars and money
When you're twenty
Bel Air, blonde hair, Greek shipping heir
Everybody loves an heiress

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh, that's hot
Steamin' like teapots
Uh-huh, that's hot
Steamin' like teapots

[Verse 2]
I'd be one if I could
The sexy girl in Hollywood
They look so pretty
Young and livin' in the city
Tabloids all over it
Everyone is talkin' shit
One week you're the talk
Next week, "Who the hell is that broad?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Gossip columns, magazines
Places they go to be seen
So many celebrities
Can't help myself, I wanna be

[Chorus]
Damn, it's good to be rich and famous

Uh-huh, that's hot
She's got that kind of fashion
Chemical attraction
Rubber red lips and her eyes real low
You're gonna miss her when she go

Go, go Shakin' our hips in our mother's clothes
You're gonna miss her when she go

Go, go It's just a question of the girl's perfection
Now watch her as she go
Face down in a pillow, she cries
Her black mascara runs in circles from her-er-er eyes
Pink feather regrets she washes away
She said she wants him
But it's hurtin' and it's burnin' him the worst
The worst way

Listen to the girl
She's love sick oh, oh
She's got a new man
But he doesn't know-ow
'Bout the love sick girl
Where does it hurt
Where does it hurt
Love sick girl
Where does it hurt
Where does it hurt
Where does it hurt

She says she wants him
But it's hurtin' and it's burnin', oh
Love sick girl
Luck down in a bathroom, she cries
Her white skin looks better in this kind of light
Pink feather regrets she washes away
Looks in her mirror
And it's hurtin' and it's burnin' in the worst
The worst way

Listen to the girl
She's love sick oh, oh
She's got a new man
But he doesn't know-ow
'Bout the love sick girl
Where does it hurt
Where does it hurt
Love sick girl
Where does it hurt
Where does it hurt
Where does it hurt

She says she wants him
But it's hurtin' and it burnin', oh
Love sick girl

Face down in a pillow, she cries
Her black mascara runs in circles from her-er-er eyes
Listen to the girl
She's love sick oh, oh

But he doesn't know-ow
'Bout the love sick girl
Where does it hurt

Love sick girl
Where does it hurt

Where does it hurt

She says she wants him
But it's hurtin' and it burnin', oh
Love sick girl
I have a fever at the disco
Sirens are screaming
And I'm losin' control!
Someone turned out
The lights in musicland
But the record starts to spin
I feel the music and
We start to dance, yeah!

[Verse 1]
Hold her hand through the black light
Baby, it's a forest land of trick slides
Honey just take your time, close her eyes
"I'm scared" she whispered as she runs to hide
Into a backroom where she paints on a smile
She hears a sound, she hears a sound

[Chorus]
It could have been love
It could have been anybody
Anybody, uh-oh
She waited for love
But there wasn't anybody around
So we left town with the rockshow

[Verse 2]
Keep it cool at the freakshow
Baby, it's a happy place, if you lose it, honey
Just take your time, close his eyes
"Touch me" he whispered as he walks to the light
From the window, there's visions of a house in the night
He hears a sound, he hears a sound

[Chorus]
It could have been love
It could have been anybody
Anybody, uh-oh
She waited for love
But there wasn't anybody around
So she left town with the rockshow

[Bridge]
Hold her, tell her that you need her
Please undress her slowly, uh-oh
Never hold the girl too tightly
She can't breathe when you speak
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh

[Chorus]
It could have been love
It could have been anybody
Anybody, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
We waited for love
But there wasn't anybody around
So we left town with the rockshow
Rockshow, rockshow, rockshow

[Verse 1]
Never seen so many purple clouds
The situation's inside out

[Pre-Chorus]
Love sick girl
Where does it hurt?
Where does it hurt?
The temperature's goodbye
But don't look me in the eye

[Chorus]
'Cause you know
I spin you around
Spin you around
Spin you around
Spin you around
Spin you around
Spin you around

[Verse 2]
Body lays inside the broken glass
How did we make such a mess?

[Pre-Chorus]
Love sick girl
Where does it hurt?
Where does it hurt?
The temperature's goodbye
But don't look me in the eye

[Chorus]
'Cause you know
I spin you around
Spin you around
Spin you around
Spin you around
Spin you around
Spin you around

[Bridge]
Love's not something you can fix
Soundophobic music, sick
I get lost in everything you say
Something 'bout you and me
Is made of steam, a little mean
But I prefer us both that way

[Chorus]
I spin you around
Spin you around
Spin you around
I spin you around
Spin you around
Spin you around

[Outro]
Around
And around
And around
And around
And around
Around
And around
And around
And around
And around
Around, around, around

[Verse 1]
In the white room, with the yellow chair
Was her baby, with his angry stare
In the white room, through their violet eyes
Shes just a baby taken by surprise

[Chorus]
They never really knew it then
How to do it when
Ring, ring ring-a-ding
They never really knew it then
How to do it when
Ring, ring ring-a--ding

[Verse 2]
In the white room, she had jet black hair
She held his head down, but he left her there
In the white room, you could hear their cries
Sound of a baby heard his very first lie

[Chorus]
They never really knew it then
How to do it when
Ring, ring ring-a-ding
They never really knew it then
How to do it when
Ring, ring ring-a-ding

[Bridge]
Ring, ring, ring
She goes
The telephone, the telephone
Ring, ring, ring
She goes
The telephone, the telephone

[Outro]
They never really knew it then
How to do it when
He had her
They never really knew it then
How to do it with
The safety off the trigger
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
No good boys ever go to heaven

Bodies movin', wundaland
Open mouths kiss, and we dance
I can't believe, c-c-can't, can't believe that I met you

Pink champagne
Mirror ball spinnin' 'round again
In this wundaland where I met you
(Talk to me, talk to me)

So DJ play
Let the record spin again
In this wundaland where I met you
(Talk to me, talk to me)

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Hold your breathe count to eleven

Lady Gaga
Music, music
Just music
Music
Bodies movin', wundaland
Open mouths kiss, and we dance
I can't believe, c-c-can't, can't believe how I met you

Pink champagne
Mirror ball spinnin' 'round again
And in this wundaland where I met you
(Talk to me, talk to me)

So DJ play
Let the record spin again
In this wundaland where I met you
(Talk to me, talk to me)

I can't

Lady Gaga
Talk to me baby, Talk to me baby
Talk to me baby
Talk to me baby, take my hand
Talk to me baby, I've got a plan
I'll take you there

Talk to me
I'll take you, I'll take you, I'll take you
I'll take you, I'll take you
Talk to me
Talk to me
I'll take you, I'll take you, I'll take you
I'll take you, I'll take you

Talk to me
Talk to me
I'll take you, I'll take you

[Verse 1]
I still see your coat hanging on the door
Never let anybody put one there before
My pillow's got your head printed on it
Baby, of all the guys you were my favorite

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't ask me why I just can't say goodbye
No, not tonight
No, I just can't say it

[Chorus]
Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holdin' on to what we had
Cause I don't wanna move on, so I gotta hold on
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand

[Post-Chorus]
Like quicksand, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, baby, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand

[Verse 2]
You came along I didn't know of love
But now I know that sometimes it's just not enough
I hear your footsteps in my corridor
But it is just my heart, it's pounding like before

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Wish I could try, but I just can't say goodbye
No, not tonight
No, I just can't say it

[Chorus]
Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holdin' on to what we had
Cause I don't wanna move on, so I gotta hold on
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand

[Post-Chorus]
Like quicksand, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, baby, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand

[Bridge]
Cause the ground is breaking
I can feel it shaking
Wish it was that easy, but it's not that easy
Gotta hold my hands out
Gotta keep my head up
Gotta keep on breathing
Baby, even if we're sinking
Even if we're sinking
Baby, even if we're sinking
Even if we are sinking
Cause I just-just gotta-gotta hold (hold)

[Chorus]
Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holdin' on to what we had
Cause I don't wanna move on, so I gotta hold on
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand
(Just-just gotta-gotta hold)

[Prolude]
Only got one life to live
We don't even need a piece of sand
Only you and me
We need to hold on and hold on and...
Only got one life to live
We don't even need a piece of sand
Only you and me
We need to hold on and hold on and hold on
And hold on
And hold on, and hold on

[Outro]
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on

[Intro]
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
The Sun is gone, babe, no more warm days
It's kind of crazy when I think of some of our memories
Taking trips with you when we needed time
Thought I was busy but I'm not having you in my life

[Pre-Chorus]
We were closer than ever (Ever)
You were as sexy as the day that I met you (I met you, yeah)
We were closer than ever (Ever)
I used to think that we'd always be together, and then the weather

[Chorus]
I swear the thunder came and brought the rain
Then the lightning struck, babe, we were never the same
(Never the same)
I should've seen the signs way in the sky
But I was blind, now I realise

[Post-Chorus]
You brought the weather, man
You are my weather man
You brought the weather, man
Tell me the weather, man

[Verse 2]
Boy, you brought the storm, you were doing me wrong
And now I'm sitting in the rain writing you this song
Colder than the frost, girl, you left me lost
Tryna live my life, how I'm supposed to turn this off?

[Pre-Chorus]
We were closer than ever (Ever)
You were as sexy as the day that I met you (I met you, baby)
We were closer than ever (Ever)
I used to think that we'd always be together, and then the weather

[Chorus]
I swear the thunder came and brought the rain
Then the lightning struck, babe, we were never the same
(Never the same)
I should've seen the signs way in the sky
But I was blind, now I realise

[Post-Chorus]
You brought the weather, man
You are my weather man
You brought the weather, man
Tell me the weather, man (Tell me the weather, baby)

[Bridge]
Boy, you brought the storm
Boy, you brought the storm
You brought that hurricane
I never thought you'd do me wrong (Never do me wrong)
Boy, you brought the storm (Yeah)
Boy, you brought the storm (Oh)
You brought that hurricane
I never thought you'd do me wrong

Baby, don't lie (Baby) baby, don't cheat (Hey)
In my mind, it's broken, boy, I'ma do me
Baby, don't lie, baby, don't cheat
Weather man, whether or not, I'ma do me
Oh, oh, baby

[Chorus]
I swear the thunder came and brought the rain
Then the lightning struck, babe, we were never the same
(Never the same)
I should've seen the signs way in the sky
But I was blind, now I realise

[Post-Chorus]
You brought the weather, man
You are my weather man (You know it)
You brought the weather, man
Tell me the weather, man
You brought the weather, man (Man, man)
You are my weather man (Man, man)
You brought the weather, man (Man, man)
Tell me the weather, man (Man, man)

[Outro]
Oh, baby, you brought the weather, man
Oh, baby, you are the weather man
"I'm not your Billie Jean"

"I could be your thriller
Billie Jean is still pregnant
I'm not worthy of you, liar
I'm not worthy of you, sire."

"You never know
I could be Michael
The next Michael Jackson"

"You're the king and I'm not worthy."

"So don't leave me yet."
I can feel my heart beating in your hands
My aura and yours meeting in this dance
Pull the trigger I'm ready it's showtime!

Hey, little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go and leave you all alone?
Oh-oh, I've got a bad desire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire

Tell me now, baby, is he good to you?
Can he do to you the things that I do?
Oh-oh, I can take you higher
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull
And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull

At night, I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire

[Verse 1: Jake]
I swear to God, I wasn't born to fight
Maybe just a little bit, enough to make me sick of it
But I-I-I-I can read between the lines
I want to run from everything
But my legs won't work, it's clear to me

[Chorus: Jake]
I-I-I-I haven't been much myself
And I feel like my friends are being put through this hell I'm feeling
I think that I'm living, if you could call it living
So brash and unforgiving
Ruled by the vibe I'm bringing
Serving myself
Serving myself

[Verse 2: Jake]
The timing's poor I know it's never right
It's hard to see this time of night
Hard to know the reasons why I fucked it up again
Still, I breathe a sigh
It doesn't seem so lucky now
Maybe I can figure out why-y-y-y

[Chorus: Jake]
I haven't been much myself
And I feel like my friends are being put through this hell I'm feeling
I think that I'm living, if you could call it living
So brash and unforgiving
Ruled by the vibe I'm bringing
Serving myself
Serving myself

[Interlude]

[Outro: Jake]
Wait and see, I'll be making my own way now
I'll be making my own way now, to where I got to be
Wait and see, I'll be making my own way now
I'll be making my own way now, to where I got to be
(I-I-I-I haven't been much myself)
Wait and see, I'll be making my own way now
(And I feel like my friends are being put through this hell I'm feeling)
I'll be making my own way now to where I got to be
(I think that I'm living, if you could call it living)
Wait and see, I'll be making my own way now
(So brash and unforgiving)
I'll be making my own way now to where I got to be
(Ruled by the vibe I'm bringing)
Serving myself
Serving myself

[Verse 1: Jake]
I know you see the light upon my face
A warning from the gods to stay away
Forbidden like a fruit and I’m the snake
Just a bite, I wanna know the taste
All the things I've seen beyond the frame
I'll steal them like, I'll steal your heart
I'm not that bad, I make

[Chorus: Jake]
Mistakes
Sometimes, mistakes
Sometimes, mistakes

[Outro]
Don’t be afraid of the way that you feel
Open your heart and you'll see it's real
Don’t be afraid of the way that you feel
Don't be afraid, that's the way that you feel
It’s true love
Right, that’s right

[Verse 1: Jake]
When I forgot you, you came to mind
Every trouble, back in your eyes and
It's all cyclical, so why even try?
Why even try to change?

[Verse 2: Jake]
You're yourself way more than I am
Being friends was in the palm of my hand
But I let it fall and break, so why even try?
Why even try to mend?

[Chorus: Jake]
On and on
The feelings burst and then they fall
Until later on
We walk it back and patch things up
On and on
The feelings burst and then they fall
Until later on
We walk it back and patch things up

[Verse 3: Jake]
Soon it will all disappear
Maybe I will miss your voice in my ear
But I can't go back now, so why even try?
Why even try to hear?

[Bridge: Nathan]
No more us
No more we
No more you
No more me

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
On and on (No more us)
The feelings burst and then they fall (No more we)
Until later on (No more you)
We walk it back and patch things up (No more me)
On and on (No more us)
The feelings burst and then they fall (No more we)
'Til later on (No more you)
We walk it back and patch things up (No more me)
On and on (No more us)
The feelings burst and then they fall (No more we)
'Til later on (No more you)
We walk it back and patch things up (No more me)

[Outro]
When I forgot you, you came to mind
Every trouble, back in your eyes and
I can't go back now, so why even try?
You can't go back now, so why even try?
No, we can't go back now, so why even try?
Why even try to change?

[Intro: Jake & Whistler]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I suck, I suck
Yeah you do!

[Verse 1: Jake, Nathan]
Tomorrow seems to seep into the edge of nothing
(A blueish tint and faded vision, hey!)
Aimless eyes are searching for a better something
(But it’s okay, it’s indecision)

[Verse 2: Jake]
Pockets full of lilacs that I picked, so pointless
(The violet scent and clouded visions, brrap!)
Creeping up, the feelings that it’s all for nothing
(It’s okay, it’s indecision)

[Chorus: All, Jake]
Honestly it's
Hard to know what you’re thinking
Goddamn, give up
It's no fun when you're leaving

[Bridge: Jake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, but repetitive
Uncertainty, we chase ghosts, indifferent

[Chorus: All, Jake]
Honestly, it’s
Hard to know what you’re thinking
Goddamn, give up
It's no fun when you're leaving

[Chorus: Jake]
You've got time to think it over
You've got time to think it through
It's a circumstantial outcry
It's a failure to pursue
It’s a sentimental mindset
It's a thoughtless way to love
It’s a blossom in midwinter
It’s a poor man’s cure for touch

[Bridge: Jake]
So far in
You could feel it
(So far in you could feel it)
So far in
You could feel it
(So far in you could feel it)
Ah-ah (Ah-ah)
Ah-ah (Ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
So far in
You could feel it
(So far in you could feel it)
So far in
You could feel it
(So far in, so far in you could feel it)

[Chorus: Jake]
You've got time to think it over
You've got time to think it through
It's a circumstantial outcry
It's a failure to pursue
It's a sentimental mindset
It's a thoughtless way to love
It's a blossom in mid-winter
It's a poor man's cure for touch

[Outro: Jake]
You've got time to think it over
You've got time to think it through
You've got time to think it over
You've got time to think it over
You've got time to think it through

[Verse 1: Jake]
You could call me a regular
I’m a basic fix for a better man
Seasons change
I’m a maniac for a better love
With a bitter hand
If you see how it’s shaking down
You can’t live without
I could light the whole thing up

[Refrain: Jake]
All the parts that you're fucking with
Like a tourniquet
I could light the whole thing up

[Verse 2: Jake]
You can say I’m a stranger now
It’s so foreign how we can get it straight
Hazy days in suburbia
At your father’s house, we self-medicate
Intertwined with my urgency
It’s so new to me
I could light the whole thing up

[Refrain: Jake]
Nothing else been impressing me
But I gotta see
I could light the whole thing up

[Chorus: Jake]
Burn the room
Oh, I hear it swell
Over soon
Oh, I hear it now

[Bridge: Nathan & Zach]
Honest to God
I really couldn't lie to your face
I look away and feel like a mess
And what I can't accept is the truth:
That I don't love you
Wish I could say
I was a better friend to you then
I'm fucking sorry
Wish I could say
I was a better friend to you then
I’m fucking sorry
Once in a while
I will remember everything good
Once in a while

[Chorus: Jake]
Burn the room
Feel it bloom now
Over soon
I feel it bloom now

[Verse]
In a dodge charger on the way to see the Dodgers
With my old bitch who really don't give a shit about me
She just want me 'cause she know a nigga poppin' shit
And I know it too but fuck it, I'm gon' fuck this bitch
You deserve everything comin' your way (all your way)
Not a nigga on my team that I would trade (no, noo)
Strong chorus, solid foundation this way (oh, no)
Loyalty's worth more than money any day (yeah, yea-ah)
I got bitches from the East Coast to the Bay
Before this rap shit, I was still makin' plays
Hothead just like Johnny Blaze, I do what I want
I can't wait to bring the pain and come bring the funk

[Intro]
Tory
I'm so tired of you niggas
Got it on smash!
You and all these bitches that be lyin' in ya pictures
I'ma take a jet and I'ma fly my niggas
Somewhere so big I can’t find my niggas
Ayy, and I'm trying my nigga
But you making hard to be around y'all niggas
And this is why I only be around my niggas
Come around I gotta look you up and down my nigga

[Verse 1]
I can't be around you fuck niggas, that just ain't me
Had to check myself, uh, I'm the same me
And I bust it like the clip when it's off safety, don't make me
And them fuck-boy hatin' niggas tryna replace me
'Cause I give them boys the blues like I'm a Grape Street G
And no, got no Gucci on me but I just stay GG'd
And when I pop up and hop to the mall I spend like 18 Gs on nothing
She ride me like a ATV
I keep her Dolce-Gabbana'd up so she can stay DG'd
And I swear that batty so big that I can't stay PG
But I stay all up on your block just like the state PD
You know I cross my I's and I just dot my T's
And I just hang with the same niggas from all my team
When I come up I promise we gonna ball together
'Cause when we came up from nothing we was all together

[Bridge]
I'm talking, all together, we was all together
When we came up from nothing, we was all together
When we all together, we was all together
When we came up from nothing, we was all together, yeah

[Verse 2]
And I can't let no money get between us
And I can't let no bitches get between us
Gotta stack this money with my team (Ayy, he knows)
All together, all together when we
Came up from nothing, we just ball together
And we never trust these bitches that we dog together
Whether big or we small or we tall together, I know
Dog forever, that's my dog forever
I'm gon' ball forever, fuck these broads forever
I got bags of money, I can't stop forever, you see
One Umbrella baby we gon' star together, one time
Yeah, and I'm big checkin'
I make so many hits I'm wondering did I miss yet?
Did I miss yet?
And tell me which nigga that I sound like this time
I turn a four-figure to a six-figure cheque, yeah, tell me do it sound right this time?
When there's more niggas tryna copy me, they tryna sound bite this line
And these pussy-ass niggas tryna hate on me
I put it down right this time
I think it's 'bout right this time
I think it's about right this time

[Outro]
I'm so tired of you niggas
You and all these bitches that be lyin' in ya pictures
I'ma take a jet and i'ma fly my niggas
Somewhere so big I can't find my niggas

[Verse 1: Jake]
Good god, it's a toss up
So sweet but she's a little fucked up
I stop to think about the future
Seems so clear, never want to lose her

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
I know, I-I know dear
I think that it's copacetic
Told me that, that I look pathetic
Drinks it up like a kind of fetish now

[Refrain: Jake]
She'll go on and tell me so
She'll go on and tell me

[Verse 2: Jake]
Her friends, all her friends say
She needs something
Like some time away
They say, "Tell me all your secrets"
Blast that up, up on some dramatic shit

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
I laugh, I-I-I laugh still
I think that you're just excited
Got my heart up and undivided
Got our love feeling like an island now

[Chorus: All]
Love, is it love?
We got trouble keeping up
Who can say you're the one
And never doubt it
(Go on and tell me)
Love, is it love?
We got trouble keeping up
Who can say you're the one
And never doubt it
(Go on and tell me)

[Bridge: Jake, Nathan]
The way it seems, so quiet now
Subtlety, there's never any need to hide it
I feel it still
We'll never be alone again

[Chorus: All]
Love, is it love?
We got trouble keeping up
Who can say you're the one
And never doubt it
(She'll go on and tell me so)
Love, is it love?
We got trouble keeping up
Who can say you're the one
And never doubt it
(She'll go on and tell me)
Love, is it love?
We got trouble keeping up
Who can say you're the one
And never doubt it
(She'll go on and tell me so)
Love, is it love?
We got trouble keeping up
Who can say you're the one
And never doubt it
(She'll go on and tell me)

[Verse 1: Jake]
I could say it right now
But it's not the time
I see those friendly faces but they only make me anxious
I could shout it out loud
In a crowded space
People have been hoping but I've never been that open

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
There's not much left to do
Even less to say
But glue together moments
Just to throw them all away
Am I looking for a change?
Or a way to mend?
Something tells me different
But I know it never ends

[Chorus: Jake]
I've been here before
Don't you know it's all the same
I've been here before
Don't you know you're not to blame
For feeling
(Anxious, anxious)

[Verse 2: Jake]
This head won't quiet down
For a single thought
I’m all circles, psychopathic
Belly up, I just forgot
That I could say it right now
I could make the time
People have been hoping and I'm finally breaking open

[Bridge: Jake]
I'll scream it but I won't believe it
I'll tell them what they want to hear then
Just give me a week or two to find it
Then maybe we'll get back to the place we started

[Chorus: Jake]
I've been here before
Don't you know it's all the same
Don't you know you're not to blame
I'm thinking that
I've been here before
Don't you know it's all the same
Don't you know you're not to blame
For feeling

[Outro: Jake]
I'll scream it but I won't believe it
(I've been here before)
I'll tell them what they want to hear then
(Don't you know it's all the same)
Just give me a week or two to find it
(Don't you know you're not to blame)
Then maybe we'll get back to the place we started
(For feeling)

[Verse 1: Jake]
Living for the past cause the future's gone
Praying in the dark that you won't go home
I should have said it better
I should have set fire to a letter
Forayed by our own
Playing in the dark, where we bore it all
It all makes sense in the center
All makes sense where I sent her

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
But I could
Run to your apartment
Hope to get it started better than before
And I could write it in a poem
Pretend I used to know you
Better than before

[Chorus: Jake]
Why is it I want to change for you?
Why is it I want to see this through?
Maybe I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
Maybe I'm better off that way
Maybe I don't want to see you stay
But I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
Sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings

[Bridge: Jake]
Love from the west
Grinning mad, light blue and golden
Found at my best
I'm a sucker for your glowing
Love from the west
Grinning mad, light blue and golden
Found at my best
I'm a sucker for your glowing

[Chorus: Jake]
Why is it I want to change for you?
Why is it I want to see this through?
Maybe I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
Maybe I'm better off that way
Maybe I don't want to see you stay
But I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
Why is it I want to change for you?
(Love from the west)
Why is it I want to see this through?
Maybe I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
(Grinning mad, light blue and golden)
Maybe I'm better off that way
(Found at my best)
Maybe I don't want to see you stay
But I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
(I'm a sucker for your glowing)
Sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]

Are you serious?
Yeah!

Oh, my fucking God

[Hook]
Cali' bitch mentality
Come through with formality
Fuck a bitch with split personalities
Stay real as fuck in reality
Da-da-da-da fatalities
Power trippin', brutality
With a bad bitch who's a bad mix
She's like four different nationalities (Nationalities?)

[Verse 1]
Yuh, fuckin' the world and I might climax
Flyer than your girl, then she might hijack
She won't fight back but she'll bite my swag
Tryna ride like that and your eyesight track in the back
Of the club smokin' Li-Lilac
Bitches at the door when they find I'm back
Know I'm on tour and I'm quite high class
I'm outta sight, need an eyeglass
All up in my hair tryna bite my tracks
I'm so sick, circle ya bitch
Boy, let it spin, I'mma make you gag, gag

[Interlude]
Choking

[Hook]
Cause this that Cali' bitch mentality
It's that valley shit, stay mad at me, uh
This that Cali' bitch mentality
Valley shit, stay mad at me
Valley shit, they mad at me
Ugh, cause this that Cali' bitch mentality
Valley shit, stay mad at me
It's that valley bitch mentality

[Verse 2]
Motherfucker I'm pow with a bang
Come through, the coat real, down with the chain
I ride with them thangs, no coward exchange
Only bad bitches get a smile from the face so why would I change?
Cause I howled at the moon, growled at a goon
On the prowl for your moolah so hide what you make, yes
Five for the bitches and one for the fakes
Two to you niggas like deuces
Nigga, just lose it
If you want that, bet a bitch gon' move it
Either you grip that? Or you gon' flip that?
But I don't hang with a strap like nooses
Kill it then do it again like "Oops, bitch"
I'm not Britney, that don't mean I'm
Not sick sipping this Toxic
I don't give a fuck where a punk bitch block is
Let 'em be aware I'm a trending topic, watch it

[Hook]
Cuz this that Cali' bitch mentality
Valley shit, they mad at me
Cali' bitch mentality
Valley shit, stay mad at me
It's that Cali' bitch mentality
Valley shit, stay mad at me
Cali' shit, Cali' shit
In the valley bitch, stay mad at me

[Bridge]

Mad at me, ma-ma-ma-mad at me
Yuh, they mad at me, ma-ma-ma-mad at me

[Interlude]
Check this out, hahaha, yuh, yuh, check it

[Verse 3]
The valley, the valley, these cats is so bummy, I call 'em O'Malley (O'Malley?)
I ain't got no babies but treat my haters like my hubby they daddy (My hubby they daddy?)
I ain't gonna stop 'til my clique is on top and my whip is imported (Whip is imported, -ported)
New to the city, I cruise through the city like "Bitch, I'm important!" (Bitch, I'm important!)

Put some diamonds on your neck, girl have you icy
Or I might just spend a check, I'm still deciding
Bitch, I might be

Ooh I see niggas hatin', they wanna be like me
They wanna pull up in the Wraith outside just like me

Ooh, bitch I might be
Bitch, I might be

[Verse 1: T-Pain]

Looking for a side piece that can
Take all my money from me
Come put that pussy on me
She go, we get some more hoes
She go get the money for me
I feel like Larry Flynt
Imma hustla baby

Unless you fucking up baby
Cause I put that fur on your shoulders
Buy bitch a fuckin' safari
Diamonds all over your fingers
Drive off in a fuckin' Ferrari

[Chorus: T-Pain]

Run like Philly, but I feel like Rocky
Niggas be blocking, never really like me
Heard he want to fight me, I'm not Rocky
Yeah, it's Wop, 

[?]
Show you the drip then I gave you the mop
Feel that it's hot, hate in a jar
Camo pico bitch you married the mall
Say what I wanna, go where I wanna
Try to rob Wop, bitch you'll die in the jungle
If I am the last real one they'll leave me alone
Medusa my love, so they turn into stone
Pass her the bone, covered with stones
House is so big that we kick it at home
Wop

[Verse 1]
Blocked your number then let you come and spend the night
Couple animals, all we do is fuck and fight, ooh
No apologies but we got the best excuses
Making promises, even when we do, it's useless, useless

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when we say it's over

[Chorus]
We do it again on nights we're alone
Say that we won't be more than just friends
I know that you're home, so pick up the phone
'Cause I wanna be where you are
So let's just blame it on love
When the rules fall apart
Let's just blame it on love, blame it on love (blame it on love)
Let's just blame it on love, blame it on love (blame it on love)
Let's just blame it on love

[Verse 2]
Dropping bottles that we finished from the night before, hey yeah, yeah
First we're throwing knives, then we on the kitchen floor, uuh
No apologies but we have the best excuses, no
We can lie about it, baby, but we know what the truth is, the truth is

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when we say it's over

[Chorus]
We do it again on nights we're alone
Say that we won't be more than just friends
I know that you're home, so pick up the phone
'Cause I wanna be where you are
So let's just blame it on love
When the rules fall apart
Let's just blame it on love, blame it on love (blame it on love)
Let's just blame it on love, blame it on love (blame it on love)
Let's just blame it on love

[Bridge]
Baby, you can hold it against me
Long as you keep holding me against you
'Cause we get so high on the chemistry
Every time you leave

[Chorus]
We do it again on nights we're alone
Say that we won't be more than just friends
I know that you're home, so pick up the phone
'Cause I wanna be where you are
So let's just blame it on love
When the rules fall apart
Let's just blame it on love
We do it again on nights we're alone
Say that we won't be more than just friends

Let's just blame it on love

[Verse 1]
I'm speeding past the lights

I'm walking on a dream
Stuck in the time machine
Spinnin' round, take me out of all control

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

From where I used to bleed
Calling out, take me out of all control

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
I feel it coming at the end of the night
I feel it coming, I feel it coming (feel it coming around)

[Verse]
Drop by, anytime
Come fill my head with new lies
I'm here, I'm on the line
You touched my heart, I'm satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
These people in bright cities
That we hang with will never face me
Even though they're so much prettier
They never wanna talk to me, please
Treat me kind
I'm by your side
One second with your hands on me
Is enough to make me wanna die

[Chorus]
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind

I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind (I don't mind if you make me cry, I don't mind if you're a waste of time)
I don't mind if you make me cry (I don't mind)
I don't mind if you make me cry, I don't mind if you're a waste of time
I don't mind if you make me cry (I don't mind)
I don't mind if you make me cry, I don't mind if you're a waste of time

[Verse]
Drop by, anytime
Come fill my head with new lies

You touched my heart, I'm satisfied

I don't mind if you make me cry, I don't mind if you're a waste of time
I don't mind if you make me cry
I don't mind if you make me cry, I don't mind if you're a waste of time
You put the knife through my chest in a heartbeat
In a heartbeat, in a heartbeat
Shoot your gun through my brain, yeah, it's blasting
Everlasting, everlasting

You're the voice that's in my ears
Intoxicated by my tears
Cut me up with golden shears
It's a massacre, my dear
Now I'm lying in the road
Parasite inside my soul
Got me hanging from your rope
Yeah, I'm your puppet now

Now I think I've had enough, enough
Yeah, now I think I've had enough

I gave you love, with a silver bullet
You killed my heart, put a hole right through it all
I feel your hands, they electrify me
Your killing touch better satisfy me
I gave you love, with a silver bullet
You killed my heart, put a hole right through it all
I feel your hands, they electrify me
I hate this love, but I need it
Getting high from the dose of your poison
Of your poison, baby, you're my poison
Homicide in my bed, slow motion
Slow motion, baby, in slow motion

You're sadistic and you're cold
Got me under your control
Like the cigarettes I smoke
You suffocate me till I choke
Now I'm bleeding in the road
Parasite inside my soul
Got me dancing from your rope
Yeah, I'm your puppet now

Now I think I've had enough, enough
Yeah, now I think I've had enough

I gave you love, with a silver bullet
You killed my heart, put a hole right through it all
I feel your hands, they electrify me
Your killing touch better satisfy me
I gave you love, with a silver bullet
You killed my heart, put a hole right through it all
I feel your hands, they electrify me
I hate this love, but I need it

[Verse 1]
We don't hide no, we don't
We don't stray from anyone
'Cause you and I know better
They don't know we have eyes like mirrors
We don't need any armor
'Cause we got spirit and that's enough
So let 'em say whatever
It doesn't matter if tomorrow there's a war

[Chorus]
My love, oh, we are one
And I run, I run through the battle
Oh, I run, it doesn't matter if tomorrow never comes
My love, oh, we've won
And I run, I run through the battle
Oh, I run, to you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I run
Oh, I run

[Verse 2]
Our momentum has fire
Set it off like a cannonball
We're gonna burn forever
It doesn't matter if tomorrow there's a war

[Chorus]
My love, oh, we are one
And I run, I run through the battle
Oh, I run, it doesn't matter if tomorrow never comes
My love, oh, we've won
And I run, I run through the battle
Oh, I run, to you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I run
Oh, I run

[Bridge]
Oh, whoa
No, whoa
No, oh
It doesn't matter if tomorrow there was a war

[Chorus]
My love, oh, we are one
And I run, I run through the battle
Oh, I run, it doesn't matter if tomorrow never comes
My love, oh, we've won
And I run, I run through the battle
Oh, I run, to you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I run
Oh, I run

When they're acting rude
Standin' around lookin' real blue
Skippin' class, kickin' ass, bad grades when I get to school

Ah-ah-ah, you're a mystery and I just can't get enough
Yes, it's plain to say I'm addicted to your drug

Breaking hearts, falling through love

[Bridge]
Watching from the sidelines
Holding your hand, looking forward
When you stand you're so gold
And everyone knows
And I'm feeling so rejected
You'll always be so much better than me
You're ice cold, you're out of control
It's true
I wanna be like you, I wanna be like you, I wanna be like you

[Verse 3]
Man, I just wanna be cool
Wanna dress up like a girl, be a plastic, see-through
Denim jeans, matchin' tattoos
Can you please hit me up? Can I be part of your crew?
Man, I just wanna be cool
All my old friends so lame, rather be sat with you
Try my best to impress, always seem to fall through
What the fuck, out of block, I'm not what you're into?

[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah, you're a mystery and I just can't get enough

Hundred round clip on a Dra-Dra-Draco
Huh, SK, ride 'round with my esés
You ain't seen no M yet, you must be M.I.A
Got that club going up on a Tuesday
Wait that's a dub, I do magic on a Mon-day

[Verse 1]
I don't believe in fate
Nor psychic vision
But when things fall into place - superposition
In any universe you are my dark star

[Chorus]
I want you to want me
Why don't we rely on chemistry?
Why don't we collide the spaces that divide us?
I want you to want me

[Verse 2]
Superstition aims with imprecision
But when things can't be explained - superposition
In any universe you are my dark star

[Chorus]
I want you to want me
Why don't we rely on chemistry?
Why don't we collide the spaces that divide us?
I want you to want me
I want you to want me

[Bridge]
No matter what we do
I'll be there with you

[Chorus]
I want you to want me
Why don't we rely on chemistry?
Why don't we collide the spaces that divide us?
I want you to want me

[Intro: Kamal Keila]

[Intro]
Ayobi
Yeah yeah yeah
I see changes

[Verse 1]
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch: Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
"Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me neither"
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I (Changes)

[Bridge]
I see changes

[Verse 2]
One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over (I see changes)
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh (I see changes)

[Outro]
Ayobi

[Verse 1]
When I was just a boy
By the phone, by the phone
My head was stuck in the clouds
Feet would not touch the ground
You didn't have to leave that way
Didn't have to leave that way
'Cause I was just
Just a boy
By the phone, by the phone

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been holding on to all your promises
Why'd you tell me you were on your way back?
I've been waiting so long
Days have come and they've gone
Don't leave me hanging

[Chorus]
Call me back, call me back, call me back, call me back
Baby, call me back, call me back, call me back, call me back
I've been waiting by the phone, love
I've been waiting by the phone, love
So just call me back, call me back, call me back, call me back

[Verse 2]
You didn't have to be that way
Didn't have to be that way
'Cause I was just, just a boy
By the phone, by the phone

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been holding on to all your promises
Why'd you tell me you were on your way back
I've been waiting so long
Days have come and they've gone
Don't leave me hanging

[Chorus]
Call me back, call me back, call me back, call me back
Baby, call me back, call me back, call me back, call me back
I've been waiting by the phone, love
I've been waiting by the phone, love
So just call me back, call me back, call me back, call me back

[Intro]
(Listen now f—)

[Verse 1]
No one can take me out of this mess
I do it to myself
I lost my phone, my keys, what else?
The acid doesn't help
I'm paranoid as hell and I wanna
Go home but there's no place to run

[Chorus]
Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby, I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer
In the heat of the summer!

[Verse 2]
I've got to figure something out
But I don't know where to start
I found my keys under the couch
But I'm scared of going out
Having all these doubts and I'd rather
Stay home 'cause there's no place to run

[Chorus]
Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby, I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer

[Bridge]
I'll be wasting time
In the sunshine
I'll be flying high
In the summer time

[Chorus]
Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby, I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer
In the heat of the summer

[Verse 1]
Rich bored kids
Pissing away fortunes
They'll be on their skids
Mothers will be tortured
And their dads on pills
Full of disappointment
Cuz they got no skills
Can't fix shit but it'll be okay
When all the money's gone away
And they'll be free
When they're reckless just like me
When they're reckless just like you
You've been stuck inside a dream
The one where you lose all your teeth
And you're in school without your clothes on
But you'll be okay
Everyone I know has got their debt to pay
Sell your soul to make it, that's the modern way
Are you reckless just like me
Are you ready

[Bridge]
Oblivion is coming on
Oblivion is coming on

[Verse 2]
Nothing's real
I really mean it, that's the way I feel
You see right through it cuz you're just like me
The greatest magic trick you've ever seen
Come on and disappear with...

[Outro]
Oblivion land of uncertainty will come along
Oblivion land of uncertainty will come along
Oblivion land of uncertainty will come along
Oblivion land of uncertainty will come along
You can get there with me!

[Verse]
Lights are out the world begins to fade
And I want you to know you're not alone
Want you to know you're not alone anymore

[Bridge]
I'm here with you
When your hands are shaking
I'm here with you
And your heart is racing
I'm here with you
In the darkest shade of blue

[Outro]
You're not alone anymore

[Verse 1]
Some days
I won't get out of bed
Let air-conditioned thoughts inside my head
Like I don't know myself
And I build up a fence
Push away the things that once made sense
And I won't want your help
All alone on the step
Waiting for the gates to open up

[Chorus]
Oh brother; brother's keeper
I'll follow will you lead us?
Oh sister; mother's daughter
I wonder, will you preach?
Will I learn to get better?

[Verse 2]
Sometimes
I just stare into space
Watch through all the film of my mistakes
I just can't help myself
All alone on the step
Waiting for the gates to open up

[Chorus]
Oh brother; brother's keeper
I'll follow will you lead us?
Oh sister; mother's daughter
I wonder, will you preach?
Will I learn to get better?

[Post-Chorus]
One day
I will climb down the step
Just give me one good reason to pretend

[Chorus]
Oh brother; brother's keeper
I'll follow will you lead us?
Oh sister; mother's daughter
I wonder, will you preach?
Will I learn to get better?

[Verse 1]
I am a sinner of a broken church
I am a saint drunk on the carpet
I am the master of my universe
Two floors in an old apartment

I will always be my mother's first
Like my father always love to start shit
Me and my lover watch the fireworks
Left the rubber right in my pocket

[Chorus]
When I close my eyes
I see I see the light
I'll be I'll be the light
Goodnight
Glory be to God
Glory be to God
Goodnight
Glory be to God
Glory be to God

[Verse 2]
Maybe I will graduate
Grandma I'm going back to college
A piece of paper don't fill dinner plates
All the things that make me hostage
Takes a lifetime to break
All the chains that cut the hardest
But the world is yours to make
Shoot straight right through the target

[Chorus]
When I close my eyes
I see I see the light
I'll be I'll be the light
Goodnight
Glory be to God
Glory be to God
Goodnight
Glory be to God

[Chorus]
When I close my eyes
I see I see the light
I'll be I'll be light
Goodnight
Glory be to God
Glory be to God
Goodnight
Glory be to God
Glory be to God
Goodnight
Glory be to God

[Verse 1]
When I was just a boy
My mama told me, "Son
You look so serious
Smile and have some fun"
When I was seventeen
My father let me know
"Life isn't fun and games
Gotta sell your soul"

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know how I ended up
So close to where I started here
I went to war for peace of mind
But what's it for?

[Chorus]
I'm dancing on a tightrope
No time to mess around
Just trying to let my mind go
I'm never coming down

[Verse 2]
I found a preacher man
To help me understand
What we are doing here
What comes after life?
And now the years have passed
Been to the moon and back
And all I've realized
No one knows a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know how I ended up
So close to where I started here
I went to war for peace of mind
What was it for?

[Chorus]
I'm dancing on a tightrope
No time to mess around
Just trying to let my mind go
I'm never coming down

[Post-Chorus]
I'm never coming down
I'm never coming down

[Bridge]
Teachers always say stay in between the lines
Mamma said be quiet if you can't say something nice
Doctors always say take these pills for your health
Now I can't remember how to think for myself

[Chorus]
I'm dancing on a tightrope
No time to mess around
Just trying to let my mind go
I'm never coming down

[Post-Chorus]
I'm never coming down
I'm never coming down

[Verse 1]
Acetate my heart
Bleach it then restart
You are the only
Image in my mind
Memorize the lines
And trace them slowly

[Chorus]
Photographic soul
Stitch together pieces of a life I'll never know
Panoramic girl
You are just a memory that lives inside my dreams

[Verse 2]
Fix me in the wash
Strip my colors off
You are the vision
Swimming in my sight
Captured in the light
A crystal prism

[Chorus]
Photographic soul
Stitch together pieces of a life I'll never know
Panoramic girl
You are just a memory that lives inside my dreams

[Post-Chorus]
My panoramic girl!

[Chorus]
Photographic soul
Stitch together pieces of a life I'll never know
Panoramic girl
You are just a memory that lives inside my dreams

[Verse]
Here at the party I came to alone
Ramblers are rambling, you stared at your phone
I'll stick around if you stick around too
I wanna know why you hide in your hair
Where do you go when you glide down the stairs
I'll stick around if you stick around too

[Chorus]
You and I break out just a matter of time
There's a reason we don't live forever
Reason we don't live forever
You and I break out just a matter of time
There's a reason we don't live forever
Reason we don't live forever
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I

[Verse 2]
Waking with you in the home that we've made
Dishes are dirty and bills to be paid
I'll stick around if you stick around too

[Chorus]
You and I break out just a matter of time
There's a reason we don't live forever
Reason we don't live forever
You and I break out just a matter of time
There's a reason we don't live forever
Reason we don't live forever
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I

[Verse 3]
Now that we're older with gray in our hair
Holding your hand as we glide down the stairs
I'll stick around if you'll stick around too

[Chorus]
You and I break out just a matter of time
There's a reason we don't live forever
Reason we don't live forever
You and I break out just a matter of time
There's a reason we don't live forever
Reason we don't live forever
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I

[Verse 1]
Look in the mirror
Familiar figure
Staring right back at me
Split decision
Now my reflection's talking
But I didn't speak

He said oh my god you're piecing it together
You are just a shadow of me
Oh my lord you've never left the mirror
You were never ever free
But tonight, you will play the tambourine

[Chorus]
You will be the chosen master
You will leave with the girl this time
You will be the leading actor
Movie of your own design
And when you hit disaster
The answer will be yours to find
You're the mirror's master
Now forever I'm resigned

[Verse 2]
Take in the vision
My imperfections shatter in the mirror in me
Another shadow slips in to the chateau
Hoping that I cannot see
I said oh my god I'm piecing it together
You were just a memory
Oh my lord you never left the mirror
You were never ever free
But tonight you will play the tambourine

[Chorus]
You will be the chosen master
You will leave with the girl this time
You will be the leading actor
Movie of your own design
And when you hit disaster
The answer will be yours to find
You're the mirror's master
Now forever I'm resigned

You will be the chosen master
You will leave with the girl this time
You will be the leading actor
Movie of your own design
And when you hit disaster
The answer will be yours to find
You're the mirror's master
Now forever I'm resigned

[Outro]
'Cause now forever I'm resigned
Now forever I'm resigned

You can look in my face and experience it you bitches
Never been with that bullshit so dont you bring it around me
Im from tear it up avenue right off of get down street you know me I say
Never hesitate, always had a pistol, never been afraid to show
Let it whistle like du du du dudu, du du du
Still creepin on my side, will kill you if you try
Give my money to my momma she will give it somebody
Thats my little biddys brother, hes a bad motherfucker
Im smart hes tougher who will survive?
I want to fly like a boy in the sky
I can buy anytihng that money can buy
Oh I
I can turn a knickle or you and homies retired
I can do just anything whatever my soul desires

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, get ‘em off the floor, take ‘em out the box
Turn on the stove, set ‘em in a pot
Don’t forget the jar, whip ‘em ‘till they hard
We about to open up a mothafuckin’ store
We about to open up a mothafuckin’ store
Put the sign up baby, we are never closed
Yes, we’re open, we are never closed
We about to open up a mothafuckin’ store

[Verse 1: Boo]
Hustle to get rich
The only thing lesser than O’s is Mike Vick’s
That’s 7 grams for you fools who ain’t hip
Y’all don’t understand grindin’
Homie we ain’t closin’ shop, we steady reing up
Everything a G and up, nigga stop stressing
All you need bakin’ soda, 7-Up, doin’ pills to stretch it
That’s just a little lesson
I hope y’all listenin’, if not I’m the manager
I could throw some pitchers in, look at what I’m whippin’ in
760 big body, block still doin’ 40
Weezy gave me 60, now I workin’ with a hundred
Bagged up, dope money, bitch keep the stove runnin’

Cook it up in an hour, standing over Chicago
Yeah, nigga, we open 24 hours, y’all closin’
Holla at ya boy, yeah

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Get ‘em off the floor, take ‘em out the box
Turn on the stove, set ‘em in a pot

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
Been the Hollygrove’s Hannibal
Was coward since cannibal
The Apple Street animal, good thing the boot ain’t flammable
Cut through ya cantaloupe
And then I stab you with the antlers from an antelope and vanish in some grams of coke
I’m sick with the hustle and coke is my antidote
I’m sick with the scuffle, I jab at ya mammy’s throat
I grab that thing-thing and then I blam-blam ya folk
And then I cruise off in Tanner’s boat, haha
Shhh, haha
Nigga, feel my breezy, feel my Timbs and feel my G’s and feel my trees
Feel my movement, feel my people, feel my sequel, inject these needles
This is drug music
This that Rock & Roll, Hip-Hop, thug music
Heart missin’, no love music, get used to it
See this the next generation, we smash daughters
Smoke and drank tap water, ride out and jack quarters
But not the type of quarters that you use for Pac-Man
The type to get the stacks fam, serve it to the trash man
My niggas is riders
We ride out in black vans with gats in our black hands in all black fam
My past is my future, I’m livin’ like it’s ‘88
Chopper had to scrape the plate, just to cop the Bathing Apes
You know me nigga, I double up, back-to-back
Why you fake hustlers can’t stack a stack
Young Money, chea

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, brown table
Round table
I break a brick down, I’m the ant pile creator
Gats ‘round the table, gats on the table
Smokin’ on that purple, sippin’ on that maple
That’s syrup for the splizzo, the service never slow though
Even though I drink a ounce and smoke a ounce, fo’ shizzle
I am Wizzle, mothafucker, hundred long in the attic
50 large on my pinky, 20 hard, I’m in traffic
I find a skinny broad so I can pack it
Put the hard in her bra and the soft in her panties
And then I flow off to Miami, cops think we in Atlant-y, and she in Lousiana
Yeah, that’s Lil Weezy Ana
Uptown Hot Boy, red bandanna
We open up shop boy, the scale’s handheld
Put it in the window, it’s on sale

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Get ‘em off the floor, take ‘em out the box
Turn on the stove, set ‘em in a pot
Don’t forget the jar, whip ‘em ‘till they hard
We about to open up a mothafuckin’ store
We about to open up a mothafuckin’ store
Put the sign up baby, we are never closed
Yes, we’re open, we are never closed
We about to open up a mothafuckin’ store

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Boo]
We got-we got DVLP on the beat, This the

Hey, they go for 10 where I’m from!
And that ain’t even drought prices, baby
You ain’t hear about the Birdman? Woah
I’m tired of always stuntin’ on these niggas
Aye

Come short and you don’t get the product
Come in ya homie place, come to collect the product
Niggas respect the Carter

Yeah, you stand next to mama, I put holes in ya mama
You’ll die by her, you was close to your mama
Niggas sleeping on war in ya smoking pajamas
Not the one in Iraq, prick, watch ya back

Bang the 9, sidearm, die calm, bitches
Roll the dice under, all night, water, fishes
Every day, Weezy F. is a gangsta, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Ah! Bold like a Titan, made on the block
Groups slither like a python, replace all stocks
Stash work in my Nikes, blade in my socks
Flash work; “Got a license?” Bitchmade cop
This bitchmade bullshit gotta stop!
Trade in ya Glocks, AKs turn a nigga to a pagan
Chop! Flames burn a nigga ’til a place
Get mopped! Hot! Walk up and get dropped
My nigga boy up in this bitch
I bring the toy up and just spit
I bang the boy up and just split
I beat the boy up with just fists

[Verse 3]
Aim at your hairline and shoot you in your face
Got a Uzi on my backside, 

[?] at my waist
I got money in my spare time and new 

[?] every day
Make a pussy separate when the pistol levitate
Oh! Better days 

[?] that’s what they say
But you ain’t never safe, you could die today
So my niggas they crack the safe and divide the Ks
And we all buy rides with bass and ride by ya place
Three in the morning, awake your mama
Come outside, BOP! You gotta “wake” ya mama, damn
Carry her body in grateful honor
As soon as you put her down, BOP! Lay with ya mama
Man, I was fifteen with a baby mama
Few grams and like eighty thousand, I promise

Staring out my Bentley in Ray-Bans, every day

[Chorus]

Every month in the year, I’m a everyday gangsta! (Yeah!)
Straight everyday gangsta (Yeah!)

[Roddy Ricch]
Package, I had racks on racks
Gotta keep the pump on me, I'ma have a Asthma attack
I'm a crip nigga, gotta put my set on the map
Keep a double cup, gotta pour fours on fours

A real nigga behind bars, they had to let me out

Got killers on go,

With a dollar bill, then I turned it into a hunnid bands
It ain't my fault if your main bitch choosing
Straight outta Compton, I'm a rich nigga, I'm ruthless
Hopped in the dawn, I forget where the roof is
Nine millie, I'm a snap a bitch, I shoot, chill

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Didn't you know, I was waiting on you
Waiting on a dream that'll never come true
Didn't you know, I was waiting on you
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
When you decide to break the rules

[Refrain: Kanye West]
'Cause I just heard some real bad news

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
People'll talk like it's old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you how long have you known dude
You played it off and act like he's brand new
When you decide, to break the rules

[Refrain: Kanye West]
'Cause I just heard some real bad news
Real bad news
Real bad news
Real bad news

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Oh, you just gon' keep another no you won't
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
Oh, you just gon' keep another love for you
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
While I'm waiting on a dream that'll never come true
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
My face turned to stone when I heard the news

[Outro: Kanye West]
What's on the news?
Channel cruise

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Uh, Okay, the news just came in
That Tremaine is, now Grammy nominated
Aw man what a dream, but what'a nigga think
Ain't shit changed but the color of the leaves
Still I'ma go hard, like the dick in da broad
If you hate that, you can put my dick in yo jaws
And don't waste that, I will never lose
Cause the lord where my faith at, uh, take that
I've endured more pain from the game
More strain on the brain than I thought I could sustain
Granddaddy just died, that's gon' bring my daddy close to me
We gon' ride out, and chop it up, that's how it's supposed to be
Life too short for me to worry about your thoughts
God judge me, I give a fuck about the court
Plus y'all all foul like Shaq was on the court
Don't talk shit now, if you ain't back it up before
But y'all can't stop me from reaching my goals
You gay behind doors looking through a peep hole
Tired as a nnnn, I don't never sleep though
Play the game to win, I'll never cheat though
Sometimes it seems I will never beat though
Still how you earn a blow like, C4
Naw nigga can take me take me, no Repo
Naw nigga can face me, no equal
Fire under me, Teeth over lip
Underdog shit like I'm under my pits
Photograph me in a picture like a pimp
The women love me like hate doesn't exist
Suicide songs I slit my wrists
Suicide doors on the whip ain't shit
Do as I can, true as I am
Old niggas can never be as new as I am
I ain't sayin' the same man, life about evolving
Many other dogs who haven't grown, they're just disolvin'
Such a misfortune, triggers such a problem
Ain't no mathamatics to equate him or to solve him
Word is I'm cold, and they just wanna defrost him
Words in my 

[?] turn to songs, turn to awesome
Mind on float, body on coast, which one pick one
I'll probably finna' touch down
Just bought a seven I ain't finna' touch down
Thoughts running like a man trying to get his gut down
Daydreaming of my aborted daughters
Trying to put my best foot forward and balance
Like a skater would, searching for a greater good
Ridin' through my old neighborhood
Outer door wreaths, it was Christmas time
40 chrome piece with a clip inside
Out of yo reach, Salvatore feet
I adore beats, then I kill'em so sweet
Sick of niggas hatin', quit deliberatin'
It's anti-climatic how your antics are average
I'm on acid, you got it all backwards
Trey Songz sing, but Tremaine has all assets
Bastards, bastards

[Intro]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 1]

But first nias gotta find me

The Nets could go 0-82 and I look at you like this sht gravy
Ball so hard, this sht weird

Ball so hard, since we here
It's only right that we be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to be go Michael

Ball so hard, got a broke clock, Rolleys that don't tick tok
Audemars thats losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
Ball so hard, I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
Ball so hard, let's get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
Ball so hard, trip behave, Just might let you meet Ye
Chi towns D. Rose, I'm movin'the Nets to BK

[Hook]
Ball so hard mothafuckas  wanna fine me

[Verse 2]

I said look you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
(Ball so hard, ball so hard), That so cray, Ain't it K?
What she order,what she order?
Your whip so cold, (ball so hard) this old thing
(Ball so hard) Act like you'll ever be around muhfas like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fk ol girl she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French but I'm in France (I'm just sayin')
Prince William's ain't do it right if you ask me
Cause if I was him I would have married Kate & Ashley
What's Gucci my nigga?
What's Louie my killa?
What's drugs my deala?
What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest
Cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in London
And they going gorillas!

[Hook]
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me
Eh!

[Outro]
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Ooh, you are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
I'm definitely in my zone
Oh! Ooooh! Ooooh!
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
I'm definitely in my zone
I'm definitely in my zone

Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me!

[Verse 1]
Every freckle's where it's supposed to be
I play your body like a symphony
Unless you're gonna add on my last name
Then you don't needa change a thing

[Verse 2]
Autumn colors blended in your eye
Your creator must've took his time
Don’t you switch up, don’t you rearrange
No, you don’t needa change a thing

[Chorus]
'Cause when I wake up in the morning
I kinda feel like I’m a king
'Cause when I see you there beside me
No, I would not change a thing

[Verse 3]
You don’t needa put no make-up on
You wake up looking like a Sam Cooke song (Oh lord)
Don’t do nothing, keep it just the same
No, you don’t needa change a thing

[Verse 4]
Oh, you’re Carolina on a perfect day
You look like April, baby, if I may
And if I had to, darling, I would pay
You to never, ever change a thing

[Chorus]
'Cause when I wake up in the morning
I kinda feel like I’m a king
'Cause when I see you there beside me
No, I would not change a thing

[Bridge]
'Cause when the lord freestyled your body
He didn’t make not one mistake
And though the TV tells you different
No, you don’t needa change a thing
Change
No
Change

[Chorus]
'Cause when I wake up in the morning
I kinda feel like I’m a king
'Cause when I see you there beside me
I would not change a, no
And when the lord freestyled your body
He didn’t make not one mistake
And though at times, I know that you hate yourself
I would not change a, I would not change a thing

[Outro]
Change
Ahh, yeah, don't
I won't change
Hey, hey, hey

[Intro]
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want you

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

[Verse 1]
Baby, put on heart-shaped sunglasses
'Cause we gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says
I been waitin' up all night
Take another drag, turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is
Say it's gonna be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Hit me, my darling, tonight
I don't know why but I like it
Gotta get back to the wild
Give it up, give it up
Live it up, live it up

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

[Verse 2]
Let's take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we're here for
Saved too many times
Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed, it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

[Pre-Chorus]
Hurt me and tell me you're mine
I don't know why but I like it
Scary? My God, you're divine
Gimme them, gimme them dope and diamonds

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

[Bridge]
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But baby, I want you, I want you
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But baby, I want you, I want you, I want you

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

[Post-Chorus]
Baby stoppin' at 7-Eleven
There in his white Pontiac Heaven
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

[Verse 1]
Did he tell you you're the only one? (oh-oh)
Did you introduce him to your mum?
I bet "Boys of Summer" is your favourite song (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, me too
Did you lap up all the clichéd lies?
A book of poems on The Northern Line (oh)
Did you wonder where he went some nights? (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, me too

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know it's out of the blue
But I've got something to tell you

[Chorus]
My boyfriend is your boyfriend
At the same time, at the same time
He fooled me and he fooled you
With the same lies, at the same time
Let's make a pact that we never go back
He don't deserve me or you
'Cause my boyfriend is your boyfriend too

[Verse 2]
It's kind of funny when you think of it
There must have been some times we almost met, I know
Jumpin' in and out of the same bed (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, me too
Same sleazy weekend in a slick hotel
Locked our love on the Paris bridge as well
Said he loved me from the day we met (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, you too

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know it's hard to believe
I've been thinking the same thing

[Chorus]
My boyfriend is your boyfriend
At the same time, at the same time
He fooled me and he fooled you
With the same lies, at the same time
Let's make a pact that we never go back
He don't deserve me or you
'Cause my boyfriend is your boyfriend too

[Bridge]
(Shared the love we made)
Oh
(Made the same mistakes)
I know how you feel
(I feel just the same as)
Same as
(You) You
I feel so stupid that I couldn't see
I never thought that this would happen to me

[Chorus]
My boyfriend is your boyfriend
At the same time, at the same time
He fooled me and he fooled you
With the same lies, at the same time
Let's make a pact that we never go back
He don't deserve me or you
'Cause my boyfriend is your boyfriend too

[Verse 1]
Like cigarettes & alcohol
Baby, you're my downfall
Dressed up in that pretty blue shirt
Damn, you're really gonna hurt me
Hate it when you don't call
Warning signals all along
Flowers dying deep in the dirt
Damn, you're really gonna hurt

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, fell really hard for you
You're breaking my heart in two
But I knew all along
And I still played along
Oh, fell really hard for you
You're so damn predictable
And I knew all along, oh

[Chorus]
Only you can make me feel like I'm the prettiest in the room
But then you make me feel invisible
I'm better when I'm
Hanging at the party with your friends, they think I'm cool
Then you show up and make me feel so small
I'm better when you're gone

[Post-Chorus]
Better, better
I'm better when you're gone
So much better, better off
I'm better when you're gone
Better, better
I'm better when you're gone
So much better, better off
I'm better when you're gone

[Verse 2]
Left my clothes at your house
You can go and throw 'em out
Laying in that pretty blue shirt
Only makes me think about
Selective memories so I forget all the bad ones
Like I'm seventeen, I believe you're a good one
The reality is your love is my poison, oh
I still can't believe that

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, fell super hard for you
You broke my heart in two
But I knew all along, oh

[Chorus]
Only you can make me feel like I'm the prettiest in the room
But then you make me feel invisible
I'm better when I'm
Hanging at the party with your friends, they think I'm cool
Then you show up and make me feel so small
I'm better when you're gone

[Post-Chorus]
Better, better
I'm better when you're gone
So much better, better off
I'm better when you're gone
Better, better
I'm better when you're gone
So much better, better off
I'm better when you're-

[Outro]
You can make me feel like I'm the prettiest in the room
But then you make me feel invisible
I'm better when I'm
Hanging at the party with your friends, they think I'm cool
Then you show up and make me feel so small
I'm better when you're gone

[Verse]
Now beam me up Scotty
You gon' find your mommy chopped up in a tub
With "Stop snitchin'" written on a note by her body
I picked up your ho and she wore something tiny
I wore something simple, she like that about me
My dope from the 90's, dope ain't consignment
Coke ain't that diet, I hope you a client
Niggas be snitching, bitches be lying
Niggas who snitchin' we throw to the lions
Ain't no testifyin', you know desert's quiet
Scream until you give your throat laryngitis, we so terrorizin'
You cuddle too much, you choose hoes to confide in
I know where you hide and that ho verified it
I told my homie, "I know where to find him"
He said, "You late, we already got him
And by the way, it was an honor"
That made my day, made me so proud
I bought my bitch some shit from her favorite designer
And a Chihuahua
What's the occasion? Don't worry about it
I don't fuck with snakes except Kobe, the Mamba
Might cut off my hair 'cause these hoes is Delilah's
Let me check my wallet, my pulse and my vitals
I am the greatest, I am retired
It's up in the air like carbon monoxide
We in the buildin', we started from outside
My dick is my third eye, she call it cockeyed
Run with me
Run through a threesome
This shit so wet, it can be sea sickening
Niggas expect some sort of leniency
I'm in high def, but why are you screening me?
I'm Weezy F

[Verse 1]
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar

[Verse 2]
Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee
I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar

[Verse 1]
Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know, you all, where I stand

[Chorus]
(Monday morning) here I am
Want you to know just if you can

[Verse 1]
Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know, you all, where I stand

[Verse 2]
When the morning gathers the rainbow
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too
So to the rescue, here I am
Want you to know just if you can
Where I stand, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know

[Verse 1]
Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know, you all, where I stand

[Bridge]
Sun is shining and the weather is sweet
Sun is shining and the weather is sweet
Sun is shining and the weather is sweet
Sun is shining and the weather is sweet

[Verse 2]
So to the rescue, here I am
Want you to know just if you can
Where I stand, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know

[Verse 1]
Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know, you all, where I stand

[Intro: Ellie Goulding]
And that's the reason
You're in the dark

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

[Instrumental Break: R3hab]

[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
Now I'm dreaming, will ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this, but I know I'm not that strong
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love

[Instrumental Break: R3hab]

[Outro: Ellie Goulding]
I need your love
I need your love
I need your time
I need your love
I need your time
I need your love
I need your time
I need your love
It's that butter shit niggas know I always never stutter with!
Check the styles, check it, uh, peep it

[Verse 1]
I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fifties
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy-pop
Shit, instant, get smoked like Winston cancers
And cut halves through them 

[?] gangsters too
In real life, the real trife scene
Might steal your life with the assault machine
Rifle, dead up, it's a setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like can't white or in full flight
(X) The unemotional, call me anti-social
On the run from off the gun death tally commercial
Death valley is like rehearsal to the streets
To my peeps, 

[?] one-two's on beats
Like the weapons of war
Now you keep from steppin' on my floor, or delivery front door
Special, (ed) and motherfuckers master yours
My disaster causes you: Hell in them gas drawls
The supervillain, cooler than a million, I be chills
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Don't make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin' in my dealings
Sendin' spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown, in the comforts of your own home
Grown, big wheelin', high rollin'
I hold the lye, I keep the sty on my eye swollen
Bitch, nigga, switch the style
X a massive-versatile
Big up to Monster Isle

I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Peep it

[Verse 2]
To my brother Subroc and Black Ju
I crack brew for (you), two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When giving crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers who's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss or motherfuckin' mother goose
X the suspicious flirter
That every hooker hearda', next to malicious murder
Track is type vicious fulfillin' ya pipe wishes
The misses may be legal minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve don't breathe
Sixteen shots I do believe and one up the sleeve (Man)
Master of the O to predict ya last pause
I told you, Hell and gas drawls, breakin'
Glass and plastic jaws like federal drastic laws
Fed up from fightin' secret wars with them Fantastic Fours (with the invisible bitch)
Versus Doom wit' the metal face before I go to state
The ho better settle case
The flow is at pedal pace, steady like tricycles
Beware all suckers is froze like icicles
I'm baggin' bitches like nickels
Cause I licked 'em where they tickle before I hit the clit though
I'ma split till I pronounce, more hits than a ounce no doubt
About to bounce, X the unannounced, I'm out

[Outro]
And I like to give a shout to my man Jet Jaguar
You know, D-Smooth, B-One
Master of the O
I call this joint
In hell with them Gas Drawls

I was on there surfing out of my mind

[Verse 1]
Walking down the street and the billboards seemed to stare
And the posters seemed so dated with what they tell ya to wear
And the buildings on the banquet, your dresses don't sell here
When I'm on the phone, there's no reception here

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't understand me, you don't know my game
I say "What's the malfunction?", you say "Internet connection!"

Lethal poison for the system
Pirate skulls and bones
Sticks and stones and weed and bongs

Hit me on my burner prepaid wireless
We pack and deliver like UPS trucks
Already going to hell, just pumping that gas
No one on the corner has swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
No one—no one on the corner has swagger like us

There is always something that I'm thinking about

Y'all just so metrosexual

This is more like letting that TEC blow
This is more like a left when they say right
When the world do you wrong but you play right
This is more like pushing that white rock
When the world try to put you in a tight box
Coming up in the drop with the system bang
'Cause you don't give a fuck what the system think
Y'all comin up M.I.—M.I.—M.I.A
Semi-spray when you in my way

[Spoken Word]
Yo, yo, yo, what's up, this Lil Boat
It's my muhfucking birthday
So, uh, I made this mix of fucking-
Old shit, new shit
Just some shit so y'all can fucking listen to it, I don't fucking know
Some shit, I don't fucking know
And it's mixed by me, it's terribly mixed
I don't give a fuck, it's my birthday, shit, suck my dick

[Intro]
No, no, staying awake
No, no, staying awake

[Verse 1]
She got a pussy like the Garden of Eden
I tip-toe through the tulips
And I'ma do me, scratch me off my to-do list
I got flies all on my new shit
Loose lips sink the cruise ship
Even gigabyte get their two chip
Havin' a pillow fight with a cute bitch
With a body like a belly dancer
She say you scared of this pussy cat, well if that's a panther
I hope it's pink, I read her mind, yeah I read every chapter
Sit on this dick, feel like you flyin' on a pterodactyl
I ain't got time to play no games
Gimme mind, don't play no games
She say she'll slit me if I'm vain, I said "objection, sustained"
This shouldn't affect my affection
She say she sent from Heaven
That's why all flights were connected
I still use protection, if she's a blessing in disguise
But I swear it's a damn good disguise, because I can't tell
She wish she had me on lock
But there's so many other niggas doin' time
In her brain cells, damn, uh

[Chorus]
No, no, staying awake
Am I sleepin' with the devil?
How the hell should I know
No, no, staying awake

[Verse 2]
Uh, am I sleepin' with the devil?
How the hell should I know
My heart beat echoes 'cause my insides are hallow
If anyone have a towel, wipe the guilt off my face
My high's comin' down like my stilts about to break
She tell shit I never heard when I thought I heard it all
Like you perfect but not flawless but you got the perfect flaws
And what goes around, comes around, out a swirly straw
Then she put that shit on me, I feel like some dirty draws
She say "just don't leave me Wayne, 'cause life is short"
I say "I'm touched but baby, pimpin' ain't a contact sport"
She dyed her hair, I asked her "when's the funeral?"
She laughed and said "you crazy," I said "look who's talking"
And Gisselle may leave her house without makeup and still be pretty
But I wonder if I leave yo' ass, would I still be shitty?
I pour champagne on her, she put cocaine on mine
And we forget everything and six-six-six nine, alright

[Chorus]
No, no, staying awake
How the hell should I know, am I sleepin' with the devil?
How the hell should I know
No, no, staying awake

[Verse 3]
Oh, how well do I know that I'm sleepin' with the devil
Hot pussy loosie, she be goin' at my neck
But I be shot, puttin' loosie, and I sweat when I'm around her
Regret when I'm around her
Ask me "would I die for her?" I say "dead before designer"
'Cause I see through her flames and she see through my snow
She gon' be singin' the blues, hope she could hit them high notes
Pour me a drink of some few and let me spit on this ho
I told that bitch to be cool, like the temperature low
With yo' fine ass, she tell me "gimme some more"
Like high grass but I just trim it and go, I'm on my nigga shit
I call her wifey, she call me a polygamist
And I swear that pussy taste like Devil's Food Cake
Give me a toothache, I feel like fool's gold on April Fool's Day
But I ain't a fool for love 'cause play with love, you get hurt
Play with pussy, get wet, play with fire, get burn, the roof

[Chorus]
No, no, staying awake
Am I sleepin' with the devil? Hell if I know
No, no, staying awake
No, no, staying awake
No, no, staying awake

And all the niggas that I'm with, they in the drug trade

Okay, I'm murderin' this motherfuckin' freeway
You can get murdered on the mornin' of your b-day

My Benz and my Wraith startin' to feel betrayed

You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
You know that they say some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it
And all of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head (Messin' with my head)
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know
No chance
And don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you loved me

Now you tell me you need me

Now it's your turn, to cry
So cry me a river

Aren't we too grown for games?
Aren't we too grown to play around?
Young enough to chase

Are we too grown for changin'?
Are we too grown to mess around?
Ooh and I can't wait forever baby
Both of us should know better

[Post-Chorus]
Ooooh, oooh, been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh, tryna' do what lovers do

100 though, Imma be wherever that money go
Glocc 9 in my underclothes, new cartell, we workin for him
Fuck niggas, we don't fuck with those
Bad bitches, never let them know
Keep them round, but never trust them though
This 62 so comfortable
I'm a field nigga, you's a house nigga
I'm a real nigga, and you's a mouse nigga
Coad red, which means you coad red
But I'll knock you out this, blame it on you old heads

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Fork on the floor, white in the pot
By any means, if you like it or not
Malcolm X, by any means
Many 14s stuffed in my denom jeans
As-salamu alaykum, well, alaykum salonne
Whatever your religion, kiss the ring on the don
Real nigga, street surtified
Hit the streets, wip caussts 335

[Verse 2: Wale]
Wale though!
Malcolm X, get yo head out my pocket
Some niggas walk with death, guess they ran out of options
Tell them niggas we movin, tell them niggas to do it
I sware we going ham, hope some them niggas sue me
Naibor on every block, this bitch ain't got no heart
Shit ain't really same, since Ronald Raigan banned rock
And we ain't land on it, Mr. Raigan
But this gonna make us rich, Mr. Raigan
Wale like them Salom
She see me Friday, then go to Shamon
When I play with her box, she give the greatest top
She say these niggas is her pray, and she makes a lot
Word, how they say we not fly
How they say we not work
They just need convincing like Malcolm Little, before he converted
I'm on my Dean Sha-la, Imma get her right
On the bible, you can run, but you can't hide

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Fork on the floor, white in the pot
By any means, if you like it or not
Malcolm X, by any means
Many 14s stuffed in my denom jeans
As-salamu alaykum, well, alaykum salonne
Whatever your religion, kiss the ring on the don
Real nigga, street surtified
Hit the streets, wip caussts 335

[Verse 3: Pill]
Marching for cars, they put a hole in it
Start the applause, a rebble so lifted
For the paper, the poperotzi so relished
For the mascot lives, teachers do sharades
That's Malic, one behind the brass
Kuruption over cans, leave him leaking in the gass
Better remember, smell that chetter and sills
?
My religion is kitchen, par performers
My pockets ain't normal
Pholosify is rocks and weed, pot to lean, glocc to scream
Niggas clocking dollars, don't know how to read with mouths to feed

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Fork on the floor, white in the pot
By any means, if you like it or not
Malcolm X, by any means
Many 14s stuffed in my denom jeans
As-salamu alaykum, well, alaykum salonne
Whatever your religion, kiss the ring on the don
Real nigga, street surtified
Hit the streets, wip caussts 335

Pt. 1

[Intro: will.i.am]
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on, yo

[Chorus: will.i.am & Slick Rick]
It goes on and on and on, all around the clock
2-4-7 like the hand on the watch
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
It goes on and on and on, all around the clock
3-6-5 'til the new year drop
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
We keep it constant, constant
Constant (Ya don't stop), constant (Ya don't, ya don't)

[Verse 1: ​apl.de.ap]
We be throwing down like Muhammad
Niggas don't be knowing we be flyin' like comets
Slick with the tongue, word out to mouth vomit
Masters of the Sun, we rocking these comics
Better beware, spiritual warfare
Spread the love, northern and southern hemisphere
Black Eyed Peas took it out of the stratosphere
We made it to the top livin' on a prayer
Nation to nation, good vibration
Underground sound hit the whole population
Check the demonstration coming from the Peas
Moving high velocity, no time to freeze
(Music, please)

[Chorus: will.i.am & Slick Rick]
It goes on and on and on, all around the clock
2-4-7 like the hand on the watch
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
It goes on and on and on, all around the clock
3-6-5 'til the new year drop
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
We keep it constant, constant
Constant (Ya don't stop), constant (Ya don't, ya don't)

[Verse 2: Taboo]
My job is to take it to the next
I maneuver through the simple minds and keep it complex
Spritually, mentally, we will connect
We do it intentionally for progress
First is the heart, gotta spread the love effect
Second is the mind, gotta feed 'em intellect
Third is the body, gotta treat it with respect
'Cause you don't wanna be a ghost, be the spirit? Yes
One love, one tribe, staying colorblind
Inspired by Apl 'cause he's really colorblind
We keep it on the positive 'cause it is hard to find
We keep it on the positive 'cause it is hard to find
We keep it

[Bridge 1: will.i.am & Slick Rick]
Constant, constant (Ya don't, ya don't stop)
Constant (Ya don't stop), constant
We go on and on and on, all around the clock
2-4-7 like the hands on a watch
We go on and on and on, all around the clock
3-6-5, watch the new year drop

Pt. 2

[Chorus: will.i.am & Slick Rick]
We keep it constant, constant
Constant, constant
We keep it constant, constant
Constant, constant (Ya don't stop)

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
Bring the tracks out, bring the brass out
I go Coltrane with my sax out
Let's go Soul Train, let's go black out
Turn that bass up, let's go max out
Bring the drums out, bring the beats out
Bring that mic out so we can speak out
When it's lights out, we go freak out
I got freestyles to take MC's out
Mic check one-two, I bring the heat out
I'm givin' you somin' new, somin' to tweet about
Don't be upset when B-E-P out
Ain't no quartet, they just three out
There's the trio, one amigo
Filipino, and a negro
Around the globe that's just how we go
Ain't no stopping, ain't no ego

[Bridge 2: Jessica Reynoso﻿]
Boy, you got a girl, got me on fire
On and on and on and on and on
Boy you got a girl, takin' me higher
Going, going, going, going, gone
Boy, you got a girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, girl
Boy you got a girl feeling inspired
And I don't wanna stop it if it's wrong

[Chorus: will.i.am & Slick Rick]
(Ya don't stop)
Constant, constant, constant
We keep it constant (Ya don't), constant (Stop, stop)
Constant, constant
We keep it constant, constant (Ya don't stop)
Constant, constant
We keep it constant, constant (Ya don't)
Constant (Ya don't, ya don't stop)

[Verse 1]
Breathing in the dark
Lying on its side
The ruins of the day
Painted with a scar
And the more I straighten out
The less it wants to try
The feelings start to rot
One wink at a time

[Chorus 1]
Oh
Forgiving who you are
Just know that if you hide
When you get out of bed
Don't end up stranded
Horrified with each stone
On the stage
My little dark age

[Post-Chorus]
Horrified

[Verse 2]
Picking through the cards
Knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the face
Say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again
All limits of disguise
The humor's not the same
Coming from denial

[Chorus 2]
Oh
I grieve in stereo
I know that if you hide
If you get out of bed
And find me standing all alone
Open-eyed
Burn the page
My little dark age

[Outro]
Horrified
All alone
My little dark age

[Verse 1]
I am the trailer park queen
Jimmy pull up in his blue Chevy Nova
I get him strawberry ice cream
I have been dying for him to come over

[Chorus]
We're gonna listen to the Beach Boys
We're gonna ride in the rollercoaster
When we get high, Jimmy propose
Jimmy gon' buy me a Coca Cola
Jimmy gonna buy me a Coca Cola
Jimmy gonna buy me a Coca Cola

[Verse 2]
I am the New Jersey dance queen
Jimmy's the king of Ticonderoga
When we're together, we're so mean
When we're together, no one can take over
It's love, it's love

[Chorus]
We're gonna listen to the Beach Boys
We're gonna ride in the rollercoaster
When we get high, Jimmy propose
Jimmy gon' buy me a Coca Cola
He gonna buy me a Coca Cola
Jimmy gonna buy me a Coca Cola

[Bridge]
We're going to Coney Island
We're going to Coney Island
We are in love and we're flying
We are in love and we're flying

[Chorus]
We're gonna listen to the Beach Boys
We're gonna ride the gold rollercoaster
When we get high, Jimmy propose
J gon' buy me a Coca Cola
Gon' buy me a Coca Cola
J gon' buy me a Coca Cola

[Interlude]
I never loved somebody so much
I said J, get into the car and if you love me stay
And drive me far, far away from who me and you are
And I wanna go to Coney Island
I wanna go to Coney Island

[Chorus]
So we listen to the Beach Boys
Jimmy drive me to Coney Island
When we get there, Jimmy propose
I said J you don't know how happy I am

["Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"]
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

["Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"]
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)

["Billie Jean"]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth"

["Smooth Criminal"]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?

Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by—
You've been hit by—
A Smooth Criminal

["Remember the Time"]
Do you remember, girl?
Do you remember, girl?
Do you remember, girl?

["Human Nuature"]
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way

["You Rock My World"]
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)

["The Way You Make Me Feel"]
Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)

Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
G'on, girl! Oaow!
Hee-hee! Ooh!

[Outro]
It'll be out by now right?

[Verse 1: Hozier]
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the heaven of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the bearing of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Chorus: Hozier & Mavis Staples]
And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Power, Lord
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power
And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power
Hey, power
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power

[Verse 2: Hozier]
It's not the wall, but what's behind it
Oh, the fear of fellow man, it's mere assignment
And everything that we're denied
By keeping the divide
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Chorus: Hozier & Mavis Staples]
And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Oh, power
Nina cried power
Lennon cried power
James Brown cried power
And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power
Hey, power
B.B. cried power
Joni cried power
Nina cried power

[Bridge: Mavis Staples]
And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you to
Rattle your chains if you love being free

[Chorus: Hozier & Mavis Staples]
But I could cry power (Power)
'Cause power is my love when my love reaches to me
James Brown cried power
Seeger cried power
Marvin cried power
Yeah ah, power
James cried power
Lennon cried power
Patti cried power
Billie, power
Dylan, power
Woody, power
Nina cried power

[Verse 1]
When I first saw you
The end was soon
To Bethlehem it slouched
And then, it must've caught a good look at you

Give your heart and soul to charity
'Cause the rest of you
The best of you
Honey, belongs to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it a gentle sound, the rolling in the graves?
Ain't it like thunder under earth, the sound it makes?
Ain't it exciting you, the rumble where you lay?
Ain't you my baby, ain't you my baby?

[Chorus]
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

[Verse 2]
If I was born as a blackthorn tree
I'd wanna be felled by you
Held by you
Fuel the pyre of your enemies

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it warming you, the world gone up in flames?
Ain't it the life you, your lighting of the blaze?
Ain't it a waste they'd watch the throwing of the shade?
Ain't you my baby, ain't you my babe?

[Chorus]
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

[Verse 1]
When stunted hand earns place with man by mere monstrosity
Alarms are struck and shore is shook by sheer atrocity
A cure I know that soothes the soul, does so impossibly
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on

Me and my babe relax and catch the manic rhapsody
All reason flown, as God looks on in abject apathy
A squall, and all of me is a prayer in perfect piety
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me

[Chorus 1]
When the meaning is gone
There is clarity
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me

And it's easy done
Our little remedy
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me

[Verse 2]
What yields the need for those who lead us oh so morally
Those that would view the same we do through their deformity
Who view the deed as power's creed, as pure authority
This moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me

[Chorus 2]
Since it all begun
To it's reckoning
There the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me

Be thankful some know it lovingly
There the reason comes in the common tongue of your loving me

[Chorus 3]
Like a heathen clung to the homily
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me

So summon on the pearl rosary
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me

[Verse 1]
I couldn't utter my love when it counted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now
And I couldn't whisper when you needed it shouted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now

[Chorus]
Words hung above, but never would form
Like a cry at the final breath that is drawn
Remember me, love, when I'm reborn
As a shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn

[Verse 2]
I'd no idea on what ground I was founded
All of that goodness is going with you now
Then when I met you, my virtues uncounted
All of my goodness is going with you now

[Chorus]
Dragging along, follow in your form
Hung like the pelt of some prey you had worn
Remember me, love, when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn

[Verse 3]
I fled to the city with so much discounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now
Back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now

[Chorus 3]
I was housed by your warmth, thus transformed
By your grounded and giving and darkening scorn
Remember me, love, when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
I don't wanna wear a white dress to the party
I don't wanna 

[da-da-da-da] in the party
I just wanna lay in my bed in the party
I don't wanna, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Baby, why you going right there?
I'm about to be your bad, I'm about to be your 

[at]
Baby, why you going right back?
I'm about to go-go, go-go
I tried so many times
I know if you get right, yeah, yeah
'Cause I tried so many times and I found your type

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wear a white dress to the party
Take it all off, now we're dancing in the lobby
I don't really care if you hate me or you love me
Hate me or you love, love, love, love, love me
I don't wanna wear a white dress to the party
I'm a bad dream and I never say sorry
I don't really care if you hate me or you love me
Hate me or you love, love, love, love, love me

[Bridge]
Da, da, da, da, da
Ahh-ahhh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Coming right back
Da, da, da, da, da
Ahh-ahhh

[Verse]
Baby, why you going right there?
I'm about to be your bad, I'm about to be your 

[at]
Baby, why you going right back?
I'm about to go-go, go-go
I tried so many times
I know if you get right, yeah, yeah
'Cause I tried so many times and I found your type

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wear a white dress to the party
Take it all off, now we're dancing in the lobby
I don't really care if you hate me or you love me
Hate me or you love, love, love, love, love me
I don't wanna wear a white dress to the party
I'm a bad dream and I never say sorry
I don't really care if you hate me or you love me
Hate me or you love, love, love, love, love me

[Outro]
Da, da, da, da, da
Ahh-ahhh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I don't really care if you hate me or you love me
Hate me or you love, love, love, love, love me
Da, da, da, da, da
Ahh-ahhh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I don't really care if you hate me or you love me
Hate me or you love, love, love, love, love me

[Verse: Lady Gaga]
When all the world is a hopeless jumble
And the raindrops tumble all around
Heaven opens a magic lane
When all the clouds darken up the skyway
There's a rainbow highway to be found
What's up?
What's up?

Waiting on the beach with your baby, you know
I'll be on the way
Waiting on the b-beach with your baby, you know
I came for you

Keep them other girls at bay, oh
I would blow them all away, yeah
Keep them other girls at bay, oh
I would blow them all away

Pussycat kittycat, come on play
Pussycat kittycat, come on and play
Pussycat kittycat, come on and play
It's a motel holiday

One, two, one
Faster, faster
He wants it to go faster
Faster, babe
We go, you go
I know you go

Waving on the beach I'm picturing my babe
Tripping on a tidal wave
Waiting on the beach and I'm picturing my babe
Gotta

[Intro]
1-2-3

[Verse 1]
I'm alone in my house
I'm out on the town
I'm at the bottom of the bottle
I've been knockin' 'em down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can't get back up on my feet
See the lights on the street like stars

[Chorus 1]
But look what I found
Look what I found
Another piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

[Verse 2]
Under the foggy day
I’m lookin' for a light
And my only friend
Is workin' tonight

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can’t get myself out of bed
Hear these voices in my head like a song

[Chorus 2]
But look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what I found
Somebody who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

[Bridge]
When I met you I was blown to pieces
Heart all over the floor
Ever since you put me back together
I can’t believe it won’t believe it
Uh

[Chorus 3]
Look what you found!
Yeah baby
Look what I found
Someone who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Look what I found
Whoo!
C'mon!
Look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what we found
Somebody who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Heart just layin' on the ground

[Verse 1]
Life is so simple
A little boy, a little girl
Laughing and loving
Tryin' to figure out the world
It felt like summer when I kissed you in the rain
And I know your story but tell me again

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Nothing you say wouldn't interest me
All of your words are like poems to me
I would be honored if you would take me as I am

[Chorus]
I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face
When I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?

[Verse 2]
I hope you’re still with me
When I’m not quite myself
And I pray that you’ll lift me
When you know I need help
It’s a warm celebration of all of our years
I dream of our story of our fairytale

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Family dinners and family trees
Teachin' the kids to say thank you and please
Knowing if we stay together that things will be right

[Chorus]
I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face
When I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?

[Outro]
Is that alright?

[Verse 1]
Why do you look so good in those jeans?
Why'd you come around me with an ass like that?
You're makin' all my thoughts obscene
This is not, not like me
Why you keep on texting me like that? (Damn)
Got other things I need my mind on, yeah
Other responsibilities
This is not, not like me

[Chorus]
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?

[Post-Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahhh, ahh-ahhh

[Verse 2]
Boy could you please stop bein' so fine
When I stare at you, I wish I were blind
'Cause I begin to lose control
No I can't, can't let go

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause ever since I met you
I've been prayin' on my knees
That you would always stay around
That you would never leave
But I'm the kind of girl that always needs to be free
Why did you do that to me?

[Chorus]
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?

[Post-Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahhh, ahh-ahhh
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahhh, ahh-ahhh
Why did you do that? (Do that)

[Bridge]
I can't stop talkin' 'bout what you do to me
You keep keepin' me from how I'm supposed to be
To be

[Chorus]
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me (Oh why did you do that to me?)
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that (Why?)
Do that to me?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?

[Post-Chorus]
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh, ahh-ahhh (Why did you do that to me?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh, ahh-ahhh (Why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?

[Verse 1]
I can’t believe the things you said
Right now, I wish that you would try
Try to stay near me
Try to be near me
Before I cry
Cause I am gonna need a well
To catch the pain and lift the spell
Like you won’t hear me
Can you try and hear me?
Before I cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Hurry up hurry up (Hurry up)
Before I lose you
Hurry up, hurry up (Hurry up)
Woah, woah
Before you lose me too
Hurry up, hurry up
Woah, woah
Before I change my mind

[Chorus]
Cause I’m gonna cry if you say you don’t need me
I’m gonna cry if you act like you don’t care
Promise me, baby, you know I can’t fake it
Why don’t you hold me?
Tell me you love me
Before I cry
Before I cry

[Verse 2]
Could you please find another way?
I start to think that I'm insane
Tryin' to stay here
Let me just lay here
Before I cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Hurry up hurry up (Hurry up)
Before I lose you
Hurry up, hurry up (Hurry up)
Woah, woah
Before you lose me too
Hurry up, hurry up (Hurry up)
Woah, woah
Before I change my mind
Woah woah

[Chorus]
Cause I’m gonna cry if you say you don’t need me
I’m gonna cry if you act like you don’t care (Don't care)
Promise me, baby, you know I can’t fake it
Why don’t you hold me?
Tell me you love me
Before I cry
Before I cry

[Bridge]
I'm 'bout to lose it
It's got so confusin'
Am I just repeatin' myself?
Say somethin' lovin' to me before I crumble
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me

[Chorus]
Cause I’m gonna cry if you say you don’t need me
I’m gonna cry if you act like you don’t care (Don't care)
Promise me, baby, you know I can’t fake it
Why don’t you hold me?
Tell me you love me
Before I cry
Before I cry
Before I cry

[Outro]
Have I said what I needed to say?
Have you said what you wanted to say?
Did you say what you wanted to say?
Would you try and stop me
Before I cry?

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Wish I could
I could have said goodbye
I would have said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew it would be the last time
I would have broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Oh, oh, oh
Oh

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself lyin' in your arms
Mmmm mmmm
And I wanna pretend that it's not true oh baby that you're gone
Cause my world keeps turnin' and turnin' and turnin' and I'm not movin' on

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
I don't wanna know this feeling unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment
Hoooo ouuu
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Hoooo ouuu

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips

[Outro: Bradley Cooper]
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Don't let another day begin
Won't let the sunlight in
Oh I'll never love again
Never love again
Never love again
Oh I'll never love again

[Chorus]
If I call you up
After 3 AM, with liquor in my blood
Please don't be my friend
'Cause every time I love you, I hate myself
So don't you pick it up
I'm out of my head, go get back in your bed 'cause

[Post-Chorus]
I'm done, uh, uh, yeah
I'm done, done, uh, yeah

I'm chained to your lips and I'm chained to your kiss, yeah

[Intro]
*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

[Verse]
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe "Stan" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L ("Evil" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, "Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
"Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!"
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
"Dawg, that's a date" — "Looks like an olive to me"
"Look, there's an apple!" — "No, it's not, it's a peach!"
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)

[Outro]
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists"
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners

[Intro]
Motherfuckers talkin' crazy (Yeah)
Sayin’ I should quit (Ah)
I fuckin' tell 'em make me (Bitch)
Eat a fuckin’ dick (Yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (Woo!)
On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I’m turnin’ back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia’s an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin’ you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (Ayy)
Feel like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure (Yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause, damn it, I'm still the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world (Yeah!)
Greatest in the world (Yeah!)
Greatest in the world (Yeah!)
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it (Yeah!)
The best to ever do it (Yeah!)
The best to ever do it (Yeah!)
I feel like the greatest (Yeah!)
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good (Yeah!)
Never be as good (Yeah!)
(Packing up) Wife-beaters, white t-shirts, what?
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 2]
So you sold ten million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out ten million albums, eh? (Haha! Wait)
What was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, "Die Antwoord!"
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress (Woo!)
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout—now get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time took
And rappers I hear you talkin' shit
I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget though, and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it (Yeah)
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit (Bitch!)
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's not gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wipin' up everyone in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world (Yeah!)
Greatest in the world (Yeah!)
Greatest in the world (Yeah!)
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it (Yeah!)
The best to ever do it (Yeah!)
The best to ever do it (Yeah!)
I feel like the greatest (Yeah!)
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good (Yeah!)
Never be as good (Yeah!)
(Packing up) Wife-beaters, white t-shirts, what?
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention (What?)
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
And I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension (Woo)
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
Psychopath, Michael Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (Uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene (Pew)
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips, got the Sig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Brr!)
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (Woo!)
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding (Ding!) hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling (Ow!)
But like a wedding band
You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
Anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali
'Cause I knew one day (Hey!) I'm gonna be the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world (Yeah!)
Greatest in the world (Yeah!)
Greatest in the world (Yeah!)
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it (Yeah!)
The best to ever do it (Yeah!)
The best to ever do it (Yeah!)
I feel like the greatest (Yeah!)
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good (Yeah!)
Never be as good (Yeah!)
(Packing up) Wife-beaters, white t-shirts, what?
But I'm the greatest

[Verse: Eminem]
Here we go aga-ain, from heroes to villains
Used to be your Romeo, but we both were jilted
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still, it gave me hope that we'll get
Through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in a E-N-V-E-lope
Would be dope, but what kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho (Damn ho)
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why is she tryna act out?
She's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice
Guys, when someone you'd die for
Sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more?
Another late night in, she stumbles through my door
Lets the daylight in and all we do's fight more
And I ain't violent, but she's goin' through my drawers (Illa, Illa, Illa)
To plant the K-Y in, I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like St. Ides and who's prob'ly screwed five more
Guys, sucked eight-nine men
I'm takin' two-by-fours to our eight-by-tens
Bitch, it's you I tore out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two-ply for when you date my friends
In order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows, this the thanks I get?
I'm waitin' for the day I can
Hear you say, "Marshall, what a skank I've been."
"And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him."
Got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
After you, I swore to make the grey skies end
Here come the rays like when
You get a pay hike and
Am I the good guy or do I just play like him (Illa, Illa, Illa)
And hope that he dumps you?
It's like a dream come true, just to scream "Fuck you!" (Fuck you!)
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in
Since—

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty
They'll call me guilty
You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty
Even though you know the real me
You can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I'll let you say that you're the good guy
'Cause this ain't what love looks like
You can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever
I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I'll let you say that you're the good guy
Play like you're the good guy
Play like, play like, play like you're the good guy

[Intro: Joyner Lucas]
Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Refrain: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it, then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food (Yeah)
Pass the plate (Yeah), where my drink (Hol' up)?
This my day (Yeah, yeah), lucky you, fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!), give me some room (Hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (Boom, bap), y'all gotta move (Woo!), give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished (Bap, bop, bop)
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin' (Yuh)
You might'a went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (Woo!)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time (Yeah!)
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My Twelve Days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo!)
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo!)
Bitch, I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón
Little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've embedded the level, I been the ghetto to ghetto
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now (Yeah, yeah)
Shit get realer, but 'til all the beef die down (Yeah)
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down (Bop, bop)
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shawty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now (Woo! Woo!)
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab, down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo! Woo!)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Refrain: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way (Yeah), I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em (Ah)
Wasn't in it for the trophies (Nah), just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me, fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still, I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said, "I don't have any answers"
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell, but I'm back on these rappers (Yeah)
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, "What a wonderful feeling!
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap (Yeah)
Let's recap, way back, MC's that (What?)
Wreak havoc on tape decks (Woo)
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap (Nah), and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact (Yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks and I'm fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again, as I begin to thinkin' about an evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least seventy or three-hundred milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (Yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA (Yeah)
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
Been prayin' for my downfall (Yeah)
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus: Eminem & Joyner Lucas]
So y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!), give me some room (Hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (Boom, bap), y'all gotta move (Woo!), give me the juice

[Intro: Lil Juice & Eminem]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops (Yup)
Daybed, iPod
"May-back," Maybach (Yup)
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Payless, high-tops (Uh)
K-Fed, iHop
Playtex, icebox (Yeah)

[Chorus: Eminem]
That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (Woah!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us on the mic (Yah!)

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9" & Eminem]
I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me (What up?)
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spider move like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons
I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tires new
The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy
Why these dudes tryna figure out
How to do a freestyle as fly as me? (Why?)
I'm confused tryna figure out
How to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
Everybody doin' chick joints
Prolly rob these little dudes at fist point
'Member everybody used to bite Nickel
Now everybody doin' Bitcoin
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups
On them uppers-and-downers (Woo!)
I'm into stuff like doublin' commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count this shit up and then bust this shit down
When the cops hit us up, we can flush this shit down
We cannot give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff
Now you slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless
If you've got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hirin' strippers, prostitute retirin'
We can spit it for your advance
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants
You niggas—

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops (Yeah)
Daybed, iPod
"May-back," Maybach (Yup)
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Payless, high-tops (Uh)
K-Fed, iHop
Playtex, icebox (Yeah)

[Chorus: Eminem]
That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (Woah!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yuh!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us—

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You say you affiliated with murderers, killers (Ayy!)
The people you run with are thuggin' (Gang!)
But you just a wannabe gunner (Gang!)
Like you was gonna do somethin'
Actin' like you catchin' bodies (Ayy!)
And you got juice, lil' youngin', you buggin'
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery
Bitch, you ain't plugged into nothin'
Rap God spit lyrical bullets (Pew!)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better put a
Strap on, other words if you're gonna
Roll up with your (Gang!) you're gon' need a arsenal
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better⁠—*gun cock*⁠—have arms if you're gonna pull up (Skrrt!)
Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feelin' himself
He wants to keep up his tough demeanour
So he does a feature, decides to team up with N9na (Yeah)
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne
If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun
And I'm talkin' to you
But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublim's and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfuckers
But, just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories jarred like strawberry or pineapple apricot jelly
I respond rarely, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off
Like a fuckin' cocked semi-Glock Demigod
Let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
Non-threatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artille—ry, Godzilla harsh with a hard shell
With a motherfucking heart bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say I lost
You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off of ya
Better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
That I'd be the most hated, though made it
So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
But now those days are over
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
My code name is groper, I role play with lotion
I fucked on the world then I throw away the Trojan
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
I'll blow eighty holes in you
Don't make me go in, I O. J. the flows
And I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman
I'm throat spray and Motrin, I throated Nicole
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
A double-edge sword, it cuts both ways, I poke and
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle to sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original
I consider me and Nickel identical ('Dentical!)—but not us
The only thing we have in common's I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster (Yeah!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (Woah!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us—
(Man, fuck this shit, let's go)

[Intro]
(Fack) Okay, (Fack) how do I say this? (Fack)
Last year (Fack) didn't work out so well for me (Fack)
(Fack last year!) (Fack) (Last year can eat a dick!)
2018, (Fack) well (Fack)

[Verse 1]
Hah, yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-You collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (On it) (Yeah)
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to—

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Verse 2]
I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (Wasn't)
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (Was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should'a let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Interlude]
Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kami, kami-kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze (kamikaze)
Take a look at what I've done

[Verse 3]
I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it (Get it)
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift, beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is

[Verse 4]
Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a foot—oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (What?), 12 inches of wood (Haha)
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words
You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray-on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot

[Intro: Mario Resto]
Take me to the river
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Eminem]
It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof
We wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would pounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof—wrote, souped, and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds
I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group
Shoot!

[Pre-Chorus: Mario Resto, Eminem & Both]
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

[Chorus: Eminem]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel
And I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in
Been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me, Biz, "Rockstar" was the shit
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
If you'da put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
Porter tried talkin' you into comin' up off it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET
And the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed

[Pre-Chorus: Mario Resto, Eminem & Both]
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Bacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops, little drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed
All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get
For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva, and Swift?
A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none
I just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this
To my partners, I can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you men
But I just can't be the guy everybody depends
On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair
I will always be here, but that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era
I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air
I'm barely chartin' myself
Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent
To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road
Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

[Chorus: Eminem]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Outro: Eminem]
I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones

[Intro]
(Illa, Illa, Illa)
(Yeah-Yeah, yeah-yeah)
Yo (Yo), how do I keep
(Man, I don't know what’s up with these hoes, man)
Gettin' in relationships like this? (I'm just sayin’)
Maybe it says somethin' about me (Yeah, yup)
Should I look in the mirror?

[Chorus]
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not 'til she gets her act together

[Verse 1]
She thinks I'm bein’ mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
She’s about to let the demons out
She don't wanna see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin’ to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how—

[Chorus]
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein’ weird's normal

[Verse 2]
And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless
No wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 9-1-1 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger
She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over
Kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted
Up with someone so unlikable and shifty?
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing
She's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
To a motherfucking crime scene?
Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't s'posed to agree, you fucking bitch!
'Specially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceited cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!
I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hopin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognized me and had Milo flip me off
Right out the passenger side window (*Beep-Beep*)
I hit a light pole, you skirt off
And then pull up at 5 a.m. in the drive in a stretched white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with Milo's demo (Ow! Ah)
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you "You're the apple of my eye," so shut your pie hole

[Outro]
Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal? (Yeah)
I just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?

[Intro: Eminem & Justin Vernon]
(Photoshoot!)
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid" (Yah)
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away (Woo)
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY (Yeah)
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once (Yeah!)
You wanted Shady? You got him!

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Eminem]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (Ha)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly (Yeah)
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, "He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit"
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, "Hold your head up!" (Huh?)—Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)—Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a ******, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (Ha), sorry if I took forever (Haha)

[Chorus: Justin Vernon Eminem]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Haha)
Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I'ma have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew (Ah!)
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the Hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall, bitch! (Yeah)

[Outro: Justin Vernon]
It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire

[Intro]
I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

[Verse 1]
Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah!"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Verse 2]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the—

[Chorus]
Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Verse 3]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Skit: Eminem & GPS]
Paul, yo, um
So I got your message, I wish you would answer the fuckin' phone
Um...
(Turn right)
No, I don't plan to reply to everybody who fuckin' says something fucked up about me
But I will say this, I was reading some comments last night about, like (Turn right), what people are fuckin' saying about Revival
And uhh
Yo, this Yahoo motherfucker, whatever the fuck his name is, said I rhy—literally said I rhymed "rhymes" with "chimes"
"Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes"
(Turn right)
Like, you don't understand I'm rhyming the entire fuckin' sentence you fuckin' moron
(In 100 feet, turn left)
It's my fault 'cause you're fuckin' stupid
But I swear to God this motherfucker lives in Michigan and I think I figured out his address
And I'm on my way to his fuckin' house right now
(Turn left)
I'll hit you back later
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Andrea Bocelli & Kanye West]
Por ti volaré (Huh?)
Espera que llegaré
Mi fin de trayecto eres tú
Para vivirlo—

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Like the mindblower, watchin' what we don't want
Whole family here, but it feel like a movie
Feel like a movie, yeah, it feel like a movie
Whole family here, but it feelin' like a—

[Chorus: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
We so livin' so Italian (What?), livin' so Italian (What?)
Livin' so Italian (Yes), I said livin' so Italian (Uh)
Livin' so Italian (Nah), living so Italia' (What?)
Livin' so Italian (Italian), I said livin' so Italian (Ok)

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Hov keep gettin' that dinero, got it
Even if a nigga gotta rob it, get it?
Black Jack in a casino
A nigga got unlimited credit, uh
A nigga got a lot of vendettas, uh
But we the Black mob, we gonna set it, uh
Peel off in a Lamborghini Countach
200 in the dash, we gonna rev it, uh
Lucky Luciano is what they call me, paesano
A 100 keys at the piano
Plays across the Verrazano
El Padrino, in the villa in Venice, sippin' vino
Not bad for a mulignan
Y'all know like we know, ha

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Like the mindblower, watchin' what we don't want
Whole family here, but it feel like a movie
Feel like a movie, yeah, it feel like a movie
Whole family here, but it feelin' like a—

[Chorus: Kanye West]
We so living so Italian (What?), livin' so Italian (What?)
Livin' so Italian (What?), I said livin' so Italian (What?)
Livin' so Italian (Nah), livin' so Italian (What?)
Livin' so Italian, I said livin' so Italian

[Verse 1]
For starts
What a waste to say the heart could feel apart
Or feel complete, baby
Why would you make out of words a cage for your own bird?
When it sings so sweet
The screaming, heaving fuckery of the world?
Why would you offer a name to the same old tired pain?
When all things come from nothing and, honey, if nothing's gained?

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
It's how I know now that you understand

[Chorus]
There's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again

[Verse 2]
Let it hurl, let the awful song be heard
Blue bird, I know your beat, baby
But your secret is safe with me 'cause if secrets were like seeds
Keep my body from the fire, hire a gardener for my grave
Your secret is safe with me, and if secrets were like seeds
When I'm lying under marble, marvel at flowers you'll have made

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand

[Chorus]
There's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the pain, honey, the sweeter the song
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
But I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
It's how I know now that you understand
How big the hourglass, how deep the sand
I shouldn't hope to know, but here I stand

[Chorus]
And there's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
But I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again

[Verse 1: Anne-Marie]
I don't wanna lie, can we be honest?
Right now while you're sitting on my chest
I don't know what I'd do without your comfort
If you really go first, if you really left

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Read & repeat every conversation
Being with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday you've got me praying

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Pre-Drop: Anne-Marie]
Don't leave me a...

[Drop: David Guetta & Anne-Marie]
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha

[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
I don't want to call and you not answer
Never see your face light up my phone
Never see you singing "Tiny Dancer"
Everytime my head hurts, everytime I'm low

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
'Cause I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Everything about you uncomplicated
Here with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday, you've got me praying

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Pre-Drop: Anne-Marie]
Don't leave me a...

[Drop: David Guetta & Anne-Marie]
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha (make me, alo..)

[Bridge: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me
Don't you ever go
Don't you ever leave me
No, oh

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Outro: Anne-Marie]
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Intro]
Motherfucking man, I done learned from the best of ‘em
Took the first slot and niggas still second-guessing him
Hoes, I’m undressing ‘em (Yup); foes, I’m not stressing ‘em (Nope)
Outlasted a bunch of ‘em, out-flowed the rest of ‘em

[Break]
Green Lantern
Here’s a—Here’s a another one

Here’s a—Here’s another one

(Believe that, baby! Oh!)

[False Start]
Sm—Smoking on some Cali and my eyes was dazed (Luda!)
Smoking on some Cali and my eyes was dazed
Smo—Smoking on some Cali and my eyes was dazed
Ain’t a damn thing changed, listen here, man, look (I know that)

[Verse]
I hit heavy in the trunk, so I say I'm heavy-hitting (Hitting)
My car just got a Jheri curl, the paint still drippin' (Drip)
My whip so clean, I turn lovers into haters
Then I make 'em come around like curl activator (Woo!)
There are none greater; I'm the freshest on the scene
The rap Damon Jones, I'm the freshest on the team (Team)
But really, I'm a coach, spitting game to the players (Okay)
And I'm yellow with that purp like I came with the Lakers (Hahahaha)
I'm out to get that paper (Yeah), the mule and the acres (Yeah)
I'm repping for the rich, red-monkey Bathing Apers (Go ‘head)
So catch a contact like you inhaled Luda vapors (Aight)
‘Cause rappers get smoked like I rolled in some papers (Oww!)
Put 'em in a ashtray, throw away the roaches (Go)
Move them out my pathway, show them who's the dopest (Yuh)
I bring home the bacon and protect it with the toasters (Okay)
Like the lens on your camera, fuckboy, I'm so focused!

Green Lantern
You’s a superstar, boy
5,000 Watts
You’s a superstar, boy
The boy Ludacris
You’s a superstar, boy
You’s a superstar, boy, why you still up in the hood?

[Busta Rhymes:]
Uh, y'know, this time as we circle around the block, as we travel through the hood
Ya mean? This time I had to pick up one of my homies to help me tour guide you again through the hood - my nigga Luda!

[Rick James - sampled from "Ghetto Life" + (Busta Rhymes):]
When I was a young boy, (REMIX!) growin up in the ghetto! (REMIX!)
Hangin out on corners, (REMIX!) singin with the fellas (REMIX!)
Lookin for the cute chicks, (Flipmode, bitch) tryin to find me big fun (DTP)
Lookin for some trouble, (Yeah, yeah) or anyone who'll give me some (Here we go!)
I was young and crazy! (In the ghetto) (REMIX!)
Didn't know what my life would be (In the ghetto) (REMIX!)
I was dumb and oh so lazy (In the ghetto) (REMIX!)
Something had a spell on me (In the ghetto) (REMIX!)
You all know what I'm talkin 'bout (Talkin 'bout ghetto life)
(Talkin 'bout ghetto life) (And as we continue on)
You all know what I'm singin 'bout (Talkin 'bout ghetto life) (We gon' continue to travel through every ghetto through every part of this motherfucking planet, ya heard?)
Ghetto liiiiiiiiife (Talkin 'bout ghetto life) (LET'S GO!)

[Busta Rhymes:]
(In the ghetto) Crackheads all over the place
Where they be stockpile dry boogers on they face
Where they mother put spit up on they finger - wiping it off
Or put a knife to the skin of a few - slicing it off
Where younger kids be looking at the older man funny, like he trifling
Recycling soda can money
My niggas ball now and youngins try to ball later
While they hustle, muzzle em, selling a final call paper
For the perm, when you see the black hair natural
Crackhead'll off a nigga's head for a capsule
Find alot of good game, alot of hood fame
Police know alot of niggas by they first name
Experience your first struggle, and you'll see your first pain
Get your first drug money, it'll be your first chain
Now, and even when it looks like shit is getting worse
Up in the ghetto, regardless I'm a rep the hood first
Gotta love it

[Chorus: Rick James + (Ludacris)]
(Talkin 'bout ghetto life)
(Talkin 'bout ghetto life)
You all know what I'm singin 'bout (Talkin 'bout ghetto life) (Remix, yeah, we know about that ghetto life, remix)
Ghetto liiiiiiiiife (Talkin 'bout ghetto life) (Luda! Check it out, look)

[Ludacris:]
(In the ghetto) That ghetto life sure is drastic!
All the furniture's covered in plastic
Hand-me-down brothers with past clothes
Milk crates as basketball goals
Lil kids go to SLEEP for dinner
Use hangers as t.v. antennaes
We drink kool-aid without the water
And most kids is without they father
Use pots and pans for roof leaks
Crackheads with average 2 teeth
Tell grandmama to stay strong
The ambulance is taking to LONG!
Lil babies out playing in the street
Use the oven and stove as HEAT!
Alot of tests and daily scars
And we gotta drink out of jelly jars when

[Chorus:]
(Talkin 'bout ghetto life)
Ghetto liiiiiiiiife (Talkin 'bout ghetto life)
You all know what I'm singin 'bout (Talkin 'bout ghetto life)
Ghetto liiiiiiiiife (Talkin 'bout ghetto life)

[Busta Rhymes:]
(In the ghetto) Look, see the shit so simple
Kids watch what we do with the project windows
Selling drugs on the strip, hoping that your chips grow
Hanging clothes on the line, hoping that the wind blow
To dry that shit off, you know that it ain't really that
Gotta save money for that food, fuck the laundromat
Despite the struggle and all
No matter how the thing pop
Forever repping the ghetto
Can't stop, won't stop

[Ludacris:]
Yeah!
Playing hide-and-go seek don't seem right
Playing red light, green light (In the ghetto)
You get beat with extention cords
And the cops got friends of yours (In the ghetto)
Whatchamacallit, thingamajigs, what's-her-face and what's-her-name is up (In the ghetto)
No heat so you shiver up
And the pizza man don't deliver up (In the ghetto)

[Outro: Rick James + (backup singers)]
(Talkin 'bout ghetto life)
You all know what I'm talkin 'bout (Talkin 'bout ghetto life)
You all know what I'm singin 'bout (Talkin 'bout ghetto life)
