Pull up to my crib in your black Range Rover
I got some plans that don't involve my hands
Get out and walk up slowly, lemme see your new Manolo
I don't think you ready for what's about to happen behind closed doors
And girl I want you to enjoy yourself, have you feelin so good inside

Girl your skin tone's so lovely, got me breakin' out in cold sweat
You been here for 15 minutes, I don't know which way to go yet
Girl you're so soft, I wanna break you off with some of this good love
And you can tell me what to do, I won't stop until you say so
And girl I want you to enjoy yourself, have you feelin so good inside
So jump up on this roller coaster, let me take you for a Nappy ride

Yeah man, I'll smoke wit'chu, y'knahmsayin?

Ain't shit to me y'knahmsayin it's just like
I don't be wantin to get high
Cause that shit be lookin like it be havin niggas y'knahmsayin?
That right there, believe it all, ha ha ha, yeah y'all
Nah man I, I mean, think it's gettin tired though, no joke f'real
What you got on, you got a Swisher? Or, that's a Philly or what?
Oh that's a Swisher okay I mean y'know
Y'know niggas rap about Swishers and shit
They don't believe in at all, ha ha ha ha
Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-ch'all {*laughing fast*} y'knahmsayin?
I hit it man, roll it and... oh you got one? Aight
Let me hit that shit man

[Verse 1: Styles P]
You can knock, on my door but ain't, nobody home
I might be there, but I'm gone cause I'm stuck off a zone
I'm "Half Baked" like the guy on the couch, I don't get high I'm a grouch
So I puff, on my line and be out
I call my road dog, pick me up with weed, let's hit the road dawg
You blew it with a hood rat, the fuck you break the code for?
God damn I think that I'm high, too much haze
But I, see my ghost pass within the blink of a eye
And them ghetto niggas, know how it feel
I smoke more than a buildin on fire roll more than the wheel
I get stuck like a car in the mud, and blow my greens out
And call my nigga T-Pain to borrow some buds
And then choke, 'til I think I'mma cry, or I think I'mma die
Nah dawg, I just think that I'm high, shhh

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
See I ain't ever smoked befo'
So I'mma take two hits and I'mma blowwww my mind away
I never thought I'd be gettin high today-ay-hey-ayy
Now it's on me again so I take another pull - hooooo!
We in the Cadillac, floatin like the ocean
Suddenly everything was movin in slow motion
So I take another hit, and try to relax
I'm beatin on my chest, CJ beatin on my back
Somebody help me I think I'm 'bout to die
But I got it, I got it, WHOA~!
So I passed the blunt, it came right back to me
But I know that this smoke is still runnin through me
I don't think I'mma ever open my eyes
My homeboy said, "Why?" And I said cause

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm high-iiiiiiigh-iiiiiiiiiigh
Dawg I think that I'm high-iiiiiiigh-iiiiiiiiiigh
Dawg I feel like I'm high-iiiiiiigh-iiiiiiiiiigh
I really think that I'm high-iiiiiiigh-iiiiiiiiiigh

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Shit, God damn
DAMN~! Please stop by the sto'
Cause my, mouth dry and I done ran out of Ho's
Oh, them Little Debbies got me lickin my chops
But I just, want a drink and Newport shorts in the box
Maybe a Swisher Kaing or three, I seen fine behind
That want to hang with me, long as I bring the weed
I said cool, I'mma ride on through
Thirty minutes later we was getting high in the room
And then I, take another hit, and try to relax
I'm beatin on my chest as God is beatin on my back
Somebody help me I think I'm 'bout to die
But I got it, don't touch me I got it, OHH~!
I passed the blunt and it came right back to me
But I know that this smoke is still runnin through me
I don't think I'mma ever open my eyes
My homegirl said, "Why?" And I said that

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm high-iiiiiiigh-iiiiiiiiiigh
Dawg I think that I'm high-iiiiiiigh-iiiiiiiiiigh
Dawg I feel like I'm high-iiiiiiigh-iiiiiiiiiigh
I probably can't sing cause high-iiiiiiigh-iiiiiiiiiigh

[Outro: T-Pain]

It's somethin bout'cha
That's got me doin things I said I'd never do (never do)
And I can say I'm amazed
The way you put it on me, how you got me chasin you (chasin you)
And I could care less, I could give a damn
Cause see you my ride or die
You're a down ass bitch who don't take no shit
Keep it real though and still look fly

[Verse 2: Sean Paul]
Real talk I'ma tell you out the whip
It ain't yo' face and it ain't yo' hips
It's how you roll my weed and lick dem lips
And, when I dip shawty you don't even trip
You give me rubberbands for my grip
You the fly bitch steppin up out my whip
I'm your nigga girl we like "This done"
And when the hook say you got me like dat dere I'm sprung

[Bridge 1: T-Pain]
Oooh she got me doin the dishes
Anything she want for some kisses
I'm cookin for her when she gets hungry
All she do is actin like she want me
She cuttin off all my homies
Even all my other 'ronies
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinkin 'bout it lately
Man! She really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her...
But now I'm leavin quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin everythang with me
When it all come down to her

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm sprung
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I'm sprung.. (I'm sprung)
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you

[Verse 3: Trick Daddy]
I ain't never been a sucker for love
Never even had a gilrfriend 'til I started fuckin with her
Ain't never even knocked her down
And she hooked on awards tryin to lock me down
With one flick of the tongue I was sprung
And we didn't get done 'til fo' or five in the mornin
She had me deep in the zone
You get a brand new wardrobe but baby you ain't goin home
The new Jag and all the Louis bags
Chanel and Excata straight from Belle Harbor
I told my homeboys I'll holla
I got plans for a date, my girl want steaks
And she prefer Benihana's
We can go from Monday to Sunday, don't even matter 'bout the money
I'm stuck on her, never shoulda let her suck on it
Shoulda hit her up and sent her home the next mornin

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm sprung
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I'm sprung.. (I'm sprung)
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you

[Bridge: T-Pain]
You do (You do)
You do (You do)
You do (You do)
You do (You do)
You do (Do do do)
You do (Do do do do do)
You do (Do do do do do do do do)

[Verse 4: T-Pain]
So we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin' what I want to
With nobody tellin' me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feelin' so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But I'm feelin' kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her
Now I'm leavin' quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well it all come down to her

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm sprung
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I'm sprung.. (I'm sprung)
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you

[Outro: T-Pain]

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'd rather get it while the going's good, baby, you know I would
Do you better if you treat me the same
I'd rather get it while it's hot, than stay there while it's not
Ooh girl you not the same any more, you not the same
I'd rather get it while the going's good, baby, you know I would
Do you better if you treat me the same
I'd rather get it while it's hot, than stay there while it's not
Ooh girl you not the same any more, you not the same

[Verse 2: Akon]
Akon, yeah
Girl you know my steez, always in the streets
Steady packin my heat, case some nigga wanna come test me
You made me slow it down, especially when you come 'round
How the hell it go down got me actin like a clown?
It ain't funny, girl, you're not the same no more
Spendin too much money and the sex ain't the same no more
Girl you had me fooled (up and shacked up)
Ooh (now you're washed up) hate it but it's jacked up
As Konvicts, we gotta

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'd rather get it while the going's good, baby, you know I would

You not the same anymore, you not the same
Girl, you not the same anymore and you know, know
You not the same anymore, you not the same
Girl, you not the same anymore and you know, know

[Verse 1]
Yeahhhhh
How many times have I told you love you?
Don't seem to change a thang, girl you're not the same
There was a time when you wanted me to hug you
And treat you like, the lady that you wanna be
The girl I knew that wanted me
Would never try to hold me back
And do me all this wrong
Girl what's goin on?
I tried to talk and you walk away
Right out of my face, right out of my place, but

[Chorus]
That's just it, girl
You just don't know how much I love you now
That you walked out of my house
That's just it, girl
It'll be another day, be another way
To get you right back in my place
That's just it, girl
You just don't know how much I love you now
That you walked out of my house
That's just it, girl
It'll be another day, be another way
To get you right back in my place

[Verse 2]
How many times have we sat at a table
And both ate at one time, and said what's on our mind?
I'm thinkin our relationship was a fable
A fairytale to me, that's just how it seems (oh girl I heard)
Even when I heard that you was cheatin I was faithful
And would do any God damn thing that you would say too
I tried to talk and you walk away
Right out of my face, right out of my place, but

[Chorus]
That's just it, girl
You just don't know how much I love you now
That you walked out of my house
That's just it, girl
It'll be another day, be another way
To get you right back in my place
That's just it, girl
You just don't know how much I love you now
That you walked out of my house
That's just it, girl
It'll be another day, be another way
To get you right back in my place

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
That's just it, girl
You just don't know how much I love you now
That you walked out of my house
That's just it, girl
It'll be another day, be another way
To get you right back in my place
That's just it, girl
You just don't know how much I love you now
That you walked out of my house
That's just it, girl
It'll be another day, be another way
To get you right back in my place

Ay man I know y'all feelin like can't touch me dog
But I'm right here, I ain't goin nowhere dog
Yeah, yeah, sheeit I'm just a rapper turned sanger man
What you is dog? I'm just a rapper turned sanger man
What you is dog? I'm a rapper turned sanger man
Ay, what you is dog? Don't even worry 'bout it

[Verse: T-Pain]
Ay, now let me tell you a lil' story 'bout this young rapper man
Shit, from the start in his heart, he had a passion to sing
What a passionate mayne - rapper, producer, a whole stack of thangs
And then one day he said to himself "You know, a man has to change"
So now he a rapper, a sanger - a dancer, a romancer!
Man cancer can't be way mo' too serious
I'm tryin to drop this real but they ain't hearin this
They fearin this - used to all that shit that they hear on the radio
I bet'cha I catch the ear of somebody and they gon' play me though
So we came up, not givin' a fuck, what a nigga gotta say 'bout Pain
Got niggas lil' ladies droppin their panties
Smackin' their fannies, sayin his name
So I'm playin the game they want me to play
Sayin everything they want me to say
And I promised homeboy if I get back to this rappin it won't be today
Ain't got time for the rap shit, bap shit, makin hand clap shit
Nappy, nappy, nappy mo' nap shit
That shit second, this shit first
That shit hard, but this shit worse
And this shit curse me and it hurts me to let it go
But I gotta come back to the sack to let these other niggas know
That it's another side to Teddy, a dull side of the machete
A fuckin prime spot on the Chevy, the situation gets heavy
So find it in your heart to let me put this gangbang shit away
I've made it up in my mind that I'mma change today
A rapper turned sanger

I got them banging drums, she got them Alicia keys
Ooh girl let's make a beat, ooh, girl, you make me weak
Like every time the track break
Make the control room boom like a 808
And if you walk your thong into this vocal booth
I can guarantee I'ma make this song all about you
And you know I got that drank, you know I got that stank
It's amazing how I think, and I do, so
And every time I meet a girl, she tell me that she sing
And I say I got a house with a studio
I'm just tryna do my thing, baby, video or audio
Shawty, I'm so smooth, I go everywhere that water go
Ooh, so bad, so mean
Make me wrap your ass up like a hot sixteen
And I promise you ain't wanna hear nobody else flow
Welcome to my studio, you gon' love my studio

Do you mind if I pluck upon your string for one minute?
And do you mind if I do some nasty things for one minute?

[Intro: Akon]
Konvict! (Konvict!)
New York City!
All the way to Los Angeles, California
From the dry lands to overseas baby
To all my beautiful ladies, I see you

[Verse 1: Akon]
The first thing I noticed when I walked in the club
Girl was you watchin me
Then I started walkin' towards her
When I lost her in the crowd, where could she be?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Akon]
You got me in the middle of the dance floor
Just searching for you girl (I'm steady lookin for you baby)
I ask myself were you created in this world
By the beauty in you girl (and I can't believe that you got me)

[Chorus: Akon]
You got me so... you got me so
You got me so high and confused I don't know what to do
So... you got me so
You got me so high and confused I don't know what to do

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
(T-Pain, Konvict)
Now you got me all in the club
Like I ain't got nothin' better to do than look for you, yeah
Cause I'll be here all night searchin'
Do what I gotta do 'til I find you

[Pre-Chorus 2: T-Pain]
You got me in the middle of the dance floor
Just searchin' for you girl (I said I'm searchin' for you girl)
You got me sweatin', got me weak in the knees
Cause I've been workin' for you girl (and it's so hard because I'm so)

[Chorus: Akon & T-Pain]
You got me so... you got me so
You got me so high and confused I don't know what to do
So... you got me so
You got me so high and confused I don't know what to do

[Verse 3: Akon & T-Pain]
Now I'm lookin in the back, while I'm lookin in the front
While I'm standin' in the middle like where are you?
(I could've sworn that she walked right past me baby)
Niggas sippin on 'gnac, contact from the blunt
Got me lookin at ladies, where are you?
(I could've sworn that she looked right at me)
Cause I'm lookin for you

[Pre-Chorus 1: Akon]
You got me in the middle of the dance floor (Baby you got me)
Just searching for you girl (Looking for you)
(And I'm tryin to find you baby, ooh)
I ask myself were you created in this world
By the beauty in you girl (the beauty's got me going crazy)

[Chorus: Akon & T-Pain]
You got me so... you got me so
(Come on and find me, I'm looking for you)
You got me so high and confused I don't know what to do
(Baby where can you be - where can you be)
So... you got me so
You got me so high and confused I don't know what to do

[Outro: Akon]
So high
Don't know if I can go on through this night without you
{*distorted*} "Where is everybody?"
"Don't stop now..."
"Don't stop now..."

[T-Pain]
Heyyy, yeah
I don't really wanna do nothin today
Just wanna do you tonight (you tonight)
And the only way that I'll be satisfied
Is if I do you right (do you)
I want you to feel it (feel it) comin (comin)
Stronger (stronger) longer (longer)
If fuckin you ain't the right thing to do
Then I can't get no wronger (wronger)
I'm pullin (pullin) hair (hair)
Slappin derrieres ('ere)
All you gotta do is say {"Don't stop now"}

[Hook: T-Pain]
And I won't, I promise this
I'm gon' be the dominant one, I got you bitch
Squeeze that pillow, bite that shit
Ohhh, it feel good, don't it? (don't it?)
Tell me that you want (want it)
Shorty call me daddy {"Don't stop now"}
Don't stop it (stop it) stoppin
Don't stop it (stop it) stop it
Don't stop it (stop it) stop it

Girl, I don't really know what else I can say
But baby girl you look tight (you look tight)
And I'm sittin right here lookin in your eyes
And they're tellin me everything you might like (you might)
I want you to feel it (feel it) comin (comin)
From a bigger (bigger) nigga (nigga)
I'm not what you're used to fuckin with (oh no)
I'm a little bit thicker (thicker)
I'm pullin (pullin) hair (hair)
Slappin derriere ('ere)
All you gotta do is say - don't stop now

[Hook]

[Intro: T.I.]
(Yeahhh! Yeahhhh!) Ayy, it's for all my cats man
Have you ever been in the club and have a chick run up on you
And kinda tell you to buy her a drink homey?
I mean, it ain't what I can do, it what I will do~!
And attitude is everythang, y'know what I'm sayin?
I mean, a chick who ask for nothin'll get everythang
The chick who ask for everythang'll get nothin
Pain, why don't you talk to these motherfuckin broke bitches for a minute
Would you?

[T-Pain]
You may want a man with some consideration (consideration)
Determination (determination) a lil' conversation (how you doin baby?)
And you might want a man who just ain't straight up nasty (straight up nasty)
From Tallahassee (it's the eight-five-oh) you're far too classy (far too classy)
So you might want a man who's got a job (job) car (car)
Clothes (clothes) jewelry (jewelry) girl that just ain't foolin me to you (no)
Do you (no) think that I'm that easy shawty?
It can't go that breezy shawty, find another dude cause it ain't me

[Hook: T-Pain]
Put you in the Range, buy you expensive thangs
It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me
No way, no how, uh-uh

Ice out all your fingers, take you out and make you famous
It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me
No way, no how, uh-uh
It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me

[Akon]
I know you thought you had a sugar daddy plan to treat me like a herb
Take my money cause I'm attracted then kick me off to the curb
Dine in fancy restaurants eating expensive hors d'oeuvres
How I'm gon' let you get it all like that without the big lip girl that's my word
And if you wanna ride, then I just can't let it slide
If you plan to get me for all I got you could start by spendin the night
Otherwise let me see yo' head get small less you're here to make the head get tall
If not go on get lost cause that ain't me (if not go on get lost cause that ain't me)

[Hook]

[T.I.]
Hey, shawty look so good so she think I should throw dough to her like it ain't nothin to it
Get you whatever you like, I could but all I be givin you tonight is just wood
Hood, to my heart I do it, huge and yo' attitude just blew it
So rude that yo' mentality's distortin yo' reality
Actually the more you speak make me think where I'd rather be
I don't care if you hidin me cause I won't sponsor shoppin sprees
It's lots of freaks that I could be showing my generosity to
Boo, stop it please, I ain't that guy, you ain't that fly
Got yo' head up your ass that's why all you ask for is all I deny
I do for you what I decide and I can buy all kinds of things
Go places, spend all kinds of dough, my kindness is no blindness though
T-Pain, where you find this ho? Ha ha, I know what you want me to do

[Hook]

[T-Pain]
Yeah, uhh
Mmm-mmm
Hmmmmm, keep goinnnn

For somebody, someone
They make me feel so joyous

Sick and tired of all the stuff
They give me reason to keep goin
And goin
When I feel like I should quit

I never knew this would happen
And if you knew 'bout my past
You would seeeee
Whyyyyy it's a miracle
Heh, but you can see why I'm happy
Nobody wishes for me
This was prayer, where
Would I be without them? Heh
And when I try to give it up
Sick and tired of all the stuff
When I feel like givin up

They give me reason to keep goin

But I done +cleared+ the rumors
E'rything in the open, now you know how big the room is
Tell 'em what the truth, they can't handle it
They thank a nigga's slicker than a mayonnaise sandwich

From the V.I.P. to the main stage
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoahhhhh
Yeahh-YAY~!

[T-Pain]
I never seen a shorty dooo that (that)
On a pole (on a pole)
Reach in my pocket pull out two stacks
Then I throw (throwwww)
If you've ever done thism don't you feel dumb when
Shorty come over to you and start gettin it on
Then the song is almost done (that's so wrong)
So I made a long (long) lap dance song

[Hook]
I need a 2-for-1 or somethin
Otherwise I need my own, lap dance song
I've only been in here for two hours
And all my dollar bills is gone, for a lap dance song
I need more than a minute wit'chu
Before I spend a minute with you, girl c'mon
Don't do me wrong, you know what's goin on
Yeaah! This is the long, lap dance song

[Interlude: T-Pain]
Ohhh yayyy~! it's 2-for-1 tonight! Yeah

[T-Pain]
Shawty came out from the main stage (stage)
To the floor (floor)
Then we went into the V.I.P. (P got it all)
Baby was so ready, hot and so heavy

Then the song was over (that's so wrong)
So I made a lonnnng lap dance song

[Hook]

[Interlude: T-Pain]
Yayyy~! it's 2-for-1 tonight!

Girl do you know we're near done (done)
There's still a ring here (ring here)
Girl you can't leave me (no) please believe me (no)
You gotta stay over here and keep gettin it on
'til the song is over
And I know that this is the long, lap dance song

[Hook]

[Interlude with minor ad libs]

[Verse 1]
I got a question I wanna ask my momma
But she's been gone for some years now
I need the answers, I want to ask my friends
But they're to cool to be honest
And she's gone take it the wrong way if I question her
It just might break her heart, man
I can't ask my girl

[Hook]
So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'mma ask Donny
And I'mma ask Stevie
And I'mma ask Prince
If I'm in love
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
Am I in love?

[Verse 2]
Who the hell knows who Purple Rain is?
And am I standing in it?
I sing along to every single word though
And I feel like I need them
'Cause for all I know
Rocket love flew past me yesterday
But I gotta know for sure

[Hook]
So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'mma ask Donny
And I'mma ask Stevie
And I'mma ask Prince
If I'm in love
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
Am I in love?

[Chorus]
Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

[Verse 1]
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be something missing

[Verse 2]
Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails

[Chorus]
So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking

[Verse 1]
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?

[Verse 2]
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me on to phantoms (Way out)
I follow to the edge (Way Out)
Of the earth (Way out)
And fall off
Yeah, everybody leaves (Way out)
If they get the chance (Way out)
And this (Way out)
Is my chance

[Bridge]
I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
Yeah, I...
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
And I...
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape

[Verse 1]
I'm the next act
Waiting in the wings
I'm an animal
Trapped in your hot car
I am all the days
That you choose to ignore

[Chorus]
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

[Verse 2]
I am a moth
Who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you
Because there are no others

[Chorus]
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

[Outro]
It's all wrong, it's all wrong, it's all wrong
It's all right,  it's all right,  it's all right
It's all wrong,  it's all right
It's all right,  it's all right

[Mary J. Blige + The Game]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh huh

[The Game]
I need a "Real Love", Mary, holla at me if you need a real thug
We could ride through Compton and see real Bloods
Real Crips and I'mma always hold you down, that's real shit
I'm the Los Angeles king and "You Remind Me" of Mary, the R&B queen
I got the "411", what's crackin'
What I owe you for helpin' me go four times Platinum
I add a kid to "My Life", he's almost two
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is thank you
For over ten years of the ghetto gospel
You've paved the way for young black women to prosper
How you paint pictures you deserve Grammys and Oscars
Congratulations for me, Aftermath, and the Doctor
So niggas go 'head and envy me
I'm Billboard's Top 10 featuring M.J.B

[Mary J. Blige]
When you learn stepped in this game
After "What's The 411?", things ain't been the same
And I can't complain
But with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain
But I'm so glad to be here
And my music's still sincere
Lets get back to the story
All of this pain and glory
And 94 was "My Life" and my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you and told you what I've been through

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Mary J]
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

And I came and "Shared My World"
But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Tryin to find my way
And I dropped a "Mary" album and people would say
That it's just not gonna work and my feelings they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love and I owe it all to them
Then I came with "No More Drama", I remember that week
It was when Aaliyah died, I couldn't hardly sleep
Thought about it every day
And it made me change my ways
I'm a real woman, now because of all of these days

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Mary J]
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

[Bridge]
"You Remind Me" of a "Real Love"
You don't have to worry ("Real Love")
"All Night Long" "I'm Goin' Down"
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-dahh
Do-do-do-do-do-dahh
"Reminisce" on the love we had
"You Are Everything" "Love Without A Limit"
What are you gonna do without "My Life, My Life, My Life, My Life"

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Mary J]
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

[Outro: Mary J. Blige] + (The Game)
Right now, I just wanna thank Dr. Dre
(Hate it or love it, Aftermath's on top!)
And The Game for pickin' such a hot record, I thank y'all
(Naw, baby, we thank you) Shout out to Cool & Dre
(COOL AND DRE!) For makin a track...THIS HOT! WHOO!

[Intro: Just Blaze]
And the prophecy read
That one day, like the phoenix arose from the ashes
That a boy will be born unto a family in the slums
This boy will go on to use the knowledge he gained
While fighting for survival in the streets
To become a great leader
And in time, that boy will grow to become...
KING!

[Interlude: T.I. & Just Blaze]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Time to ride, nigga
Just Blaze!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I welcome you to get acquainted with the youngest in charge
Respected from east to west like he was running the mob
Dictating, ain't taking orders from no one but God
I know you niggas is broke 'cause I know what you charge
You niggas wishing for a Phantom; it's one in my garage
It's black as legary, right next to the platinum Ferrari
You niggas ain't getting money off of rapping, I'm sorry
Fucked the rent up, went and spent up 60 large on a Harley
Is where you stay 10,000 square feet? Not hardly
Now, you see that we ain't able to compete, now, are we?
Ayy, pardon me—I'm giving you the West Side Story
Of the A, where I stay; niggas stay down for me
Wanna play? At your gate, niggas lay down for me
And get a order for killers to spray rounds for me (Ayy, ayy)
Competition, you ain't considered; you rapping, you boring me
You repping the A horribly—must I say? More importantly

[Hook: T.I.]
The king back! (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Nigga, the king back (Yeah, yeah, uh-yeah, yeah)
You better lean back (Ayy, ayy, ayy, why's that?)
Nigga the king back (Uh, aight, ayy, tell these niggas, what!)
The king back! (Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-ayy!)
Nigga, the king back (Ayy, ayy, ayy, OH!)
Shawty you seen that? (What happened, my nigga?)
Nigga, the king back (Aight, let's tell these niggas, ayy!)

[Interlude: T.I.]
Ayy, man y'all niggas got me way too fucked up, you understand that?
What you need to do is, homeboy—
You need to go back and grab I'm Serious, you know
You need to get familiar with Dope Boyz and see where all these niggas got they style right now
See where that trap shit came from
Then you need to graduate to motherfucking In the Streets, Volume 1 through 3
Then you need to go to Trap Muzik
I got locked up for a second
Then grab Urban Legend
And that'll bring you up to speed, nigga

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Who knew you could fit on your wrist a whole pound of diamonds?
I'm number one on the list while you clowns are climbing
Wishing to be in positions that you found that I'm in
Since you niggas do what I say, I'm world-renowned as "Simon"
If Jay handled the clay, and around the time
I deliver a bad day when four-fives is firing
I care the least about polices and the fireman's siren
Ambulances ain't gon' stand a chance at reviving (Hey)
DOA—that mean you be deceased upon 'em arriving
Paramedics yell, "Clear!" and your flatline silent
You ain't ready for out here 'cause the lifestyle violent
Think you is, you must be living on Fantasy Island
You make us mad, get your ass wiped out like Thailand
Hit for four like I went up and drained the three while you fouling
To say you want it with me's to go to war with the finest
Need you be reminded? Want it with Your Highness?

[Hook: T.I.]
The king back! (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Nigga, the king back (Yeah, yeah, uh-yeah, yeah)
You better lean back (Ayy, ayy, ayy, why's that?)
Nigga the king back (Uh, aight, ayy, tell these niggas, what!)
The king back! (Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-ayy!)
Nigga, the king back (Ayy, ayy, ayy, OH!)
Shawty you seen that? (What happened, my nigga?)
Nigga, the king back (Aight, let's tell these niggas, ayy!)

[Outro: T.I.]
Ayy, man, I know y'all niggas in the trap every day, still, man
I know y'all niggas don't see nothing but the projects, nothing but bricks
But listen, make no motherfucking mistake man
I still will suit up my motherfucking self, AK and 45, nigga, on side, nigga, and come see 'bout niggas, you understand?
But I don't wanna do that 'cause I respect that shit y'all doing
I started that shit
I made that shit cool
I made these niggas want to be you, nigga
Nigga, respect this shit!

[Swizz Beats]
The kings back

[T.I. Hook]
I got that get it get it

Got that guacamole holy moly you don't know me
See me clean as I wanna be, what these niggas wanna be
Shots so bright I can't see niggas standing right in front of me
These niggas don't want none of me, this rapping shit is fun to me
What I look like beefing wit you nigga you a son to me
Move weight out to Georgia get it cross the water
Rive that shit to New York coming all the way from Florida
Dope boy trap nigga that's what they call us
Summer time balla when I buy the mall up

[Hook 1 + 2]

[Verse 2]
Might have seen me getting gas at the Citgo and he sit the six low
Riding right beside a 45 and what its hitting fo
Shawty ain't bullshitin folk he'll be out be here hitting folks
Stick around and try to tell polices what he did it fo
Ain't nuttin he ain't did before other niggas getting so
Blurred wit the pussy and bet some even getting so
Long he ain't funny he got that long money
Naw money you niggas barely got hit the mall money
I'm the perfect example of how to hit the ground running
From the trap to busting up how the underground stunting
So you still see me down at the underground stunting
Ima Westside Bankhead nigga it ain't nothing

[Hook 1 + 2]

[Verse 3]
I was raised off Easy, 'Cube, Ice T, 8Ball, MJG, 'Face, Pimp C
Ima king just believe me, try me when you see me
And niggas start busting like they start busting pushups push a
Button shot calling niggas not balling
Just doing a lotta loud mouthing and not dogging
I got the shit locked from Atlanta to New Orleans
Virginia Mississippi Kentucky I run all dat
You niggas better fall back, boy grab a ball bat
Take it to ya skull, dats gone be the end of all dat
Insist on having problems, bet dis revolver will solve dat
Hit em in the temple then I leave em where they fall at

[Hook 1 + 2]

[Intro: Mary J. Blige & T.I.]
Don't forget, to remember me
(Let's get 'em, Mary)

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & T.I.]
Don't forget, to remember me (Ay, don't forget shawty)
I'll be back, so remember me (Remember this)
Please keep me in your heart, if we ever have to part
(Ay, don't forget shawty)
Don't forget, -get, to remember me

[Verse 1: T.I.]
(It's the King, homie)
Ay, the King, modern-day Martin Luther, Malcolm X, I'm
Officially the freshest, don't dare forget, I'm
Gone, momentarily, don't bury me yet
Like Ali got, I got the title back, prepare me to that
When the world needed Tip, ask where he was at
But when he need somethin back, nigga fade to black
Talk shit behind his back, you a hater for that
I don't expect nothin less, in the game of chess
You think five moves ahead and not behind
Niggas jumped up, cheered when I got my time
Like, "Yeah! One whole year I got the grind"
But get me losin off your mind shawty, may I remind you that
There ain't another nigga who done been through what I been through
Time after time again, you better get some in you
When you, said it was over for him and you thought
He couldn't continue to floss, here's to your memory loss, suckas!

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & T.I.]
Don't forget, to remember me
(Ay, don't forget shawty, ay, don't forget shawty)
I'll be back, so remember me (Yeah, yeah, remember this, shawty)
Please keep me in your heart, if we ever have to part
(Yeah! It won't be long, shawty)
Don't forget, -get, to remember me (Ay, don't forget shawty)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
They say, outta sight's out of mind
And nine times, out of ten, men out of pocket out of line
You do it big, errybody that you out-shined
Then your ol' lady fate talk 'bout how she got fine
She say she was tryin to get away, he say, "About time"
Right now we all thinkin "Damn, hopin not mine"
But when it's lights out for ya and you locked down
Ain't no tellin whether or not your lady went and got down
Wit the nigga cross town, cause he hot now
Rippin up your love letters, liftin up her night gown
Right now, somebody baby momma gettin piped down
Kids in the next room listenin, "Momma pipe down!"
The thought hurt, don't it? But maybe she's strong enough
Or, ain't get that lonely, cause you wasn't gone long enough
But trust, it's just a temporarily setback
It's on when I get back, please don't forget dat!

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & T.I.]
Don't forget, to remember me (So remember this, shawty)
I'll be back, so remember me (It's the King, bitch!)
Please keep me in your heart, if we ever have to part
(Ay, don't forget shawty)
Don't forget, -get, to remember me (Take it out, Mary)

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige & T.I.]
I don't mean to feel like this
Don't mean to think like this
My heart just has to be sure
That the love that I give to you
That's the love that I get from you
I need to be safe and secure, oooh-oooh
(Just let me know you thinking 'bout me)

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & T.I.]
Don't forget, to remember me
(Ay don't forget, shawty, ay, don't forget shawty)
I'll be back, so remember me (Keep me on your mind, shawty)
Please keep me in your heart, if we ever have to part (Okay!)
(Ay, don't forget shawty)
Don't forget to remember me

[Outro: T.I. & Mary J. Blige]
No, no, no- no, no, no
Ay! Just a friendly message for everybody, man
Who thought I was gone forever (Don't you forget)
Partna, it's a year and a day and countin, ya understand that? (About Me)
By the time you hear this, I'll prolly be halfway home
Now remember dat, suckas!

[Intro]
Westside nigga
Hey

[Hook x2: T.I.]
(BANKHEAD) I got my .44 and my dro
And my Chevy on twenty-fours, and my ho
Now where am I 'posed to go?

[Verse 1: T.I.]
See me riding in a Chevy, .44 on the seat
With a quarter O of blow, gettin' loaded wit C
No tag, no license, trunk loaded with D
Riding Fulton Indy, where we normally be
They pull us over, you think I'm stopping, you must be fucking with me
If they don't want to die tonight, they best stop fucking with me
I'mma pull over in bowen home my cousin and B
And they gon' hide me in they home while they looking for me

[Verse 2: Big Kuntry King]
Hey, we the neighborhood superstars
Couple Chevys, pulling hard
Thousand dollars worth of dimes in the trap with rockstars
We putting fear in cowards' hearts when they see us on the block
Swerving in the deuce and quarter, busting shots just because
The hell I care about getting caught, I'm making bail by twelve o'clock
Back in the spot with the same bomb-serving drops
I pull a ho in Bangkok, dropped her off at Tip's spot
I'm burning rubber, fuck the cops, another day on my block

[Hook x2: T.I.]

[Verse 3: Mac Boney]
I'm Cadillac daddy, pulled up on some hoes from old Natty
I said I'm Pimp Squad, ho, what's happening
Westside get them panties snapping
She asked me, can I do the Laffy Taffy?
I said I do the 'make the pussy happy'
Let's get a room over on Virginia
Step inside a suite and then continue
You're in for a little fender bender
Baby, just remember, make it quick
These niggas kind of know me, I'm the shit

[Verse 4: C-Rod]
I'm in a bubble kush Chevy, well at least that's what it smells like
Hit the gas, blue fire blowing out the tailpipe
Tailpipe, that's all these hoes wanna lick for the night
I treat 'em like Tina, beat that pussy and you call me Ike
That's right, monster ride sitting on the twenty-eights
It sound like a stadium, you would've thought the Braves played
The engine running like Vick, with the Falcons on the hood
Mr., Mr. Westside, yeah you know they in my hood

[Hook x2: T.I.]

[Verse 5: AK]
Ain't no telling where I'm going, 'less I'm stepping out
Sippin on the high life, windows up, in the clouds
Open up the console, that's where I got my gun
Right next to that, get that bag and roll another one
I got the vitamins, make a freak fuck all night
Hoes know, killers on the Westside earn stripes
Make that money turn bright, just look at my piece and my grill
Swerving off Church Street, the pimp God gave me skills

[Verse 6: Young Dro]
I was born up in Bankhead, y'all remember me
Way back in '83, T.I. stayed up the street from me
Just cause I'm from Bankhead, niggas having beef with me
Half never seen a G in a cap in my Beamer V
Ten screens falling, my Chevy watching Lean On Me
Riding down Simpson, 'bout to waste my purple lean on me
Purple linen clean on me, the whole zone three on me
Waffle House Charger, yellow-black, I got a bee on me

[Hook x2: T.I.]

[Sample: Eazy-E]
Back, front back, fron-front back, fron-fron-front back, side, side

[Intro: T.I. + Mannie Fresh]
Ladies and gentlemen!
T.I.P., aye!
Fre-fre-fre-fresh!
I know a lot of y'all niggas out there, man, who ain't up on this down south shit
Probably wondering what the fuck you listening to right now, ahah! (King amongst kings)
But it's an absolute honor and a pleasure, you know what I'm sayin'?
To bring you some gangsta shit of catastrophic proportions
Yeah!
All the UGK alumni, like myself, know what this is, man
Hey, Bun!
Pimp C, nigga!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I gotta '66 Impala so fresh, white top
Vert drop wit' the choppers on deck
Fuel exhaust, and a motor out a ninety-four 'Vette
Fish bowl, televisions pimpin I ain't done yet
I got the checker red leather and I'm sittin on chrome
On 26 inches just to get my roll on
One of Jeezy's songs on, make them bitches get low
I get that ass raised up, like Dr. Dre six four
Hey, come up in my hood, bet them bitches know Tip
If you tell 'em you wit' him, all them bitches gon strip
If I show up in yo' hood, I bet you niggas won't trip
Once I empty out this clip, I bet you niggas gon' dip
Or get hit up in yo'...

[Hook: Eazy-E + Pimp C]
Back, front back, fron-front back, fron-fron-front back, side, side
Back, front back, fron-front back, fron-fron-front back, side, side
Never let ho-ass niggas ride
Back, front back, fron-front back, fron-fron-front back, side, side
Back, front back, fron-front back, fron-fron-front back, side, side
And we never let ho-ass niggas ride

[Verse 2: Bun B]
It's the Gulf Way Boulevard gangsta
Swangin on T.I., S's and Fo's (S's and Fo's)
Pirellis and Blades and 'em crews of hoes
I'm a playa, you can tell by how I choose my pose
When it gets to swangin on the curb, you might lose ya toes
Dedicated to the slab (slab), the dunks (dunks), the drops (drops)
The candy painted cars wit' the chopped off tops (off tops)
Now put ya diamonds up against the wood wheel
Lean back up on ya leather, chunk a deuce, and show your grill
Keep it trill, this the south baby, Texas and GA
T.I. reppin for Bankhead, I'm reppin for P.A. (for P.A.)
Now pop ya trunk, get it crunk, it's time to ride
Show them boys you got that front back and side to side baby

[Hook: Eazy-E + Pimp C]
Back, front back, fron-front back, fron-fron-front back, side, side
Back, front back, fron-front back, fron-fron-front back, side, side
Never let ho-ass niggas ride
Back, front back, fron-front back, fron-fron-front back, side, side
Back, front back, fron-front back, fron-fron-front back, side, side
And we never let ho-ass niggas ride

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
I'm switchin lane to lane (uh), leanin on the switch (on the switch)
Sippin on the barre, smokin green and hittin licks (licks)
Bumpin Too $hort baby, in a candy red Biarritz (Biarritz)
Drop the top and pimp the lot and watch the trunk do tricks (do tricks)
Pimp C, I keep my money on my mind (mind)
Keep a hooker on the track and keep a swisher full of pine (pine)
If y'know like I know, you wouldn't try it (try it)
Wanna jack me for my candy car, you must wanna die (wanna die)
But I don't really wanna hit ya with this hot thang
I just wanna get some brain in the turnin lane
Comin down creepin slow, sippin on a potent fo'
Bangin on the Screw, and keep the pistol right here in the do' {*echoes*}

[Hook: Eazy-E + Pimp C]
Back, front back, fron-front back, fron-fron-front back, side, side
Back, front back, fron-front back, fron-fron-front back, side, side
Never let ho-ass niggas ride
Back, front back, fron-front back, fron-fron-front back, side, side
Back, front back, fron-front back, fron-fron-front back, side, side
And we never let ho-ass niggas ride

[Intro]
Ey, I know you done kicked it with a lot of niggas before
But you ain't never kicked it with a nigga like me
Hey Hey

[Hook]
I see ya baby, throw ya hands up high
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
Because the rocks gonna glisten and the drops on 20's
Bend it over let it drop if you wanna roll wit me
I say all my sexy ladies throw ya hands up high
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
Because it don't get betta, niggas don't get cheddar
Like that fella in the yellow Purple Label silk sweater

[Verse 1]
The stones keep glowin' on my wrist like whoa
And she can't stop lookin' I know ya bitch like those
And she chose, ain't no question if the bitch might blow
Just get her to the crib and get her whole back sore
I'mma blow my dro', I'mma pop my pill
Ask anybody wanna take a shot, I will
Might see me in a different color drop, Hot Wheel
With the top down low, and the Glock concealed
I got the Hayabusa racing up the block, one wheel
If the police try to chase me you know they a done deal
I got skills, anybody wanna come test
We'll send this .45 be up in yo chest
A lot of ladies wanna kick it with a nigga so fresh
Who could spend a 100k, any day, no stress
The watches is insane, the chains is grotesque
Stay single if you wanna but you gain no cash

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If you got a man and you're tired of being there
You done gave him too many chances, you're tired of being fair
I offer you the opportunity to ride with a playa
You, me, and a couple of freaks in the ride with a playa
Nevermind those outside, when they stare
Cause the chrome 24's on the ride give a glare
Because of one guy, you decided to share
As long as you having the time of your life, who cares
Man, we all sinners, what matters is in the center
I know God see the heart, and I'm a stand up nigga
You can't beat me cause you ain't man enough nigga
I look him in the eye and tell him man up nigga
You really getting money? Throw a grand up nigga
Wanna fight? You should've hit me when you ran up nigga
Let the Smith and Wesson hammer body slam fuck niggas
Go and kick it with the hoes and throw ya hands up with 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You ain't know me cause I live so special
Try to stay low key but it's still so special
Flat screens in the floor, quarter mil' in the dresser
Jewelry box glowing like I loan on treasure
I'm chillin' with Vanessa, met a girl named Heather
Told her "Hi, how ya doin'? Buy a drink? My pleasure"
Told her if she got a homegirl go tell her
That I got a hard rug, I could go for-ever
If Vanessa wanna touch it just let her
If she laughed out loud, I'll be shocked if we jus met her
Bought the dro', get low, and its only one-fifth
And it's four pills left, do you wanna come with?

[Hook]

[Hook: T.I. & Pharrell]
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I was born into poverty raised in the sewage
Streets will always would be a part of me, they made me the truest
And even when my days wasn't the bluest
I never ran from adversity, instead I ran to it
Fear ain't in the heart of me, I learned "just do it"
You get courage from your fears right after you go through it
Now I come through in a Coupe on 22's
That ain't bad for a nigga who ain't even finish school
Don't get me wrong I ain't never been a fool
I just put off graduating for a pair of tennis shoes
I used to use the beats to paint my pain
But nowadays man I can't complain
I got several automobiles and they all on them thangs
Several solitaires and they all in one chain
They used to see me in the mall, I'm the same
And gettin brains from a couple of broads on the plane

[Hook: T.I. & Pharrell]
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world

[Verse 2: Common]
I come from Chi-Town lost and found in the struggle
Where dudes say "stay safe" and "say out of trouble"
Speakers muffled, the law and BMs try to cuff you
Those with duffles move weight and have muscle
I dug through the dirt with a verse for the people
Open up for Daddy Kane and Eazy at the Regal
The radio rarely put their needle on my record
They ain't see how the hood and heaven were connected
Sales projected, ain't show how effective
Lessons learned, sessions turned to life reflected
And everything I found real in life, yo I kept it
They say life's a teacher, you're gonna get tested
When a nigga changed they kept saying "that nigga strange"
They couldn't see how my mind on bigger things
Ahead of my time now I caught up with the game
Making good music, making paper, making change
And it's good

[Hook: T.I. & Pharrell]
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I put gasoline drawers on, I stood in the fire
With enough heat to set the hood on fire
Man you niggas think Suge was off the wire
You should've seen the squad before I had Messiah
We assumed the title as the number one supplier
Felt like I was selling blow since I was in diapers
And we wished a nigga would come try us
We was cool with the killers, best friends with the lifers
Quick to up and scrap if a nigga wanna to deny
For what we considered then a lucrative empire
But like that pimping time flash by you
Now I wonder what the judge think as he reading my priors
'Cause prisons ain't full and the reaper ain't biased
Anybody telling ya different's a damn liar
Gave the jail hell and shot birds at the hearse
Lived through worse and reversed the curse

[Hook: T.I. & Pharrell]
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I keep telling myself "Man, I'm living the good life"
I'm living the good life
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world

[Intro]
Grand Hustle Pimp..
Hey, whats happenin shorty
Me being a true player and all
I mean you know as a stand up guy you know
I really hate to say I told you so
But, man I told you so
Back when we said we were goin to run this shit man
When we said Pimp Squad Click, Grand Hustle was the business
When we said their was a whole nother side of Atlanta
A whole nother bunch of motherfuckers in the trap, y'all didn't know

[Hook]
Man, I told you so
They thought a pimp wasn't s'posed to blow
Because I was rappin about moving o's and blow
Pimp I told you so
They thought that Outkast closed the door
And Ludacris came in and sold his 4?
Man, I told you so
The Mac, C-Rod, Kuntry and Dro
And AK had the coldest flow
Nigga, I told you so
I said the future was right up under your nose
You thought the south wouldn't explode no more
Remember, I told you so

[Verse 1]
Way back when Kriss-Kross was hollering "Jump" on ya tube
They was still gettin jumped at school, we used to tote them tools
Don't get me wrong I'll give respect to them dudes
But approach us wrong, and we'll smoke them fools, ain't no joke it's the truth
Fuck a hater, let 'em do what it do
I'm busy now, but I'll be through in a few
And then I'm coming for you
So keep shit talking like it's something to do
I'll spend a 100 grand get a killer something to do
I been hustlin since 92' when I heard UGK
Hollering "Pocket Full of Stones" I was on my way
Had a history in the yay, before I started to trap
At 13, let me take you back farther than that
When my uncles was baggin blocks, used to count the stacks
I was only 8, and my grand-daddy can vouch for that
And my pops had a lot of work, a lot of folk he got 'em work
And ran numbers, said if he ain't wanna, he ain't gotta work
Why I sold rocks, I guess I got from pops
My uncle's point man is saying "a chip off the old block"
The nigga you hear now the same one from off the old block
Who used to stand on Front St. and get off the old block

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I remember the P$C, Killer Mike, David Banner and me
And YoungBloodz ran through Atlanta with heat, when even Atlanta was sleep
Nigga, back before you heard of me
I was middle man into serving keys when KT was serving 3
I'm on top because I deserved to be
So simmer down, calm your nerves at least
Speak your words with peace
Before you lay out on the curb deceased
Think about it, it's absurd to beef
I took my songs to street
He told me dopeboy was the bomb in the street
Since then, my name rang like alarms in the street
Who knew how long it would be
If only LA knew how wrong he could be
I told you ain't nobody stronger than me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This southern rap shit of the day is something I helped design
Puerto Rico at the mix show I'll let you know who the next in line
The Snowman, Paul Wall, and Thugga, now say I was lyin'
Alot of other niggas shouldn't of even been signed
Thats a opinion of mine
Because these niggas be neglecting the grind
Ain't waiting on nobody to let me shine, I'mma go get me mine
And then they wonder why they checks behind
Cuz TIP was 20k? back in the day, need me to press rewind
What be on these niggas mind, man don't get me to lyin
I seen ya kind, dopeboy, and that ain't even ya kind
Ain't never even sold a gram of crack, and ain't no need of ya tryin
Back in the trap, pimp I don't see him survivin

[Hook]

[Intro]
Let's get it homeboy!

[Verse 1]
See me riding through Atlanta in a Phantom with the double door
Make these bitches wonder what he be in so much trouble for
I'm touching folk, anytime they tryin Grand Hustle folk
And busting folk, what the fuck they arguing fussin cussin for?
You lucky ho, a couple of years ago I'da probably cut your throat
But fuck it though, what I'm spending somethin on a nothin for?
This well-known flow, man I got this shit from Simpson Road
Adamsville, Bowen Homes, Center Hill to Zone 4
A drop top, flip flop, shine thats the chrome glow
TIP pop out the roof, ay what he up in Herndon Home for?
With long dough, shit he just doin what he known for
Blowin 'dro on twenty-fo', livin how the song go
Rubber burnin, turnin corners, beatin like a congo
You try to jack and pull the strap, it's ASAP, pronto
King of the South, every hood's head honcho
I'm Westside certified, go where the fuck I wanna go

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hey I done told y'all I'm a O.G., never had cold feet
You end up with no teeth, nigga "U Don't Know Me"
I'll knock ya off ya feet, put holes in ya 'til ya clothes leak
Toss this in the river like I threw away my old heat
You chose to oppose me? Who the fuck you 'posed to be?
Mechanicsville to Summerhill, the Zone 3 done roll wit me
No ho's in me, you know all the blow these folks done sold wit me?
I'm everything you 'posed to be, boy ain't no runnin over me
Kick it wit the +King+ and lemme show you what I mean man
Most these niggas rappin 'bout a block, ain't never seen nann
Real niggas recognize, real niggas and ye ain't nann
You don't know how to stab a nigga dead, keep a clean hand
Or sell a block for twenty-fo' you got for seventeen grand
From Eastside niggas in Kirkwood and Little Vietnam
These 26's keep the attention of bitches
Come and ride wit me pimpin, lemme show you how we get it

[Hook]

[Intro]
Hey, T.I.P. pimpin'
Hey, shorty, why you gotta act like that?
I'm sayin', I'm just tryin' to be nice to you

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Verse 1]
Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo' face
Now, I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing, that you need your space
Selling niggas one thing, you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between your knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you making, get your knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I got a mansion and a gate, you with me and you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck with 23's the case
600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word, we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad making you stay?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Verse 2]
Can he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this?
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest?
Take advantage of what you're concealing in your dress?
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?
Give you sex 'til you sweat, tongue kissing on your neck?
It's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with your panties so wet?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Interlude]
Ay, this nigga playing mind games, man
I think the time came that your mind changed, you understand?
Life is like a chess move
You need to make your next move your best move
Keep it pimpin', you understand? Hey
I mean, you know what I'm saying
I done showed you how I feel, you know what I'm saying
I put myself all the way out there, you know
The ball in your court, man
But I just got a question for you: Is you happy?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Intro]
Alright man, y'all win
I won't say it,...at least for this song, hey

[Verse 1]
Said they lookin for the realest, well I'm real as it get
Rap to the nigga dealin hard who livin in jets
Til some better nigga wit her, ain't delivered 'em yet
My mouth big but I got a pistol bigger than that
I live and die by my respect so I honor the code
Peep niggas who be out here flexin, stuntin for hoes
And if you ain't never chose to remember nothin before
Just know the game is some you win, it's somthing ya know
But if you already begin again, start, it go
Learn to shoot a pistol, flip a O or its hard to grow
Man if you ain't ever heard of Pimp Squad before
You better ask a real nigga or a broad who know
Cause you ain't ready for the pros, get it outta ya brain
You in over your head, way out of your lane
I'd be insane I'm filthy rich and got it from caine
So would you say them niggas know if they done got it the same, right?

[Hook]
Cause you know who, you know what
Of the you know where, goin against us, too unfair
Cause everywhere you do a show, we got kinfolk there
And now you know I ain't no more, not a tinfolk there
It's you know who, you know what
Of the you know where, beef now don't you go there
And if you do, don't use our copy producers, he won't care
If he leave the hood alone, pimpin he won't share man

[Verse 2]
I know you think you out there gettin it in
But whatcha doin, I don' done it once and did it again
I had a trap between runnin while living in sin
He done settled down, turnin nine millin or ten
I give a damn if I never sell a million again
I gotta thank you a million for just lettin me in
But now I'm settlin in, gettin used to the view
On top, won't stop til I'm huger than you
Don't flop? Who? Me, pimp you losin your screws
What kinda dope have you been lettin niggas shoot into you
No, you ain't ready for the shit I'm introducin to you
The roof in the back of the Bach ain't translucent as you
So now your nigga dressin up, man do what you do
I got style, pimp, it's more than just the suit and the shoe
This been proven, I'm the truth, stamp government seal
I'm what it is. These other niggas, just suckers with deals, for real

[Hook]

[Intro: T.I.]
Ay...
I know it been a minute since I had a lil' one-on-one witcha..
Heh, or should I say one-on-one-million?
But..I just gotta say man
Through the lil' period in my life, man
I really see how fucked up some of you suckas is, man..
Remember, I don't really need shit!
It's the thought that counts..

[Hook: Mitchellel]
On top of the world when I'm standin tall
But if I ever ever had to take a fall
Will you accept my collect call?
Will you accept my collect call?
Cause everybody loves you when you balllllin
But don't nobody want you when you falllllin, (I gotta know)
Will you accept my collect call? (I gotta know)
Will you accept my collect call?

[Over Hook: T.I.]
I think I'mma forget this shit homie
Huh? Hah
Don't holla at me in the club, nigga fuck you!
Real talk, nigga..Tell the truth, shawty..
Be f'real

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I was told way back in the day when I was trappin
Nevermind what niggas say, judge 'em all on they actions
It's hard to imagine when you travelin
Havin fun gettin paper catch a case and see how niggas act then
Out the cell, partna been five, he rattin on me
Got a little Benja' pension, now they turn they back on me (Did who?)
Shiiit, cause out of sight is out of mind
Better put your trust in God, homie man'll let you down err'ytime
(Real talk) And I'm speakin from experience, serious
Imagine my suprise hearin from the inside
Err'ybody talkin bout me like the nigga just died
"Tip gone twenty years at the least, bet five" ("Nigga f'real, nigga you can't get away wit dat shit!")
Man niggas just lie for suspicion of extension ("Dat nigga kept it")
Not to mention the rumors of me committin suicide ("He KILLED HISSELF??")
God will open your eyes and show you who really witcha
But keep it in the back of your mind when it's over how niggas did ya
(I won't forget..)

[Hook: Mitchellel]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I ain't never asked a nigga to do shit for me
I wouldn't do in return, but guess you live and you learn
Don't expect my well bein to be a nigga concern
Cause I know that ain't the way the world turn
Cause err'body love to see a nigga assed out
Rather see ya lose it all than to see you cash out
They gossip like bitches, I don't e'en ask how
Cause niggas ain't shit, I believe that now
And it even matter how much you do for people
They'll love to see ya beat down livin in the gutta - what a
Shame at the least in the game when you see
They want you locked up more than the police
The sucka can't wait to get a nigga off the street
They hate to see me sittin on butter soft seats ("Look at dat nigga!")
Dog peep, bet to you don't e'en make sense
But that mentality EXACTLY why you'll never be rich - hater!

[Hook: Mitchellel]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I remain a stand up guy no matter what I
Stood tall, chest out, head up high
Wit my back against the wall, layin it all on the line
Wit God on my side I perform e'rytime
(Must I remind you?) Similar to a miracle, just short of amazin
Survived shit that would've drove most niggas crazy
Rose to the occasion, whatever situation
Suprised haters and came out guns a-blazin
Theoretically speakin, but you rather be thinkin
I'll fold cause you would if you were me, I know
All I got is the family, friends come and go
And with that understandin, I put none befo'
My folk, y'know enough to do the same I hope
If not...Shit, ya ass'll find out
When you on top e'rybody wanna ball wit ya
But when ya not you wouldn't even know who to call, would ya?

[Hook: Mitchellel]

[Intro: T.I.]
Yeahhhhh (hey!)
Hahaha, hey, hey, ha (all right)
Aight Toomp, man
This what the folks been waiting on, I guess (that's right)
Let's give it to 'em, baby (hey!)
Grand Hustle, nigga
Aye, man
They been waitin on this shit since "What You Know," huh?
Yeahhhh, it's the King, bitch!
Aight, my nigga, the wait is over, nigga
Hey, hey!

[Verse: T.I.]
One for the money, two for the show dawg
Three for the niggas hatin on the low, y'all
Know a picture's worth a million words I'mma show y'all
Death before dishonor, family befo' all
Without the braids I'm the closest thing to O-Dog
Minus the testimony; say it ain't so homie
Hey! Shorty like that, don't he?
World hopped off my jock, I got 'em right back on it
Ohh! Step back, brush myself off
Picked bid'ness back up right where I left off
I could show my dough, that other guy just talk
Hey where I live just as big as yo' projects dawg
AY! Ha ha, better check my swagger
How I walk, how I talk, how I stack that cheddar
What I drive, how I dress, nigga let's just bet a
Hundred stacks on that, nigga I'm just, better
Hahahaha, somebody better tell 'em mayne
They swag owe my swag everythang
It's very plain to see you study me awful hard
To the point that my swag need a bodyguard
I think a Thank You card's in order, y'all oughta be
Havin y'all swag sendin mines an apology
A lot of little me's I see, got beef
But what's the possibilities? Stop seek, you not me
Hardly worth a hill of beans, step up to the guillotine
Get decapitated; don't see how half of you rappers made it
Say good-bye to the fame and fortune, c'est la vie
And what the game need with you nigga? They got me
I ride through the city, so clean, seat really low
Automo-bil-ey so, pretty but I'm illy though
No comparison, ain't a nigga mo', thorough than
This gangsta American flow, doper than heroin
King like Evelyn, Champagne mayne
So deranged and belligerent; right up there with Benjamin
Who? André 3K, B.I.G., Jay-Z, UGK
Scarface, Makaveli the great, Wayne, Common, Kanye and, Lupe
So fuck what you say, you welcome to ask who you may
Bet they say as of today I'm back on top like a toupee
Hey! All objections overruled, it's overdue
Both high, and sober too, I'm so high, up over you
Same guy you see in the streets is as fly as here in the booth
So don't be surprised when you meet me to see I'm really the truth
Ooh, so uncouth, nigga who want proof?
Must agree if shit I did can't no one undo
I stay on my, one-two, nigga who want to
Turn a brunch into a brawl, do what you gon' do
I'm why it's, hot as a bitch in here still, cool as a Frigidaire
This year I'm on a mission dear
Think that was somethin, listen here

[Intro]
I know you miss me, I know you miss me..

[Hook]
They say the city ain't the same and the nightlife died
Since T.I.'s inside, like the streets been quiet
Ay, I know you miss me, I know you miss me - I know, I know
The say the thugs ain't ballin and the dubs ain't fallin
Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay
Ay, I know you miss me, I know you miss me - I know, I know

[Verse One]
Yeah, y'know I do it for the city and err'body that's in it
The generals and lieutenants salute how I represent it
Since I've been sittin' a minute, know err'body be missin me
Walkin off in the club, gettin err'body attention
When I'm out, record was spinnin, they start it from the beginning
Get bottles of Cris' n' Remy and pass it out to the women
Pull out a stack of twenty, throw it up to the ceilin
Watch it fall to the flo', start throwin some mo'
Ask anybody you know, wherever party you go
With me in the V.I.P., know that shit was outta control
If I pull up in a Mercedes, or hoppin out of the Rouge
Continue hatin but hey, I'm the flyest guy that you know
Ay East Coast, West Coast, Midwest, South
I keep a fire marshal at the do' stressed out
Line stretched around the corner, shut the whole event down
Been a minute in the city since it really went down, ain't it?

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I'm gettin calls err'y evening, sayin the streets need me
I'm at it just as soon as I'm able pimpin believe me
Niggas talkin greasy but they don't wanna see me
They know where to find me, soon as they release me
Remember me and Jeezy, at least once a week we
Hit the strip club, show these niggas how to treat figures
Hey, one stack, two stacks, three stacks, fo'
Nigga, five stacks, gon' tell 'em bring ten mo'
And Lamborghinis' and Apollos', they see me they screamin holla
The robbers follow the ballers, so {?} in my products
Still ain't nobody hotter, I put that on my daughter
Long as I been sittin still, niggas still ain't caught up
Atlanta you know I run it, err'body astonished
'Ey gotta stay in their houses like err'ybody were punished
Tell 'em they can quit frontin and them suckas sit down
Let 'em know the king comin and he shut this shit down, homie

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And err'y time I take the city back
And wear my crown, nigga give me dat - dat, dat
Ay, I know you miss me, I know you miss me - I know, I know
I did my thang, stack my millis
Now it time for me to bring back my city, ay
Ay, I know you miss me, I know you miss me - I know, I know

[Hook]

[Intro: T.I.]
T.I., Drumma, Usher, baby!
Hey, hey (Yeah, man)
Hey what's happenin' e'erybody
I hope they get my good side (Hey, hey)
You know I gotta look good when I walk out the house
You know I know the camera's following
I know they taking pictures, right Drama
Ay man, you watch it I live it, you dig that?
Y'all sit back relax get some popcorn man
I'm gonna make it a good show, you dig that?
Are you not entertained?
This goin' make a hell of a movie huh! Hey!

[Hook: Usher]
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holla (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waitin' for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement

[Verse 1: T.I.]
The price of fame I think I paid, want my change I done gave
E'erything in my possession for my seconds on the stage
For my name up in lights and multi-million record sales
I done gave up my life, can't get a moment to myself
When alone I ask myself, is it worth it? I ain't perfect
Neither is anybody else, but I think my kids deserve
To be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions
When the lies and gossip's published I'm the topic of discussion
And I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it
And I'd do it all again that's the funny thing about it
I ain't playing, boy I'm 'bout it, will I change, boy I doubt it
I done been a lot of things, I ain't never been a coward
See the paparazzi crowded all around me now
Same niggas who was dissin' want a pound like I'm C now
Showered with support from my adoring fans
They hear T.I.'s arrested they're like here we go again

[Hook: Usher]
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holla (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waitin' for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement

[Verse 2: T.I.]
You've seen it all before, guys know how the story goes
It's like 2Pac never died, sit back, enjoy the show
You see the shit that scares you senseless, I done lived through it
Knew the risks and the consequences and I still do it
And then I'm so fresh, them niggas mildew it
Not just a actor by profession, pimp, I live movies
That's why they whisper when they see me, point and stare at me
Cause they just wanna live through me vicariously
Fashion weekend, Paris week, party like a rockstar
Get blown by a top model 'til she catch lockjaw
Got the dough you get a year, stashed in my sock drawer
Showed you the troubles and the struggles of an outlaw
Top dog would not fall, I am not y'all
Couple pages out the calendar and I'm out y'all
Kid listen, pay attention, you don't wanna be me
It's safer to watch it on T.V

[Hook: Usher]
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holla (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waitin' for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement

[Verse 3: Usher]
See I don't think it would even matter (to me)
Woking a nine to (five) would it be better, I mean be honest
Would you care to gossip about me, not likely
I guess that's just the way that it goes (the way that it goes)
(Cause I know) See I can be somewhere out keeping it cool
(And get told) Almost anything instead of the truth
Y'all know more than I do, it's breaking news to me too
Easy killer y'all know that ain't how I move (ooh)
He said and she said (what) I did what, with they (who)
No not me I said (not me) she gave me no head (ooh)
Won't get me again (hey) I pleaded the fifth (hey)
I know better than to ever talk during the film...
In' and flashing lights can blind your eyesight
To when you can't see what's wrong from right
Well shorty 'til you walk a mile in my shoes
And understand this is who I am

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Usher I completely concur
Life can be such a blur, obviously we prefer
Our privacy but instead we endure
Yes sir, don't expect nothin' less of me
Cause this goin' probably be this way until the death of me
But for the hustle and the lady on my arm now
Plus all my kids and my mom's I'm a calm down
And yo, we doin' just fine, and the time's just flyin'
Live one headline at a time

[Hook: Usher]
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holla (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waitin' for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement

[Intro]
Ay... say, pimp...
This to er'body stretched out behind the walls...
Countin' days on they calendar...
Flippin' pages month to month...
Ay, man, I'ont give a damn how other folks treat ya, man
I just wanna-- I wanna let ya know, pimp
Y'een missin' nothin', homeboy... real talk

[Hook]
I know the time seem long, just try and keep strong
Put on ya headphones and rewind this song
Remember you ain't missin' nothin', homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin', homes
Hey, just know the club on hold and the broads on pause
You get home, it's gon' be waitin' on y'all
So dawg, just know fa real you ain't missin' nothin', homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin', homes

[Verse 1]
On er'ythang
My uncle did a decade
Came home, hit the ground runnin' gettin' paid
Like he never did a day
Hit the streets niggas still in the same place they was
'Fore he went in the chain gang and doin' the same thing
Cuz the game go on, you only do two days in the joint
The day you get locked up and the day you go home
I know it feel like the world passin' you by
Like shit happenin' everyday out there that you'ont know 'bout
E'rytime you call home ya baby mama show out
And ya pat'nas don't even send you flicks from when they go out
But don't worry bout it or stress it cuz shawty, know what?
The time do itself, all you gotta do is show up
Keep layin' down, wakin' up and thankin' the Lord
And 'fo you know it they gon' open the doors, true story
Just prepare yourself for it, if you ain't got a plan
What you need with a second chance? Shit, you gon' blow it
Learn and visualize what you tryna do
And do the time, homeboy don't let the time do you
They say the time just flew in the streets
Hard to believe from in there but you'll see soon as you on the streets

[Hook]
I know the time seem long, just try and keep strong
Put on ya headphones and rewind this song
Remember you ain't missin' nothin', homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin', homes
Hey, just know the club on hold and the broads on pause
You get home, it's gon' be waitin' on y'all
So dawg, just know fa real you ain't missin' nothin', homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin', homes

[Verse 2]
Probably thinkin' easy for me to say from here in the booth
But they showed you, they'll put me in there with you
Right now locked down in the state of the feds, lay in the bed
Playin' this over and over as you say in ya head
"Yeah... next time I'mma be straight
Just count down to my release date..." piece of cake
My nigga Cap right now servin' a life sentence
For a murder he committed in his self-defense
And in such good spirits shawty ain't even trippin'
And I could be right in there with him, no bullshittin'
He on his ninth year now just waitin' to get out
Got me thinkin' my shit ain't even worth complainin' about
Cuz it can still be worse fa sho
So you waitin' on me to lose hope you got to kill me first
I talked to my nigga Big Meech
Had to tell him the streets miss him just as much as he miss the streets
Had to let him know whenever he released
We hittin' the club like '03, this time it's on me
Yeah we laugh, reminisce for a minute and then
I tell him just know ain't nobody ever did it as big
It'll never be the same in this city again
Closest you'll get is me and Jeezy and them
So dawg, if it seem like you left behind, ten steps behind
Just know it only get better with time, fa real

[Hook]
I know the time seem long, just try and keep strong
Put on ya headphones and rewind this song
Remember you ain't missin' nothin', homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin', homes
Hey, just know the club on hold and the broads on pause
You get home, it's gon' be waitin' on y'all
So dawg, just know fa real you ain't missin' nothin', homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin', homes

[Ad-libs to fade]

[Verse One: T.I.]
When I think about all my time and all my struggle
Through all my grinding and all my troubles
Man I came up from nothing, all I had was a hustle
With a blindfold trying to find pieces to the puzzle no muzzle
I tell it like it is, that's that
Right or wrong I'mma call it like I see it don't forget
That impossible is nothing your environments irrelavant
Just don't let your emotions overpower your intelligence
Refuse to give up, your mistakes don't define you
They don't dictate where your headed they remind you
The Time keep ticking let your mind keep clicking
Never stop thinking be aware of your positions
Be aware of the collisions and the potholes sitting
On the road that you travel on your life long mission
Just listen every day is like a snapshot taken
If you live you can learn to be patient

[Hook: John Legend]
Cuz life is like a slideshow
All the places that I go
And I the things that I know
Through all the highs and low
Cuz life is like a slideshow
All things that I've seen
And all the things that I've dreamed
You can't take away from me
Cuz life is like a slideshow

[Verse Two: T.I.]
As I look back at a fly young cat
Who could rap with a dream look where I took that
Beginning on Bankhead then it spread out
Vision in my head all I had to was get it out
When I walked out of my house and looked at my street
All I seen was opportunity that led me to truency
I ain't really have a role model to infleunce me
Uncle Quinn in prison they say next it's going be you in it
As I juvenile caught cases so fluently
Look at my life and learn from it don't do it
If I only knew back then what I know now
How much better life would of been if I'da slowed down
Maybe I'da been Kanye instead of seeing Gunplay
But God got a plan, I'll understand one day
But one day of life, like a snapshot taken
Just believe you can make it have faith be patient

[Hook: John Legend]
Cuz life is like a slideshow
All the places that I go
And I the things that I know
Through all the highs and low
Cuz life is like a slideshow
All things that I've seen
And all the things that I've dreamed
You can't take away from me
Cuz life is like a slideshow

[Bridge: John Legend]
Ohhhh, ohhh, ohhhhhh~!
Looking back on my lifetime
See the slides go by, sometimes I wonder why
Looking back on where I've been
I remember when
Do you remember then

[Hook: John Legend]
Cuz life is like a slideshow
All the places that I go
And I the things that I know
Through all the highs and low
Cuz life is like a slideshow
All things that I've seen
And all the things that I've dreamed
You can't take away from me
Cuz life is like a slideshow

[Verse 1]
Chinchilla to the floor, Cigarillo full of dro
White Benz double doors, I could change colors though
Blue Ferrari, red Bent, black truck on 24's
Several Cheverolet's on 20 inches maybe more
Used to wish for better days, now I'm wishin' never more
I could go buy anything, stick my dick in every hoe
Grand Hustle on everything, P$C in every store
Sellin everything from rubberbands to leather coats
Swear to God I never change, jealous niggas never know
T.I.P. ain't never been a lame, jigalow since '84
Blessed with astonishing ability to pull a hoe
Fuck her so, good make her think this dick was full of Moe
Pussy so, good but I love it when she suck it slow (OH)
Her motto you don't swallow what you suckin' for (OH)
My motto you ain't ballin' what you hustle for
The VVS's let off such a glow to let these bustas know

[Chorus]
Hey! Hey!  Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce let me see you bounce like this
Hey! Hey!  Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce tell that bitch to bounce like this
Hey! Hey!  Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce all my nigga bounce like this
Hey! Hey!  Hey shawty bounce like this just, bend it over and make it bounce like this

[Verse 2]
I give you 30 seconds show me what you got could you
Bend it over for me drop it like its hot could you
Wiggle your titties a little lift your top get you to
Bust it open show your panties and your ass for me
Actually I was thinking you, Kim, and Daphine
In the back with me, lickin' on the bottom half of me
Answer me first know that sayin no is blaspheme
Me I'm pussy pumper number one you can ask for me
I knew how you danced for me that you had plans for me
Save the conversation get your partner out them pants for me
Damn honey, you'd be a fool if you ran from me
You ain't fuckin wit another dummy I'm the man honey
Im tryin' to give it to you 'till it make you stand funny (OH)
Throw that pussy right and maybe you can get a grand from me (OH) (HA!!)
Picture pimpin givin' you some damn money
Not a one thin dime but your ass is fine

[Chorus]

[hook]
Now shawty bounce with me bounce with me, let me see you see you bounce with me bounce with me
Now shawty bounce with me bounce with me, let me see you let me bounce with me bounce with me

[Verse 3]
Hey shawty stall if you want to I ball when I want to
Could fall through and shut down the mall if I want to
I could make your girlfriend choose but I want you
Why you bother me with what you will and you won't do
Listen shawty I'm a grown man and you grown too
You can leave with me I ain't gotta telephone you
All I'm thinking 'bout is me layin on you
Or vice versa with a lot of ass to hold on to
I got somethin' for that ass to bounce onto
You missin the chance of a lifetime why don't you
Hop off in the droptop, ride through the city lights
Take you where I kick it let you see what pimpin living like
Pop one of these then we'll see what you feeling like
Takin off your clothes wanna know what its drilling like
Presidential suite at the very end of the night
Treat you like a freak and give you what was missing in your life

[Chorus]

[hook]

[Talking]

All my niggas, where ya stay?
Westside to Decatur, ah hey-ya, fuck ya wooden eight

House with no father, school - why bother?
That's why I call myself the King of the South
Well nigga, ah you don't want what I'm break out the house
Ah so I, strongly suggest you keep my name out ya mouth
Before I, be in ya house tapin ya spouse to the couch
And put a, hole in her blouse, I don't play young nigga

[Outro: Lil Jon]
YEEAH!!

If it's too hot for yo' ass (uh-huh)
Get the fuck out the motherfuckin kitchen
Knamtalkinbout (getcha ass out)
The boy Lil' Jon, doin this shit with my nigga T.I.!
Ghet-O-Vision, Youngbloodz (Ghet-O-Vison ho!)
That boy Pastor Troy (old Troy)
It's serious mayne (serious)
This shit motherfuckin serious.. (it serious bitch)
In the south niggas, they get motherfuckin serious (real serious)
We out this bitch... holla...
(T.I. talking)
Bet yall niggas don't remember these wit Run-DMC...
Naw, I ain't wit dem no mo...What they is now...MY AIR FORCES

[Verse One]
Walk through the hood at night
I dont like 'em laced tight, but they feel alright
Outta sight, all white, steeping swaging my strap
I got the four in my lap cause I stay in the trap
Like guess and heavy starch thrity-four in the way
With thrirty six so I can fit this forty-four on my waste
If I waste something one 'em I'ma throw 'em away
Pull a fresh pair out the trunk, and buy some more in a day
And I wear'em like I bought 'em, I don't lace 'em or nuthin'
Got bitches wonderin' why I don't call, I don't chase 'em or nuthin'
Funky fresh MC, I bet you see
T.I.P with a fresh new pair of Nike Airs on his feet
And when you see me in the streets, you know you looked at a star
The way the Congo and Polo the checks is even matching my car
Ahhhh, back to the subject though
I just letting you know about my air forces

[Chorus]
Don't care how many shoes I get, when all else fails dem the shoes I pick
And I walk like so I don't bruise my kicks
I got alot but none fit like my Air Forces
Brand new O-Eyed Benz
Where in less there ain't a pair in every store I been
Gotta outfit, wanna make sure I'm fresh
Well you know I gotta go get my Air Forces

[Verse Two]
All white trimmed in gray
Bubbled laced to the top on with me
All day, collecting pay in the ass of a jay
Or any sucka nigga trying to get in my way
Stay kicking this muthafucking G.A. clay
With a limp and a sway and I don't play
Hoes keep asking pimp why the the same 'ol shoes?
Bitch, I'm four pairs deep and I done paid my do's
(My Air Forces)
Call number one like me
Hanging out the Chevy door when I stomp on the street
Concaine white leather feel good one my feet
Heyyyy, they ganranteed to keep you from the police
With bold they ain't scuffed
The strap holding me up
My shoulder boy-cut
Who need platuim wwith super Dave, when dem boys be stuntin'
Nigga I'm just ballin' it up in my Air Forces

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Stepping in my Air Force Ones, hat to the right plus I got my gun
Headed to the weed house to cop me a sack
Bumped into this bitch I knew from way back
Now I'm smoking good kicked back and I'm ridin'
Police pull me over and I had to jump up out it
Bail to the spot, had to shake these damn polls
Forces fucked up and I done lost my dro
All white and gray with dem bubble shoe laces
Even got dem blue ones for the special occasion
ATL fitted with the guess get a map
Pussy ass twidded em put a hole in my lap
Now I gotta situation at hand
Guess I gotta take it back to the old plan
Forces get my payment trying to catch a ride
Thats why I stay down wit my Air Forces

[Chorus]
(Hook, Akon)
When they tell you that you'll never get over
Just tell them you're number one
You're a champion
Don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over
Just tell them you're number one
You're a champion

(Verse 1, T.I.)
See the web site's lyin
Tryin'a block my shine
Don't you know you never gonna stop my grind
In a drop top flyin like I don't got time
Got everybody surprised that I won't drop dimes
What's on yo mind? Keep me off it
At least quit lyin if you must keep talkin
Gone with the nine, see I just keep walkin
Before I have you suin' sendin lawyers to the office
A lot of y'all, that's why I don't like that shawty
A couple months off, I'll be right back shawty
With a brand new swag, and a brand new 40
And a brand new ride, give a damn who saw it
Nation wide move, nigga, yeah you saw it
Shawty need a body gaurd for his body guard, don't he?
Tip fallin off, sound kinda hard don't it?
Y'all hate to see me ball
Take it up with God, homie
(Hook, Akon)
I can see it in your eyes
It ain't hard to tell
They watchin you
They just tellin you lies
They want you to fail
They plottin on you
Soooooo
Don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over
Just tell them you're number one
You're a champion
You know the streets been fiendin for anotha on of them jackin fa beats ya know
So dig mane go on and crank this shit up this year. Lets do it

(verse)
Aye!
Keep my name out ya mouth I done said it before
Cause all them games I ain't bout, tell whoeva you know
Before I pull this thang out, aim it dead at ya throat
Or bring the rifle out the house and put ya head in the scope
Pimpin trained for the drama shawty ready to go
See me hangin out the Hummer spittin 70 mo'
You was talkin bout the drought, I was peddlin snow
And I doubt you get some blow fa cheap as I'm sellin it fo'
Aye I'm a G, what I'm worried bout a felony fo'
When I get free bet I be ballin hard as eva before
Got some Chevy's but a Benz what I'm usually in
And niggas hatin on the crew I put a few in the wind
Keep it pimpin till the end while you chose to pretend
Shot a video in the pen and I'll do it again
Made news nation wide from 11 to 10
Headline CNN Peter Jennings and friends nigga
I'm so cool been doin this since the old school
You turned into a gangsta when ya vocals hit the Pro Tools
Haha Looka here man..
So don't get it confused you don't know that dude
I'm hard core no gold teeth no tattoos
If you don't want no beef nigga don't act rude
I got a 4-4 fo' yo attitude
We can... Talk or shoot it out whateva you chose
Have me back in the county blues on the TV news
Only... two rules when you walk in my shoes
1 take no shit number 2 don't lose
Im throwed off plum fool nigga loosen my screws
I'mma pass my partner the tool leave you wet as a pool
Lames get it misconstrued Gs you don't fool
I know... bustin a grape is somethin you don't do
Supa cool nothin to prove I been bustin the Reugers
And givin you bustaz the blues since you was suckaz in school
Hey this a situation you gon wish you neva persued
You wanna push me, pussy nigga do what you do
You think trappin just in my flows nigga oh contrare
Been sellin blow since I was 12 years old my dear
Bustin Calicos just to let 'em know I'm hear
Choppaz in the trunk of every auto I steer
While you was in the classroom tryin to pick a career
I was sellin glass countin cash drankin a beer
I agree this rap beef shit is so last year
But ask if I'll tear a new hole in yo ass. Yeah
Fa flexin and disrespectin I don't play about dat
But no mo questions I got shit else to say about dat
But my sentence'll be finished any day and I'm back nigga
Laughin at ya sucka ass Hollywood rap niggas
Fakin and they love it but this ain't fa the public
So in interviews I choose to stay away from the subject
I just prove that I'm the truth if you don't like it then fuck it
We can keep it between me and you and this pistol I'm bustin
Yeeah!
Pussy niggas ain't fuckin wit me
Cause pistol play in broad day that shit ain't nothin to me
You need to pinch yaself nigga cause you livin a dream
And I'm one of the realest niggas that this industry seen
Think of me as John Gotti wit a Phd
Or either Martin Luther King wit a G.A.T
I'm ridin clean, paint gleamin blowin T.H.C
And for that reason hataz wanna alieviate me
But I forgive 'em cause I know it ain't the he hate me
He just hate the situation hate that he ain't me
OGs say alot of them in me they see
Cause I'm a scholar no diploma no GED
Now TIP ain't sweet just so y'all know
Had to tone it down for ya cause I know y'all slow
Niggas tongue wrestle plenty yeah but they all show
Spread gossip like hoes bout what they don't know
Got mo lies to tell than a nigga in jail
All my niggas in the streets I know remember me well
From how I use to take a key and put the wieght on the scale
Now I'm seein how many mill's one record can sell nigga
You was on the low discussin a G
When urban legend drop we'll see what the discussion'll be

[Verse 1]
I done been locked up wit the worsest of niggas
Armed robbin con men and murderous niggas
The dope boys be the first to deliver
Green, brown, or blow, got mo snow than Buffalo in the winter
Think these lyrics is comin from a pretender
If I said it I done seen it or done it
So I mean it when I say you don't want it
Done came a long way from jumpin the hunnids (hundreds)
To baggin them quarters, doin shows from L.A. to Flawda (Florida)
In Atlanta, I'm the law and the order, the king of it
Got a throne and a brougham and a (?) that's chrome
Callin houses on the water my home, wit no mortgage or loan
If I live in it I bought it and own it
If I'm wit a bitch I caught her and boned it
No question, no less than a week and she's in confession
And I bought no necklace unless I'm investin
No exceptions, I'll open ya closed session

[Hook] X2
You ain't hard til you cookin like this
You ain't mob til you fucked wit the click
Or you flippin them bricks
We make music for the broke and the rich
For the hoop and the 6
For the hustlas went from nothin to (?)
We hustle from 6 to 6 to 6 again
Sell fat nicks for 10 til the bricks get in
Venturin from ATL to Michigan
The talk of yo town, y'ain't even worth mentionin
Peppermint try'na get another shipment in
And Sam Goody just hit us on the hip again
Got hot shit under our fits that'll pierce ya skin
And the click I'm in some made men, know dat
Got a deal now, but I was the shit befo dat
Totin steel now, but hold my own wit no gat
T.I.P. the answer to the question "Where them hoes at?"
The heat is catchin up to niggas runnin 4 flat
At the club gettin crunker than crackers on Prozac
Say you got some dubs on the Lac? Well shawty where the vogues at?
T.I.P. ain't the shit? come on shawty, don't act
I'm the hottest thing ever flowed over 24 tracks

[Hook] X2

Some niggas wonder how I made it, I do what it takes
At school I was cool wit the nigga who threw a 22 in ya face
Took ya starter coat and choked ya til you blue in the face
Or you might know me as the nigga who fucked ya bitch and bust 2 in her face
Either way, I'm a winner like the 4 and the trey
You probably never held mo dough than I can blow in a day
Sometimes I'm wearin gold, sometimes I'm ridin on it
Between us, I doubled up off my signin bonus
K.P. and Jay say "Shawty, ay you goin legit"
But I ignored the shit, when I scored a brick
I bet you never knew how quick 36 O's'll flip
Yeah I cook it til it bubble up, see how quick it double up
Competition's in trouble I'm supplyin the hood
Born, bred, when I'm dead, I'mma die in the hood
Niggas be tryin the hood, I open fire in the hood
Shut 'em up, wet 'em up, and let 'em lie in the hood

[Hook] X2

[Verse 1]
Pay for niggas to show fame to me
You mean I could just hit the club and everythang for free?
Me and all the ally niggas that I brang with me?
If a nigga from Bankhead and Buckhead, he probably came with me
No frisk, mo cris, we can drank for free
T.I.P. drunk, smoke, dank ya piece
T.I.P. a rich nigga now, I came in peace
So if a bitch nigga gettin’ knocked out, don’t be blamin’ me
But if we buckin’ at the door, goin’ up on the floor
In the bathroom, frontin’ tryna fuck us a ho
No hen, no mo’, you proly know
Spit that ??? bars of gold, so

[Bridge]
On Sunday, do your thing
On Monday, back to work
On Tuesday, stay at home

On Friday, go get fresh
But Saturday is

[Hook]

And bought twelve bars for XO
‘Til there wasn’t no mo’

[Verse 2]
Yeah, the bouncers’ll touch us
‘What these ghetto niggas doin’ in here with L.A. and Usher?’
Yeah, what of it?  Know you seen us in public
Guaranteed to show up in somethin’ is changin’ the subject
Hit the door, they like, ‘So what you baby daddy sister cousin
Said about?’  Hold up - who done just showed up?
Can’t get to the liquor, they got the bar sewed up
Drove, rolled up - that got the code up
Hey, put your money up - this round are on us
Say, we don’t want no glasses, just bottles of brown stuff
I got bitches shakin’ asses, models around us
Got 30, 40, 50 bottles krissies round us

[Bridge]
On Sunday, do your thing
On Monday, back to work
On Tuesday, stay at home
??? do the dirt
On Wednesday, go get paid
On Thursday, cash a check

[Intro - T.I.]
Is that T.I. over there? is that him?
Is that you? Rubber Band Man
Boyyyyyy..... is that T.I.? Whoooo..
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Remix pimp, yeah, y'all already know what it is man
T.I.P, came from the south, Rubber Band man boyyyyy...
Connected with my folk from the West Mack 9
My folk from the Chi' Twista
And T Double D, from the bottom

[Hook - T.I.]
Rubber Band man, wild as the Taliban
Nine in my right, forty-five in my other hand
I'm in trouble man, always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand
Chevy's all colors man, who I'm isss...?

[Verse One - T.I.]
I'm young pimpin', way out of ya vision
Don't set your sights on my position, I'm way out ya division
I was grindin' while you was tryin' to figure out your division
I'm sittin' on the block and watchin' hustlas makin' a killin'
Until I, jumped in the game without my uncle's permission
Against all of my family's wishes through whatever conditions
I'm workin' trappin' servin' kitchens with intentions of gettin'
My mittens on a couple million workin' off of comission
Everyday I'm on a mission where heavy yay is, so listen
I buy it, flip it, weigh it, ship it, 'til you cook it and sniff it
When I talk, G's listen, they can see I been livin' the same, life that I'm spittin'
I ain't frontin' and trippin'
I came, out of the trap I ain't just come here to visit
I named the album Trap Muzik cause I'm being specific ya lames
To my niggas still investin' in caine
I'm wearin' rubber bands just out of respect for the game

[Verse Two - Mack 10] (T.I.)
(Who I'm isss...) Mack the dope mayn
Who bang is the game and we got that wicked heroine you jam in your vein
It's simple and plain, my cocaine off the chain
My ballin' fastbreak, you got that half-court game
Y'all just be talkin' and ramblin', ain't really grindin' and gamblin'
But in my hood, the kids is all black like Grambling
And they stay scramblin', hustle hard on the boulevard
Rob ya, leave ya scarred, and pull ya whole card
I got that wizerk, dawg I got them birdies that don't chizerp
Water, X pills, sticky green and the purple sizzurp
And no matter where I'm at, it's west coast up front
I'm low key, I can't stunt and move a hundred bricks a month
In the east they like my swagger, them broads be up on me
In the south they love me, cause I'm down and dirty homie
And if you get it how you live as a gangsta then stand up
Mack10 a 'D boy', so my cash is rubberbanned up

[Verse Three - Trick Daddy] (T.I.)
(Who I'm isss...) I represent for the Tre-o-five
Down with the rubberband man, y'all call him young T.I
See I been an O.G., far from O.D. and this is
T double D don't even call me Maurice, now listen
My description is tall, dark, skinny, and ill-mannered
A hood negro with a little bit of Spanish, be like
Say yo papi, I got, yayo papi if your price is right come on down and y'all copy
Watch me, I'm gettin' money like it's 1984
Got so much cash Bill Gates could kiss my ass (yeah)
I'm such a player they call me Juan Pierre
Been ballin' since my younger years like ya boy Cabrera
I ain't no sentimental nigga, I'm sittin' on spinners nigga
And when I'm, draggin' my denim don't you bustas try to get 'em mmm..
I'm from the parts where the stars like them 

[??] stars
Quality sound beatin' down each and every car

[Verse Four - Twista] (T.I.)
(Who I'm isss...)I'm a windy city man, the one that take a cigarillo to the brain
Love to get it crunk in the south where my cousins from, and shawty shake that thang
Take a hipno' to the dome, smokin when I'm rollin, wood on chrome
Bump if it ain't Kamikaze or Trap Muzik then I dont put it on
When I'm on the porch I'm a Pac-Man, yell out that I got that dro', watchin for the po'
You can get the jab for one hunnid but I'm givin out the ounces for fo', let a nigga kno'
Call me the rain mane from the place where they gang bang
Where them thangs hang, and the brains hang, where we gotta main-tain
Can I cut and hit it girl, come on let me get it get it girl
I love the girls from New Orleans, to ATL, to St. Louis, and the "Windy City" girls
Blow fire man, when that ho slide on the pole like a fireman
Smoke dro so fire, when you throw it at the wall it stick like Spider-Man
Cause you messin with the 'icky, hit the tip up in the alley for the fifty
Steady bumpin' in the club sippin Moet and Crissy, come on y'all kick it with me
"Why?" cause it ain't no thang man, Twista gone chop that change mane
Cause I'm number one on Billboard with a bullet but I ain't gone change mane

[Hook - Twista]
I'm the Slow Jam man, rollin' wit' the rubber band man
There's some niggas in my right
With a .357 off in my other hand
(Who I'm isss..) Call me Trouble Man, always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand
Chevy's all colors man, who I'm isss..?

[Verse 1]
You looking good in them guess's shawty showing yo ass
Make a nigga wanna grab a hold of yo ass
Strip you out yo couchie dress and hit the flo' wit yo ass
When I leave the club I wanna see some more of yo ass
I ain't tricking shit but I might spend some dough on yo ass
The way you bouncin on my dick and grindin' slow wit yo ass
Hit the v.i.p. wit me I po' some moe' fo yo ass
Just so I can see you out there bouncin yo ass
If I leave the club wit something rather go wit yo ass
Them other broads fine but you a pro wit yo ass
When I see u poppin and droppin I know it's yo ass
In a crowd full of hoes I would notice yo ass

[Bridge: T.I.]
A now a thug done chose
And I don't give a damn if the club done closed
Give the DJ a dub tell him spin one mo
So I can finish watching you poppin yo
Shakin yo, droppin yo, bouncin yo ass

[Hook: T.I. & Females]
(T) Now all my guls say
(F) Do it baby stick it baby
(T) Yeeeah, bounce ya ass and holla
(F) Do it baby stick it baby
(T) Alright, a in the club say
(F) Do it baby stick it baby
(T) Okay, so if ya wit it holla
(F) Do it baby stick it baby
(repeat)

[Verse 2]
I see ya every Friday night outside the club in da line wit ya partners
Shawty you see all that ass poking out them Dolce and Gabbana's
Hey as soon as she get in I'm a find her ass
The first record the DJ spend I'm behind her ass
I don't care if I got some henn' I'm putting down my glass
Just so I can get out there and grind her ass
Wit yo fine ass, must I remind yo ass?
You da baddest thing in here that's why I'm eyeing yo ass
In ya Iceberg suit, ya face looking cute and I like those boots
Ya nails all pretty and ya hairdo too
I'm fucking wit you, shit just choose and we'll be fucking by two

[Bridge: 1x]

[Hook: 1x]

[Verse 3]
I made this song to let you know shit that I see ya when you workin dat ass
Make a nigga think later on he gone be twerkin' that ass
And I can tell by the way you throw it back it ain't no hurting dat ass
And ain't no room for nothing else in that skirt but that ass
The jiggling shawty, got a nigga shivering shawty
And if you don't know what to do wit you better give it here shawty
Put a bend in her back, I'm throwing the dick she giving it back
I tell her if you ever give me dat ass I ain't giving it back
She bouncing her ass, later on I'm a blow a ounce wit her ass
Ride out wit her ass, cut sumethin' on the couch wit her ass
Then bounce to her pad, coz you know it ain't no housing her ass
Coz since the first time I seen her, all I been thinking bout is her ass

[Bridge: 1x]

[Hook: 1x]

Do it baby stick it baby (8x then end)

[T.I. - talking]
What? (Nigga, what)
I'm the King of the Motherfuckin south. (Huh, what? I'm T.I.P nigga)
Picture that, nigga (Try me then nigga. King of the South)

Nigga, I been bustin'. You don't like it. Outbust me then, nigga
Nigga, I can fight nigga. I can say what the fuck I wanna say, nigga. (PSC)
King of the got damn south. Bust me then, nigga

[Verse 1]
Might see T.I.P in one of them drop things
Way down the block, man
Swervin in and out of lanes, gettin some hot brain
I'm tellin ya, I'm hot man
From here to Scott Lane
You know the day I drop, man
Shawty, I'm not playin
Now hold up, st-stop dammit
Shawty, you're not jammin'
If you hear one more, got dammit
I-I-I can't stand it
I'm taking over spots to damage that B.I.G and Pac image you got
Stop dick ridin, your shit's tired
I doubt if even your bitch buy it for six dimes
I can't see how niggas who not spittin ask why they not winnin'
Or why their record not spinnin, why niggas not feelin it
Cause that shit is not real, and we know you're not ah killin shit

[Hook 2X]
Crown damn royalty
Shawty, I must be
Whoever wanna shut me, uh-up
Just outbust me
Until then I'm king of it, don't act like you ain't know it
You wanna be supreme, of it, go get 16 for it

[Verse 2]
I been spittin since way back like the seats in the Lac, nigga
Since the days of 97 sacks in the back of the trap, nigga
I ain't a rap nigga, I just happen to rap
With a gift
I ain't gotta act and still I'm hotta than that nigga
I think all of ya wack niggas should give your plaques
To the real killas and crack dealers for writing your script
Get a grip, you need your ass whipped, for tryin to be famous
Everybody know my flow is chainless and that's how I remain
It's T-I-P, K-I-N-G, O-F-D-A-S-O, ah U-T-H
Labeled as one of the greatest when it comes to the flow
Give a damn what you think
Cause if the legends of the south ain't complainin
Like Outkast and Goodie Mob
What the hell and the fuck do I care what you sayin
I'm T.I.P

[Hook 2X]

What, what, what
Yal still ain't heard
Pussy nigga, yal still ain't heard
T.I.P., King of the South, shut your motherfuckin mouth
Or come see bout me, homie

[Verse 3]
Well, whether you can't live with it
Or you just can't love it
One thing that you can't say
Is shawty it ain't bustin
I was the King of the South before my single was out
I gave you everything from the hoes to the dope game
Now hold up, wa-uh-wait shawty, wanna buy at 8 shorties
So go and get the weight shawty, out of the safe for me
They all can go for 140, meet me at 1:40
Now hey, don't play no games with me
I ain't no lame sissy
All I'mma bring wit me, is the niggas who hang with me
They smoke and drank and slang with me
So they'll bang with me
Know if they came with me, that they down to die for me
Or bust a 45 at the blink of a eye for me
Now don't be fuckin round, before you be duckin down
You ain't goin hear that bustin sound
Til right 'fore you touch the ground
Now know that AK'll turn you browner than Bobby
And I was raised in the yay, rappin just was my hobby
I'm king of it

[Hook 3x]

[T.I. - talking]

PSC in this muthafucka

[Intro]
Still ain't forgave myself, damn
It's a lot of fucked up shit that go down, man
You don't even know the half

[Verse 1]
Man I been in and outta trouble since a adolescent
Spoiled rotten, dead fresh, wit no daddy present
I got two uncles, Quint and Man, and they keep me straight
7 or 8, I'm countin money while they movin weight
My daddy send me clothes and always tell me come and see him
I say, "Aight," but still I'm feelin like my momma need him
They sendin letters home from school, nobody read mines
And plus my uncles doin 10 years Fed time
Then I started rebellin, began crack sellin
Tha littlest thang on the corner wit a Mac 11
After school I hear my mama holla, "Homework!"
I say "Aight ma, but look, I got my own work"
Started interactin wit fiends at the age of 13
Now my mama findin rocks in my socks, Glocks in my toy box
Like damn, why do trouble come to me like this
But on the real, it ain't even have to be like this, fuck!

[Hook]
Mistakes made on this road to wealth
I still ain't forgave myself
Ay, what I am today, I made myself
But I still ain't forgave myself
For runnin to the grave getting closer to death
I still ain't forgave my self
For anyone who ever wondered how I felt
I still ain't forgave myself

[Verse 2]
At 14 man, thought I knew everything
I'm slangin slabs, trappin hard, movin heavy Cain
I bought an '85 Cutlass on some Dana Danes
Now I'm the shit, huh, the motor blew in 30 days
Hardheaded man I ain't listen to anything
I'm getting money so, I'm right and I got plenty game
Besides, why I need school? I'mma be rappin mama
If that don't work, well, I guess I'mma be trappin mama
But hey I promise I'mma make it cause I'm damn good
I'mma get us out this hood and off these canned goods
School just a white man game, and it's ran good
At 16, here's my introduction to manhood
Blue lights behind me, damn, what I'm gonna do?
Cause I got 2 pounds of weed in the car and a .380 too
I'm guessin everything'll be aiight if I just keep it cool
How ya doin officer, what ya mean why I ain't in school
Can you search the car?? Yea but, I rather that you didn't
Besides it's just a waste of your time cause ain't nothin' in it
(Laugh) I guess that's when I seen, that I ain't know shit
When stuck in a place wit freedom I ain't gone get.. (Damn!)

[Hook]
Mistakes made on this road to wealth
I still ain't forgave myself
Ay, what I am today, I made myself
But I still ain't forgave myself
Guess these the chances ya take, when dealt the cards I was dealt
But I still ain't forgave myself
For anyone who ever wondered how I felt
I still ain't forgave myself

[Verse 3]
Outta all the niggas I was wit when I was doin wrong
3 in the fed, 1 doin life, and 2 dead and gone
Knew there was more to life than sellin blow and chopper bustin
But what's the good in knowin' better if I ain't tell 'em nutthin
I knew I coulda told Cap not to kill shawty
Put down the gun, get in the car let 'em live shawty
You'll probably get locked up, and I'll probably have a deal shawty
Naw, I ain't scared, I'm just telling ya like it is shawty
Coulda told Endae, Quint, and Kern, man ya covers blow
Leave that country town alone, yall need to come back home
Bankhead and J-Rue, I just feel like if I was wit 'em
They woulda never got killed that night if I was 'em
Seem like I coulda done mo', said mo'
Why all my partners gotta be dead or in the fed fo'??
All the time, I just wish that yall could ball wit me
Sometimes at night I close my eyes, and dream that yall wit me (damn.)

[Hook]
And even though they say I can't blame myself
I still ain't forgave myself
For all the mistakes made on this road to wealth
I still ain't forgave myself
What I am today, I made myself
But I still ain't forgave myself
For anybody who ever wondered how I felt
I still ain't forgave myself

And yea they say I can't blame myself
But I still ain't forgave myself
Fo the mistakes made on this road to wealth
I still ain't forgave myself
Guess this the chance that you take, when dealt the cards I was dealt
But I still ain't forgave myself
For anybody who ever wondered how I felt
I still ain't forgave myself (Ain't Forgave myself)

[Talking]
Yea, for anybody who ever wondered how I felt
Anybody who ever wondered what's wrong wit me, here it is..
3 16's of what's in the heart of T.I.P
This song is dedicated to everybody who ain't here wit me
Cap, damn.. you fucked up shawty, but when you get out
If I live to see it, its gone be on again ya know what I'm sayin
And we ain't gotta worry bout goin to jail shawty we legit now
Ya know what I'm sayin.. Cern, Quint, Endae, yall gone get out man
And when you do I'll be there shawty.. always
Bankhead, J-rue, I'm sorry man, some shit I can't change
When I get up there, we gone ball again, open the gates shawty let me in..
We gone ball. J-Rue man I know money ain't worth a friend shawty..
I fucked up bad man.. I still ain't forgave myself
My momma, sorry I ain't graduate but
Hell we rich now it don't matter. My uncles shit
It don't matter either.. yall back
Well hell.. My Lil' boy (music stops)
You betta not do the same shit I did
Or Im'ma whoop yo muthafuckin ass..

[T.I. talking]
Ay, ay, ay, what you need shawty
Ay shawty man a I got 5 for 45 shawty, 5 for 45
Well shit what you need shawty
Ay these these bd's right here shawty
Ay this that this that noise too shawty
You can't get no better than this right here
Ay nigga well get the fuck out my trapp then

[Verse 1]
A crack a ki' a crumb do it fifty mo' times
The quarter go for 5 and the half go for 9
Still in the trapp wit them break down dimes
Hit me on the hipper anytime, I don't mind
Why y'all niggas bitching on and whining I'm a grind
Shack it in the winter and the summer I'm a shine (getting mine)
It's plenty of money to be made from Candler Road to Bankhead
It's plenty of room to get paid for those that ain't scared
I got the hard for the j's and dro' for the dank heads
The dope game still strong like pimping ain't dead
Heard what I said I ain't buying no yell
Weighing 36 o's or more on a triple beam scale
Yeah, look like you got that touchy bug shawty
Standing round in my trapp I think you fucking up shawty
Same nigga who taut a k getting paid in the trapp
Made a song for the niggas and the J's in da trapp
For the...

[Hook]
Da dope boyz in the trapp nigga
The thug nigga, drug dealer where you at nigga
I say the, da dope boyz in the trapp nigga
The thug nigga, drug dealer where you at, a where you at nigga

Ya dope boyz in the trapp nigga
The thug nigga, drug dealer where you at, a where you at nigga
Ya dope boyz in the trapp nigga
This for da, ya dope boyz in the trapp nigga

[Verse 2]
Never everybody in the swats know I got the fiyah fiyah
Nigga want that weight got it for the high high
You can't even supply the package I buy
I get it and I cook and it's gone for it dry
Get a quarter ki and cut it down to all dimes
Buy my own blow so the profits all mine
How we gone shine?, the same way we gone grind
Niggas ain't gone be able to see us hey, they gone think they gone blind
C got choppers on his vert and I got Daytons on mine
Triple gold and vogues, poppin' moe' blowin' pine
Honey brown wood grain wheel in the 'lac
Oak on the dash and the 12's in the back
Came for years of trappin', staying down wit the crack
Now that I made it rapping I ain't never going back
I'mma let the paper stack till it can't no more
Still got love for my niggas slangin' blow
Getting do' fo' sure

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I remember it all started wit a quarter ounce of hard
Me and C-Roy crunked the trapp up in Cobb
Nann nigga barred we the trillest niggas living
If this ain't yo trapp then what the fuck you doing in it?
What the muthafucking business, do you think you puttin down?
If so then my corner you need to get the fuck from round
Unless you wanna sell some weed my nigga Beed got the pound
Anything else I don't need ya help, I got the hard locked down
37's ki's in da grill of the broam
Jumped from 33 to my folk in Bowen homes
All most gone ain't got but four mo'
Eternal Simpson Road ain't no more blow
Nothing left for you but to count my do'
Just something else to do while I blow my dro'
350k what I paid for the shit
Made 850 quick when I flipped all these bricks
Getting rich in this bitch

HooK: 2x

{T.I. shouting out da dope boyz!}

Ay one time for da dope boyz in ATL

On over to Candler Road
Ay I know y'all niggas out there getting money in Decatur
Got damn ay we going on down to Miami shawty
Ay we know y'all niggas got them thangs down there for the low

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Come on (Hey)
PSC, Uh

They don't know, they don't know
(Now what you really know about them?)
(What it is) Yeen know about them
Them heavy chevys shawty
(Yeen know about them) heavy chevy shawty

[Verse 1]
Now how you tame a young baller
That rides Suburbans, Caprices and candy Impalas
Raspberry Monte Carlos that march like a rottweiler
Off the collar addicted to hustlin' and stacking mighty dollars
Ho holla, when you hear the chevy beating down the street
Beating so hard the Crissy wasting on my mink seats
To get them reupholstered gonna cost me ten G's
The same as the Chevy platinum emblem on my keys
With the diamond against the trim
Young ass nigga with a Louis V brim
A sporty young shawty with Gucci shades dim
These hoes mistaking me for being they pimp
They say "baby couldn't see you past them shiny rims"
I'mma cool little daddy bitch I've never been a simp
If you choosing ho then you need to hop on then
And if you ain't bitch, then you need to ride with him
Cause I'm pimpin' in my...

[Hook (2x)]
Ridin' swervin'
Ridin' swervin'
Ridin' swervin'
Ridin' swervin'
Ridin' swervin'

Yeah, we ridin' in them heavy Chevys, them heavy Chevys
On them D's and them Vogues
When we shinin' on them hoes
Yeah, we ridin' in them heavy Chevys, them heavy Chevys
Beatin' hard in the park when we rollin' wit the squad

[Verse 2]
Now you heard of me
You gone feel something hot to the 3rd degree
Coming down your streets in a black Caprice
With a fine ass freak in the passenger seat
Y'all fake niggas don't know the half of me
I spit pimp game automatically, don't be mad at me
Cause I'm finally coming up in the industry and the 4's sitting up on the triple d's
Bloodline, the underground celebrities, Mack Bone my partner keeping the beat
Heat it up like a cookout when the sun fall
Y'all nigga better look out or your rap career is over
I put a hook out like you at Apollo
Ride and swerving while my niggas follow
Hoes wobbling and start slobbin' bobbin' on the dick til they swallow, AH

[Verse 3]
Speedometer broken, duals smokin'
Body dented, windows tinted
Bend it round the corner
Leaning, engine steaming, screaming demons
Spillin' liquor, yeah nigga
Blow a tire off the wire
Burning rubber leaving foul
Muthafucka how you ride
Choppin blades with triple golds
Stay away from Campbellton Road
Playa cause I'm riding old
It ain't no thang to take them vogues
Jack it up, strip it down
Have the freshest car in town
Pimpin cuz I'm bout my crown

Hey shawty what's that knocking sound?

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 4]
T.I.P and P.S is fresher than new SS's
Triple doors and vogues shining like some treasure chests (bling)
I got a fetish
I ain't getting in it boy unless it's
Got them little blue boxes off in the headrestes
I bet it's wood in the dash
Duel in the ass
Get an Impala, holla
Watch me (skirrrt)
When I pass
I'm burning rubber in your yard
Diggin' up ya grass
Drag racin' 454
That's what make it fast

I hit the gas
And I mash on it in a flash
Throw it in the gutter
Buy another if it crash
That's petty cash

I parlay all day in a Chevrolet
Pearsjay wit a face bright as heavens day
I'm beatin fo' tens in the flo then
Hit the store then for some more Hen (Hey Dub)
Pull a ho and four friends

Dubs still spinnin' with a gold grill in it
White leather guts
Wipe up what ya spill in it
Still trillin out here

[Hook]

Outro

TIP, shawty
P$C, shawty
Pimp Squad
DP, Mac Boney, AK, Big Kuntry shawty

[Verse 1: T.I.]
They say love blind, so why can't I picture this guhl mine?
Yea I dig her but I figure, I'm wastin this guhl time
I'm runnin from relationships, scared to commit
Mad at monogamy, sexually, I'm a misfit
But this shit's... way too much fo me
Usually I can take 'em and make 'em a cut buddy
Yo mama probably see me, and say that I'm no good
I was born in the burbs, I was raised in the hood
We from two separate sides of life, two different backgrounds
Shawty been legit and I just started to rap now
I ain't tryina act now, I'm bein' real witchu
Really, I just wanted to kick it and chill witchu
But the picture got bigger, 'fo I could even paint it
Thoughts got deeper befo' a nigga could think
A playa like me on this, strange ain't it?
One thang bout yo feelins is this, you can't change it
Yo perception on me, I don't think I can maintain it
We flirtin' with disaster, this game we playin is dangerous
You the best thang that happened since I done became famous
But sometimes I think we shoulda remained strangers

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
I.. chose you baby
(Stay with me now, stay with me, sing it fo me shawty)
Oh I oh I chose you baby
(Ah, come on, uh, uh, uh c'mon)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I like you to pursue, but still I respect it to let it go
Give it time, give it room to breathe and let it grow
I'll just tell her when I'm ready to change, I'll let her know
Hate to say it, but til then be friends and nothin' mo
Even though anotha time, anotha life, anotha place
I swear I know we coulda been great
But rather than great, you lil heart take the smile of yo face
So I can treat you righ, I'm willin to wait
And ain't shit fake, I know it sound funny comin from a felon
But I think I got a piece of what's up in heaven
So to keep from, blockin my blessings, think I better back up
Last thang a nigga need now is bad luck
But if my life was perfect shawty, I'da had her
I guess, I guess I don't deserve it, ballaz tell me you ain't worth it
So I gots to hit the surface, I'll holla when I holla
Act like I don't wanna see ya, and I don't wanna call her

[Hook: Jazze Pha] x2

[Intro]
Yeah
To the ladies
One mo' message from T.I.P.,
I represent every man in America... Naw, the world
You wanna know what he what he
Thinkin' bout when he ain't
Talkin to you bout why he can't
Be your man you sure you wanna know
Here it is...

[Verse 1]
My girl say I don't love her
She say we just fuckin'
Nothin' against you
It's just that I hate tux
She wanna toast with the Mo' and the ice
Throwin' the rice
Wake up with me for the rest of your life
Ask me where I'm going, when I'm comin back when I bounce
Runnin her mouth, call herself the queen of the south
Redecorate the crib throwin satin on the couch
Catch me out adulteratin' takin' half of the house
Well it ain't she don't deserve it
Just I don't wanna give it
The life she wanna live
Shorty I don't wanna live it
Makin' money shorty's missin'
To all kind of digits
From KeKe's to Chaniques's
To Bianca's and Brigettes's
Poppin' up unannouced, shorty call 'fore you visit
Nothing about a number, mind your goddamn business
Look bitch, some shit bout Tip won't change
We can hang, but I got to let you know one thang

[Hook]
(I can't be your man)
It ain't you it's me, sorry shorty
(I can't be your man)
Where I been, I don't see no rings on these fingers
(I can't be your man)
Look to the future, find someone better than me
(I can't be your man)
You deserve much more, I'm no good to you shorty

[Verse 2]
Don't it seem like shit be cool for a month and a half
All of a sudden you frontin' and showin your ass
Complainin' bout what you got
Shorty look what you had
Before me, it was pull-out couches and Bilitant bags
Now she mad cause she ain't got a T.V. in her Jag
I tell you what if that ain't good enough get back on the bus
Give up the princess cuts and the Prada and stuff
I take you out to eat and you order a bottle of what?
Ungrateful wonderin' why I'm not faithful
Ballin's all good but this shit is just wasteful
Want me to pay your bills
Help you get a bigger crib
Shorty I don't mind helpin'
But show some initiative
Ain't brought nothin' to the table but hard times and heartache
Do something, get on the grind for God's sake
A reminder, rewind this message from your highness
For those that chose to take my kindness for blindness

[Hook]
(I can't be your man)
I don't cheat cause I ain't shit
I cheat cause you ain't shit
(I can't be your man)
Every time I walk in the house you sittin' on that goddamn couch
You ain't got nothing better to do
(I can't be your man)
Cook, clean, iron, pay the water bill, shorty do something
Work with me
(I can't be your man)
Ay, pack you shit shorty, I'm droppin yo ass off at yo mami house right now

[Verse 3]
One more scenario
Bout another jazzy ho
That I met on the road
After a show in Ontario
Shorty say she got a man
That don't really scare me though
But she say he got a temper
So, but what he jealous for
Cause you told him you were cheatin
Hell, well what you tell him for
Shit, what that got to do with Tip
You better let him know
Now she want to let him go
But what for
So you can get with me and keep being a slut ho
I don't think so
Baby better stay where you at
I'm no good for you
Never mind the way that he act
You got a kid and a crib with him
What's better than that
I'm in town for the week you better settle for that

[Outro]
(I can't be your man)
I'm here for 4 days shorty, 4 days
I can't change the world
(I can't be your man)
He don't treat you right?
What that gotta do with me?
(I can't be your man)
He be cussin' you out and shit
You cheated on him shorty, can you blame him?
(I can't be your man)
You ain't fend to bring that bullshit to me
I don't want naan parts of it
(I can't be your man)
Look here man
Get that shit out of my face
Kick rocks
(I can't be your man)
I ain't fend to have nothing to do with it
Their will be none of that round here
(I can't be your man)
Besides shorty you talk to much
I can't deal with it
(I can't be your man)
You say you work where?
Mickey D's, get the hell out of here shorty
Man look ay, I can't deal with it
You got too much baggage with you man
You and little, uh,uh,uh little Opus Cunningham
Y'all kick rocks down the damn street
I can't deal with it shorty
N...,complain...,what..., you ain't got what?
Shorty when I met you shorty you was barefooted
Sittin' on the railroad track with some straw in yo mouth
What the hell you complainin' about what you got now
Wh-Wh-What nigga you got steak and eggs right here
I'm sayin, what the business is?
Get the hell out of here man
Ay man you need to show me some appreciation round here
You in the damn living room more than the muthafuckin' furniture shorty
I can't deal with that shit man
Get a damn job
Do something for me
Lazy bitch, All the bad bitches in the world and I had to hook up
With the sorriest hoe in America
Why don't you take the weight off my back every now and then
Why don't you pay a bill
30 damn dollars, the cable bill ain't but 30 damn dollars shorty
Why don't you change the..., flip the mattress
Man wash some clothes, change a light bulb
Goddamn shorty, I gotta do every thing round this sumabitch
A lazy bitch, ain't nothing worse than a lazy bitch shorty wasted talent
(Intro - T.I.)
Ay, ay, ay!
Now listen to me for a minute
Ay, ay, ay!
Can ya hear me?

(Ciara)
Yeah, yeah, ye-ah!
La-la-la-la-la-la-la!
Ha ha ha, yeah, ye-ah!
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ye-ah!

(Verse 1)
TI
I know what you be thinkin' when ya hear me tryna holla
I'm a baller! You don't wanna come near me
I know ya hear me, but you really ain't tryna be bothered
Cause you probably used to leavin' out the club gettin' followed
But listen, shawty, I ain't nothin' like a stalker
If I say then I mean it, I ain't just a sweet talker
I know I want a woman 'fore I ever try to call her
I know ya first mind tell ya to decline, but you oughta
Come and chill for a minute, take a load off
Know ya heard rumors, plenty hoes say I'm throwed off
If ya choose to listen to them then it yo loss
But what you wanna do let me know, 'fore I roll off
I know ya havin' second thoughts, it ain't yo fault
Just don't let the bling scare ya off, I'm a sure floss
But I keep my business to myself, let the hoes talk
Kick it wit da King, be the Queen, it ain't no cost
(Chorus - Ciara)
I'll be your Queen for a day
Maybe we can get away
I do anything you wanna do anytime just pick a place
I'll be your Queen for a day
Baby you won't have to chase
If ya really want me to be the one, all ya gotta do is say, "I'll be ya King!"
I'll be your Queen, for today
Maybe you won't have to chase
If ya really want me to be the one, all ya gotta do is say, "I'll be ya King!"

(Verese 2 - T.I.)
Come and hang wit me, shawty
I can change ya life! Not a lil bit, look I'm talkin' major like
I mean first class flights, not first class seats
Gotta go G4 if ya commin' wit me
I put you in position broads would be honored to be
Hoppin in the double R right in front of the suites
Tell the driver to drop us off in front of the beach
Set up a table in the sand, fix us somethin' to eat
You'll be surprised whatcha learn sit and talkin' to me
As the moon and the stars glisten off of the sea
You've hardly ever seen only one woman with me
And if ya did then she probably mean something to me
I know you know I tote Glocks and I come from the street
But I done growed up alot since I was runnin' the streets
And even if that don't change ya opinion of me
I bet ya glad you got the chance to come and kick it with me, right?
(Chorus - Ciara)
I'll be your Queen for a day
Maybe we can get away
I do anything you wanna do anytime just pick a place
I'll be your Queen for a day
Baby you won't have to chase
If ya really want me to be the one, all ya gotta do is say, "I'll be ya King!"
I'll be your Queen, for today
Maybe you won't have to chase
If ya really want me to be the one, all ya gotta do is say, "I'll be ya King!"

(Verse 3 - T.I.)
I know ya had a chance to listen to the rest flirt
For you give on up the song come and try my vest first
I can give it to ya slow or I can make the sex hurt
Ooh but no pressure we ain't gotta have sex first
I know you wanna know that it's a mutual respect first
But we goin kick it if ya wanna clear ya head first
We can blow on the best purp til ya chest hurt
Take a couple shots drop the top in a wet vert
Call up ya homegirl, we can go and get her
If she love a good time well tonight might impress her (ha ha)
Squeeze in ya tight skirt, match it wit ya best purse
I can show ya both how to ball I'm an expert

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, take a good look at me - now picture me unhappy
No cash and outta fashion, not flashin'
Picture me doin' bad even if I wouldn't rappin'
Picture me even breathe on the mic not snappin'
I'm fire hot not lukewarm, my arms frozen
Picture me in a room full of hoes unchosen
Picture me with no P.O. and no 'dro
Picture pimps walk with some broads and ain't gettin' no 'tho
L.A. gone and I ain't gotta deal no mo' (Picture that)
And Ghet-o-Vision ain't real no mo' (Picture that)
Ah T.I.P. ain't work for MIA no mo'
He still so-so (picture that) he still po'
Nigga picture that, ah matta fact picture T.I.P
Gettin' anything other than rich
Now can you picture this, young, pompus, arrogant son of a bitch
Labelled as anything less than "the shit", I can't see it

[Chorus: Beenie Man]
Dis bad man you get shot, anywhere
Bad man nuh tek back chat, no day
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat, zagga zow
Any bwoy flip dem ago flap - come again
Dis bad man you get shot, any day
Bad man nuh tek back chat, anywhere
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat - bak
Any bwoy flip dem ago

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Pull up in a blue coupe that's damn near clear
And Polo gear that won't drop 'til next year
Be like this here, Cartier frames and Piaget wristwear
T.I.P. your majesty's right c'here
Notice when I came the dames disappeared, ya lames listen here
To play me, ba-by, hey he
Gone need a track from God featuring Jesus or Jay-Z
Go on floss, ball but where it cost
Smile for the cameras, take your shirts off
Y'all niggas actin, take ya skirts off
Hoppin bomb-ass nigga and he ain't wanna work boss
I'm gettin' sick and tired of these phony renditions
Wonder why I don't consider them no competition
There's no vision - lil' ambition
How I feel about these niggas, am I worried?
Are ya kiddin'?

[Chorus: Beenie Man]
Dis bad man you get shot, anywhere
Bad man nuh tek back chat, no day
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat, zagga zow
Any bwoy flip dem ago flap - come again
Dis bad man you get shot, any day
Bad man nuh tek back chat, anywhere
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat - bak
Any bwoy flip dem ago

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Some niggas wonder what my goal is
They think it's goin' gold havin' hoes sweatin' me
Fuck that, I'm in it for the longevity
Picture me as one of the greatest that'll ever be
Compare me to, 2Pac, B.I.G., and Jay-Z
Work with legends like, Organized No-I-Z., and J.D
Neptunes, they even flow on one of Dre's beats
Fly to Miami, chill with Luke and we can trade freaks
I freak shows, just peep hoes under shade trees
Huh, but KP say just keep it top-notch
And make sure that the club is jumpin' like it's hop-scotch
Floss rocks and in the summer keep the top dropped
Ten thousand dollars work for clothes, when I go shop
In the Impala on them vogues so the hoes jock
Especially when I rock that linen suit with no socks
In Polo skippers, they undo zippers
And they shows cock, to show shot shit
Bitch, I'm serious

[Chorus: Beenie Man]
Dis bad man you get shot, anywhere
Bad man nuh tek back chat, no day
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat, zagga zow
Any bwoy flip dem ago flap - come again
Dis bad man you get shot, any day
Bad man nuh tek back chat, anywhere
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat - bak
Any bwoy flip dem ago

[Outro: Beenie Man]
Well it's a Neptunes sound (ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Zagga-zagga-za, na-na-na-na-na (T.I.P.)
Whoa na-na-na-na (Beenie Man)
(Zagga-za-za-za, Oh we dat shit)
An a ziggi-ziggi-zagga (Bad man sittin)
Straight from Jamaica (Alright lemme give this to ya)
Alright lemme tell them somethin (See it's goin down)

[T.I.]
These niggas robbing me
Pray to God is nothing but a robbery
I gave them all I had
So they pulled they lick off flawlessly
They yelling fussing cussing
But all I hear is heaven calling
Me next thing I know they busting
They left me seven and they all in me
On fallen knees help me please death is all I see
If I die memory of a ballin G is all I'll be
Never thought I'll be laying in a puddle of blood trying to breathe
I don't want to die but something is telling me
It's time to leave say my apologizes
Make a final peace wit God
Seen my whole life flash before my eyes
And now it's getting dark body temp done drop
Going in shock crying out in fear, close my eyes
Take my last breath and I'm outta here
In my life I smoked a lot of weed
Drunk a lot beer, sold a lot of ki's
But that shit don't even matter here
Somebody said "walk toward the light"
But I ain't ready to go
Am I dead? is it over? "you ain't ready to know"

[T.I.]
Well now I moving toward the light
And I ain't walling or nothing
I ain't like the shit
Well hell I guess ain't use for me to try to fight
The shit what the business is you God
I been waiting to meet you
And I knew I been hearing bout yall
But like the one day I would see you
But why you let dem niggas kill me?
You could have done something why you ain't come down there
And shield me when them niggas started dumping
Then He say "excuseth me
But I control no hatin
And it cometh not from me"
Well who coming from "Satan"
Oh Satan did this excuse me Lord
But now that nigga's on my shit list and
I know with all this fly shit you got a A-K
Or a piston grip give me a clique of angels with bulletproof wings
Lucifer gon get piston whipped a lot of die I ain't scared
Who he think he is fuck with Tip
I got a A-K two 45's bout 50 clip I'm finna dip
I ain't borrow shit I'm finna trip
Put a piston grip in Lucifer lip
And then he say "two wrong doth make it not a right one a last"
Well forgive me cause
I'm bout to ride out on Luficer's ass
And all I need you to do is give me
The strength and Lord you know I'm need you
With the shit I'm finna attempt
I'm fix to bust hell wide open fear don't control me
And I'm O.G. hell can't hold me

[T.I.]
Now 'Pac and Biggie want ride too
I guess that's cool since that muthafucker
The reason y'all niggas had to die too
My nigga Bankhead would be alive too
Shawty let ride
It's 4serious up here dough
Cause we don't ride we glide
Now I'm strapped and ready folks
But I can't seem to do a thing
With these wings how I'm supposed to keep them steady folks
With a chopper on back of two 44's shawty no
A the pain we finna bring
I don't thing he even ready for
When it's on you already know
Farewell bruh. mama always told me
I was bad enough to tear hell up
I'm doing this for what you made of
From that time you made the bitch eat the apple
To the time you pick your folks
To put us on the boat and enslave us
Worked that never paid us
Killed Malcolm X, Martin Luther King
And everybody else tried to come down here and save us
Kept our fathers from raising us
Kidnapped us from our country
Take your distance in our religional way
Well now it's time for the cadet to busted
We want our spirits and our minds back now
I'm getting mines right now
Pussy nigga lay it down I'm walkin
Thought hell kicking the devil doors down
Spreading rounds waving cadet rounds
Well I woke up I was lying down shawty
WHAT HAPPENED?

Although I won't elaborate I'll say she lick things and get green
She fuck wit me because I got big dreams
And along wit a face she think she seen on the big screen
I give it to her 'til she whine and her back hurt
Then drive her crazy 'til she crying and she act worse

Verse 2: T.I.P

Man trying to stop pimpin like shooting a bee-bee gun at a freight train
So comparing us is like wine to a grape stain
My reputation's great mayn, I got a great name
I hate lames, I stake claims, and I break dames
I like 'em small or bigger with a figure eight frame
So if she fine I bet she mine when I find time
Man I ain't lying, mine dimes I don't wine or dine
Like clothesline hoes mine, I'm a goldmine
Ay I'm the "King of Da South" and the throne mine
I got the chrome in the Chevy and the Brougham mine
Ay man I'm young but I been doing it for a long time
That ain't my fault that bitch grown she got her own mind
Ah-and I'm...
Hook: 1x

Verse 3:

I bet some niggas think I cake her when I take her out
But come next week just watch me rape her fucking bank account
Eventually the P$C hey we gone take the south
Then grab the earth by the ankles and shake the paper out
Nigga I'm bout my paper route so I'm gone make a route
Anybody blocking my road to riches man I'm gone take 'em out
Keep runnin yo mouth making up you mind you got's to be's wit out

Big p-i-m-p-i-n-g is all I be's about

They out of pocket, I'mma lock 'em out and leave 'em out
And that don't change man, season in season out
Open up The Source shawty and see who just you reads about

Ay, listen homes, get Atlantic on the phone, go on call 'em
And tell Craig, Julie, Kev, and Kys - I need to holla at 'em
First I gotta let 'em know I'm tired of rappin
Fuck the money, ever since Phil died I ain't happy
Hey what's happenin, we under new operations
Though we ready for whatever, we like ya cooperation better
Listen when I'm talkin, throw it off, I ain't patient
I'mma tell ya once then start countin shell cases
Don't mean to scare you but this bullshit is irritatin
I'mma tell you like it is shawty, I ain't fin' to play
I feel like another case comin round the corner any day
I know the consequences, I'm the same nigga anyway - anyway
It's way more important than what I'm fin' ta say
Do what I say or I ain't droppin shit 'til twenty twenty-eight
(Who gives a fuck if he comes on the 20th for 28th?)
{He said the year 2028 you fucking moron!}
Listen guys, on that B-I shit
It's T.I.P. from here on out, fuck that T.I. shit
Give a damn what any nigga gotta say 'bout this
(Yo check this cat) Yeah I think it's best to say I did it
Don't be e-mailin no itineraries, I won't get it
Ya best bet just holla when they fill the jet
Tell Cindy ain't no photo shoots and I ain't interviewin
Refuse and I'll build a subdivision and shoot a dozen movies
{Cash that check and be spendin our money}
You right about that honey, thanks for doin that for me
Speakin of money - you can always buy me out but the price high
I ain't none of T.I. nigga, no mo' Mr. Nice Guy

Listen kid, understand me here (what?)
This is Lyor Cohen (yeah yeah)
You better treat this company with some respect (ha ha ha ha)
And you better not be playin with my motherfuckin money

[Outro: T.I.]
Oh I got ya motherfuckin money partner, but I ain't playin
You got any sense you'll do what the fuck I say
I ain't sellin no goddamn albums
And that ain't no threat, that's a motherfuckin promise jack!
Come and see me if you want it
Get it like the Red Cross nigga!

[Hook: T.I.]
Ay, hey don't you wanna be hiiiiigh?
Hey listen baby come fly with me, take a ride get high with me
Ay, ay, I know you wanna be hiiiiigh
You never wanna say bye to me, if you ever come fly with me
Ay, hey don't you wanna be hiiiiigh?
Hey listen baby come fly with me, take a ride get high with me
Ay, ay, I know you wanna be hiiiiigh
Promise you'll never say bye to me, and if you ever get high with me
Let's go

[T.I.]
Okay the bucket's on tilt, truck is on stilts
Just did another deal today, at least a couple mil'
And I'm askin you to chill, wanna pass that down?
I'm tryin to pick you up and never put ya ass back down
Get rid of all your worries, why you draggin that around?
Here, pop one of these, now pass that around
Fire it up, take a shot, now ya ass in the clouds
Can I bend you over? Throw your ass back down
No need sayin no, we way past that now
I ain't them other niggas, just control the flashback now
Make three wishes, you can have that now
And fuck the financin, payin cash right now
Ay, miracle man make dreams come true
Take a ride, get high, 'bout the time you come to
I bet your life done changed, you likin my last name
Done had a couple babies with a Bentley and a Range
Crib on the water, eatin meals on a plane
And your life in the sky like you lived on a plane
With so much good shit to fill yo' brain
If the band seem strange I'm just sayin

[Hook]

[T.I.]
You see me, chillin out kickin back in the ride
With a, fly broad on the passenger side
Got a, nice smile and immaculate eyes
Before she, get inside she don't have to decide
Cause she can have it how she want it, we can do it like that
And then I went and threw it to her and she threw it right back
She said nobody never gave it to her like that
Hit it from the back, I figure you would like that
Her head intact, pussy good like that
And damn, she ain't even from the hood like that
So she probably never really kicked it with a cool nigga
Other niggas had her didn't know what to do with her
Intimidated by her face and her cute figure
Cause her waist real small but her ass way bigger
Hope she know that if I want her I ain't finna play wit her
All I gotta do is spend a day with her

[Hook]

[T.I.]
Hey, hey what it is pretty girl, would you like to
Come and kick it with a nigga for a night or two?
And you can take your clothes off if you like to
And it don't matter 'bout the cost if I like you
I just do it shorty, I ain't gotta try to
Bust a move, bet ya I can satisfy you
And me chase right behind you, why boo?
I'm like you, know you fly but I'm fly too
You know how I do it, always ride good
Match the paint with the wheel, put the trunk in the hood
You dealin with a real nigga, get it understood
I'm still from the hood, even when in Hollywood
With my beat down low and my top let back
You lookin for a G, well you got just that
Hey I can be your king, you can be my princess
Baby all you gotta do is say yes

[Hook]

[Intro: T.I.]
Mmm, God mm
What the fuck, what time is it?
I coulda swore I parked my car (shit)

[T.I.]
Ay, light hit my face sun brought the heat
Open my eyes see my car parked across the street
And then it hit me I ain't really slept at all in a week
Matter fact I don't even remember fallin asleep
Alantic office claimin J. Geter keep callin the heat
Is it an emergency or somethin you need to talk to me?
J said - "I thought you needed to talk to me
If it's a change made aware I think it ought ta be
You makin ultimatums now you don't talk to me
You make shit way worse then it ought ta be
I ain't arguin on the phone, come talk to me
I'll be waitin on you dawg at the office, peace"
Now, thinkin hard as I walk out my house
What the fuck have I done now, what could he be talkin 'bout?
I been stayin outta trouble, shit I been on the couch
Just workin on the album, I was listenin now
Then, Doug called (ay you spoke to J?)
Yeah is it somethin I don't know that I was supposed to say?
All I know is for the hour I been woke today
Niggas comin with the riddles and the jokes today
I'm real close to J, I seen ups and downs hit
But I ain't never heard him sound the way that he sounded
Really caught a nigga by surprise, I was astounded
He a real cool dude but why he call me clownin?

[Doug Peterson] + (T.I)
You sayin you don't know 'bout it? (Know 'bout what?)
Atlantic Records said you called the office and went nuts
Makin death threats talkin loud gettin buck
(Man they said I did what? Folk I'm just gettin up!)
Say you waitin out your deal 'til you year is up
You plannin to make away with 20 million bucks
(You bullshittin me right? Is you serious bruh?)
Yeah they said from now on they'd rather deal with us
I talked to Craig, Jules and Kys' a long time
Long story short they said you done lost ya damn mind
And they runnin off deeper across ya deadline
You crossin a thin line, don't give 'em a deadline
Or they suin the shit up out ya, they don't give a shit about ya
Said you ain't doin nothin they couldn't have done without ya
Man you ain't never been hotter, worked a whole lotta
Years and came up to go way back to the bottom, what

[Repeat to fade]
Hustle pimp, hustle pimp

[Outro: T.I.]
Man, the hell is y'all talkin 'bout?
I been in the house all night
I don't know nothin 'bout that shit man
I got the album right here!
Man send this to 'em

[Intro: T.I.]
Yo, ayyyyyy, huh-ayyyy
I gotta love my man here engineerin (okay)
It don't take me too long to write it (uh, huh-ayyyyy)
How long it take you to record me baby? HEY! (huh-ayyyyy)
Hey ya ain't live, you don't ride, you don't do it like I do it
(It's all good man, we gon' ride on these fuck niggas anyway though)
Ya ain't real, you don't wanna get into it
Don't play with yourself nigga (okay)
Play a lotto nigga (okay)
Hey - let's get it! (yeahhhhh fuck nigga, AY!)

[Hook: T.I.]
Hey ya ain't live, you don't ride, you don't do it like I do it
I keep it real - ya ain't real, you don't wanna get into it
Ya ain't crunk, ya ain't buck, ya ain't hard, ya ain't G
You ain't got what I got pumpin in your hard TV
You do all that yellin, holla, ya ain't real and ya ain't bout it
Ya ain't serious, ya ain't crazy, you know you don't wanna die
Ya ain't hustle from the bottom, you don't got it like I got it
You can hate and you can lie but pussy nigga I'm the hottest

[T.I.]
I'm the realer nigga in this shit, aside from all the business shit
I'm the nigga sucka niggas best to keep it pimpin with
People say I start a lot of shit, I say I finish it
Thank God it wasn't no witnesses, I'd still be servin sentences
Rap shit way more stressful that I love my other businesses
Thank God I'm a professional and scared I don't begin to get
Whether in a Phantom or the truck with all the kids in it
Still tote a hammer try me, man I hope you listenin
Your death gon' be elaborate, real fuckin extravagant
I'm down to die myself to show you niggas I ain't havin it
Had to kill your son and a few your momma had to get
And they were playin dumb, we run in and ask where daddy at

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Mac Boney]
I carry niggas on my back like a bookbag
Put the pistol in his hand and tell him shoot his ass
I pull a little file faster than them credit people
Yo' ass dead, that's why you probably seein dead people
The weapon with me's really lethal, yeah it scare people (oh my God)
I know off top that I'm gon' bust, that's why I dare people
And I won't dare cheat you, I fair-and-square beat you
Same time, same time's why I'm on that Grey Goose
Don't make me spray and let loose, cause I won't hesitate to
I heard one shot then heard two, jumped up out the truck like what it do
I got a fo'-five on me and got a nine too
A nigga sayin "Mac Boney, we ain't shoot at you"
I say you sucka ass niggas better keep it movin
'Fore y'all boys be the ones I end up doin

Hustlin... out here...

[Hook: Governor]
I'm out here, hustlin
I'm just thinkin 'bout gettin back home to you babe
I'm out here, hustlin
You see that's how I'm able to send that little money to you
Hustlin - let's get more freedom
In my future, so we can ball (out here)
So we can sip champagne, and puff that mary jane
And you can fly first class on an airplane

[T.I.]
Jeah, ay, let's go man
I remember comin up, used to hate to get on the bus
Dreams of gettin paid and makin the big bucks
Started to get a little then couldn't get enough
Let me in, I'mma win nigga I don't give a fuck
The environment sucks but the bread ain't bad
The broads, don't fuck 'em all but the head ain't bad
I'm young, rich and legit; think the Feds ain't mad?
Haters are sick of the Six, so scared of the scad
Dag, damn nigga ya ain't have to brag
This'll never pay, remember when you said that bad?
The nigga still thinkin I blew up so fast
J. Geter, remember when you put up yo' last?
This for my niggas tryin to flip yo' cash
'fore the Feds can get a chance to clip yo' ass
Get a lot of powder in a Ziplock bag
Wrist full of rubber bands, 40-cal's in the dash

[Hook]

[T.I.]
Yo ay, ay, let me holla at 'em Gov'..
I know some people love me to death and there's some that can't stand me
Cause I got a big-ass crib in Miami (what else?)
Another out in Cali, backyard so sandy (okay)
And most broads find it hard to understand me
But the same attitude that make crews goddamn me
Is the same ones that got me lookin cool at the Grammy's
Haters wanna damage me but King you'll never be
Shawty holla at me when you get your first felony
Then holla at me when you've been on Dave Letterman
Say they never seen a real nigga so elegant
Lames wanna hear that real shit and I'm tellin it
Trained the game to be sold and I'm sellin it
Chasin a Honda mil', that bullshit is irrelevant
We can race if you wanna, I bet on me and you'll never win
Simply cause a loser's somethin I've never been
If you doubt now holla back at 2007 then

What you waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
Let me hear you say big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas, bein' broke is not an option

Let me hear you say big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas, bein' broke is not an option

[Verse 1]
Do it to the maximum, take it while you askin' them
Don't listen to them suckers when they say you too irrational
See, I said I was King, and them lames started laughin', them
Same suckers now want the King on a track with 'em
I composed several classicals, you know, like "Top Back"
"Dope Boyz", "Bring 'Em Out"
And "What You Know About That"
Now they ask how I top "What You Know About That"
Dominated '06, now I'm goin' right back
See me reign hell, I just showed you like that
Even Denzel say, "Damn, I ain't know it like that!"
Nigga, yeah, still Bankhead, you can tell
Ain't nothin' changed but the name on the mail
I still kick in doors with them thangs in the air
Up in Benihana's, see me slang in the chair
I will slang 'caine, no such thing as a jail
Say you need a hundred squares? It just came off the scale

[Hook]
Now do it, you better do it, you better do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, ‘cause I'ma do it, ‘cause I'ma do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?

Let me hear you say big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas, bein' broke is not an option

[Verse 2]
Do it like a ball player where you see me ball at
Stacks tall as ball players from the stage to the air
Whether in Miami, Cincinnati, or the Riverdale
Arizona, California, make it rain anywhere
Pullin' out that pistol, nigga, who you think you finna scare?
These 20 rounds of missiles have ya pissin' in your underwear
I tote a pair of .40 cal's, so you better tone it down
Or I suggest you just prepare yourself for when it goin' down
A-Town, West Side, club crucial, catch me
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro, and Mack be
Jackers lie, say they caught me slippin', how could that be?
I'm somethin' like a stalker, I be e'rywhere the strap be
The trap be, jumpin' with them hundred dollar slabs
If I want it, nigga, I could get a hundred on the tab
Sell 'em all, double down, nigga, do the math
Think I won't pull up in somethin' with 200 on the dash?

[Hook]
Now do it, you better do it, you better do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, ‘cause I'ma do it, ‘cause I'ma do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
Hey what you waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it
Let me hear you say big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas, bein' broke is not an option

[Verse 3]
Now, I do it like I wanna do it, and do that shit in front of you
Real nigga vision pimpin', I ain't seein' none of you
I do it for my nigga Phil daughter and his mama too
I do it for my oldest sons and their grandmama too
Do it for my daughters and my youngest son's mama who
Go buy what she want because she know it ain't a problem to
You do somethin' to them and to you I'll bring the drama to
You do it for a day or so, we do it for a month or two
I do it for my partners, go make sure them niggas stuntin' too
We do it with them choppers
Ain't no problem, where you runnin' to?
We do it for the block, that's why ain't nobody stoppin' me
I do it for my pop and my cousins too, they watchin' me
I did it nonstop, now see how these niggas copy me
I made it from the bottom to the top where I oughta be
Who do it this good and do it this fresh?
No matter what I do, you know I do it to death

[Hook]
Now do it, you better do it, you better do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, ‘cause I'ma do it, ‘cause I'ma do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
Hey what you waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it
Let me hear you say big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas
Bein' broke is not an option, now do it!

[Intro]
Huh, yeah (AY! You already know what this is homie!)
Aiyyo what you yellin for man? (Man shut the fuck up talkin to me man)
Man calm down shorty
(Nah you calm down, I ain't got shit to say to you man)
Man see that's why I don't even fuck wit'chu dawg
(Hollywood ass nigga, I don't fuck with YOU)
You be on that bullshit man
(Yeah man, well you better respect my muh'fuckin hustle)
Man you ain't the only one gotta hustle nigga (I told you once man)
You can't tell me shit! (You heard me) Aight now

[Hook]
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, M-Y, H-U-S-T-L-E
Should respect this hustle, respect this hustle
Won't accept nuttin else so respect this hustle
I ain't in it for the fame, I ain't in it for the glory
I'm down to die for it, absolutely mandatory
Respect this hustle, respect this hustle
Won't accept nuttin else so respect this hustle - AY!

[Verse One]
These niggas bitch-made, I'm gettin paid six ways
Six laid, shit's sprayed with lemonade with blades
Keep your mouth closed, you don't wanna get sprayed
Shoot you up your body, let it sunbathe six days
Kamikaze renegade, nah he never been afraid
Kept the trap hot enough to fry an egg in the shade
I ball 'til the day I'm lyin dead in the grave
I leave the Feds behind the wall cause I ain't get away
Chopper round the corner and a bushel with a brick of yay
A bust can happen any day, we out here trappin anyway
Gettin money's an addiction, damn what a nigga say?
I got a real bad condition if I ain't gettin paid
Hand over fist, well I miss it, gotta get busy
I know you see this car I drive and see the house that I live in
And figure this is enough (what nigga?) I want way mo'
Nigga this is Play-Doe, you set your sights way low
Had enough of the game, I don't know whether to stay or go
And different group of lames and suckas e'rywhere which way I go
(But nigga know you King, why you always gotta say it fo'?)
Cause they said I couldn't say it befo'
And I remember all it did was fuck my temper up mo', Doug and J know
I said I wear a crown, not a halo - sorry
Niggas think they seein me but they so sorry
They fast but they ain't no Ferrari {*YOOM!*}

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Ay, don't you think you been pullin gats fussin cussin enough?
Round here braggin 'bout these niggas you be bustin enough
Man look around, ain't nobody sufferin but her
You could beat a hundred cases, catch one and you fucked
(Man I get probation) Is you crazy? Pull a gun in the club
See how many folks and polices put you down in the club
If we gotta come with a slug, why we come to the club?
How much more of this shit you think we can sweep under the rug?
(Look, we already told them "I Told You So")
But all these niggas speakin out who wouldn't spoke befo'
Don't take it personal, people wanna be close to folk
What you think the televisions and the posters fo'?
(Yeahhh man I'm claustrophobic though) Well you need to see a doctor for it
And I ain't jokin, you close Tip and you 'bout to blow it
Did you forgot about them nights in the cells, was you honest
(I dunno) When we was havin talks with God and you promised
If he made a way for you to be large, and you done it
Out the gate, "Urban Legend" went on to do numbers
Sold a mil', made "ATL", "King" first week five hundred
Won the Grammy's (but not the one that I wanted)
What about them eight figure deals and that other new money?
But ask yourself somethin, where the gun you got from me?
Keep it real
Talk about somethin other than yourself sometime (man)
Did you keep your promise partner? (Ay, just keep it real)

[Hook]

[Numerous ad libs to the end]

Niggas think they gonna attack, I got a mac on hold

You see T.I. and Nelly on it, know the track gone blow
Man you niggas barely pro, I don't even practice no more
Aye shawty I was gettin' dough when you was rappin so-so
When you barely had flow I had crack for the low
You can stunt for the audience and act for the hoes
Let me ask you what you gon' do when we ain't actin' no more
Aye when I finish wit you you ain't even gon' be rappin' no more
Aye "How he doin'?, Where he at?" somethin' they ain't askin' no more
Aye picture me not bein' the main attraction no more
That's all the talkin' I care to do to you back to the hoes
Baby drop it back it up til you can't back it no more
You show me you bout that action, I'll throw a stack on the floor

[Hook]

[Nelly]
Aye come on in lil mama sit down pay attention
You don't want to get to school, then take your ass to detention
Stick my key in your ignition, I'm crankin' up your engine
I'm pullin' your extensions Now we switchin' up positions
Got an ill technique, in makin' ya knees weak
A non-stop treat until your g-spot leak
To your G4 seat, we'll be back next week
So tell that lame ass nigga you got places to be
So give me your participation, don't need no hesitation
Don't want to be mistaken, ma I'm plannin' on relations
Yea, you rollin' wit the King and the One
Country niggas in the chevy passin' Grey Poupon
Man, we been gettin' dough since we was way too young
The record sales was the mob that'll make me a Don
You see this is why I'm hot, and this is why he not
So mama climb on top, and show me what you got, aye

[Hook]

[T.I. & Nelly]
The independent ladies that can buy their own Mercedes I say
That's the one, that's the one
Country girls that represent, payin' they own rent holla
That's the one, that's the one
For the women constantly poppin' tags with the newest Louis bags yea
That's the one, that's the one
To all the girls who in shape, slim waist, pretty face hey
That's the one, that's the one
Okay
Now bend that ass over

[Intro]
Look at this little nigga, man

I'll show you how to tote that tool
Make that double
Better be cool, you don't want no trouble
Keep it leanin' to the left
My gat stay cocked
I'm always super clean when you see me on the block
Keep my money in a knot with a rubberband on it
Blow to marijuana, know I got it if you want it
See me standin' on the corner, slangin' that crack
You know how it is to be the man in trap

[Hook]
I'm the dopeman nigga the dopeman nigga the dope the dope dope the dopeman nigga
I'm the dopeman nigga the dopeman nigga the dope the dopeman the dopeman nigga
I'm the dopeman nigga the dopeman nigga the dope the dope dope the dopeman nigga
I'm the dopeman nigga the dopeman nigga (From a ki' to a G, it's all about money)

[Verse 1]
Look, bet all you see is tats, money, grills, and chains
But if you scratch the surface you can feel the pain
Names change but the situation still the same
The bills need payin' nigga simple and plain
Take a young'n who's aspirin' to get him some change
Won't nobody hire him so he get in the game
Went and bought a 50 slab, divide it up into ten
Sold 'em all, double down, did it again
By then you got enough to buy a quarter ounce
You sellin' dimes to forty fiends buy it and bounce
Throw some money to your momma keep some food in the house
Cop the outfit and the Jordans on the day they came out
Betta get ya self a pistol know the jackers is out
Flip another seven grams, oh you hustlin' now
Time to get yourself a half, make sure it's some glass
A hundred bags sell it fast stack a G now you officially

[Hook]
(I betcha think you pretty good at it now, huh?)

[Verse 2]
Now once you flipped a couple o's know the game get gravy
Take twelve fifty go git ya two and a baby
Yeah sixty three grams if you whip that right
You should get back five or six that night Stack that money and repeat that twice
Buy you somethin' to ride in, ya gotta be tight
Next time you buy somethin' take twenty-five hundred
Get four and a half it come back in nine don't it
Now stay low key when the money keep comin'
Keep some niggas on ya team to show these suckas they don't want it
By then your connect will clearly see you on ya grind
Shit you come to get a nine and he front you what you buyin'
As long as you bring back your money on time
And if you snort blow, do it on your own time
At this rate you'll be at a brick in no time
They say the want some weight, tell them niggas stand in line

[Hook]

(Stay with me now shawty, here comes the fun part)

[Verse 3]
Now the robbers plottin' on ya and your name stay buzzin'
You caught a sale case down in Macon with your cousin
Your connect ain't worried, you and him cool
He know you'll never tell what you and him do
A mob of a hundred just a few of them true
You heard a worker snictchin' on you and it's true
Everybody know you sell that shit
The feds come and get ya, shit we heard you
Tote that tool, make that double
Better be cool, you don't want no trouble
Keep it leanin' to the left, my gat stay cocked
I'm always super clean when you see me on the block
Keep my money in a knot with a rubberband on it
Blow that marijuana know I got it if you want it
See me standin' on the corner slangin' that crack
You know how it is to be the man in trap

Say goodbye to the:

Hey shorty, real talk: I'mma tell it like it is, ya dig? Them other cats give you half of it cause they don' known no better I'mma give you the whole story though. This shit a dead end street, partner. Take it from a nigga who been there. It ain't but a few of us who make it up out this shit, man, and live to tell about it, you know what I'm sayin', from the free world. But shit. The choice is yours, though, homie. Just don't say I ain' tell you. Once they get yo ass behind them walls talkin bout how many folk they got tellin on ya, your ass'll believe somethin' then. If you out ta make a million dollars in the game I betcha you get a hundred years...

[Hook]
You niggas ain't raw
I don't buy none a that bullshit you tellin' me
King you'll never be, I can see you niggas ain't raw
Hell naw, give a damn who you go and get
Real niggas know it we can notice that you niggas ain't raw
Even know now you 'posed to be down with so and so
Still the same lame from a year ago, I know you ain't raw
You ain't graduated with the gladiators, you just practice for the young assassinators
You know you ain't raw

[Verse 1]
Fuck that shit you tellin' us
I know you ain't shit as us
You ain't no competitor, that shit there ain't scarin' us
You bought ya self a slaughterin' a coffin's what you headed for
You ain't wanna die well nigga what you pull a weapon for?
Just cause we the niggas all of yo ho bitches checkin' for
And ain't nobody real niggas rather hear instead of us
You ain't out shinin us, you ain't out sellin' us
A lot of niggas do it don't nobody do it well as us
Hater wanna flex with us
Let em get vested up
Hit em with the choppa chest and up, bet I wet cha up
Let cha partna get cha up, ain't nobody catchin' us
But this some shit I'm bound to receive a lethal injection for
King of the whole thing, fuck whoever steppin' up
Give a damn whoever behind him, care about who catchin' up
Long as I'm alive the second best you have to settle for
Come on now you really think you betta, bruh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got 44's glowing on a boat just goin'
This bitch, his bitch, and yo bitch blowin'
Young pimpin' get dough like his last name Cohen
My fan base spread and the shit kept growing
That what got me getting head in the vessel
Of the G4 again hook a hustle up with investors
Now there he go again
Twenty million later I guessin' it finally soakin' in
Unless you just a hater who mad at me cause he broke again
Sellin' all his jewelry considerin' sellin' dope again
Cuz he was ballin' out of control and posed to be focusin'
Wanna be the king by default they hopin' for openin'
Pray they see the day they hear me say I never flow again
But au contraire I guarantee one year after another they'll suffer as long as I'm here
Fear no man alive I don't care, you don't run shit nigga be clear

[Hook 2x]

[Intro: T.I.]
You gotta get your swagger together nigga (ay)
Get your suit fitted (ay)
Starts on the inside, ya dig?
I don't need mine, I got cribs where we goin (okay)
If you don't love yourself you can't love nobody
Keep up nigga (okay) I love myself
You gon' need to travel ladies, you go and got that mack diesel right

[T.I.]
I'm the man from Atlanta, to way out in Cali
Catch me in New York, I'm on the way to Miami
I be in Hawaii, then catch me in Paris
I be at home barely, I'll sleep when I'm buried
What I need some sleep for? This dope got me geeked up
I went to Japan and made a mil' in a week bruh
These niggas can't keep up when they see me in London
Or out in Ibiza, that time I ain't sleep for
Bout three days maybe, you see me in Haiti
With Wyclef Jean and a selection of ladies
But my folk got that work in like they back in the 80's
See the money's what move me, conversation don't phase me

[Hook: Wyclef Jean] + (T.I.)
(Tell 'em why cause I) Been around the worrrrrld
Traveled the seven seas (and I be)
Poppin bottles with celebrities (so you can find me)
Flyin high, smokin better trees (ay, oh-ay-ay)
Girls around the worrrrrld (yo, yo)
They keep callin me (they call me)
Paparazzi they be follow me (they all be)
Hopin that they get a shot of me
It's my swaaaaag (they wonder what's so special 'bout him)
(Why they ain't sellin records like him, tell 'em)
It's my swaaaaag (how he always look so cool)
(That why e'rybody do what he do, tell 'em)
Gotta be my swaaaaag (they wonder why he wear his hat like that)
(When girls see him why they act like that, ay, I don't know)
It's my swaaaaag (for some reason all the real niggas love him)
(Even though they girlfriend wanna fuck him, I guess)
Gotta be my swaaaaag

[T.I.]
Gettin money in Frisco, wearin my raincoat
See I'm gettin wet, and this bitch in the same boat
I came in the game slow, they act like they ain't know
That I wasn't gon' leave until I got what I came fo'
I still can't complain though, as long as I ain't broke
I came a long way but shawty ain't nuttin changed though
I still let the tool go, don't get it confused bro
Run up on me wrong, now what you think I'mma do bro?
Send you to your maker, then go to Jamaica
Or either to Cabo, I chill at my condo
My swagger is perfect, hatin on me ain't worth it
Guarantee you boy, the Earth my turf, if it hurts

[Hook]

[T.I.]
Regardless what haters say I'm as real as they come
I'm chasin that paper baby however it come
From singing this song to moving yay by the ton
I bet you never seen a nigga gettin money so young
How I get from the pen', all the way to Berlin
I've been to Switzerland skiing and pimp I'm goin again
It ain't nuttin to catch me in the south of France
In a coffee shop smokin dro in Amsterdam
And ain't nuttin to fly, all the way to Dubai
St. Barts, St. Lucia, any day we can try
G-5 to Moscow and they say I'mma lie
I'mma ball like a dog 'til the day that I die

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Outro: T.I.]
This is impeccable pimpin
You couldn't duplicate this shit if I told you how to man
Hahhh, y'all niggas keep up
By the time you get to Puerto Rico my nigga I'll be in Cuba
By the time you get to Cuba I'll be in Haiti
By the time you get to Haiti I'll be way over in Africa man
Y'knowmsayin? South of France in my land man
The Earth's my turf my nigga {*fades out*}

[Intro]
Let's go (ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.. ay, ay, ay)
Y'all gon' wish for a nigga like me when I ain't here
Ya know what I'm sayin'? (Think I'm lyin)
Say goodbye to the bad guy!
You don't appreciate a nigga my type
Once I die ain't no mo' niggas my type
So just remember me right (you ain't gotta worry 'bout me no mo')
Just remember me right, hey just remember me right
Hey just remember me right, just remember me right
(But you gon' see is far worse than out there, hey!)

[Hook: T.I.]
Bet you don't appreciate a nigga my type
Cause when I die ain't no mo' niggas my type, so just remember me right
Bet if I let them suckas kill me tonight
All them haters gon' be filled with delight, God forgive me, aight?
I sacrifice so they could live my life
If necessary I'd give my life, so what you here in my life
Reputation decorated with stripes
No need for cryin at the end of my life, hey just remember me right

[T.I. - over Hook]
You'll see...
I see you laughin, AY!
I did this shit for you nigga, it's all good
Hey! You know me homie, ay

[T.I.]
When your back was against the wall remember where could you go
Remember who helped you again like he helped you befo'
Went out they way to let you know that you ain't ever alone
They disrespect you, you come get who 'til they left you alone
He taught you, how to be weak, he taught you how to be strong
Taught you not to accept defeat, you go all out or be gone
Bet it ain't, the same in the streets now that he gone
He now in heaven on the throne exactly where he belong
Now he left millions devastated and his family mourned
Sons turn to grown men since they daddy been gone
Daughters grew, like him or not he left his family on
Even prepaid the funeral service he had in the dome
And there they came to represent, for a stand-up gent
Who walked it like he talked it, always said what he meant
Impossible to stop him, had a head like cement
Maybe now you'll appreciate a nigga like this (they might)

[Hook]

[T.I. - over Hook]
Ain't gon' be no mo', remember me how I was baby
I can see you still laughin right now, HEY!
I made it possible homie
But I die for it, it's all good man
Strong got to lead the weak! Ay

[T.I.]
If they had only knew the man outside of the hype
No matter what the situation he always try to do right
Still they gossip to told lies, used to take him for granted
Often find it hard to relate, somehow they can't understand it
Cause that respect he gon' demand, if there's a problem he handle
Look adversity in the eye, he never ran from a challenge
They tried to knock him off balance when the Feds came and got him
Did the time on his head, came home, that ain't stop him
That's why them niggas used to hate him but they girl used to jock him
Swear he had the kind of swagger made the world stop and watch him
Plus he possess so much hustle made it impossible to top him
Got better every album, haters hate to see him drop 'em
They just talk shit from a distance, when he around they playin possum
He used to scare them suckas shitless that's probably why them niggas shot him
And what it took ain't nothin else they ever could or did about it
So go on, talk shit about him, least you ain't forgot about him
I see

[Hook]

[T.I. - over Hook]
You'll see! Ain't no more of me man
Hey, hey, hey!
Enjoy, I did this man
That's how I just put the weight on my shoulders
I carry the load baby, I'm used to it
I'm built for it! AY!

[T.I.]
Wanna say sorry to my momma, King and Lil' Mama
See me go through so much drama, you could stand a lil' thunder
Never let 'em see you sweat, stay cool as a cucumber
Stay ready for whatever, make 'em know I'mma do wonders
How he died? On his feet like a man with honor
Showed you the sky was the limit, you could do whatever you wanna
That's for Bubba and Domani, Deyjah and Neek-Neek
Don't worry 'bout me, Uncle Phil and Leiah's with me
See me wit'cha granddaddy - I know you gon' miss daddy
But life ain't always a dream, and horrible shit happens
Hate I let a nigga kill me before I could quit rappin
And get to spend mo' time wit'cha, I know we'da been happy
But I had to take in them chances, you probably woulda been trappin
Long as I could keep that from happenin, ya pappy can die happy
Just keep the wind at ya back, and the sun at ya face
Remember winnin in your blood, you were born with what it take, okay?

[Hook]

[T.I. - over Hook]
Hey, that's it for me
Hey, I bet you'd love that, wouldn't you?
I did this for y'all man
You know ain't no favorite man
Man fuck this shit partner, HEY!

[Outro]
Hey y'all, with all my heart I apologize man I'm sorry
I tried, I did everythang I could man, y'knowmsayin?
There was just more of them than there was me, ya dig?
They say you can't win 'em all
But shit man, I gave them niggas hell long as I could though bruh
Heh, and you could put the money on that, HEY!

[Intro]
Ugh-ugh-ugh, ugh-ugh, ugh—ayy
Where the piano at shawty?
Y—Yea—Y—a—Yeah
Y'all ain't never seen a dope boy play the piano and rap at the same time, have you?
I'ma show you something, partner!
Bop to the left and right like this here, nigga
Come on, homie!
Dig this!

[Verse 1]
I'm 22 and a vet in the game
Say I'm, I'm super cool, still a threat at the same time
Rhyme 'bout the times I invested in 'caine
Pleasure and pain in every aspect of the game
I'm the answer to your prayers if you praying for change
So, how dare you compare us and say we the same?
When I'm, I'm climbin' the ladder, they stuck in the same mindframe
They accomplishments are nothing to gain
And visually, see, I'm outta your range
Except this rose-gold glow from my wrist to my chain
I entertain young niggas who slang
Like a picture, no frame, see, it's simple and plain
Ayy, my shit bang, spit flames, put niggas to shame
Flow so insane, lyrics sick and deranged
Now, you can't mention my city 'less you mention my name
T.I., P-I-M-P, I'm the man (Ayy, ayy)

[Hook]
(Ayy, be easy) You don't want no trouble with me
(Just be easy) The drama ain't nothing to me
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, be easy) Before you having problems, just breathe
(Ayy, be easy) Ayy, you ain't worth dying, believe me
(Just be easy) You don't want your mama to grieve
(Be easy) Well, mind your busness, don't bother the G
(Ayy, ayy, be easy) Swear you stuntin' but you frontin' to me
(Just be easy) Behind the scenes or behind your breezes
Ayy, be easy

[Verse 2]
You came in kissing ass when I came to lead
Set the standard for Atlanta, rearranged the lead
Okay, so what the fuck is fame to me?
I been popping since kindergarten, you's a lame to me
I give the niggas what they came to see
A reflection of oneself—what they aim to be
As you can see, it ain't no change in me
And you won't meet another nigga off-the-chain as me
I'm so fly, no lie, don't deny it, you felt
So inspired by my style, decided to try it yourself
But you won't meet nobody ranked as high as myself
The checks you waiting on, homes, I can sign them myself
Tote gats, dro—smoked that—now, I'm high
Seats way back in the Maybach I ride
Through the streets of the westside, I slap five
And throw dubs, show love, nigga, hate me—why?

[Hook]
(Ayy, be easy) You don't want no trouble with me
(Just be easy) The drama ain't nothing to me
(Ayy, ayy, be easy) Before you having problems, just breathe
(Ayy, be easy) Ayy, you ain't worth dying, believe me
(Just be easy) You don't want your mama to grieve
(Be easy) Well, mind your busness, don't bother the G
(Ayy, be easy) Swear you stuntin' but you frontin' to me
(Just be easy) Behind the scenes or behind your breezes
Ayy, be easy

[Intro]
Saw the drop top like the bezzles in my watch {*3X*}
Like the bezzles in my watch like the bezzles in my watch
Saw the drop top like the bezzles in my watch {*3X*}
Like the bezzles in my watch like the bezzles in my watch
Saw the drop top like the bezzles in my watch {*3X*}
Like the bezzles in my watch like the bezzles in my watch

[Verse: T.I.]
I came up bumping Eazy-E, Cube, and Dre (Scarface, OutKast what's happening niggas!)
Eightball MJG UGK
They raised me like Sonny raised C
I always made the money, money never made me
Break me what this bitch you crazy
You seen with the freaks don't think she never paid me
Pimpin get a bitch, break a bitch, hit a bitch, shake a bitch
Spit game till I make this bitch turn these tricks and get me rich
Lick his ass suck a dick bring me back my Ducats quick
Who you think you fucking with
I'm serious about this pimpin shit
All my niggas that I kick it with looking for a richer bitch
Get this bitch to take these triple pounds of weed bricks and shit
Broke bitch you get your shit
Before I get another bitch who could fix your shit
My pimpin too strong I ain't with your shit
You going to make me split your shit
Two things I ain’t seen is this UFO and a bitch I can’t get
If her eyes on the ride she’ll ride for the fuck of it

[Hook] ad libs (T.I.)
She saw the drop top like the bezzles in my watch {*3X*}
Like the bezzles in my watch like the bezzles in my watch
You saw the drop top like the bezzles in my watch {*3X*}
Like the bezzles in my watch like the bezzles in my watch

[MJG]
Whole mack load it up hard as fine blow it up
M-J-G I know you hoes ain't been exposing us
I'll cross a trick over, bag a bitch down and post her up
And slam dunk some pimpin in her sister if she close with her

[Eightball]
Lookie here
Open up the door and let a crook in here
Grab the mic and weak niggas tuck there tail and look in fear
As I bust a round with no shells from inside in myself
Lyrics like a concealed weapon sending you bitches straight to hell

[MJG]
Burning up just like in Waco, Texas
Heating up your necklace
Scorching up your afro, the devil coming at your
Ass and he hollow point at niggas who really want it
M-J- fucking G with pussy and titties on it

[Eightball]
Them bitches love when they see pimping come up in it
24 inches under somethin full of smoking tinted
Hustle hard for it keep it cause I love to spend it
Pimping love is women stop like they're deer and kiss it

[Hook] ad libs (T.I.)

[Verse: Bun B]
I came a long way from a poster posted
To la Cosa Nostra kept the toaster closer than I'm supposed to
While ya hoes approach ya
Ride like a roller coaster
Pistol whip you hold ya throat then choke you
Like I'll coach ya, croak ya, roach ya, joker, light and smoke ya (damn)
Pope of Port Arthur, I blessed the masses, stretched to Kansas
Still elementary best of classes
Good and learn'ded, earned my passes
Pack pistols just to blast it
I blast it it just to prove it, I proved the second guessers
Motherfuckers get to moving
I born into hustling I grew up tustlin, came up musclin'
Bogarted the meek and the frail but hell I put my trust in my left and right hand
Grinding threw the night
And I keep my family tight and see some paper like a white man
Balling in the night (man) we haulin' in the white (man)
Sippin' on purple Sprite and you can call it what you like
I call what the fuck I feel, play the cards they fucking deal
But we ain't sleeping till they free the Pimp and that's the fucking drill

[Hook] to fade

[Intro]
Huh
Ok, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh

[Verse 1]
I never know whether I'm living for tomorrow or dying for today
But either way I'm tryna move a hundred dimes in a day
They say that crime don't pay, but I'm gon' stay on the grind in the A, with the same ol' J's
I know the lames gon' say that I done changed, no way
I'm in the gutter everyday, tryna slang more ye'
In the middle of the trap, we hang the dro blaze
Niggas in the trap ain't changed in four days
Waiting on a page that saying the blow came
Instead of us just finding more ways to get paid
Anyway, in the fire, I done been there homie
Niggas ball, niggas die, and ain't shit fair, homie
Them crackers give you some time and get to sit there, homie
My niggas dying, I'll see you when I get there, homie
Aye, born alone, die alone in life
But right or wrong, folk it's on for life
Just be better than me

[Hook]
Shawty, the streets ain't the place to be
I'm telling you cuz it's too late for me
Ay be betta than me
Crack a slug, nuttin' better to see than young niggas wit' a felony sheet
So be betta than me
I know ya mamma waitin' faithfully on her baby to graduate ya see
You way betta than me
Betta than us, betta than this, take a chance nigga change some shit
You could be betta than me

[Verse 2]
Ay, its rules in the game son, learn it young
When they haters speak yo' name, man, burn they tongue
Never be ashamed of how ya' live or where ya' from
You stack a mill, niggas will see how far you come
Without a gun, you got somethin'll make 'em bar you son
That's a million-dollar mind, why, they niggas is dumb
Yea they gon get outta line, but they niggas is scum
They outta sight and outta mind 'til you visit the slum, stay down
Stay on the grind and yo' digits'll come
Bottom line: you gotta shine no matta what you become
They streets is 40 percent of yo mind and 5 percent muscle
10 struggle, 10 time, and 35 percent hustle
And trust if dey don't burry the scared, they bury the dead
When anticipating pistol play, be very prepared
And if you ain't, find somewhere to burry yo head
Because them hot ones from the choppas tear ya body to shreds
I said

[Hook]
Shawty, the streets ain't the place to be
I'm telling you cuz it's to late fo me
Ay be betta than me
Crack a slug nuttin betta to see then young niggas wit a felony sheet
So be betta than me
I know ya mamma waitin faithfully on her baby to graduate ya see
You way betta than me
Betta than us, betta than this, take a chance nigga change some shit
You could be betta than me

[Verse 3]
In a broke down Cadillac, ridin' high
Not many trusts in this life either shine or die
Ima live one of two ways, either grind or cry
And Ima grind it out, even if I'm dyin it out
Ain't got no mo than me, so what the fuck you lyin about
That man right there, but ain't gon be when dey start findin out
That that bullshit you be talkin ain't the real deal
That ain't you blow, them ain't yo cars so how you really live
See what you need to do is take a chilly-willy pill
Go and chill yo ass out, fo dey deal yo ass out
A bad hand from a mad man, in a mad clan
All dem otha niggas take a fall you gon take the last stand
Gnawed in, sawed in, how everybody ball
When everybody else is all in you don't know where to fall in?
Need some Flaw Henn, I'm telling you shawty
And don't be buyin none of dat bullshit sellin you shawty
And all that otha shit they talkin is irrelevant shawty
Tell 'em, show you the papa, fo dey show you the cable
You see a whole different nigga when you open dem drables
Follow hatas nuttin holy can saves us
Shawty be betta than me

[Hook]
Shawty, the streets ain't the place to be
I'm telling you cuz it's to late fo me
Ay be betta than me
Crack a slug nuttin betta to see then young niggas wit a felony sheet
So be betta than me
I know ya mamma waitin faithfully on her baby to graduate ya see
You way betta than me
Betta than us, betta than this, take a chance nigga change some shit
You could be betta than me
(Repeat 1)

[T.I. - talking]
Ay I'm working here, know what I'm saying
Try to put yourself in my shoes for a second
Its not personal I'm just sayin though

[Verse 1]
Ay look
From when the moon came out 'till the sun came up
I was supplyin' the days when where they flame up
Our mamas passing, by trying to explain us
Pissing in the bushes like they never house trained us
But, try to understand thats how we came up
You get to know us, you'll love us but you can't change us (naw)
Really we rather be rich and famous
But in the mean time were forced to slang dust
'Dro or crack cocaine, Penicillin to Rogaine
Ecstacy, Viagra, whatever'll get the dough mayne
I'm tired of people misrepresenting my domain
Oh you think we out here killing for nothing, hustlin for no gain (picture that)

[Chorus] (sample playing in the background)
Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't wanna make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job

[Verse 2]
I don't know if you don't know, don't care or can't see
Every time something up in the hood, it ain't me
And I ain't always up to no good and on the creep
So you ain't always gotta pass through the hood without speaking (how you doin'?)
We ain't out here threatening your lives, raping your children
We just out here staying alive, making a million (you know)
Working hard, trying to survive chasing a million
You hear us talking loud, just think of us as chameleons
Adapting to situations, but accusations of stealing
And burglarizing your house, I mean you just hurting my feelings
We got lives, we wanna live nice too
We got moms, dads, wives, kids just like you
But our options are few, it's hell in high school
When your helping with the rent lights and the gas bill too
So before you go judging us loving us won't hurt
When you're under 25, staying alive's hard work

[Chorus] (sample playing in the background)
Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't wanna make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job

[Verse 3]
And for you to see what I'm saying, open eyes will help
If you could think about somebody besides yourself
Why you pointing fingers at me, analyze yourself
Quit all that chastising and try to provide some help
Instead of calling the law and busting my balls
With all due respect, we don't even be fucking with y'all (maan)
And we can't help it cause it is like this
We don't like it no more than you that we live like this
Always stuck in the grind, summertime to wintertime
Cutting school to sell fifty dimes by dinner time
See everything we know we learned from the streets
Since thirteen I've been hustling and earning my keep

[Chorus] (sample playing in the background)
Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't wanna make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job

[Intro]
Aye, uh-uh, uh, aye
Aye, what's happenin'?
Ye-ye, ye-ye-yeah
That's right, one time for your mind
What's happening, pimp?
This for all my niggas who think they hard
Ok, nigga, I'll tell you what's hard, pimp
(What's hard pimp?)
Going about your day, nigga, losing your life at the end of it
Nigga, that's what's hard, nigga
(Minding my muthafuckin' business, that shit was fucked up)
Let me tell you a story about the last day I lived in my life
(How it happened, man?)

[Verse]
I'm in a '96 Impala with the gat in my lap
Annihilating any nigga trying to work in my trap
I have the feds got me tapped
So to keep 'em off of my back
I got a crib in the trap and a crib to relax
Now my indictment was a secret, and that's the way that they keep it
If I ain't have a ho giving head to the feds coming back telling me exactly what they said
I'm a dead man walking
Waiting on time in jail
But I'll die before I let 'em stop my mail
Long as I got another ounce to sell
What the hell, I'mma bail?
Grab my scale
Get another ki and I'mma slang my yayo
Everyday it feel like they on my trail
Look them in the face say, "Fuck they jail"
Niggas on the westside can't re-up because it's a drought
So I check the crack house
Damn, it sold out
Now back to the crib, so I can check this stash
Ain't sure about how much dope I had
Got a couple kis in the safe right now
Weigh it up, cook it up, then chop it down
Now I'm ready to go and pick up my fetti
But before I leave the house I can't dip without grabbin my G's
And my keys to my brand new V, put 'em in pocket
So my gat–blue jeans, Desert Eag'
Nigga, you holler 'bout freeze
Put this red dot to your ass and squeeze
Now I'm dippin back to the SWAT
With the 4-4 and a plastic Glock
Turned around the corner and I had to stop
Couldn't trap, before me it was the cops
Sit and watch, but I still ain't scared
Mac Boney and 'em must have fled
Only cops is I fear is the feds
On my car flashing blue and red
Damn there they go, now it's time to dip
Got the 4-4 right my hip
9 millimeter with an extra clip
That's what you niggas get fucking 'round with TIP
Busting at 'em, and cussing at 'em, but ain't no shaking 'em
Them bullets that they was busting at me, my vest was taking 'em
Making them pigs fall in pain
Turned around cause one called my name
Took a hot one to the brain
Yeah, I died, but long live the game

[Ad-Libs]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
You think them niggas is hot
Well shawty look what I got
(nigga look what I got)
You think I'm lying nigga
Look what I got
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Shawty look what I got
Ay, pimpin look what I got
Look what I got
My nigga look what I got

[Verse 1]
Big wheels still spin when I stop
Presidential roll, gold rolex watch
With no rocks
I save them for the pinky
Keep you niggas blinkin'
He ain't wearin' platinum, Naw
But I keep you niggas thinking
Mink seats sure to keep a nigga sinkin'
Swear he ain't slangin'
But I know that nigga creepin'
Got a condo, in Orlando
For the weekend
Hoes be so crunk in the club
We gotta sneak in
No more room in the V.I.P
They payin' just to peek in
When they leave
They be lookin in a car
They can't even see in
And that's just the
Be-gin-ning
In the city that he in
He was rappin' in the cafeteria
But now that nigga serious
Heard he got a CL, a EXT on Spreewells
Several Chevy's on 24's
(Hold up), "how many records he sell?"
Man I don't know
But he got a label now
Them boys, the PSC (Hell)
I heard Atlantic gave 'em a deal for
2 or 3 mill. (Ay, shawty)
(For real, nigga?)

[Hook]
Look what I got
A old school, a truck and a drop
So next time you think them niggas is hot
Shawty, look what I got
The respect of the niggas and G's
So next time you say them niggas is G's
You probably lookin' at me
A what, we ballin'
Bought the bar for the broads
So next time you think them niggas is hard
Shawty, look at the squad
I'm buyin' yachts, have the streets on lock
So next time you think yo' peeps on top
Pimpin, look what I got

[Verse 2]
I'm well known in the hood
Like the dope man phone number
Roll anything I can throw some 24's under
Nigga talk bad 'bout the man
But I shole wonder
Why the dope boys fuck with 'em
And the hoes love 'em
Very little promotions on this album
Never heard of 'em
But it's jammin' like the fuck
Was jumpin' out the stores
Cause I was born in the raid
And I'm made in the streets
I done played in the days
In the shade in the streets
I say I rapped in the trap
With the best in the streets
Shot craps in the back
You know the rest, nigga please
You doin' business with me
You best invest in some skis
I sell slopes of snow
I don't fuck with little blow nigga
Got 80 k's, it's gone take a little more (To what?)
To double up and bring it back
And make a little more (You movin' slow)
And movin slow, now what you take a nigga for?
I'mma cock hammers and 44's
And nail yo ass to the floor
And I ain't braggin', I'm just letting niggas know
Cause the media and radio can get a nigga so
Fucked up
Comparin' me to this nigga lil' flow
I do a song
Fuck up they whole little show (So, shawty)

[Hook]

[Intro]
Huh, Hell naww, I can't quit
Hell naww, man, we got too much money to be getting shot up
Stay down, Grand Hustle
Ugh

[Verse 1]
Look, I'm this far from being a star and just that close to quitting
I never should've came close to missing
But I want to be a musician, pimpin', not a politician
Listen, feel my position, it's a rough transition
Plus, I'm way too deep in the game to be trying to change
For fortune and fame and glamour, I could be in the slammer
Or six feet up under Atlanta—it's a blessing to breathe
I walk the streets with seven felonies, I'm blessed to be free
Long as somebody up in Heaven who keep blessing a G
T.I.P.'ll still be blessing CDs, so, haters, you can see these
'Cause I'm back now with something to prove
Everything to gain, pimpin', nothing to lose
I ought to start smacking niggas when it's nothing to do
They too big? Shoot them in the leg and even the odds
('Cause you ain't hard) 'less you ran with Cap and C-Rod
Trapped with K.T. and robbed with J.R.
Fucked hoes with D.P., broke bread with J.G.
Switched labels like K.P.
(Who the fuck did all that, pimp?) Me
Even though I'd rather go back to slanging drugs and shit
It's a gang of niggas and bitches really love this shit

[Hook: T.I.]
I can't quit
Even though polices hate I'm legit
And rappers hate it cause they know I'm the shit
Hell naww, I can't quit
Some niggas hating on the money I'm getting
Most of them hate it 'cause I'm fucking they bitches
Nah, pimpin', I can't quit
Some niggas hating on the rocks and the rings
Some of them hate 'cause they don't think I'm the King
Hell naww, I can't quit
People hate it when you better than them
They ain't hating? Start worrying, then
Ayy, I'm winning, I can't quit

[Verse 2: T.I.]
It's been... ten years, an album, and two deals
For real, we all know I should have sold two mil', at least
It's all good, though, I flow for the streets
I do it for y'all, every weekend—you see who in the mall
Who's still in the trap signing your shirts, giving you dap
Kicking it with you, then, get you and your folk in the club
Posing for pictures with girls, give them kisses and hugs
Pouring out liquor at shows, passing niggas the dro
One of the realest rappers niggas'll know
But niggas be hating to the point where they be calling the station ("Don't play his record")
But they respect it 'cause I'm ready and focused
And I see they petty and bogus—I want you to know this
But most of you notice: Niggas in the game ain't real
Got to stay selling records 'cause the fame ain't shit
And fuck the units that they name'll sell
It'll break your heart to see your favorite rappers lame as hell
(Fuck them niggas! I'm the true and living!)

[Hook: T.I.]
I can't quit
Even though polices hate I'm legit
And rappers hate it 'cause they know I'm the shit
Hell naww, I can't quit
Some niggas hating on the money I'm getting
Most of them hate it 'cause I'm fucking they bitches
Nah, pimpin', I can't quit
Some niggas hating on the rocks and the rings
Some of them hate 'cause they don't think I'm the King
Hell naww, I can't quit
People hate it when you better than them
They ain't hating? Start worrying, then
Ayy, I'm winning, I can't quit

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Ayy, you can please some of the people some of the time
With some of your rhymes; but they might not like one of them lines
(I tell you what) I'll let you criticize me one at a time
Those of you who think I'm too cocky, get in front of the line
Whether you don't like my ego or my arrogant flow
Don't like that when you say I'm tight, I say, "I already know"
Don't like how I was talking shit before my album could blow (Oh)
Like I need to calm it down, be more like the average Joe?
So, fuck you, them thoughts, and that lil' house you think I'm in
Get a Benz—I'll value your opinion then
Think I give a fuck how many times my record spins?
Fuck what you recommend, I'm back again!

[Hook: T.I.]
Look, pimpin', I can't quit
Even though polices hate I'm legit
And rappers hate it 'cause they know I'm the shit
Hell naww, I can't quit
Some niggas hating on the money I'm getting
Most of them hate it 'cause I'm fucking they bitches
Nah, pimpin', I can't quit
Some niggas hating on the rocks and the rings
Some of them hate 'cause they don't think I'm the King
Hell naww, I can't quit
People hate it when you better than them
They ain't hating? Start worrying, then
Ayy, I'm winning, I can't quit

[Verse 1]
I'm either running for my life or I'm just waiting to die
I'm the supplier of the fire if you're chasing a high
It's never when or why; it's the way that he die
Did he stand like a man 'til the day that he die?
Or was he reaching for guns or trying to run
Or was he outside on the lawn in front of his son
And if you running your mouth you can die in the slum
'Cause in the south where I'm from they dying for crumbs
You can die for your partners or die for your moms
Or you could die cause your nigga just heard the alarm, just stealing
Or die in a plane—they say it's a bomb
When they run it into a tower—they just say it's Saddam
Screaming Allah the moment that it's hitting the building
With total disregard for all men women and children
See niggas get killed when people mix they money with feelings
I'm filling my money up in the wall some in the ceiling
I'm just one of the millions of niggas who bucking
It's a war going on and they killing for nothing
We were in denial all awhile they where flicking the buttons
I'd rather be dying for something instead of living for nothing
End of discussion

[Hook]
Hey, ain't no more talk
Just start killing niggas off till ain't no more chalk
Or no mo' tape, to outline no mo' scenes
Or no mo' crimes, no mo' dying for no mo' fiends
Or no mo' rims and thing's and no mo' green
And no mo' chains and ring's that go bling bling
And no mo' passionate rapping and so it seems
It's just these talent less rappers they all acting
And I know, so ain't no mo' talk
Just start killing niggas off till ain't no mo' chalk
Or no mo' tape, to outline no mo' scenes
Or no mo' crimes, no mo' dying for no mo' phenes
Or no mo' rims and thing's and no mo' green
And no mo' chains and ring's that go bling bling
And no mo' passionate rapping and so it seems
It's just these talent less rappers they all acting
And I know

[Verse 2]
Yeah they said it wasn't no mo' green for no mo' grind
No mo' room for no mo' kings and no more crown to be given but by no means
Am I any more conceited than this game needed
And if I say it believe it, I'm running the region, you see it
Popping and blowing, I'm stopping I'm going
I'm just, telling, you knowing, you sleeping, or hating
And I don't care what you niggas is thinking or saying
About, you know who, the one who say you know what, do you know where
But you the best cuz you goin' care
Now I ain't think so either, but we know greed'll make ya
Do strange thang's if we ain't people
And if ya, busting bout nothing, than we ain't equal
You just cussing for nothing and poisoning people
And it's embarrassing laughing at all of your songs
And you can hate me right now but you'll miss me 'fore long, when I'm gone

[Hook]

[Rap Verse: T.I.] + (T.I.P. alter ego)
I wanna talk to you shawty (Why?)
Cause you be trippin' sometimes
(Man I'm just trying stay true to what I say in my rhymes)
It ain't a doubt in my mind, but you got a lot on the line

(Man but they be tryin' me shawty)

More heart than these niggas (Yeah)

(Ay man fuck these niggas I'm from Bankhead and I don't know where you stayed at)

Be thinkin' 'bout standin' outside in the sunshine (Ho)
Watchin' nigga's heads get buck for cuttin' the lunchline

(I'm really glad we had a chance to sit it down and rap a tad)
(I admit you had a couple points, sometimes I act a ass)
Ay but it is so important to keep it real though just like ya said
No record deal, no amount of mil' shall go to our head
(And with that said can't nobody tell us shit, so fuck the hatin')
How many niggas real enough to stand and give theyself a straightenin'?

[Intro: T.I.]
Ayy, man, I still got them things

[Hook: T.I.]
Ayy, this a trap (C'mon)
This ain't no album, this ain't no game
This a trap (Trap music)
This ain't no album, this ain't no game
This a trap (Trap music)
This ain't no album, this ain't no game

This ain't no album, this ain't no game
This a trap (Trap music)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ayy, welcome back to the trap, niggas back in the trap
With another heavy Chevy, big dope boys and trap niggas
All you rap niggas roll out, I trap when it's cold out
Wack niggas flying, but I stay down 'til I'm sold out
We the sound underground, like I'm rapping in a dope house
Might as well be, the way the feds got me scoped out
Ayy, but fuck 'em! Let my nuts hang, block's hot, I does 'caine
Cook it 'til it bubble, double, fast as a Mustang
I know you thinking, "Fuck, man, lil' shawty tough, man"
Been a long time since a nigga from Atlanta spit this much game
Ayy, that's a rare few of real niggas, so how could they give a nigga
The feeling that a real nigga get around a real nigga?
All they do is steal niggas' ideas and run with 'em
Holler something simple, talking 'bout the hood, fake like they hung in 'em
I got a million rhymes, want 'em? Come get 'em
What beef? These pussy niggas? Man, I'm just having fun with 'em

[Hook: T.I.]
Ayy, this a trap (C'mon)
This ain't no album, this ain't no game
This a trap (Trap music)
This ain't no album, this ain't no game
This a trap (Trap music)
This ain't no album, this ain't no game
This a trap (Trap music)
This ain't no album, this ain't no game

This ain't no album, this ain't no game
This a trap (Trap music)
This ain't no album, this ain't no game
This a trap (Trap music)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2: Mac Boney]
Still telling niggas, I ain't holding, I ain't folding
When the 12 hit the corner, I ain't rolling, I ain't rolling
Keep the coke stretched out like Carl Lewis' hamstrings
Stepped-on like I'm working with the dance team
Triple-beam ain't seen what I do to a ounce of blow
The wet man on my pager like, "I'll pay you folks to whip some more"
I'm doper than the pure itself, I cook it all up by myself
I give my niggas recipes so they can turn to chefs theyself
They love the work, that's why I keep 'em coming like collection plates
We flip the cake then move this shit from Georgia, baby, state to state
Intimidate niggas in the city who been moving weight
Your pockets losing weight, they fuck with us 'cause you been known to hate
Demonstrate the way we turned the drought out in '98
It started out in '95, started out with nicks and dimes
Nigga, you done lost your mind, thinking you could set up shop
Pimpin', I respect the grind, let's take it to another block

[Hook: T.I.]
Ayy, this a trap (C'mon)
This ain't no album, this ain't no game
This a trap (Trap music)
This ain't no album, this ain't no game
This a trap (Trap music)
This ain't no album, this ain't no game
This a trap (Trap music)
This ain't no album, this ain't no game
This a trap (Trap music)
This ain't no album, this ain't no game
Nigga, this a trap (Trap music)
This ain't no album, this ain't no game
This a trap (Trap music)
This ain't no album, this ain't no game
This a trap music

[Skit: T.I. & Mac Boney]
Twelve! Let's go, man!
Let's go!
Let's go!
That damn dog!
Man, follow me. Follow me, shawty.
Let's hit it!
Hit the cut, pimp! Hit the cut!
Watch out, now!
Fence! Let's go, let's go!
Shit! Damn!
Aight, fuck it! C'mon!

[*BEAT SWITCH*]

[Spoken: T.I.]
Pimp Squad, shawty

[Verse 3: T.I.]
A nigga still in the trap when the spot'll seem hot
With the mayonnaise jar and the collard-green pot
On a lot of straight Hen' and a lot of green pot
Competition in a rage, like, "he gotta be stopped"
Well, maybe I will be, but probably not
Oh, what the bloodclaat—he try, knock 'im out of he socks
Listen to I'm Serious, thinking, "How did he not ...
End up way up on the top of the chart?"
That's because where I was, see, you gotta be pop
If you really want to pop, and I rather be dropped
Listen, Pops, want to know a little more about rap?
First rule: If it's real, it ain't just a record deal
It's a trap!

[Intro] (T.I.)
Want to be your man, please...tell you why
(I know what y'all thinking)
Doop doop doop doop doop doop
(First he can't be my man, now he want to be my man)
(I wish this nigga make his mind up)
Can't live my life...tell you why
(All my niggas man we gonna have be 21 bout this shit you know)
Oh baby, oh baby
(We gonna step out the track for one sec, one sec)

[Verse 1]
Now what I got to say, seal with a kiss
Know I can't be your man why I feel like this
What I need with a woman when I live like this
Different chicks running in and out the crib like this
Maybe five, maybe six, seven, eight'll be enough
Plus the twins make ten but for you I give it up
Set times to the side just for us to live it up
Walking out of Ralph Lauren, purple label linen, yuh
It's hard for me to discuss what I envisioned for us
Lots of trust, and a crib worth a couple million plus
So what if I got a pass, labelled a dirt bag
By the many hearts I broken and women I hurt bad
Might I add Christian Dior and fur jackets
A part of the package, but still far from a marriage
It's easy to lose balance when hearts just start carin
With the attractions apparent, its hard to stop starin

[Hook]
Hey baby let me tell you sumthin, come here I need to tell you sumthin
(Tell you why)
Hey shorty let me tell you sumthin, wanna talk need to tell you sumthin
(doop doop doop doop doop doop doop)
Lil mama let me tell you sumthin, I wanna tell you sumthin
(Can't live my life...without you)
Hey baby let me tell you sumthin, Shorty I've been meanin to tell you sumthin
(Oh baby, oh baby)

[Verse 2]
If I can get a little bit of your time, shorty
I got some shit I want to get off my mind, and I know
You get enough of niggas hollerin ya fine (hey
Ask...ask ya friend man, man I got this)
Introductions seem to bug you, them partnas of mine
My bad, I know you think I'm probably lyin
Then I'mma stop to conversate, relates all of ya time...man
Look, but half of that shit is all in ya mind
Say you should follow your heart and I'm followin' mine
But anyway, when I see yo' face
Im thinking three or four days in Montego Bay
At the Half Moon, but I know she gon' say
I already have too many hoes, I know
But if I had you, all the dough I'd blow
On eleven karat pink stones trillion bows
I wanna be the reason why you showing ya teeth
Without a worry in the world when you rolling with me

[Hook]

{*Roger Troutman's - "I Want To Be Your Man" plays*}

[Intro: Jay-Z Sample, Swizz Beatz & T.I.]
Woo! Bring 'em out, bring 'em out— Bring 'em out, bring 'em out—
It's hard to yell when the bar-rel's in your mouth (Come on, Swizzy!)
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out (Ayy, Swizz Beatz)
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out (Yeah, T.I.)
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out (Ayy, A-T-L!)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
T-I-P, coming live from the VIP
Heard the nightlife lost life without me
Both the feds and the state wanna see bout me
The whole city got biz-zerk, he got three
That other nigga got a hit, but shawty, he not me (Naw)
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
The King back now, hoes don't even know how to act now
Hit the club, strippers getting naked 'fore I sat down
Still balling, money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road, doing shows, putting my mack down
Mississippi to Philly, Albuquerque to Chatt-Town

[Chorus: T.I. & Jay-Z]
I got the crowd yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all my hot girls yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, from the back, they yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Once again, what other rap nigga hood-er than this?
I got rich, and I'm still on some hooligan shit
You be rapping 'bout blow—I was moving the shit
You talking 'bout shooting out, and I was doing the shit
If I hit you in the face, you gon' be suing and shit
And if I catch another case I know I'll truly be missed, so I'ma—
Keep a cool head, stay out of the news
And show these other rappers it's bedtime (Bedtime)
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed-out, hard-top Carrera to shine
I got some time, it ain't shit, 'cause I get better with time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine?

[Chorus: T.I. & Jay-Z]
I got a packed house yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all my hot girls yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, from the back, they yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Uh-y-yeah! Mic check, one-two, one-two
You wanna beef with the King? What is you' gon do?
Will you show up on the scene with two guns drew?
Or you and your friend and play a little two-on-two?
If you knew half of what I knew, then you'd be hitting the deck
I got a tool and a vest—I can get some respect
I'ma make it hard for a sucker nigga to flex
Show thim this ain't the squad for a nigga to test
Pimp, my nuts too large, and we way too fresh
Work well with nines, AK's, and Tecs
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess
You wanna beef, nigga? Bring your best

[Chorus: T.I. & Jay-Z]
'Cause we be standing in your front yard yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all my hot girls yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, from the back, they yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
We in your front yard yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all my hotgirls yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all the dope boys ellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, from the back they yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

[Break: Swizz Beatz]
Hands in the air now!
Hands in the air now!
Hands-hands in the-in the air-air now!
Hands in the air now!
Put y'all hands in the air now!
Hands in the air now!
Hands-hands in the-in the air-air now!
Hands in the air now!

[Hook: T.I., Swizz Beatz, Jay-Z]
I can't hear you! (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Grand Hustle! Swizz Beatz! (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
I can't hear you! T.I. (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

[Outro Hook: Swizz Beatz & Jay-Z]
Woo! You just heard the sounds
Of the King of the South, T.I.
I go by the name of Swizz Beatz, the Monster
I need y'all to rewind this and play this from the top!
Oww! (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Oww! (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Oww! (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
We on fire tonight! Come on! (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

[Outro: T.I.]
That shit's crazy

[Intro: T.I.]
Hey, Hey, Hey

[Hook: T.I. & Pharrell Williams]
But she's a freak though
She got angel eyes, with the baby face
But she's a freak though
I want my momma and daddy to meet her, maybe have my name
But she's a freak though
They keep talking about you
Because they can't keep up with your pace
You're my, super freak, super freak
You're my, super freak

[Verse 1: T.I.]
My momma taught me, everything fine ain't the finest
And everything that shine ain't a diamond
They say that change come wit time and I'm finding
That most bitches take your kindness for blindness
Yeah it feel good laying her beside you
Diggin deep, ol' nine up beside you
But we can't kick out in public, gotta hide you
Cause all my partnaz in the hood done tried you
It's true that you can't turn a ho into a house wife
Well listen shorty maybe I don't want a house wife
They say that you a freak I'm thinking that they bout right
Because that pussy's so good and your mouth tight
A pretty face, slim waist, and her stout nice
Juicy ass that them niggas in the south like
She super sexy, got a nigga thinking bout a wife
Wearing all white, being wit her for life

[Hook: T.I. & Pharrell Williams]
But she's a freak though
She got angel eyes, with the baby face
But she's a freak though
I want my momma and daddy to meet her, maybe have my name
But she's a freak though
They keep talking about you
Because they can't keep up with your pace
You're my, super freak, super freak
You're my, super freak

[Verse 2: T.I.]
The main thing making niggas judge you
Is the same thing that make me wanna love you
From the smell of ya hair, I wanna hug you
To the way you yell "give it to me" when I fuck you
Plus you ain't tripping off a nigga cause he thuggin
That's why I'm twice as happy as relationships that wasn't
But my partna say you trickin wit his cousin
But nevermind, I don't listen they be buggin
They find it hard to understand how could T.I.P. love
This girl, when her man is out at strip clubs
Maybe cause T.I.P. girls leaving wit girls
And in the morning they'll be waking up with six girls
They don't know we more like homies when we pick girls
Why you worried bout it, he ain't gotta make you his girl
Fuck what he think about you, I think you the shit girl
Make me wanna bring another kid in the world

[Hook: T.I. & Pharrell Williams]
But she's a freak though
She got angel eyes, with the baby face
But she's a freak though
I want my momma and daddy to meet her, maybe have my name
But she's a freak though
They keep talking about you
Because they can't keep up with your pace
You're my, super freak, super freak
You're my, super freak

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Now I been told every nigga in the streets know
She ain't nothing but a freak ho
But when I look in her pretty eyes, I don't see it though
Now she done showed me some shit that I ain't seen before
But what we do behind closed doors is for me to know
All in all I've decided I'm a keep her though
I'm a fucking grown man, what I'm creeping for?
Just try me by the four, that's what I'm toting heaters for
I'd die by that for her a real good reason though
That's how I feel, let my partnaz and my momma know
Keep it real, all the disrespect has got to go
I disrespect, she is selfish, she don't hide it
Though she may have been a tad misguided
All she need is a little affection, a lot of direction
A nigga wit a constant erection
And I done wasted plenty time contemplating second guessing
Procrastinating, I wanna buy a ring and pop the question

[Hook: T.I. & Pharrell Williams]
But she's a freak though
She got angel eyes, with the baby face
But she's a freak though
I want my momma and daddy to meet her, maybe have my name
But she's a freak though
They keep talking about you
Because they can't keep up with your pace
You're my, super freak, super freak
You're my, super freak

[Intro: T.I.]
Ayy, I wanna see you dance like them girls in that Tip Drill video... (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ayy, let me see you get loose
Get loose, get loose, get loose
Ayy, shawty, you can get loose
Get loose, get loose

[Chorus: T.I.]
Ayy, shawty, bust it open for me, let me see you get loose
If you really wanna show me that you love me, get loose
No Grey Goose, if you don't get loose
Get up out the coupe if you won't get loose
Bend it over, reach for yo' toe, get loose
Hold on to the pole, drop it low and get loose
No x-o if you don't wanna get loose
No more dro unless you gonna get loose

[Verse 1: T.I.]
My potnas in the club and we chillin' to the max
Poppin' bottles, blowin' money, we ain't learn how to act
All in the V.I.P. spendin' four or five stacks
You can tell it's T.I.P. from how I bend my hat
Send the waitress to the bar but she comin' right back
Bet a shot of x-o'll get you on the right track
You got yo' girl with you, better hold her hand, I'm a mack on attack
Turn yo' head and she bound to get snatched
Give the dick to her once, get her hooked like crack
Takin' cum in the face, yeah, I like it like that
Holdin' on to her waist while I hit it from the back
If she come wit' *Pussy Pumper* she ain't never comin' back
Rough sex, talkin' dirty, yeah, she into all that
Got a movie that'll prove that what I'm sayin' is all fact
Bra and panties all black and some real tall stacks
Suckin' titties, eatin' cat, shot her off the meat rack

[Chorus: T.I.]
Ayy, shawty, bust it open for me, let me see you get loose
If you really wanna show me that you love me, get loose
No Grey Goose, if you don't get loose
Get up out the coupe if you won't get loose
Bend it over, reach for yo' toe, get loose
Hold on to the pole, drop it low and get loose
No x-o if you don't wanna get loose
No more dro unless you gonna get loose

[Verse 2: Nelly]
Let me see you drop it down, get that eagle on, girl
Ain't no fuckin' way I'm leavin' here alone, girl
Money ain't a thang to the uncut 'caine
Baby, I can make a mill' if I rap or if I sing
Done tryin' to ball, ma, I own a damn team
Even with a noose nigga still can't hang
Let me tell you who I'm is
Lunatic, man, straight up out the heartland
Nine on my right, ten more karats on my other hand
In different colors, man, worth a couple-hundred grand
Damn, mama, how you do that there?
How yo' waist stay still, but you move that there?
Ain't got a clue right there
Seen a lotta ass poppin', but that's new right there
You invited to the house ma, you and yo crew right there
Check it, okay, let's have some fun
I got four G's and five five G's in one

[Chorus: T.I.]
Ayy, shawty, bust it open for me, let me see you get loose
If you really wanna show me that you love me, get loose
No Grey Goose, if you don't get loose
Get up out the coupe if you won't get loose
Bend it over, reach for yo' toe, get loose
Hold on to the pole, drop it low and get loose
No x-o if you don't wanna get loose
No more dro unless you gonna get loose

[Verse 3: T.I.]
You ready to get loose
Shawty better be sittin' on them leather seats
If not, pat yo' feet on the concrete merrily
Freak by choice, not force, I would never be
Charged with a rape, if she say no, I'ma let her be
Why should I let that worry me? Too many bitches cherish me
Pimp 'til I die, be a player 'til they bury me
Renegade, I'ma keep it pimpin', I ain't finna play
Anyway, I can hit the baddest bitches any day
Slept with the best, I ain't gotta flex
Got yo' girl stretched out, pullin' up her dress
Checkin' out her spread and I am impressed
G-strings right in the middle of them wet
Her girlfriends with her and all of them next
I passed them a bottle, gave all of them X
Havin' *Pussy Pumper*, so all them expect
The best sex, and that's what all of them get

[Chorus: T.I.]
Ayy, shawty, bust it open for me, let me see you get loose
If you really wanna show me that you love me, get loose
No Grey Goose, if you don't get loose
Get up out the coupe if you won't get loose
Bend it over, reach for yo' toe, get loose
Hold on to the pole, drop it low and get loose
No x-o if you don't wanna get loose
No more dro unless you gonna get loose

[Outro: Jazze Pha]
Woooo weeee
Ladies and gentleman
This is a Jazze Phinzell, producshinzell
T.I., Nelly Nell, Phizzle Phizzle...
Grand Hustle, sho' nuff
Get loose

[Intro - T.I. talking]
As you see the O.G.s from Grand Hustle done laid it down again
T.I.P. shawty
Hey yo, this for all my homegirls like to see a baller do his thing
Get ya shit together come on
All the eight, nines, and dimes
I'd like to welcome y'all to the best time of ya life
Ya understand that
All the stones is real
And it's all chrome on the wheels, ya know
Anything less is uncivilized

[Verse 1 - T.I.]
Pull up to the club, lift both doors up
Hopped out clean and yo ho chose us
Walked in the door, make the show hold up
Cause my neck and my bracelet is so froze up
The kind of stones bitches wanna see close up
So we don't approach them, they come and approach us
Roll the dro up then go post up
Look down with the west finna go sho' nuff
In the V.I.P. and all eyes on us
Hoes chill, poppin' pills blowin' dro no dust
What cha say, got a man so what
I don't know him baby and he don't know her
I got a new Phantom and my own chauffeur
Ya think ya finna be thinkin' 'bout him, no sir
Probably prefer to tell ya man good night
Unless you don't wanna know what the good life look like

[Hook - Lil' Kim, T.I.]

[Lil' Kim]
If you ain't gettin' money good night
I know what a broke nigga look like
When ya ridin' in ya wheels get ya shit together
Boy them diamonds ain't real, get ya shit together

[T.I.]
Now we can ball seven days, six nights
If tht head and that pussy hit right
Hey, match ya panties with ya bras get ya shit together
Go get ya hair and nails done get ya shit together

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
Hey, I'm off the scene with Louis the thirteenth
Chains swings to my jeans, and my T-shirt clean
In case you been researching, I'm the King
With a style as mean as the Earth seem
Chest on ice, and my wrist on gleam
30 karats in the ring, money ain't no thing
You think I'm playin' but I ain't joking
The dro king, if it ain't purple, I ain't smoking
Rubberband bank rolls, fifty thousand dollar cheddar knots
Try to shine, is you out your mind, boy you better not
I walk around with more money than you ever got
Shrewd attitude like I never had to sell a rock
Shawty I can get you in whatever spot
Backstage, front row, what I got to front for
I'm getting bored, don't even know what I stunt for
Got a lot of rides, what it hurt to cop one more

[Hook - Lil' Kim, T.I.]

[Verse 3 - T.I.]
To all my hot girls, if you wanna come chill
Or roll on chrome wheels, let me tell you what it is
We fixin' throw a little party at the crib
Where the floors tricked out and the rooms like ill
The basement's cool, but the pools unreal
Where that millionaire lives, shit remains concealled
So pop a pill, put on your blindfold
I'm hitting the dance floor, and grab eighty-nine more
Let em' know we on the way where they been trying to go
I knew I had em' when they asked me "What kind of diamonds are those"
Headed to the spot pouring double shots of XO
Play the "Love Below" ane watch'em undress slow
Flicks on the flat screen, make em' want to "Get Low"
And spit shine this dick of mine until it gets swole
When they kick it with the king, they don't wanna let go
So whatcha gonna tell a nigga, when he tell ya "Let's Go"

[Hook x2 - Lil' Kim, T.I.]

[Hook] 2X
Don't hate me shawty
But even if you hate me shawty
I still love you
And now I only wish that you could
See that my intentions were good
I still love you

[Verse 1]
Forgave me once, forgave me twice, forgave me three times
I stayed lyin', you stayed down in the meantime
Had my son and turned around and had another one
I broke yo heart when I told you bout the other one
I stay in trouble ha? Ain't got too much to lose
Knew I could loose it all but never thought of losin' you
Eleven years ago I still regret me choosin' you
Meetin' you, pursuin' you and doin' you in '92
You fixed plates, showed yo face at every courtdate
And all you wanted me to do was call when I was out late
How could I let you go? I thought I knew it all
When you deserved the best and more, you been through it all
You think I sold yo dreams, but what I say I mean
Just take it to consideration, I was 17
I'm still the same man, just had a change of plan
Never ask you back and fuck a wedding band
But I still love you
Repeat Chorus 1 w/ ad libs

[Verse 2]
Went from resentin' you, hatin' you, now I'm missin' you
On the realest shit I ever dropped, dissin' pops
I never even thought, to ask my mom what happened
Just knew that you was livin' in Manhattan and I was trappin'
We never had a chance, we was in different states
But all forgiven, you was human and we make mistakes
You tried to make it up, but shit, you couldn't pay enough
You sent me tons of toys and clothes thinkin' you gave enough
But it wasn't though, and you wasn't there
That's all I knew, so I grew up thinkin' you ain't care
I know it wasn't fair, but ay, it wasn't fun
But now what's done is done, no matter wha, I'm still yo son
I could care less if none of yo other children come
I'mma be right there prayin' you live to be a million one
Finally I understand, hustlin', livin' fast
Tryin' to get the cash and settle down and be a dad
You probably never knew, cuz hey, I never said it
But pops, I'm just like you, I'm stubborn and I'm hardheaded
But now you dead in the ground, no meanin' tellin' you now
But all I wanted was for you to be proud
I still love you

[Hook]
Don't hate me shawty
If I ain't told you lately shawty
I still love you
Now I only wish that I could
See that yo intentions were good
I still love you
Don't hate me shawty
Please don't hate me shawty
Ay, I still love you
And now I only wish that I could
See that yo intentions were good
(Watch yo boy, shawty)

[Verse 3]
How could I criticize my daddy on that last verse
Lookin' at my own dirt, you got some nerve
But be that as it may, I got some shit to say
It's been a secret, I can't keep it for another day
I got a lil' girl, not just two lil' boys
And that's been killin' me inside, eatin' me alive
And I can't find the words, nor the nouns or verbs
To express whachu deserve, girl you worth the world
But I'm a man and I ain't perfect, if you hear me now
I'll tell you wha had happened, when, why, where and how
Me and yo mama met, we kinda kicked it off
But we wasn't 'posed to have a baby, we just chillin' out
We had a lot in common, almost the same signs
Same goals, said thangs at the same time
But then we destroyed the situation like the a changed mind
How could I look her in her eyes and holla "Dat ain't mine"
Her stomach gettin' bigger, and time is gettin' close
Six, seven, eight, nine months and I ain't told mah folks
Not just messiah mama, hell, I had told yo granny
Three kids in two years, baby, daddy panicked
But I ain't ashamed of you, I'm more ashamed of me
It's not at all yo fault, you'd be better off blamin' me
But now I realize, where the problem lies
Forgive me babygirl, I apologize
And I still love you

[Hook] 2X
Don't hate me shawty
Please don't hate me shawty
Cuz I still love you
Now I only wish that you could
See that my intentions were good

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Diamonds in my bracelet shine like a Kodak flash
Just motivation for these freaky hoes to show that ass nigga
I pop tags on a throwback fast
Nigga please, I'm wearin' these when I cut my grass... freeze
All you niggas wanna touch my cash
The 40 cal's in the stash, and when I touch I blast
Televison's in the dash, suede roof in the coupe
I'm the one nigga, young niggas knew is the truth
And the dumb niggas I ain't done provin' it to
Come with a clique of guerillas like I hung at a zoo
I gotta bitch to pull bitches like she one of the crew
Now a buncha broads in the back bustin' it loose
Do it free for me and charge you a hundred or two
Top floor in the presidential with a wonderful view
Yeah I'm rich, but I ain't just talkin' I live like this
You couldn't get water out the faucet as clear as my wrist

[Hook: Mannie Fresh & T.I.]
Pimpin' y'all ain't heard that latest?
Ay it's the best of the best
Young pimpin' on a record with Fresh
I drive Chevys, fuck Mercedes
Hopped out the new CL V12, got in the blue SS
And I'm leavin' witcha ladies
I got a beautiful bitch, pursuin' ya bitch
Next thing ya know, ya losin' ya bitch, pimp
Yall niggas give it up I'm the greatest
Ay, I'm the greatest, ay, I'm the greatest, ay
Pimpin' I'm the greatest

[Verse 2: T.I.]
It's been a long time since you seen a nigga like me
In a pair of Gucci sneakers, jeans and a white tee
Extravagant and outa control, I might be
But I'm makin' 50k on the road a night G
Rocks in my ring, big as cubes in ya ice tea
I used to dream 'bout a Benz now I own like 3
I gotta wine-colored V, with the wine-colored V
And reclined leather seats, I ain't lyin' I'm a beast
You can tell I'm gettin' money how I shine in the streets
Blowin' on the best pine you can find in the streets
Rappers wastin' they time if they trying to compete
They records sales declinin' when mine hit the streets
I got the fine freaks starin', 'cus my time piece glarin'
When the light hit the carrats, got they eyes lookin' Chinese
You'll run yourself raggedy tryna out shine me
No matter whatcha do, you're 2 steps behind me

[Hook: Mannie Fresh & T.I.]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
A smooth attitude enable me to ball outrageous
Nigga fuck you pay me, I'm all outa favors
What Grand Hustle got ain't a motherfucker gave us
A motherfuckin' thing, but ain't a motherfucker played us
You gotta mil' that's a small percentage
The way ya record deal structured, you only get a small percentage
I gotta Magnum with a magnum in it
Playstation and a plasma in it
Sittin' on 20 inches and it's tinted
Gotta hemi nothin' faster than it
The 50 Gs'll pass you in it, get real
Gotta Chevy more expensive than that Jag you rented
Excuse me, but let Young Pimpin' brag a minute
Gotta bottle of Louie and a flock of groupies hotter than Rudy
Lickin' me dry when I get out the jacuzzi
They eatin' pussy, suckin' dick until they mouth got gooey
Can't another young nigga in the south outdo me

[Hook: Mannie Fresh & T.I.]

[Verse 1: Mac Boney]
Look girl you sexy as you wanna be

Broads strippin out they clothes before the D.J. pass the mic
Puerto Rican mama citas, Asian bitches mixed wit white

You can't do it, don't tryyyyyy
I know you sucker niggas wish that you was livin' my life
In white linen I'm flyyyy
Top down in the Spider, be a rider for the rest of my life

[Verse 1: T.I.]
A-town veteran, started at 11
Went and bought an 8-ball, I was stayin' down ever since
That's why it's hard to find a young rap nigga better then
The Bankhead resident, Westside represent
Pimp Squad mobster, Grand Hustle president
Heart of a lion and the nuts of an elephant
"Trap Muzik" heaven sent, you hatin' and it's evident
You tryna stack presidents, I'm tryna set precedents
The comparisons insultin' my intelligence
Cuz real recognize real, and real you ain't never been
And never will
I catch ya where ya chill
Holla at ya where ya live, nigga fuck a record deal
Pimp graduated out the yay to stack a couple mil
Would you figure it'd be a rap nigga I'd have to kill?
My patnas tellin' me "shawty ya have to chill"
But I'mma end up hatin' with the steel, watitis
Still Dope Boy, trap niggas worldwide lovin' me
Haters see the Spider and they wanna put a slug in it
Fuck it, I'm a G, I been a rider, I ain't studyin' it
Ya better get your mind off mine and start hustlin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Daz]
As a BG gainin' them stripes
I avenge when I strike
Prey on my victims, blind them niggas all with the light
Get it right, hold it tight, blast with all your might
See we hustle for them grams 'til the early light
Follow my plan, on command, leave them dead where they stand
Ain't no stoppin' the man, nigga with grands in my hand
Livin' the fast lane, Grand Hustle the grand when the cash came
The police book me, take my fingerprints and last name
Now I'm stuck in the cell, how would I maintain?
Loc up on these niggas, the penitentiary mind frame
I strive for perfection, my method is quite collective
Check out the fuckin' way I just rep it
It's Dogg Pound Gangsta in a black stinkin' Lincoln
Rims shinin', fresh paint and T.I. countin' paper
Big moves, stay on deck with the tools
All ya niggas and bitches with niggas get sprayed with the tool
Rrrrrrrraaahhhh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Daz]
This how we hustle for the paper, cuz the hustle get harder
I'm Dogg Pound out in that Atlanta Brave starter
Money, weed and bitches, 24 inches
Conversatin' with T.I., plottin' on gettin' these millions
Down for my niggas murderin', killin'
Real in the spot, or on a mission..
All my niggas...y'all know how the fuck we kick it
I'ma...keep my eyes on a meal ticket
Hustle it up, muthafucka we'll kick it

[T.I.]
"All Eyez on Me" with my Westside homie
In a drop '65 on D's
Wanna ride on me? I got a 45. on me
In a hurry to die homie? get live on me
Be charged with tryin' an OG
And I'm creepin' thru the crowd low-key
Nigga you don't know me
I learned from niggas befo' me
I got insomnia, shawty, I don't sleep
I bomb, I don't creep

[Hook]

[Daz]
Y'all niggas know how we do this shit, T.I., Dat Nigga Daz yaknahmean
It's my life, your life, our life, his life, let's live it to the fullest

[T.I.]
One time for 'Pac... we miss you nigga
One time for Shawty B for keepin' it pimpin'
P$C, Grand Hustle pimp
Fuck nigga let this be a lesson to ya

Y'all niggas better start trainin' man
You better be a damn good ducker nigga when I goddamn let loose with this
Chopper ya understand that?

Once the muthafuckin' judge slam that goddamn gavel, nigga got his
Muthafuckin' case beat

Five (five), four (four), three (three), two (two)
One (run) you done when I see (see) you (you)

[Verse 1]
Ay, what it is, the king back in the buildin'
Still stackin' and buildin', you still rappin' to children
Jeopardizin' your deals, caught up buyin' your wheels
Like its back when we was little and its still time to kill
Quit displayin' your skills, way underpayin' bills
Spend a day in the Ville, on how you saying you real
Niggas could never live how I live, you ain't deservin'
My lifestyle's urban, never met me in person
Just my bread suburban, in a red suburban
On 24's, 20 hoes giving head, I'm swervin'
Fuck boys pissed they pants, scared nervous
I'm shell-shocked, black eye, like I been in the service
Clean, cut, and preserved, but I told George Gervin
The closest thing your ho seen, in picture perfect
The rolls gold king, my ring tight as a virgin (???)
The dream I stop 'fore I seen the top (nigga)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I treat the beats like the streets, on em I do what I want to
I ain't gotta confront you, I'll kill if I want to
Roam amongst monsters, kill homes and front you
That lil nigga swearin' he bad, eat him for lunch too
Fuck you niggas, Dominique slam dunk you
Niggas sucka punch down one of you niggas
I was being nice at first, now I'm runnin' through niggas
Whole crews, not just one or two niggas
Cuz you ain't representin' the south, you just embarassin'
See you on t.v. in New York, them niggas laughin'
The reason why D.J.'s ain't have a clue I was fabulous
Now days not playin' my record well, hell its hazardous
All this cussin' for some loud discussions, outta my character
Bussin' these niggas melons, and threatenin' all of they managers
P.$.C.'s Atlanta, so how you playin' and handlin'
Gorillas with bananas without playin' and banishin'
King of the south, it was said once then
Took a while to comprehend, that all sunk in
On the low deal a mil, I ain't done come again
Room dead, scene fled, 'fore the feds runnin' in

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Comin' live from the Terra-Dome
Shinin' lights on niggas who got they skirts on tight with mascara on
All I have ever known, is 28 in the zone
Gimme a day and its gone, a brick of yay and its on
You have neva known, me to run
'Less I'm gunnin' at niggas domes
And runnin' them out they own
Territory, every story gotta flipside to it
And your disc ain't shit unless the clique ride to it
And Imma show you how the Westside do it
In the A, not Cali, Bankhead, Simpson valley
Every crack and every alley sellin' crack
And every time diggin' hairier
Every Kim, Sue, Sally, til I tally up
A big enough knot to buy me a yacht
So then my pistols and my partnas really all that I got
I'm not, playin' at all, I'm sprayin' 'em all
This K'll chop 'em down to size, cuz they say that I'm small man
Pussycats can't worry the dog
Keep throwin' stones at the throne, I'mma bury you all man
Know, you faggot niggas hate that I'm ballin'
Makin' 30k a day and blow it all at the mall, and man I
Can't relate to what you rap on stage, nigga
Cuz I been sellin' yay since I was Bow Wow's age nigga
Hear my daddy and my cousin talkin' to me from the grave
And all they say is "Young nigga get paid!"

[Hook] - 2X

[Intro: Lil Jon]
Yeah, yeah

Naw, I ain't say that, he said that

And if them motherfuckers do, bust a motherfucking move
Stand up

[Verse 1: T.I.]
You got a alligator mouth and a hummingbird ass
Your mouth writing checks that your ass can't cash
145 and I'm out of your weight class
Want to survive, you better scramble like eggs and break fast
Cause I know how to handle your fake ass
I'm a ride on you and hide you in yesterday's trash
Pull up in the Chevy's spraying rounds through the glass
See you laying face down in the grass and I'll laugh
Ha, cause that's the end of the saga
The end of my problems, nigga mash the Impala
Go lay up with a model and watch the news tomorrow
And that's the end checkmate, game over, I'll holler
Pimp, telling you partner, you don't know what you're doing
Or recognize the trouble you getting in to and you're ruin
And dig this man
I spent my childhood in a wild hood
And all that gangster shit you talking, yeah, it sound good
But make it understood
You gone have to show me, I'm a O.G
You want to overthrow me

[Chorus: T.I. w/ Lil Jon]
Stand up
If you don't like what I'm saying then buck
Swing when you see me we can throw them hands sucker

And if them motherfuckers do, bust a motherfucking move

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today
To marry this young nigga in his own special thug way
Do you promise to love and respect all of the real niggas
And when a problem come, learn to deal with 'em
Do you swear to turn this chopper
On any motherfucker in your path, or the bitch that's trying to stop ya
Or do you promise to keep him handy
And don't hand him to nobody, nobody except family
And keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body
Unless somebody, who want him in his body
To love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel
From the bottom of your heart
'til death do you fuckin' part
Do you understand to live, to lie by him
Is to share your soul, Lord knows, you gone die by him
I know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid
Shit, all them motherfuckers dead
And did you know that every other bitch from the Wild, Wild West
End up dying from hollow points to they fuckin' chest
Cause they ain’t never seen a Carbine, a Mini 14, or a Tommy Gun
With a hundred round fuckin' drum

[Chorus: T.I. w/ Lil Jon]
Stand up
If you don't like what I'm saying then buck
Swing when you see me we can throw them hands sucker
Stand up
If you didn't notice nigga, I don't give a fuck
If I said it then I meant it and what fuck nigga
Stand up
You don't want to see the triggerman bust
Hit you and your mans up, make it hard for niggas to

And if them motherfuckers do, bust a motherfucking move
Stand up

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
Shit, I'm talking about riding out tonight
Only way I die first, got to kill me in this verse
Weezy F middle finger to life
So nothing seem critical in the hood I'm typical
Yet I'm feeling good and spiritual
Healing hoods with this shit up out my kitchen
I'm pitching that it's really good
Smoking, drinking, I'm like a fish
And I'll probably shit on ya bitch
Probably piss on her lips and she probably give you a kiss
Nasty, Holly Grove classic
Polly wood a nigga probably robbed the same bastard
Ask him
We don't give a fuck about a casket
Nigga this the murder cappy
Niggas is murder happy
12 years old, I jumped off the pot
I started selling rock right after I got shot
I had to hold my weight down
Pussy nigga stand up or lay down

[Chorus: T.I. w/ Lil Jon]
Stand up
If you don't like what I'm saying then buck
Swing when you see me we can throw them hands sucker
Stand up
If you didn't notice nigga, I don't give a fuck
If I said it then I meant it and what fuck nigga
Stand up
You don't want to see the triggerman bust
Hit you and your mans up, make it hard for niggas to
Stand up
Tell your crew they don't want it with us dude
And if them motherfuckers do, bust a motherfucking move
Stand up

[T.I. praying over indistinct chatter]
Our father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
And forgive us for our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespassed aganist us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
And the power, and the glory
For ever and ever, hmm, amen

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm prayin' for help
While I'm lookin' at the life I left, it's kinda hard not to hate myself
But quiet as kept, right or wrong it's just the way I felt
I might be better off prayin' for death, on my knees I knelt
Still tryin' to find a way to accept, it ain't a way that I can
Help nobody, 'til I save myself, technically I'm still a slave myself
I gotta climb out the grave myself, man I played myself
But when I look at all the fans I touched
I ask how can a man that's done so much, be treated so unjust
Cause I'm tryin' to inspire the folks, you wanna condemn
Cause they sell dope, well man show 'em the ropes
Be a father or a football coach, a role model or a symbol of hope
Take another approach, instead of testifyin' aganist them in court
Handcuffin' 'em and closin' the door, so they can be worse than before
Can't you see they only do what they know
Than you wonder why they don't care no mo', life ain't fair I know
But why I'm hated everywhere I go, next time you wanna
Compare my flow, just know that I'm prayin' for help

[Hook]
Askin' somebody else to give me a hand
I'm tryin' hard, but I'm only a man
Man, I'm prayin' for help
Hopin' somebody else could see what I see
It's like the hood only matter to me
They got me prayin' for help
Hopin' somebody else can carry the torch
I'm all alone, with no kinda support
While I was prayin' for help
Realized that I don't need nobody else
If God wit' me I can do it myself
I'm tired of just prayin' for help

[Verse 2]
I know it's only one king, one thing, one being
Only somethin' I believe without seeing, and with all my faith
I pray some how, some way, regardless of what anyone say
I believe one day, that I'mma change my life, get right
Start livin' like Christ, 'til the end of my fight
I'mma be defending my strife
'Til somebody come and shut off my lights, I ain't never gon' quit
No matter how difficult it's gon' get, and you can bet whatever on this
I'm forever gon' spit, harder than niggas hatin' on Tip
You can take away, place it on Tip, I double my load
Carry it as the trouble unfolds, holds yours
And I betta don't fold, put that on my soul
If it takes till I'm a hundred years old, bet I'm reachin' everyone of my goals

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ay it's so many times, I done wish I could change my mind
Change my life and leave the game behind
And it's been so many days, I done prayed I could find a way
Find a heart and the time to say, only so many are blessed
With so many chances, and so many checks, so many fans
With so many arrest, and it's been so many deaths
So many prisons with niggas in there
And the system keep playin' them to the left, man it's so many tests
So many haters love seeing you stress, but tribulations come with being the best
Still it's so many who flex, singin' bout checks, when they greener than Shreks
Sellin' dreams, never seen in the jects, that's why I'm seen as a threat
So many stripes off the streets I'mma vet, so many rappers get so little respect
Now niggas faith on the shelf, cause of the cards that a nigga was dealt
Or the heart that a nigga that dealt, so many niggas done left outta the hood
Made a way for themself, instead of givin' back, they stay for they self
So many playin' they self, instead of readin', educating they self
The ones who won't even pray for they self, they got me prayin' for help

[Hook]

Slangin' in the trap cause dat's what our daddies' taught us
Put 30s on a Lac to a Benz on Brawlers
Standin' on the corner, slangin' crack and stackin' dollars
Till it's time to cop a brick and I'm tired of movin' quarters
My dad wasn't a doctor and my momma wasn't a lawyer
I ain't neva had shit, congratulation is in order (still trappin')
Tryin' ta get a meal fo my sons and my daughter
If I call a bad bitch wit connections down in Florida
Say her daddy and her uncle still get it across the water
Rich or not I'd be a motherfuckin' fool if I don't call her

[Hook: T.I.]
Ah what it is my nigga, what it do? (ay what it do)
I gotta grip a twin, I'm finna buss a move (ah buss a move)
Ah what it is my nigga, what it do? (ay what it do)
I got the tool and I'm finna cut a fool (ah cut a fool)
Ay what it do, what it do, what it do, ay what it do
What it do my nigga what it do, ay what it do
Ay what it do, what it do, what it do, ay what it do
What it do my nigga what it do, ay what it do

[Verse 2: B.G.]
I'mma H-U-S-T-L-E-Rah
If I don't know you then fuck ya
If I know you then I front ya (proper)
But you gotta break me off
You don't, I catch ya slippin' on the block and knock you off
I know people, I get nice deals
Get 'em $5 sell 'em $10 a pill
I know people, get ki's for 13
If I fuck witcha, ya get 'em for 16
I know people, get 'em 300 a pound
Give 'em to ya for 500 if you my round
I'mma hustler, holla at me Uptown
I'm well connected with weed, white, slangin' dat brown
Come see a nigga, want a nice 16
You real we swap work you fake its 20 g's
It's like dat, I done been thru the struggle
I'm runnin' Choppa City an fuckin' with Grand Hustle

[Hook: T.I.]
Ah what it is my nigga, what it do? (ay what it do)
I gotta grip a twin, I'm finna buss a move (ah buss a move)
Ah what it is my nigga, what it do? (ay what it do)

Ay what it do, what it do, what it do, ay what it do
What it do my nigga what it do, ay what it do

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I got the eye of a tiger and the heart of a bear
I'm the king of the jungle, you can follow me there
Or you can hear it from these niggas who was hardly there
Or take it from niggas who fought to make it a star to get here
Several years ago I told myself I solemnly swear
Forever be hard to kill, even harder to scare
One reason why me and other cats is hard to compare
Cuz I'm fact, dat's fiction, it hardly compares
Bein' hated part of the game, pimp it's hard but it's fair
Well I'mma be the best, hate me, see if I care
But just know I'm raisin' the bar and I'm keepin' there
And I'mma still ride clean, blowin' weed in the air
With 2 or 3 bad bitches got they feet in the air
Say they like when I smack on they ass and skeet in they hair
Listen, I don't care if you got the song of the year
Ya whole show shutin' down if the don appear

[Hook: T.I.]
Ah what it is my nigga, what it do? (ay what it do)
I gotta grip a twin, I'm finna buss a move (ah buss a move)
Ah what it is my nigga, what it do? (ay what it do)
I got the tool and I'm finna cut a fool (ah cut a fool)
Ay what it do, what it do, what it do, ay what it do
What it do my nigga what it do, ay what it do
Ay what it do, what it do, what it do, ay what it do
What it do my nigga what it do, ay what it do

[Intro]
I'mma tell y'all sucka ass niggas somethin'..

[Hook]
You mighta seen me in the streets but nigga, you don't know me

Quit tellin' niggas you my partna, nigga you don't know me
Don't be a groupie, keep it movin', nigga you don't know me
Hey I ain't trippin' pimp, the truth is really, you don't know me

You be hatin' and I see why, cuz you don't know me

[Verse 1]
I think it's time I made a song for niggas who don't know me
I graduated out the streets, I'mma real O.G
I been trappin', shootin' pistols since I stood four feet
So all you niggas actin' bad, you gon have to show me
You gon make me bring this Chevy to a real slow creep
My niggas hangin' out the window, mouth fulla gold teeth
When the guns start poppin' wonder when it's gone cease
Chopper hit you in' the side an' create a slow leak
We can end the speculation cuz today we gone see
What's the future of a pussy nigga hatin' on me
I give a fuck about the FED's investigation on me
I don't care that they at my shows and they waitin' on me
I'mma keep on flossin', poppin' long as Troomp is on the beat
Tell police's I ain't stoppin', I'mma keep it in the streets
Contrary to yo beliefs, I'm as real as you can be
Fuck yo thoughts and yo feelings, nigga you don't know me

[Hook]
You mighta seen me in the streets but nigga, you don't know me

[Verse 2]
Ay, once again let me remind you nigga, you don't know me
So don't be walkin' up and askin' what's the deal on a key
I don't know if you wearin' wires, you could be the police
If I was slangin' blow you couldn't get a O-Z
See me and the P.$.C. fallin' through at a show deep
Police holdin' up the door, cuz they know we tote heat
I just wanna ride wit C, blow dro' in the Fleet
Or with Clay and bout a dozen different bitches in a week
I just wanna chill wit Kuntry and his daddy Freddie G
Ballin' out at anytime, in any store we spend a G
Wanna ball in the Bahamas, courtesy of K.T
Mac Boney got a mil, as well as Dolla D.P
A.K. house on the hill right next to J.G
Every week meet at Philant's restaurant and eat free
Get Inda paid, lil' Greg and B
That's the only shot we got at gettin' cap back on the streets

[Hook]
You mighta seen me in the streets but nigga, you don't know me
When you holla when you speak, remember you don't know me
Save all the hatin' and the plottin', nigga you don't know me

Hey I ain't trippin' pimp, the truth is really, you don't know me
Yeah, you know they call me T.I., but you don't know me
You be hatin' and I see why, cuz you don't know me

[Bridge]
You see a nigga hatin' on a G, ask'em what it's gon be
Whachu lookin' at? Pussy nigga, you don't know me
At the club, in the streets, or wherever we should meet
It's choppas choppin', pistols poppin', nigga you don't know me
Ay, you see a nigga hatin' on a G, ask'em what it's gonna be
Whachu lookin' at? Pussy nigga, you don't know me
At the club, in the streets, or wherever we should meet

[Intro]
And in case you forgot, I'm the King
Yea, Yea, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye
Who I'm is nigga (I'm the King)
T.I.P., Atlanta's own King of the South shawty (I'm the King)
Yea, Yea, Yea, Better keep my name out ya mouth shawty (I'm the King)
Yeah, P$C nigga, Aye, Aye

[Verse 1]
All hail Atlanta's own, owner of Atlanta's throne
If he ain't want no trouble he just should've left the man alone
It's been seen, shown and evident Atlanta's known
The King's been the one representing all of Atlanta's zones
Back when niggas was representing Atlanta wrong
Every shot he got, he put the hoods of Atlanta on
The big screen, then hit every trap and traveled on
Past, present to Texas to Alabama strong
Down in Miami, up to Louisiana homes
From the Carolina's, Virginia, to David Banner's home
I'm well connected haters, best to mind ya manners homes
I got a nickel-plated .38, but hey the hammer chrome
And it shine like ya should set the Phantom on
In it see me riding, getting blown like a saxaphone
Hey, shawty spit the shit it take to cut a candle on
If I ain't on ya tube dude, you must got ya channel wrong

[Hook]
I'm the King of the South, there is none flyer
Sucker MC's outta call me Sire, ya songs OK, but I'm on fire
24 inches on my rims and tires
I'm the king of the South, there is none flyer
Sucker MC's outta call me Sire, you was on top
But I pass right by ya, I will not stop and I won't retire

[Verse 2]
I came, I saw, I conquered with no big names
No fame, no celebrity sponsors
Just the game and a flow that was bonkers
Nigga front if ya wanna, I dead niggas like the bitches from "Monster"
Now you been told, so don't say I ain't warn ya and don't
Let it alarm ya, when ya leaking, and the reapers upon ya
See dopeman and I'm creeping upon ya, say that I ain't the King
But you just sour, you ain't think of it aren't ya
All the hating, is no time to respond to, I miss trying to conjure up
A way to get experience and launder, hey I thought ya record company
Con ya in to signing a deal shy of a mill cause they really ain't want ya
Moving yay, it's safe to say that they own ta ya
So it's time to move on to real estate, and get cake selling bigger stakes
I'm king of the south now, but theres fifty states
Cause I'm gonna spread out and I'll eliminate who in the way
I'm 24 today, give to I'm 28
I'll be ruler of all that I survey and not just in the state
See I bend just to win, but I ain't finna break
Most you niggas fake, and I'll say it in you niggas face

[Hook]

[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah, ay, ay
That's right, yeah

[T.I.]
Hoppin out a dropped Impala, pants hangin to my ankles
Feel 'em hate from every angle, they intimidated, and uh
I'm a beast, they don't like to see me walkin out of prison
I ain't trippin, I don't owe 'em nothin but an ass whippin
What you lookin at? Girl you better cut the television on
Don't wanna show yo' ass, best to get to gettin on
Home, I'm waitin on ya if you want it
I ain't gotta go for bad, I just go for my opponent
I ain't lookin for no trouble, I ain't duckin none either
Say a nigga jumpin ship I say so fuck 'em, I don't need 'em
Still greet 'em, with the same smile like I used to
Get wild if you choose to, I ain’t finna' shush you
End up head bust, bloody nose, loose tooth
Whoop a nigga ass by himself or with a group too
Who, fight back, ho it's like that
Where my knife at? Shawty I'll be right back

[Hook: T.I.]
Fresh out the box I'mma mash out, ya hear me?
This year a hundred mil' I'mma cash out, ya hear me?
Today a 100 K ain't nothin to brag 'bout, ya hear me?
The king pullin rank, big bank take little bank
Fresh up out the box I bet I mash out, ya hear me?
This year a hundred mil' I'mma cash out, ya hear me?
Today a 100 K ain't nothin to brag 'bout, ya hear me?
Rollin through your hood, can you hear me now? Goooood

[T.I.]
We gon' do it big like we did befo', fresh off a case
+ASAP+, +Motivation+ ho, guess that's all it take
They got they ass with my poker face
Wait 'til they get a load of me like The Joker say (ha ha ha ha ha ha)
A lot of talkin that bullshit'll pass but it ain't today
Gon' be a Code-10, man down, like Frankie say
Ay, at the lair where the players meet
So all squares kick rocks with your bare feet, bitches cherish me
Came back, nigga raise up
Safe to say them suckers wanna see me caged up - that chapter's over
Pass the mic and set the stage up, throw your A's up
Tell my P.O. I don't blaze up, Pee Wee fire the haze up
They praise us cause old heads recognize the G in him
Black card, +No Limit+ like P and them
Ain't nobody seein him - who fuckin with shawty
When we pull up bitches yell out "O.M.G." just like my daughter and them

[Hook]

[T.I.]
I'm in a jet black Camaro with my eyes on the sparrow
They say I can't have no pistol so I bought a bow and arrow
I'm just waitin, niggas say it ain't the same and I get back
See ain't a damn thang change but my six pack
Heh, you want wreck you can get that
But all the disrespectin shawty I ain't with that
And partner I ain't fin' to chit-chat
Comin where a nigga had to break him off a piece like a Kit Kat
Tell them cats bless me to impress me
Best leave or get wet like a jetski
Overseas where you catch me
And when they holla King nigga they don't mean Elvis Presley
Hard body lumped up, chest like a dumb truck
Keep the sword on me shawty, this ain't what you want bruh
I ain't gotta bust ya, if you close enough you get stuck
Leave a nigga drippin like a sippy cup, pick 'em up

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I etched the face of a stopwatch on the back of a raindrop
And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass
I heard an unhappy ending, it sort of sounds like you leaving
I heard the piledriver waltz, it woke me up this morning

[Chorus]
You look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets
And the literature on how to lose
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

[Verse 2]
Mysteries flashing amber go green when you answer
But the red on the rest of the questionnaire never changes
I heard the news that you're planning
To shoot me out of a cannon
I heard the piledriver waltz, it woke me up this morning

[Chorus]
You look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets
And the literature on how to lose
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Piledriver

[Intro]
Yeah, track King Cole
Uh, uh
Ya boy Mac Miller, hey
Uh

[Chorus]
What type of music should I make?
It generates love and it generates hate (Hate)
What kind of topics should I stress?
I can talk about the money and the cars and the sex
Talk about life or talk about death
Livin' care free or I can talk about stress (Stress)
What kind of picture should I paint?
What type of music should I make? (Make)

[Verse 1]
So many things to say, not a lot of time that I can say 'em
I can talk about the fact that I'm a rappin' Caucasian
Talk about goin' to school and gettin' bad grades
Talk about breakin' the rules and havin' bad days
I could talk about girl problems
I could talk about the hoes from the ugly to the hot ones
Or I could talk about this dream I have
Or I could talk about my homies when I seen 'em last
Say I'm the illest on the mic, how I kill it when I write
Or how the lights when they film is so bright
I could talk about the fame and the hoes
Or all the name brands on my clothes
Talk about the highs, talk about the lows
Talk about the high that you gettin' when you smoke
I talk about a lot of shit when I write
'Cause it's part of my life

[Chorus]
What type of music should I make?
It generates love and it generates hate (Hate)
What kind of topics should I stress?
I can talk about the money and the cars and the sex
Talk about life or talk about death
Livin' care free or I can talk about stress (Stress)
What kind of picture should I paint?
What type of music should I make? (Make)

[Verse 2]
Look
I could talk about the parties that I go to
Talk about how it's so different from the old school
I could talk about the pop and the whack rap
Or I could talk about some ounces in the backpack
Talk about a fitted, talk about a snap back
Somethin' simple, or somethin' real abstract
About the war, talk about politics
Or I could tell you how full my Louis wallet is
I could talk about a few religions
Or how to turn a Jew into a Christian
I could talk about the shit that make you cry
Or I could make it all up and just talk about lies

[Chorus]
What type of music should I make?
It generates love and it generates hate (Hate)
What kind of topics should I stress?
I can talk about the money and the girls and the sex
Talk about life or talk about death
Livin' care free or I can talk about stress (Stress)
What kind of picture should I paint?
What type of music should I make? (Make)

[Verse 1]
I got a confession to make
I don't rush a date
Commitment is an enemy to me
But ever since her lips touched my face
It's like a kiss was laced
I'm feein', I'm feenin', I'm feenin'
I usually like to slow down the pace
Love to tease and play
But girl I need to be direct with you
Cause in my mind your voice just replays
Like a broken tape
What you do, what you do, what you do

[Chorus]
Gon' make a nigga buy a ring for your finger
Jimmys for your feet
Jeans for that back
Lingerie for the sheets
Material girl, anything you need
And I'mma give it to you, to you
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all

[Verse 2]
Super star undercover
You're my number one fan
Give it to me right
Watch the diamond glow your hand
Get you wetter than reverb, right after the dessert
Baby you're my Dairy Queen
Watch you make my baby cream
Lady, you're the one that I want to spend my cash on
Spend my cash on my baby like
Baby, just make sure that you'll always put your man on

[Chorus]
You gon' make a nigga buy a ring for your finger
Jimmys for your feet
Jeans for that back
Lingerie for the sheets
Material girl, anything you need
And I'mma give it to you, to you
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all

[Verse 3]
Tripping over you like a crack on the floor
Can't settle with a taste
Baby girl, give me more
Baby take the keys to my ride, to my home
Girl, I'mma make it rain like a tropical storm
Tripping over you like a crack on the floor
Can't settle with a taste
Baby girl, give me more
Baby take the keys to my ride, to my home
Girl, I'mma make it rain like a tropical storm

[Chorus]
Ring for your finger
Jimmys for your feet
Jeans for that back
Lingerie for the sheets
Material girl, anything you need
And I'mma give it to you, to you
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all
Ring for your finger
Jimmys for your feet
Jeans for that back
Lingerie for the sheets
Material girl, anything you need
And I'mma give it to you, to you
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all

September 22nd, 2009
Kendrick Lamar
To... to...

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you
Scared of you but I will fight you
I stare at the ceiling and think about you
Curiosity killing me, thinking of when I'ma meet you
You introduced yourself to so many others, mothers, sisters and brothers, children and babies drive me crazy I wonder
Why you love people that love people that do right?
Is it rocket science to you or is it just your type?
One of my biggest fears, is waking up 4 in the morning and gotta hear you met one of my peers
Or maybe a family member that you thought was cool
Or maybe a person that I'll never meet 'cause of you
You, son of a bitch and I wish you never existed
And I swear I'd blow your brains out if you pay me a visit
But that's not realistic, 'cause you'll never rot
But I'ma still send this letter off
P.O. Box, and when you get it....

[Hook]
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Let me continue this letter saying I don't like you
Scared of you but I will fight you
Should be ashamed of the moves you make
The pain you bring, the sorrow and the hearts you break
Everyday you remind me that you're always there
'Cause every time I come around someone's getting shot down
And all I say is a prayer, "so help me, Lord!"
Then the Lord talk back, "I can't help you, boy!"
That's fucked up, my life's fucked, was cursed before birth
And what's fucked up, I gotta live my life with the hurt
Of knowing that you're everlasting
Dwelling upon the masses
Of the Earth fatal assassins
Snatchin' bodies
Probably, on my notepad as I write
Why the fuck you wanna take my life?
Sooner or later, I'm tired and weary and my gray hairs are not in my favor
So when I write on this paper
It's real talk
So...

[Hook]
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar as Death]
Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you too
And the reason we haven't met because I've been busy doing whatever since grade school
I've watched your every move
You slipped up a few times, I gave you a pass
So don't say I ain't sympathetic
But you can barely get curiosity, I'ma dead it
Everybody wanna know why I act this way
Let's just say... I had a bad day
Matter fact, everyday
But I take it out on somebody and you could probably find me wherever the wolves parade
I was born to be a killjoy, I'm an old brat
Conceived by Adam and Eve, so who you mad at?
Not me, see me? I'm just doing my job
And you ducking me? Is mos def an odd
So why send this letter as if I never knew you?
I rather knock on your door and just hand it to you

[Interlude: Ab-Soul]
It's everywhere
The streets, the corners, the coroners, the morgues, the cemeteries, hospitals
Heard about it when I was little
Tomorrow's not promised, 'cause any day can be knocking at your front door
War, genocide, homicide, suicide all coincide
Signed and sealed by the living
Make it, don't take it

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal

Pull up in a stretchy, Jean Paul flexin'

Shorty, all I got is a dollar and a dream, is ya gonna roll with me?
You see I've tried a 9 to 5, and it just don't fit me)
I can get us out the hood and have us living good, you feel me?
But I ain't leaving here if you ain't with me
'Cause, girl, a suit with a smile that don't fit me
Taking a bus for some miles is gon' kill me, oh no

Well as long as you're down I know

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Looking at you day after day, I know I

Even if I gotta go and cop a thang
Get up early and go standin' on the block, some how I

At the round table and come up on a plot, some how I

There's nothin' I won't do for you baby
Havin' big dreams of me ridin' in the Bentley Continental
While me copin' you a cute lil' Mercedes
And I know I got the block hot
But until I make it happen for you baby I will not stop
I'ma drape you with diamonds and furs
Visions of your herb blowin' in the wind from a drop top
Like a baller, like a true shot caller
The homie, Trey Songz, tippin' all day long if he have to
Makin' that money for the family
Can I get up witcha it's that nigga named Twista
Come and take a lil' cruise with a G through the Chi-town streets
'Cause you feelin' me under inspiration whenever I'm

Yeah, Bun B baby, UGK, baby, hold up
See you done had your moment, you done had your turn

The trillest player out the V.A. since the authors of Lord Willin'
Givin' R&B music a newly restored feelin'
While haters is bored chillin', he's focused and mashin'
He bringin' big faces and then them checks he be cashin'
He got some places to go and some people to see
But he gon' rep for Virginia, baby keepin' it G
In the streets and TV, don't matter, he gon' keep it 100
'Cause can't nobody do it like young Trey done done it
So don't tell me that it's dos or claimin' it's uno
Why hate 'em, congratulate him, 'cause nigga, you know

Songz

[Verse 1]
Your face is amazin', blazin' hot like cajun
All I need is a minute, please no gimmicks
She tellin' me to chill on the real or take a trip to Satan
Send me to hell with it then I yell what it do, to hell with your crew
Say you got a man well to hell with him too
The seats is sea shell the whip is sea blue and you can swim through
Ain't a lot of women that I can't swim through
And you can't say that I don't temp you
'Cause if you you said that, you's a liar
Grip them legs back call me pliers, 24 chrome up under the tires
And you so grown and my desire's to make you cum
So finish that rum, ay who said Trey Songz ain't fire?

[Chorus]
The way you talking girl you seem so invincible
It's more than sexy girl, the way that you take control
I wonder woman are you my kind of woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets, are you my wonder woman?
Are you, are you my wonder woman?
Are you, are you my wonder woman?
Are you, are you my wonder woman?
Are you, are you my wonder woman?

[Verse 2]
It's a shame the way you do ya thang
You can't blame me starin' at your frame
What's your name? Baby they call me Trey
From the TV to the stage, the Prince of VA

[Pre-Chorus]
I got propers like doctors, I could change your life
You should stop watching and jockin' as if you ain't gon' ride
I wonder something baby we gon' do somethin' tonight

[Intro: Trey Songz]
Songz, Jones
Songbook, baby
And my boy E Hud
You already know

I'm so, you so, we so fly
I'm so, you so, we so fly
I'm so, you so, we so fly
I'm so, you so, we so fly
I'm so, you so, we so fly
I'm so, you so, we so fly
I'm so, you so, we so fly

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Maybe it's the dude, maybe it's the cool
Maybe it's my shoes, call 'em 22's
Baby it's ya phase, baby it;'s ya face
Baby it;s ya smile, make me wonder how you taste
Maybe 'cause the thugs say that I'm cool
Maybe 'cause the girls wanna be like you
Maybe it's the ice that made ya look twice
Maybe it's ya back that made me look back

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Baby, I'd look good with you
You should know that you'd look good with me too
Let me ride through the hood with you
Show you to my boys 'cause ooh ooh you

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
You so fly, I'm so fly
What's more fly than you and I together?
Get high, let's fly together
I'm so fly, you so fly
What's more fly than you and I together?
Get high, let's fly together

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Maybe take a cruise, sail across seas
We can never lose, baby not we
We can be the two, true life of the party
Baby, what it do? You know that you want me
Maybe it's the feel that I like you
Got a nigga feel he can wife you
Maybe it's the fit that made me look slick
Baby, you the pick, I make you my chick

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Baby, I'd look good with you
You should know that you'd look good with me too
Let me ride through the hood with you
And show you to my boys 'cause ooh ooh you

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
You so fly, I'm so fly
What's more fly than you and I together?
Get high, let's fly together
I'm so fly, you so fly
What's more fly than you and I together?
Get high, let's fly together

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
Baby don't, don't you take too long, I want you in my arms
And if you feel what I feel, bring it here to me c'mon
See we young but girl, we grown
And baby I want to grow old with you 'cause you know that you so

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
Maybe it's ya attitude that makes me a lil mad at you
The same time the gratitude makes me wanna spend cash on you
Take you on trips, you caught the longitude and latitude
Let you hold the whip, last time we almost crashed the coupe
So I laughed at you, 'cause we was drunk pissy
It was two summers ago and you still rollin' with me
But maybe it;s the loyalty, the way that you callin' me
When we makin' love, when you scream, put it all on me
Or maybe my physique and my upcomin' from the streets
I keeps you runnin' back, I got you cumin' in the sheets
From the first time I met you, you become a little freak
I might go downtown and get somethin' to eat
And baby, you took care of me, baby, I took care of you
You cry I cry, baby, I shed tears for two
Baby if the 7 karats didn't cost 300 grand
I would had the table and put some ice on ya hand

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
You so fly, I'm so fly
What's more fly than you and I together?
Get high, let's fly together
I'm so fly, you so fly
What's more fly than you and I together?
Get high, let's fly together

[Outro: Trey Songz]
I'm so, you so, we so fly
I'm so, you so, we so fly
Get high, let's fly together

[Verse 1]
Soon as we get started making love going hard
I hear a knock, knock, knocking on the wall
And as soon as I go deep getting it in, then again
There's a knock, knock, knocking on the wall
Girl, your legs keep shaking and I swear
We breaking our new headboard headboard
And the love we make, it feels so good, girl, you know I'm proud
Looking in your lovely face scream my name, you do it so loud

[Chorus]
I bet the neighbors know my name
Way you screaming, scratching, yelling
Bet the neighbors know my name
And they be stressing while we sexing
Bet the neighbors know my name
My name, my name
I bet the neighbors know my name
My my my

[Verse 2]
Take this pillow right here, grab this
And I know you're so excited, if you bite it they won't hear
And you know just what we capable of, when we making love
So the music gon' be loud, you gon' scream and shout
Girl, your body's a problem, they call me the problem solver
Let phone sit on the charger, it could ring all night
They can call, they can knock and be upset, but I bet

[Chorus]
I bet the neighbors know my name
Way you screaming, scratching, yelling
Bet the neighbors know my name
And they be stressing while we sexing
Bet the neighbors know my name
My name, my name
I bet the neighbors know my name
My my my

[Bridge]
While I'll be banging on your body, they be banging on our wall
While they dreaming, you be screaming now they banging on our door
Sometimes she call me Trey, sometimes she say Tremaine
When its all said and done, bet the neighbors know my name
Sometimes she call me Trigga 'cause I make her body bust
He might think my name is "Oh shit", I make her cuss

[Chorus]
I bet the neighbors know my name
Way you screaming, scratching, yelling
Bet the neighbors know my name
And they be stressing while we sexing
Bet the neighbors know my name
My name, my name
I bet the neighbors know my name
I bet the neighbors know my name
I bet the neighbors know my name
Way you screaming, scratching, yelling
Bet the neighbors know my name
And they be stressing while we sexing
Bet the neighbors know my name
My name, my name
I bet the neighbors know my name
My my my

[Outro]
The way you scream my name, whoa
Girl, the love we make
Gon' keep on banging on the wall, but nothing's gonna change
I bet the neighbors know my name

[Intro : Lil Wayne]
Damn I can't believe she left me like this
I mean I brought her to the airport but I can't believe she jumped on the plane and left me like this

[Verse 1 : Lil Wayne]
And I would leave but I had to take a minute in the smokin section
Tryin to let the pain ease
Watchin her plane leave
Trippin in the smoking section
Tryin to regain me
How can I get a grip when I lost my main squeeze
And now im stuck inside of an ashtray
Like a cigarette
But my heart pumps gasoline
And this she know
I just crashed and burned
Now here come the smoke

[Hook : Juliany]
Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
Whats left u'll find it in the smokin section
Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
Whats left u'll find it in the smokin section

[Verse 2 : Juliany]
I gave myself a hour to sit at the gate
I booked us yesterday flight 378
U think I gave him enough time to change my mind
I love him but I couldn't this time
I packed it all up in my two bags and one carry on
U would think I was sure but it feels so wrong
A piece of me is strayed over still with you
I guess ill smoke my last stuck wonderin what I should do

[Hook : Juliany]
Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
Whats left u'll find it in the smokin section
Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
Whats left u'll find it in the smokin section

Im like hold on whats up
Shorty what u goin for
She packed up
Dipped out
Now she left me all alone
Back up in the smokin section
Damn she got me really trippin
Weezy tell me what u sippin
I f**ked up on this situation
Please pass me a cigarette
My nerves back calm down
She always used to promise if she leave she'll be back around
I guess its sum things as a man that im missin
So at the end of the night u can find me in the smokin section

[Hook : Juliany]
Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
Whats left u'll find it in the smokin section
Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
What's left you'll find it in the smokin section

[Verse 1]
I walk down the staircase
Magnetic pull
Back to the other place
That I cannot go

I'm sending a chopper
To steal you away

[Chorus]
The pot is full, let me take control
Let me take control
The pot is full of secrets to be told
Secrets to be told

[Verse 2]
Out of orbit
And I always will

[Chorus]
The pot is full, let me take control
Let me take control
The pot is full of secrets to be told
Secrets to be told

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Feels so good being bad (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's no way I'm turning back (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now the pain is my pleasure 'cause nothing could measure
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Love is great, love is fine (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Out the box, outta line (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, you know they say pain is pleasure
Turn it up when you play this shit
One time for my latest girl
You can be one of my greatest hits
Tired of rapping ’bout chains and whips
Do you like to get chained and whipped?
Do you like rough sex? Hit 'em like I’m upset
Do they get your panties wet?
Le-le-let's go, you rockin' with Cole, it's the best flow
Put the game on lock while those lame-os watch
I'm on fire, they are not, I kick down the door, they all knock
Bitch, I’m a boss, they on a clock
You used to be a good girl, don’t matter
Since you gone bad, you only got badder

[Chorus: Rihanna]
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say, "Ah-ah-ah"
I like it, like it

[Chorus: Rihanna]
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it

[Verse 1]
Tell me a line, make it easy for me
Open your arms
Dance with me until I feel all right
It's good in the dark, good in the dark
But into the lover's light
Here comes another fight
So ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Bore me and hold me and cling to my arm
Here it comes, here it comes
And what you're asking me now, disastrous now
Hoping and hoping and hoping
The feeling goes away

[Chorus 1]
Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
This is why I fell in love
Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
That's just who I fell in love with
(in love...)

[Verse 2]
Oh this is the time, the very best time
So give me a line and take me home
Take me over
But dashing the hopes dashing the hopes
And smashing the pride
The morning's got you on the ropes
And love is a murderer, love is a murderer
But if she calls you tonight
Everything is all right
Yeah, we know
And love is a curse shoved in a hearse
Love is an open book to a verse of your bad poetry
And this is coming from me

[Chorus 2]
But I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(Fall in love)

But I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)

[Verse 3]
Turn on the light, make it easy for me
Feel the divide, fumble in the kitchen
'Til it's right
What an awful sight
But there's love in your eyes
Love in your eyes, love in your eyes
But maybe that's just your love of fights
All night!

[Chorus 3]
And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)

[Chorus 3]
And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(In love)

[Chorus 3]
And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you feel real love
(In love)

[Chorus 3]
And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(In love)

She a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
You make it hard for me to see somebody else
I'm calling her your name
Yeah, it's messed up 'cause I'm thinking 'bout you
It's your fault, babe, I never wanted us to break up
No, not this way, but you don't understand it, girl

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
When she touches me, I'm wishing that they were your hands
And when I'm with her, it's only 'bout the sex
With you, I had a bad romance
And if I could just trade her in, I would
'Cause nobody compares to you, no, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall, Both]
I think I better let her go (Go), 'cause I can't leave you alone (Oh)
Every day that I'm with her, all I want is you (Yeah)
I wanna leave but I'm afraid (Afraid), that you don't even feel the same (The same)
And now I realize, that she ain't you
No, she ain't you

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter]
Oh-oh, oh (Oh, no, no-no, no)
Woah-oh, oh (Oh, no, no-no, no)
Woah-oh (She ain't you)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
'Cause she ain't, no, she ain't you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I've been sleeping out for quite some nights now
It's not the same in my bed
But if she found out what's going on in my head
It'll be all bad, have me right back
But you don't understand it, girl, no

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter, Both]
When she touches me, I'm wishing that they were your hands
And when I'm with her, it's only 'bout the sex
With you, I had a bad romance
And if I could (And if I could) just trade her in, I would (I would)
'Cause nobody compares to you, no, yeah (Compares to you)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall, Both]
I think I better let her go (Go), 'cause I can't leave you alone (Oh)
Every day that I'm with her, all I want is you (Yeah)
I wanna leave but I'm afraid (Afraid), that you don't even feel the same (The same)
And now I realize, that she ain't you
No, she ain't you

[Bridge]
She a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she—

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall, Both]
I think I better let her go (Hey), 'cause I can't leave you alone (Woah-oh)
Every day that I'm with her, all I want is you, girl (Yeah)
I wanna leave but I'm afraid (Afraid), that you don't even feel the same (The same)
And now I realize, that she ain't you
No, she ain't you

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter]
Oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Oh na-na-na-na (Oh na-na-na-na-na)
Woah-oh, oh
Oh na-na-na-na (Hey, hey)
Woah-oh (She ain't you)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
'Cause she ain't, no, she ain't you

[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
I bongo with my lingo
And beat it like a wing, yo
To Congo, to Colombo
Can't stereotype my thing, yo
I salt and pepper my mango
Shoot, spit out the window
Bingo, I got him in the thing, yo
Now what? I'm doing my thing, yo
Quit bending all my fingo
Quit beating me like you're Ringo
You wanna go? You wanna win a war?
Like P.L.O. I don't surrendo'

[Chorus: Nesreen Shah]
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby

[Verse 2: M.I.A.]
I bongo with my lingo
And beat like a wing, yo
To Congo, to Colombo
Can't stereotype my thing, yo
I checked that mouth on 'im
Fucking checked that gas on 'im
I had him, cornered 'im
Fucking shut that gate on 'im
Why would you listen to him?
He had his way, I'm bored of him
I'm tired of him
I don't wanna be as bad as 'im
It's a bomb, yo
So run, yo
Put away your stupid gun, yo
'Cause see through like protocol
That's why we blow it up 'fore we go

[Chorus: Nesreen Shah]
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby

[Verse 3: M.I.A.]
Semi-9 and snipered 'im
On that wall they posted 'im
They cornered 'im
And then just murdered 'im
He told them he didn't know them
He wasn't there they didn't know him
They showed him a picture then
Ain't that you with the muslims?
He had Colgate on his teeth
And Reebok Classics on his feet
At a factory he does Nike
And then helps the family
Beat heart beat
He's made it to the Newsweek
Sweetheart seen it
He's doing it for the peeps
Peace

[Chorus: Nesreen Shah]
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby
The sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, my baby
And some showers I'll be aiming at you
'Cause I'm watching you, my baby

[Verse 1]
You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer
If you were mine
If you were mine
I wouldn't want to go to heaven

[Chorus]
Cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
You're ruling the way that I move
You take my air
You show me how deep love can be

[Verse 2]
You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer

[Chorus]
Cherish the Day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
Cherish the Day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
Won't run away

[Bridge]
You show me how deep love can be
You show me how deep love can be
This is my prayer

[Chorus]
Cherish the Day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
Won't run away
Won't shy

Cherish the Day
I won't go astray

I Cherish the Day

But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless (Yeah)
This is insane: the way the name growin'
Money keep flowin', hustlers move in silence
So, I'm tiptoein', to keep flowin'

Can't promise tomorrow, but I promise tonight (Dale)

Reach for the stars, and if you don't grab them
At least you'll fall on top of the world
Think about it, 'cause if you slip
I'm gon' fall on top of your girl, haha
What I'm involved with is deeper than the Masons, baby baby
And it ain't no secret
My granny's from Cuba, but I'm an American idol
Gettin' money like Seacrest
Put it on my life, baby (Baby) I'll make you feel right, baby (Baby)
Can't promise tomorrow, but I promise tonight, dale

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]

[Intro]
Damn...
Don't
Don't
Damn

[Verse 1]
Yeah, don't leave
Cause you're my oxygen
Without you I won't breathe
You're everything I want, need
For you I wear my heart on a short sleeve
I know some things need changing
That takes time; I need more, please
Say I ain't do everything I could've done
Like the shit that I did ain't good enough
Your friends said they been would've left
Ain't do you right, so you head to the left
I can't say that I blame you
Or ever thought that it would be this painful
People do it everyday, I can change too
But dealing with the heartbreak's what you can't do
True
And that's as real get
What you feel ain't easy to deal with

[Hook]
When you find the girl you love
Has gone
You ask yourself why life
Must go on
You beg your Lord above
To send someone your way
But deep inside you pray
Oh, He'll bring her back someday

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't go
How to live my life without you
I just don't know
What you feel in this relationship
It's not that it can't
It just won't grow
I say I love you, say it don't show
Fuck the money then, them gifts don't count
What about the smaller things you needed
And why the fuck you had to leave 'fore I seen it
Damn, I need your love like a weed stick
Me without you, like Kathy no Regis
I kept secrets
And couldn't apologize enough times
For messing with that freak bitch
But I can still tell that you're leaving
And like I said, I can't blame you the least bit
The crying shame is
That time's changing
Best friends become strangers
That's how it is

[Hook]
When you find the girl you love
Has gone
You ask yourself why life
Must go on
You beg your Lord above
To send someone your way
But deep inside you pray
Oh, He'll bring her back someday

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
And say yeah, and say yeah, and say yeah
One night in town, my niggas round
Throwing money, them bitches hit the ground
Then bring it back up, she bringin'  backup
Put em in that black truck
So many hoes, they lapped up
My niggas leaning
Diddy bopping, let's get it popping
I said lets get it popping
Just look at how she drop it
Little Mama a certified pro, she need her own show
Slide on down that pole and grind slow
Hell no, I ain't counting my dough
I came to blow it all
And get some brains
Trying to find, Mrs. Know It All
And I got my cup filled
Juicy how them bucks peel
Young pimp, see I grab me up a chick and just chill

[Refrain]
In the back of the club with a stack full of dubs
Drop it low like a pro
Bring it back, that's what's up
All my dogs up in here
Cause there's hoes everywhere
Niggas stunt like you don't care
Throw that money in the air
And say yeah

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm high and drunk, doing my same dance
They call her, Pocahontas
Doing that rain dance
Talking, dough I got it
So make it rain, man
Cause the flow retarded
Sorta like that Rain Man
Borderline insane man
Look at all these dames, damn
With a nigga getting money
And I'm a changed man
You smell that haze scent
Know my game plan
Trying to get it smacking
I ain't with that game plan
Lil mama work for every dollar
She drop it low, pop it slow
Stop and go
Lots of smoke
We keep 'em rolling up
Shawty mad, she came with you, she wanna roll with us

[Refrain]
And say yeah
I said listen here
I do it grande
All day
Smoking on that bomb, hey
And I got my cup filled
You see how them bucks peel
Young pimp, see I grab me up a chick and just chill

[Refrain]
Roll that money in one hand and say yeah
Throw that money in the air and say yeah
Roll that money in one hand and say yeah
Throw that money in the air and say yeah

[Intro: Lana Del Rey + sample]
Why? ("Got that?")
Who, me? ("Louder!")
Why? ("Got that?")

[Verse 1]
Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey ("Louder!")

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh—let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane ("Louder!", "Alright!")
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I—we were born to die

[Verse 2]
Lost, but now I am found
I can see that once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers I need ("Louder!")

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh—let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane ("Louder!", "Alright")
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I—we were born to die ("Louder!", "Got that")
We were born to die ("Louder!", "Alright")
We were born to die
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh—let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane ("Louder!", "Alright")
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I—we were born to die

[Outro]
("Got that?")
("Louder!")
We were born to die
("Got that?")
("Louder!")
("Got that?")
("Louder!")
("Got that?")
("Louder!")
("Got that?")
("Louder!")

[Verse 1]
Oh, wait a minute baby girl can we just sit down
There's a couple things we need to talk about
Like when you get mad at me, do you really mean what you say?
Or is it just one of them days, when things ain't goin' your way?
Can we talk about it without the shouting?

[Pre-Hook]
I know we got issues, don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think its time to rewind and start all over again

[Hook]
Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
Cause It won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know its hard
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But It won't be the last time, can't be the last time

[Verse 2]
Can't be the last time, that you get mad at me
For forgetting every little anniversary
Something silly like me leaving up the toilet seat
And it can't be the last time, when you say I don't do this
When you say I don't do that, but you know I ain't perfect
Got no way to explain it, but I know we can make it

[Pre-Hook]
I know we got issues, I don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think its time to rewind and start all over again

[Hook]
Everybody has there arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it

But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But It won't be the last time, can't be the last time

[Bridge]
Girl, I love the things you do
Reminds me of the reasons why I'm with you
Like when you walk out the door, when your clothes hit the floor
You were just about to break up, and now we 'bout to make up (yeah yeah)
Uh oh oh, oh oh oh ooh woah
Girl just say yeah
Oh oh oh oh, let's make up, oh

[Hook]
Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know its hard
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But it won't be the last time, it can't be the last time

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I hop up out my bed, got my swag on
Scrambled eggs, filet mignon, two trees blown just for cologne
Money never limited, so icy with benefits
My driver need a passport, all my cars are immigrants
It's so sickenin', history you're witnessin'
I had a girl, she quit me, now I'm single, wanna get with me?
Sticky cannot stick to me, if you see your chick with Gucci
Think before confrontin' 'ruly, ain't my fault your lady choosin'
4:30, still blowin' purpy, O.A. Verdy rollin' dirty
Wardrobe clean, that's just detergent, got your girlfriend pickin' purses
Say she lonely, Gucci only one way to meet me in person
When she get me home my nigga told me that she love my verses

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Your girlfriend keep callin' me, I feel like she stalkin' me
You at home and she with me, so mornin' it's an argument
Gucci Mane be doggin' it, beatin' her down straight poundin' it
Drillin' on your sheets, got your blanket at the laundromat
Way baby girl throw it back, old man might catch heart attack
Gucci Mane now hardly there, smack it like I'm mad at that
Sweaty sex, so passionate, oral sex, she mastered that
Pornographic poses like she posin' for the Internet
One hour not finished yet, never been a minute man
Always been a business man, got her catchin' feelings, man
Got a man? Oh really, ma'am? Actin' like I give a damn
Used to like her, now I don't, got a real short attention span

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci, Trey Songz, put it on, my shirt off when I perform
She say this her favorite song, she got on my favorite thong
She so hot, too hot to touch, to feel it, too much for lames
Gucci Mane, I'm extra clean, so extra rubbers on my brain
Got your main thing screamin' Gucci, every Tuesday night we do it
Wish we could do it more often, but I'm often somewhere flossin'
Lay it down like carpet, Barbie, Aston Martin, double-park it
Beat it like we got a problem, pop her 'til she call me papa
Freakin' partners probably never bother with a second option
Hoppin', got the mattress poppin', rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'
Freakin' partners probably never bother with a second option
Hoppin', got the mattress poppin', rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down

[Chorus]
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I wrote my will just the other week
And what's funny, it was only one sheet
And I know there's only one me
But I hope I am everything my son be
I'm tryin' live right, stay on the drum beat
But I'm in the fast lane, in the front seat
I wonder will I lose control of the Maserati
And hit some tree, just being young me?
Is there a heaven for G's and soldiers?
I can't go to hell, 'cause I'd take over
I feel it approaching, but I ain't scared
I made that bed and I should rest in peace

[Chorus]
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake

[Verse 2]
Yeah, and every time I see the sunshine
I drop down and give thanks at least one time
Feeling like I'm living on the front line
I'm feeling like every second is crunch time
I've had breakfast, will I make it to lunchtime?
And I ain't joking so don't be looking for punchlines
Will I be the next victim of a gun crime?
I don't know the answer, that's why I brung mine
Riding by myself late at night
Pistol on my lap at every single red light
Yeah, I made my bed right, so when I do I should sleep tight
In peace I rest

[Chorus]
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake

[Verse 3]
Bury me a gangsta cause that's what I live
Don't cry for me, I gave the best I could give
I can only do me, so that's what I did
And I cherish every breath of my kid
And I don't want to go before she grow, that ain't cool
But in this game of life, I don't make the rules
Shit, so that's why I get twisted
So I can't feel it when it hits me
And my moms don't need that on her
But I see death around the corner
And if he so happens to make his way around the block
You gotta answer the door when he knock, believe that

[Chorus]
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake

[Intro]
Yeah, get up
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA]
Yes, here we go again, give you more, nothing lesser
Back on the mic, it's the anti-depressor
Ad-Rock--no pressure--yes, we need this
The best is yet to come and, yes, believe this
Leggo my Eggo while I flex my ego
Sip on Prosecco, dressed up tuxedo
Sipping coffee, playing Keno in the casino
Want a lucky number, ask Mike Dino
I burn the competition like a flamethrower
My rhymes, they age like wine as I get older
I'm getting bolder, competition is wanin'
I got the ball and I see the lane and

[Chorus]
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
You gotta make some noise if you're with me
Crazy, crazy, crazy

[Verse 2: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA]
Armed insurrection, popular election
Get paid every year like tax collection
Hear my perfection, rotary connection
Taking MCs down by lethal rap injection
I'm like an ornithologist when I get pissed
You must have drank a Fizzy-Lifting Drink and you got lifted
And sifted, I'm just riffing
And when I catch MCs, it's time for wing clipping
I fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle
A seagull, I sniff suckers out like a beagle
My ego is off and running and gone
Cause I'm about the best and if you fess, well, that's wrong

[Chorus]
We got a--
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
You gotta make some noise if you're with me
Crazy, crazy, crazy
The break is crazy
Crazy-crazy

[Verse 3: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA]
Pass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision
I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching
Put it in formaldehyde and put it on the shelf
And you can show it to your friends and say, "That's my old self"
Can't do me nothing, can't tell me nada
Don't bug me now because I'm doing the lambada (bada!)
The forbidden dance (wha!), here's my chance
To make romance in my B-boy stance
Parlay romancing into financing
Opened up a restaurant with Ted Danson
The roaches check in, but they never check out
I set the record straight, no doubt

[Chorus]
We got a--
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
You gotta make some noise if you're with me

[Intro]
Yo, Mike G, nigga (What's up dog?) Man, shit nigga I'm just chillin', yo
No, I'm about to hook up with this bitch, she fine as hell nigga (She for real?)
Hell yeah nigga she fat as hell nigga (Ha-ha where you meet her at dog)
Shit nigga I was walkin my swag and I saw the bitch eatin', right?
She was done with the food, so you know, you know, I just walked up to her
And I just decided to ask her if she wanted something to eat nigga

[Verse 1: Hodgy]
I pick her up old school street sweeper
Ask her wanna eat she suggest pizza
Shorty got body she from little Puerto Rica
Said her cousin Lisa was at the bar with margaritas
She got a skirt leg tone stallion
Mi piace, but she didn't want Italian
We ride around cruisin', bumpin' old schools
I take back to 90's to bust an old move
I told her I can cook like an arm and a foot
Attached to the leg handcuffed to the bed
Take it to the house curious conversation
Unlock the door we committin' condensation
Hellbound horn sex baby I'm satan
I fuck shit up when up shit is vacant
By the time we use the bed I don't wanna get on
Unless you pull me out and suck right after she spit on
Told you I'mma feed you, told you I'mma feed you
Mouth fulla HB is what call indeed food
Told you I would feed you I told you I would feed you
And she looked at me like "Yeah I agree too"

[Hook]
My high's comin' down, I'm hungry
I finna to get somethin' to eat
Nuttin' too expensive but none too cheap
I dial up shorty number see if she wanna eat
I told her I'll feed you girl, I'll supply the food
What if I just let you starve, wouldn't I be rude?
I'll feed you girl, I'll supply the food
What if I just let you starve, wouldn't I be rude?

[Verse 2: Mike G]
She pretty sweet, your new girl is my new treat
Kitchen or dining room damn right I give her a feast
She got an appetite that can't be soothed with regular food
She only fuck with me cause I ain't a regular dude
She ain't a regular bitch, and no need to be rude
She on some other shit, fuckin' another bitch
Hell naw I ain't asked but she ain't gon' say no
First was 5th ave, tore down Rodeo
Told you I'd feed you, told you I'd feed you
Mouth fulla Mike G exactly what you need boo
Told you I'd feed you, told you I'd feed you
Looked me in the eyes with a face that agreed too

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jasper]
Face to face as we shoot up in the room
Reach in my pocket, pull out a fist of shroom
Now you faded off the high life high tip
Now you 'bout to suck on my fuckin' dick, bitch
As we look around the room off the shrooms
Odd Future faces start to turn into goons
Radical, we ate your body cold
Fuck the microwave I eat it like this, yo

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ha-ha, that bitch though I was gonna feed her
Turnt out I feed the fuckin' crew know what I'm sayin'
My wolves gotta eat know what I'm sayin', fuck it

[Intro: T-Pain]
Hey Hey, T-Swizzle (T-Swizzle)
T-Pizzle (T-Pizzle)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I'm like eight foot fo', blonde hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun, no I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents, but I'm still a thug
I'm so gangster, you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delights
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift & T-Pain & Both]
I had a dream last night
I had high top Nikes
I had diamonds in my mouth
And diamonds on my mic
By the time I woke I was singing
I'm on a boat, whoa oh-oh
'Cause I'm a singer turned rapper
Shorty I'm a make ya
Straight to the top, yo
Shorty I'm a take ya
You can call me T-Sweezy
Now I'm a rap star
Hey, It's a thug story
Now tell 'em who you are
Singer turned gangster
You don't want to fight me
Straight to the top
In my extra small white tee

[Bridge: T-Pain]
T-Swift and T-Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story now can you get with that?

[Outro: Taylor Swift & T-Pain]
What? What? I knit sweaters, yo!
What? What? Don't test me (beep)!
Hey, hold on...
Hold on, I didn't even say anything
I didn't even s-

I didn't even swear
She didn't, she didn- she didn't even swear
Hello? Ugh!

[Intro: Dennis Graham]
Alright, well, um, alright

You know what you—you know what you're doin' with it
You know, makin' it to the top
All the way to the top
Yeah, you do it for the money, and not the honey, you know what I'm sayin'? Hahahahahahaha
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse: Drake]
Part of me wish that I could meet with all you haters in person
They got a lot of feelings for me they just ain't certain
How to express themself when I walk into the club
And take stares like the fuckin elevators ain't workin', yeah
'Cause they know the promoter paid you
You wouldn’t have come if someone hadn’t of made you
You just lookin' forward to seein' woman that played you
And shittin' on the men they get engaged to
I swear it’s like, uh
More confidence and less fear
We can discuss it further when y'all manage to get here
Diddy here, O here, Skinny here, Rex here
And we just havin' one of those conversations 'bout next year
I'ma kill it I promise this how I know you mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't asking for much all I want is the

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Drake]
(Yeah) I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be (Yeah), I just wanna be successful (That's all I want, man)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (You gotta tell 'em, Trey)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah
And I don't know if I can do that with you, you know, so

[Verse 1]
Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Verse 2]
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Bridge]
Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore
Woah, anymore

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Outro]
A murderer, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah
BaTell 'Em I Said That"

Think it's all good until they run into some real G's
Holla tell us where it is
And I promise we'll leave
Hesitate to saying boy them lamma well squeeze
Please pay attention to this part of the bull
One time got robbed got shot got shook
Got a job started rhyming came up with a hook
Got a chain and some tats came up with a look

Fuck the image and perception they never tough as they look

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You damn right

Don't tell me real recognize real eventually they'll see

[Hook]

(Ain't no way you gon' weather this storm, hey!)
Yeah girl, you heard what I said, ooh
(Holla at 'em, Chris, let's go!)
I'm gonna make you wet the bed (Ooh, bed), bed (Bed), bed (Ooh)
I'm gonna make you wet the bed (Oh, bed), bed (Oh, bed), bed (Ooh)
I'm gonna make you wet the bed (Bed), bed (Bed), bed (Ooh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'ma put your legs behind your head when I make you wet the bed (Oh)

[Outro: Ludacris, Sevyn Streeter]
(Ooh)
Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip (Ooh)
As I kiss both sets of lip-lip-lips (Mwah!)
Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip
As I kiss both sets of lip-lip-lips (Mwah!)

[Verse 1]
Get some brand new kicks, couple hundred on the jeans
I been spendin' all this money, got me feelin' like a G
Hand-me-down gear, this some shit you never seen
Droppin' three stacks, now I'm so fresh, so clean
See, we never coulda dreamed of
All the shit me and my team does
Girls see me like, "Damn, you look good, now you cleaned up"
Feelin' fresh, got my teeth brushed
I'ma new kid, been waitin' to do this
They hatin' up on my plate, got some steak and it's Ruth Chris
Been feelin' like a true pimp, biatch
It's '05, I'm the Steelers, you the Seahawks
This weed I keep hittin' makin' me cough
The jolly giant, I'm Jack, smokin' the Beanstalk
I get hoes in boat shoes, style, I won't lose
Welcome to the old school, bitch

[Chorus]
Now my clothes look cleaner, and my kicks look flyer
We be buyin' more reefer, so my crew gettin' high
Now the girls keep callin', and the money keep comin'
I be jumpin' off the bridge, but I'ma hit the ground runnin'
When the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
I ask 'em, when the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
'Cause every single day, somethin' new to do
So I'ma keep on dreamin', hit snooze (Snooze)

[Verse 2]
Hit snooze, I ain't tryna wake up yet
I'ma keep on dreamin', be the straight-up best
And I'm blessed, everyday I'm gettin' straight-up fresh
My homies like, "Mac, damn, you get your cake up"
Yes, I did, that's the life I live, I grind all day
High school, sellin' mixtapes in the hallway
I bet they never thought I'd be this cool
Now they understand why I skip school
Had my dreams, wasn't worried at all
That's why if I'm gettin' bored, I go splurge at the mall
I got money (I got money), I got bitches (I got bitches)
I got everything they dreamin' of, and I ain't done shit yet
This major leagues, big business
Used to have a wish list, now I just give gifts
Shit, it make me happy
Here's how to reach me, you can get at me

[Chorus]
Now my clothes look cleaner, and my kicks look flyer
We be buyin' more reefer, so my crew gettin' high
Now the girls keep callin', and the money keep comin'
I be jumpin' off the bridge, but I'ma hit the ground runnin'
When the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
I ask 'em, when the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
'Cause every single day, somethin' new to do
So I'ma keep on dreamin', hit snooze (Snooze)

[Bridge]
When the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
I ask 'em, when the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
'Cause every single day, somethin' new to do
So I'ma keep on dreamin', hit snooze (Snooze)

[Chorus]
Now my clothes look cleaner, and my kicks look flyer
We be buyin' more reefer, so my crew gettin' high
Now the girls keep callin', and the money keep comin'
I be jumpin' off the bridge, but I'ma hit the ground runnin'
When the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
I ask 'em, when the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
'Cause every single day, somethin' new to do
So I'ma keep on dreamin', hit snooze (Snooze)

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You said I'm not giving enough
But baby girl, I'm trying so hard to keep up
When you fear that I'ma always leave you lonely
But you see that I want us to last forever
And my heart stays open
Darling, you know it will get better

[Pre-Chorus]
But you know this shit won't happen overnight
We just gotta give love a try
And when you look beside you
Girl, I'll be there

[Chorus]
When it rains down your face
Tell me where do the tears end up?
Don't wanna drown in the rivers of your sorrow
And I, I will swim a thousand miles just for one minute to see you smile, yeah
So I'm treading water, treading water
Please don't cry 'cause you're drowning me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2]
What do you say?
What do you mean that you blame me?
Why is it today that you're doubting me?
That I'ma always leave you lonely
But you see that I want us to last forever
And my heart stays open
Darling, you know it will get better

[Pre-Chorus]
But you know this shit won't happen overnight
We just gotta give love a try
And when you look beside you
Girl, I'll be there

[Chorus]
When it rains down your face
Tell me where do the tears end up? (Tell me where does the tears end up)
Don't wanna drown in the rivers of your sorrow (Oh, no)
And I, I will swim a thousand miles just for one minute to see you smile, yeah
So I'm treading water, treading water (Oh)
Please don't cry 'cause you're drowning me

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Young Khalifa, man
How fly
We already a quarter pound in on this one
High you?
Yeah, we killing these blogs!
You already know my nigga
Ain't no turning back now
This shit on smash

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Influenced by the reefer but I'm still positively speaking
Heading down to New Orleans fuck with Spitta for a weekend
Exotic bitches freakin', minks on the rug
I'm living Cliquot dreams, pouring drinks in the tub
One life to live, so I'mma live it up
Like you gotta pay for pussy, nigga
I don't give a fuck
Blow it on some new threads
Chickens give me new head
One look at my charm, they say I ain't doing too bad
My palms itching like you did when you rolled in grass
Flick another joint, I'm here but I just hope it lasts
On the beach with my amigos smoking hella Zags
Love the life we lead so we just make a toast and laugh
You say another day, I see it as another plane
Another dollar, another reason to ensure the fame
Every city they repping, they knowin' my name
We the Gang, Taylor-Jets painted on the wing

[Hook: Curren$y]
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Fly niggas do fly things
Smoking weed with your bitch is the song we sing
Fly niggas do fly things
On the road to riches and diamonds rings
Fly niggas do fly things
Take the pictures 'front the Chevy is the song we sing
Kids looking up to me cause I'm a G

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Would it be cliche
To start my verse by saying something that I always say
The planes got it
I perfected my roll in the science of aeronautics
I swear on my soul I would never cosign no nonsense
Muscle car auction
I just cop it and then garage it
Wait on the night to set then really pop it and drive it
Bitches run on side it
Like those little Jamaican kids who saw that Benz with Buns and Ox inside it
Word to Wale, Spitta OT in DC for 4 or 5 days
I got enough pair of fresh J's in my Crooks bag
Smelling like a pound, TSA what they looking at
Wanna pat me down, came up with nothing cousin
Pull away from ground transportation puffin'
Baking kush berry muffins
Mind on a million, trying to get this shit is puzzling
In the grand scheme of things, where you sit in this discussion

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse: Eminem (as B-Rabbit)]
Now, everybody from the 313
Put your motherfuckin' hands up and follow me!
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfuckin' hands up! Look, look
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
One, two, three, and to the four
One Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four
Four Pac, three Pac, two Pac, one
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfuckin' MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standin' here screaming, "Fuck the Free World!"
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence' parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
At his fucking yearbook; fuck Cranbrook!
Fuck a beat, I'll go a cappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer
Fuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me

[Outro: Anthony Mackie (as Papa Doc)]
Yo...

[Hook]
All day long, do it like Tony

Got a sign on my dick, bad bitches only
Got a sign on my dick, bad bitches only

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Well it's that nigga you call T-Raw
Runnin' that money like Madoff

Then she gettin' laid off
I ain't got no time, ho, stop blowin' up my cell phone
Sweatin' me like headbands, call that bitch Rondo
I'm fresher than the prom, ho, teach her we don't fly coach
She fuckin' but she act dumb, kick her out my condo
Real G's, Last King, Young Money ballin'
I give her a couple of shots and then she turned an alcoholic
Metaphorically you're a toilet and I'm shittin' on your forehead
2 Girls 1 Cup, yup
We did it again Last King, YMCMB
I don't pay for bitches, bitches pay me, uhh

[Hook]
All day long, do it like Tony
Fuck her friend then I pass her to the big homie

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
Knock knock, who the fuck is there?
Sign on my dick that say, bad bitches come in here
Make a freak whore, detour
Straight to my partner room and let him beat it like a keyboard
All I do is dick em', I don't tip em' like a stripper
Man, I gotta' ton of chicks under my belt like a zipper (Yeah)
Walk up in the club, pick em' out and then I pick em' off
Pick em' up and knock em' down and then I drop em' off
I'mma dog, keep you girl from around my type
Or she'll be milkbox material and missin' for the night
Man this shit is just that easy when yo' pockets sittin' right
I turn my bed into a stage and let yo' bitch rock on my mic

[Hook]
All day long, do it like Tony
Fuck her friend then I pass her to the big homie
Got a sign on my dick, bad bitches only
Got a sign on my dick, bad bitches only
Big bank roll, do it like Tony

Got a sign on my dick, bad bitches only
Got a sign on my dick, bad bitches only

[Intro - Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah! All this Louis Vuitton
I see clearly now
Ocean view, you deserve it
I do this for you

[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
Say the trees couldn't get better
Need this sort of weather
Sand beneath your toes
Your drinks come with umbrellas
Cutting off our phones
Ignoring important texts and email messages
Say I do it big
I can't do it less than this
Them other niggas talking shit
She ain't impressed with them
Yet to spend. And we been here for a minute
That explains all the trips I invested in
It's funny how all the fussing and fighting
Turn around into us fucking and flying
Every night on the road you call me up and you crying
Was worried about them bitches, now you too busy picking diamonds
Ain't worried bout a price
Cause if you want it I got it and I'mma pay for it
The good weed's lit, the champagne's poured
Order whatever you want if you got a taste for it
It's every girl's dream, but you awake for it

[Hook] x4
Fly you to where I am
I'll fly you!

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
And you, know how it goes I go harder than a bitch
Pardon my French, but I work hard for this
You never had to see me on no starving artist shit
But mama when you caught me cheating thought that you would call it quits
Knew fuckin' with me that you was takin' all the risks
So you ain't trying to give in
Saying I'll be straight and you'll be the one hurt in the end
And that's no good!
Just tryna put you in the game like a coach would
Everything going just how it should, now your friends jealous
They hating on us. But we so far they can't tell us
The life we livin' it was made for us
When you're ready, give me a call, I'll be waiting on it
All you gotta do is hit me when you land and I'll pick you up from the airport
And take you straight to the villa we don't stay at resorts
5-star suites, spend weeks at the day spa
Mama keep your day job, I'mma..

[Hook] x4
Fly you to where I am
I'll fly you!

[Verse 3 - Wiz Khalifa]
And no matter where we go, you
Say you never been
She in love, cause I keep it G
Not cause the Gs that I spend
But I DO spend Gs on expensive weed
Vintage sneaks and hotel room keys
Came for a day, stayed the whole week
Red-eye, no sleep - window seat

[Hook] x4

[Verse 1]
Fame (Fame), makes a man take things over
Fame (Fame), lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame (Fame), puts you there where things are hollow
Fame (Fame)

[Chorus 1]
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane ('Sane)
Fame (Fame)

Fame (Fame), what you get is no tomorrow
Fame (Fame), what you need, you have to borrow
Fame (Fame)

[Chorus 2]
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame (Fame)

[Bridge]
Could it be the best, could it be?
Really be, really, babe?
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?
Could it, babe? Could it, babe?

[Verse 3]
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame (Fame), fame, fame, fame

[Intro - Wiz Khalifa]
Uh! I'm smoking right now..

[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa]
Adjust my Louie V vision
Fall up in the spot
As long as me and my gang get in
Every nigga I came with, came to spend chips
On popping champagne and tipping waitresses
G’d up, what you think this is?
Put your feet up, this the fast, life mama speed up
Pop the cork, roll the weed up
Nowadays ain’t fucking with the bar
Still ain't nothing changed but the horses in my car
Usually ain’t into showing hoes where I live
But tonight we gon’ go to my crib
Be on your toes, your boyfriend smell that weed on your clothes
He don’t know what I did, drop you off at your whip
Work by 8, almost 6, plus your nigga calling
Think he starting to catch wind
Look at your phone, press end
Can’t hurt him with what he doesn’t know
Plus you figure we’re both grown, come on

[Hook - Wiz Khalifa]
Money ain’t a thang
Tell the waitress call and bring a bottle for every nigga that’s here with me
That’s the kinda G-Shit I’m on
G-Shit I’m on, G-Shit I’m on
Got niggas rolling weed
Bitches with their hands in the air
Tell the DJ damn that’s my song
I ain’t trying fall in love with you
Let me fill your cup then find our way home

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
High off the life I’m living
Rooftop you gonna need binocular vision
Order a few shots and them things that you say you do not do
You probably gonna give in
Say it’s wrong, I call it a statement for the mission
To get you high as you want, break dress code
Skip the line to the front
Ride top down, fire the skunk, soon as the dooby get down
Roll another one
Need a couple of you, bring my brother one
The bitches can’t roll weed, I ain’t fucking with them
That’s just real shit, spend Vegas chips, all expense paid trips
Buy the champagne and spill it, we don’t save a sip
And you here with me in VIP taking risk
Home girl saying shit like "Rosé my favorite"
Plus I’m rolling up all this weed you ever smell
Weed in your hair, weed in your nail, she under a spell

[Verse 1:]
Ah ah ah ah...
Gunna lick lick lick u up
Gunna beat beat beat it up
Gunna eat eat eat u up
Put them legs up on my shoulder
Eat it like a vulture
I'm a gunna make your love
Make your love come down now
I'm a make it vibrate (blurrr)
With ma tounge
I'm a make it vibrate(bluurrr)
Till u cum
Gotta take my umbrella out and get ready
Bout pull down squirt out really heavy

[Hook:]
Stckyy face
Sugar so sweet can I get a taste
Strawberry whip cream on my cake
Don't I put a smile on your pretty face with my sticky face
Sticky face headin down town to my faviorte place
Gotta appaitie for your candy
And I'm a put a smile on your pretty face
With my sticky face

[Verse 2:]
Whacha doin girl I'm feelin kinda horn-ney
Madda fact girl I'm feelin kinda hungry
Apple vibe girl gunna heat you up
Ice cream dippin down gunna lick it up
My tounge moves faster than a cheeta... cheeta
Had them legs shakin like a seizure seizure
My old man taught me how to keep her eat her
If you don't lick it she gunna leave ya leave ya

[Hook: x3]
Sticky face
Sugar so sweet can I get a taste
Strawberry whip cream on my cake
Don't I put a smile on your pretty face
With my sticky face
Sticky face headin down town to my faviorte place
Gotta appaitie for your candy
And I'm a put a smile on your pretty face
With my sticky face

[Verse 1]
First scene
Producers pointin' like action
As the chain swing
Lettin' shine, no sheen
Just my dream
Turn reality
Well done, they say to me
How flatterin'
I’m just making it work like batteries
Abuse and batter me
But never wanna challenge me
Leave 'em shivering
Lookin' in the mirror, like who can fuck with him?
Young troublesome, that the ladies love!
Packed show at the club, who said wait 'til 21?
Asked who booked, promoter didn’t even look my way
Ha, ok
Party people doin' what I say
Hands in the air pat ya belly that's enough, eh
Just seein' how much I can get away with
Lookin' for a bird to get away with
Fly in my spaceship
Take her back to where I live
Next to God crib
You ain’t never been higher than this

[Hook]
Young hollywood star livin' lavish
Lookin' back what a habit
Everybody like what happened?
Feel like I’m movin' backwards
Tyga please show out for the camera
Now everything's flashing
Sittin' here like what happened?
Feel like I’m movin' backwards

[Verse 2]
Will your friends go
If you had to choose
International we'll be travelling 'til we old and blue
That’s how family do
But what about if they ain't paid they dues
Well I guess I’ll pay for that too
Accountant tellin' me how much I withdrew
In the last past year or two
Ain’t gotta say it so loud, you know
I’m just tryin' to keep my people proud
I’m the one they counting on to bring the members around
I ain’t kiddin' my mind is far from small child
I’m on some Mike Tyson shit up in the first round
Knock ya down
And then I smile
Throw in the towel
I’m so foul
X-rayin' every girl blouse
Forgive me, I’m back calm now
Less energy
Late-ly
I don’t know what’s gotten in to me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My heart beats
Echoes into the cold streets
Where nightmares and darkness begin to meet
As I see
Nobody cares about my history
Not even me
Holdin' tight to my rosary
I’m just hoping, someone notice me
Hopefully
Sign a CD
But right now, does it look too shabby, T?
Look down can't even see my feet
Everything's blurry
But now, no more worries for me
Maybe go on Maury
As the rapper that used to be
These days they won't even accept me
Except me
Some Excedrin
To get rid of conception
Drugs are a blessing
To someone with no breakfast, damn
It’s so hard being exited, out
Tryna figure out
What my whole life's been about
Can't even do that right
Will I ever see the light?
We back in the limelight Mike?

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
She be jumping up and down
Trynna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour
Just to get that belt to fasten
All she wanna talk about is partying and fashion
Don't know where she going
But I do not plan on asking at all
Cause her spirit is free
And she, lets nobody else in except for me
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree
I’m the only one she loves
There’s no copies of the key
Homie, that’s a guarantee

[Verse 2]
Don’t forget that Fendi purse that you put all your cash in
Kinda hard to concentrate when cameras are flashin’
Other dudes would suffocate her, I don’t want her gaspin’
Don’t know where she’s going
And I do not plan on asking at all
I’ve never been the type, felt alike
My connection with niggas that wanna fight
Over women, that's not right
There's too many in the world
Homie, you can have your pick
But I swear that ones my girl
I swear that one’s my girl!

[Part 1: Fish]

[Verse 1]
Slip it in her drink, and in the blink of an eye
I can make a white girl look chink
Don't know what to think, 'cause last time I attempted this shit
The judge ordered me to see a shrink
Started with the link
Contended her to meet me at the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink
We was uniquely in sync
Already fuckin' and we only met last week
We were both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was working for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
You can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
No, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep
The neighbors by the creek says my house stinks
And it reeks on the sheet, girl
Streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seeks
Which make meats for my obvious feasts
Used to just blot up thoughts, plot, and rethink
Now I get daughters and tie 'em and clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink
Where they get cut up to fit my physique
Critique my chic in this brand new mink, go

[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohh (Fish!)
Oh, oh
Oh, ohh
(Yeah) Oh, oh (Wolf Gang)
(Wolf Haley) Oh, ohh (How you doin'?)
(All good?) Oh, oh (Cool)
(We cool?) Oh, ohh (I'm upset)

[Verse 2]
Bitches running 'round down, pussy take a trip
Make her strip, got my dick harder than the unzip
Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket
Film clips popping on that Canon
Busting Ottoman cannons, on the pill
Is he real? Gaza stripping (In my living room)
Wolf Gang full moon, I'm assuming mushrooms (Mushrooms)
I'm a necrolampoon, not of Charles Mansoon
This fuck is ending soon because I'm ejaculating

[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohh (Fish!)
Oh, oh
Oh, ohh

[Bridge: Frank Ocean & (Tyler, The Creator)]
(Frankie, Frankie)
Now I'd like to take this time of day
To thank the Mother Earth (Thank you Momma, thank you Momma, fish!)
Letting the sun shine down on the lake
While I fish your waters
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters
Hell, hide grandmama too (Grand, yeah)
'Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool
He on the loose, yeah (Yeah)

[Outro]
Got to wash it down, all this gold is fuckin' bait
Wait 'til you see the semen swimming
Baby, please not half, the whole is great
Morals? Your body's near that coral reef
It was once upon a time you came home with me
Then the next chapter left you in my teeth
Fill your gills with goo
Going deeper than Pacific Ocean
This specific motion
Makes this hammerhead puke
Got to wear a wetsuit, can’t get seasick
I love when you're in fishnets, you want me to eat you
You’re fucking wet, fish

[Part 2: Boppin' Bitch]

[Chorus]
So I met this girl at the club
And I just wanted her to suck my dick
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch
Now she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot
Until we go to another room
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin'

[Verse 1]
This little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks
Than them other sluts fuck for, real easy
Cause I didn't even knock on the front door, sleazy
I used the welcome mat as a cum rag
And all the Wolves fucked too, yeah she’s a cum bag
Filled with a bunch of shit I purchased at a drug store
Four more Dora-looking sluts let me explore
Until my cock got sore and started growing cold sores

[Chorus]
Now she thinks that I like her
But all I really wanted was that mouth
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch
Now she text messages me every day
And I don't ever hit that bitch back
And that's because
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch (That's right), she's a boppin' bitch, she's a boppin'

[Verse 2]
This little hoodrat started jockin' at my jock strap
Until my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped
Flapping up and down until the cack finally go splat
Now you gotta spat, spit it out until you do scat
Then you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings
You wasn’t feeling shit when you was down there kneeling
Now shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with

[Interlude]
Now, now why can't we fuck with this bitch? (She's boppin')
Wait, tell him why we can’t fuck with this bitch, y'all? (That bitch she boppin')
What is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? (She boppin')
She, what do she be doin'? (She boppin')

[Chorus]
Now I'm at a fuckin' clinic
'Cause my dick is swollen and keeps itchin'
Nigga, I'ma kill this bitch (She's a boppin' bitch)
Bitch (She a boppin' bitch)
She a boppin' bitch

[Outro]
Where's my gun? (She boppin') I'ma kill this bitch
Why am I gon' kill this bitch?
To all my niggas out there listenin', that bitch (She's boppin')
And don't let her suck your dick or you'll get hurt

[Dj Drama]
Nah you been sayin the wrong one
Lemme say it right for you
Ya'll need to be saying teach me how to MC
(Dj Drama fuck these niggas up)

[Tyga: first verse)

Still RIP beats no flaws
One verse one hearse funeral 12 bars

In the locker room dawg
And she gettin lockjaw (ahhhh)
Betty the boop betty the boop
Give me the loot Give me the loot
B I G in the suit
GI Joe Tyga man army shorts red chucks
No shirt, young nigga tatted up
Nigga I go dumb count my cash throw the ones
Being famous so fun
Yea I do what can't be done
So pay attention
Hello my name's Dr. greenthumb
Pillow flow niggas too soft
& if your rolly tick tock then that shit didn't cost
Put some VS in my watch now it's water off a duck
No problemos bitches let me fuck
Yeah I spent a G on lunch
Mr. Chow bow down like a nigga gotta hunch
Hunchback Bentley Coupe brown leather like a blunt
You can have her heart I just want the cunt
Please excuse my manners
Ima eat the beat and make the track vanish
Flow flow crazy so outlandish
I can't fuck your girl I got standards
Niggas gay Adam Lambert
They went broke, Mc Hammer
Big booty bitch ima pants her
Hopped up on that dick and she turned into prancer
Biggity bounce 40 ounce
40 inch ass damn lemme pull my ruler out
Lemme do that in your mouth
Grab a towel spit it out
Now I gotta go
Go gotta do a show
Aoowww
(W-wel-wel-well donee)

[Intro]
Haha
Yeah
Had to do this one
One time

[Verse 1]
Hello, death, it seems that we meet again
You keep taking friends that I'll never see again
I guess they gotta leave
But if we pretend that they never left
Well, we gon' see them then
Never leave our heart, never leave our thoughts
As time goes by, they'll never be forgot
Life goes on, though I wish that they was there
Shit like this never gonna seem fair, yeah
So can I have a moment of silence
For anyone who's gone from the coldness of violence?
And I know you wanna see me go to college
But I'm sorry, I don't think that I'ma make it
Because this world is mine for the takin'
So when I get famous, they gon' know what your name is
And no one understand what the pain is
And how the blood run numb where my veins is
I'd like to thank you, 'cause you made me a man
Told me to never let it go, so I'm taking a stand
Always in the crowd when I played in the band
Your grandson is everything I say that I am
And maybe I am a little bit over my head
But I'm feeling so alone tryna cope with your death
Holding my breath, wishing I had one more day
Wishing you could be there when I graduate
Ugh, and it's sad to say
That no one in this room understand me
I know you had to leave, so rest in peace
But please, can you watch over Nanny?
'Cause she loved you, and I love you
All the prayers I'm saying may bug you
But I'm just checking in on what you up to
So, how they treating you up there?
Too stubborn for a cane, way too cool
Sleeping at your house, walking me to school
Thought I was a fool when my grades started slipping
When I played ball, you was always in admission
You loved me more than I've been loved before
And that's a type of thing that everyone ignores
But not me, you got me
Always and forever, Poppy

[Chorus]
Time goes by, going without you
Hope you know I've been thinking about you
And I know, I know, I know, I know
That they took you from your home
But you're in my heart
So I'm never gonna be alone
Time goes by, going without you
Hope you know I've been thinking about you
And I know, I know, I know, I know
That they took you from your home
But you're in my heart
So I'm never gonna be alone

[Hook: Kanye West & (Wiz Khalifa)]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
You will, you will
Hey hey hey hey (Okaay!)
Please say you will (hahah, yeah)
For real (Ay, ay)
I pray you will (ay)

[Verse 1]
And they say don't say it 'less you mean it
Back when I was young
I said "I will be the one", people said they couldn't see it
But on the other hand, there was some saying I be this
Nigga on top, soon as you say I'm defeated
T-Pain, they saying they couldn't believe it
Funny 'cause now they say the same thing when they see me
The way I spit you would say I was bulimic
And this beat so hard, I had to say I did a remix
Niggas hate, they don't say it but they think it
When you lame, I can't hear what you saying when you speaking
Another plane, my mother saying "get some sleep in"
I can't, I'm living out what others saying they dream is
Now the hoes say that I'm conceited
'Cause they wanna give me brains, and I say that I don't need it
I'm getting paid and paying so much attention
To what radios playing and what they saying in meetings
I ain't saying I'm that deep in
But I'm saying I got my feet in
In a year they gon' say I'm Michael Phelps
And you gon' think to yourself, before you jump in that deep end
It was said that my city sleeping
Out of state, I had to say what that P meant
"I put on" like Kan' said on that Jeezy
Come to where I live, the kids say I'm like He-Man
Doing everything that you say I can't
Not a stroke of luck, player, you can say I plan
Tired of saying shit to make these niggas understand
So I'll be everything that you say I am
Very strange, yes
You niggas too plain, I'm a Taylor Gang Jet
And my lane's left, I talk money so I save breath
And niggas say I'm lucky, I say that I'm blessed

[Interlude]
Every goddamn day
Yeah, and I work hard too
You know, I ain't just pop up out of nowhere
Been doing this shit
Hahahah
T-G-O-D Boiii
Yeah
(Matter of fact... Okay)

[Verse 2]
Hundreds on the mattress, twenties on the floor
Kids with dirty handguns posted by the door
When I was 14 they used to send me to the store
To bring back blunts, now I'm the one rollin' up
Speakers bump, iPhone plug-in for my truck
E. Knievel, showing you niggas how to stunt
I mess up flows like waves and potholes
West Coast, I fuck hoes and eat Roscoes
Got gold with diamonds in it
All the finest linen
Versace, City tryna lock me (Hahahaha)
That's my Biggie flow right there
I dunno if y'all caught that but that's that Biggie flow though

[Outro]
Yeah, bitch!
Khalifa man, '09 star year
Got what you need right here, boy
Quit tryna be somebody and be yourself
Yeah (Hahaha)
And um...  I don't know
Just look out for the next one
Bitch

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section.80, HiiiPoWeR

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
Unless you eatin' pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfuckin' pistol
Aimin' it at a pig, Charlotte's web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugarcoat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want a plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you motherfuckers waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean this shit is
Huey Newton going stupid, you can't resist his
HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry, mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fuckin' widow's peak, uh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uh
Dear Lord, come save me, the devil's working hard
He probably clockin' double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightenin', so fuckin' frightenin'
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I'm standing on a field full of land mines
Doin' the moonwalk, hopin' I blow up in time
'Cause 2012 might not be a fuckin' legend
Tryna be a fuckin' legend, the man of mankind
Who said a Black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean this shit is
Bobby Seale makin' meals, you can't resist his
HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Bridge: Alori Joh & (Kendrick Lamar)]
Every day, we fight the system just to make our way
We been down for too long, but that's alright
We was built to be strong, 'cause it's our life, na-na-na
Every day, we fight the system, we fight the system
We fight the system (Never like the system)
We been down for too long, but that's alright, na-na-na

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Who said a Black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked, we was racin' with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightenin', so fuckin' frightenin'
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang
The drama it bring is crazy, product of the late '80s
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the Navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
'Cause a riot, throw a Molotov
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
'Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean this shit is
Fred Hampton on your campus, you can't resist his
HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]

[Hook]
And we danced
And we cried
And we laughed
And had a really, really, really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives
Our lives (our lives)
Our lives (our lives)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Tonight (tonight!)
Tonight (tonight!)
Tonight!
Cause tonight's the night
Am I right?
Dance

[Verse 1]
Feels like the night for a party
My nature's so naughty
There's a knock on the door
It's the neighbors, quit cock-blocking
We're having a ho-down, are you hoes down?
Don't make me pull my hose out
Cause it's big, long, pink, strong
And been known to dance, like, all night long
Grab my hand, play this song
DJ, save my life, come on!
Leave your fear, back off the wall
Free of beat and pussy pop
And if you don't have a pussy
Pop a cock into a booty, into a booty
Yeah, yeah

[Hook]
And we danced
And we cried
And we laughed
And had a really, really, really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives

[Verse 2]
I am not, I am not going to stand on the wall
I will dance, I will dance, I will break that ass off
And I see you in the corner, corner looking so small
Doing the robot like, "If I die tonight, at least I went hard"
I will not, I will not give a damn who watches me
I will live, I will live! Liberate the fox in me
I will be the discoball, freakin' give my all
To whatever girl's booty I'm freaking on
I'm not skeeting, nah it's just freaking hot
Alright, I skeeted

[Verse 3]
I will not be a mannequin
The ego banished
The roof's on fire
Let's burn down the Vatican
I will moon walk to Pluto in honor of Michael Jackson
In heaven he'll be saying that man is tight at dancing
Rip to the king, Michael Jackson, we learned it all from you
Dedicate this to the dance floor
Party up the sorrow 'til tomorrow morning happens
We pledge allegiance to the DJ
Put your hands up

[Hook]
And we danced
And we cried
And we laughed
And had a really, really, really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives
Our lives

[Bridge]
You see me looking at you from that bar right over there
But your friends are huddled up and they are hating on a player
I just want to dance with you, get on the back of you
Tip tap the boots, extract the truth
Da- Dance with you, get on the back of you
Da- Dance, dance, dance
Awesome

[Ad-Lib]
Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh

Hey-oh, hey-oh

And remember this moment for the rest of our lives

[Verse 1 - Curren$y]
It's the Planes and the Taylor Gang
And I'm
Fucking with the chronic cause the chronic give me dopeness
Center of the camera focus
Once the car service doors open
I'm with a chick you only seen on magazine covers posing
I really know this bitch
I won't tell you I got it unless I could show you it
I'm not gon' tell you about it until I go through it
Formula One car, code word for solo whip
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you I'm cool
Weed lit
Lights flipped up on the Porsche
The same model Tony escaped from the club with
When them haters tried to knock him off
That's cold
Destroyer of the track I am Spitta Destro
You in the club line obeying the dress code
I drive by
Bitches making googley eyes
Google me Ma
I do that music so beautifully, huh
Believe that
Jets nigga retweet that

[Refrain: Curren$y]
And In the Middle we stay calm we just drop bombs
In the Middle we stay calm we just drop we just drop
In the Middle we stay calm we just drop bombs
In the Middle we stay calm we just drop we just drop

[Verse 2 - Wiz]
Jets, Taylor Gang
You know the slang
Bad bitches feeding me champagne
Show up smelling like weed on the plane
People cut they eyes but they don't say shit
Rep Taylor Gang plus the Planes bitch
Polo Socks
Bad Bitches dig em cause they know the flow so hot
They be at my shows hoping one day they can meet us
And maybe we'll smoke
I ain't on no Hollywood shit
You sexy and know how to handle your weed
You probably cook bitch
Bong rips send us to Hong Kong trips
My life is a movie stick to the script
Can tell that it's quality before its lit
He is I and I am him
Some bitches a lot of weed and gin
Tattoos cover half my skin
Hoes scream Taylor Gang out they roof
Plus they love the Jets music
Lemme hear it

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, Coca-Cola, yayo bought me everything
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boil-a, boil-a, boiling water, damn I got a forced game
Snort-a, stort-a, make an offer, no prob', I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Mi casa su casa partna, mi casa so full of rastas
More ganja than reefer farmers, you couldn't see me with binoculars
White girl with me, Cindy Lauper, multi deep like Frank Sinatra
Gave ten birds to Waka Flocka, told him drop 'em, Moreland Plaza
Flow sick like the morning after, try me then your skull get fractured
Ransom your little handsome son, so sad that your first daughter captured
Gucci hot as boiling water, my pack just came cross the border
Your girlfriend's a major snorter but that bitch ain't worth a quarter
Don't give that another thought-a, if you serve me then get shot up
Ounce, a half, a eighth, a quarter, send my goons to do the slaughter
Hustle hard, got from my father, take no shit, got from my mother
Never snitched and never will, I put that on my baby brother

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, Coca-Cola, yayo bought me everything
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Only one dude and I'ma smoke my reefer
Cruise through the city in my new two-seater
Stay lowkey, get dough with my people
Maybe try to find me a blow a little cheaper
Only one dude and I'ma ride around town
Work got low, bitch dropped a few pounds
Count a few checks, deal 'em out
Shoot a little dice, blow a little loud
Sell a little powder, make a few thou'
Turn them into millions standing tall as Yao
Mean mug every nigga on my team
Nigga say anything, folk will hit him in his mouth
Back in the day, they said I wouldn't be shit
Tell them fuck niggas, "Nigga, look at me now!"
Money on my dick, they worse than they bitch
It don’t make no sense, we just laugh at them clowns
Pull up to the club, everybody like, "Wow!"
Watch cost a car, car cost a house
Catch me in the club, I'm stunting on the couch
Balling like a baller, me and Gucci ballin' out
Shawty got it for the low, who said it was a drought?
Swag run so hard, man these hoes like (Ow!)
Well known in the North, raised in the South
Connected out West, get 'em in, get 'em out

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
In the kitchen with Patrick Swayze, me and the yay is dirty dancing
Drop a gold deuce and it white just like some Louie glasses
Stupid Brick Squad chickens in, stankin' through the plastic
Gettin ‘em in and gettin’ em gone; definition of a trapper
I'm the hottest thing walkin' 'round in East Atlanta
So I'm like a baby, shittin' like a damn Pamper
Ooh, they hate my swag cause these bars is Alaska
Hip-hop police got me workin' under the scanner
Coca-Cola, where's the water? Watch this dough, I serve this order
One on the window cause the police just might smell this odor
Barber shops and beauty parlors just to cover dirty dollars
White girl was super dirty so I put her in the shower

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila, boila, boiling water, damn I gotta forced game

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
Soo Woo! To the B gang, it’s a G thang, see me

Work the wheels and hold the gun
Smoke out my pistol, I wish you’d run
Nigga win some like, "Which one?
Hundred round chopper or the handgun?"
Heard I ain’t never lost none, got nicks and dimes, you want some?
I’m a legend in the hood like Big Pun
Got bales of the mid you want some? I bought them
Waka Flocka, Flocka Waka, midgrade bought me everything

Still in the kitchen, flickin' the wrist

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Feds coming after us, niggas talkin' 'bout jackin' us
Married to that white girl so bitch, I ain’t no bachelor
Brick Squad, Re-Up Gang, motherfuckin' yayo club
Lookin for another one cause I ran off on my last plug
Off white Jag, white truck, white Lambo
All white Porsche four door going HAM ho
You know who I am ho (Yo Gotti!) you say I robbed your brother
I don’t give a damn though; he must've had the yams low
He must've had them grams off, weighing what I paid for
Too many of them bands, now he laying on his man's floor
I’m Yo Gotti nigga, and I’m from North Memphis
In East Atlanta Zone 6 and I got the North with me

You in that Mitsubishi, I'm in that Bentley GT
I'm takin' trips with Papi (You walkie-talkie copy)
I got them Pookie fiends, might rock some Juicy jeans
I mean some Juicy sweats; maybe some blue Giuseppes
I play foul, no free-throw
Bitch I ball, no free show, deadass, no peep-show
Bought our own condo, water-front condo
Daughter, son dundo; watchin' Telemundo
Flyer than a rocket, money in my polly-pocket
What you coppin'? Keep that work inside my Pippi Longstocking, bitch

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, Coca-Cola, yayo bought me everything
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boil-a, boil-a, boiling water, damn I got a forced game
Snort-a, stort-a, make an offer, no prob', I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars

[Intro]
Well I got up today and I put on my shades
And I said I was fine (I’m fine)
But everyone knew that I was lying (What you mean?)
If you look at my face (What you looking at?)
And the way that I behave (I ain't doing nothing strange)
You will still see a disguise (Hm)
Even if you was blind (damn)

[Hook]
But now I'm saying bye, goodbye
American Dreaming
American dreaming
It's not that hard to find
Cause most of the time
I’m American sleeping
I barely can see it
But now I'm saying bye, goodbye

[Verse 1]
As I rhyme and I rap
The average listener is blind to the fact
That my mind has been tapped (tapped)
I carry the World as it lies on my back (back)
My spine could've cracked so
Please pay me no mind as I laugh
This is all just a stage, every line is an act
I'm killing the American dream with a trap
Like an axe, I’ma put it in a sack
Then put it in the back of a black Cadillac
As I’m traveling
Some say that I’m thrown like a javelin
I’m really tryna get you exposed to the galaxies
Then break off the mould to normalities
People called the election a tragedy
Looking at the screen like "This can’t be happening" (NO!)
I ain't saying that I’m some kind of activist
But something must be attacking us

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Okay, bring it back
I was spending my time just posing (just posing)
Like a mannequin you pass by (pass by)
Tryna make it one day to the big league
Where the girls ain't hard to find
All the time, I was just searchin' for a plastic promised land
And I got myself entangled in a corporated plan (sign here)
But a dream is nothin'
And it’s everything at the same time
So you never know when you might wake up
And find you was just living a lie
So goodbye, just like Trey said
Goodbye America, bye
Cause anything but the truth is a waste of time

[Hook]

[Hook]
All my niggas that be hustling we up tonight
And all my niggas that struggle we up tonight
And all the girls around the world going out tonight
Take a shot make toast we up for life, and we up

[Tyga - Verse 1]
Uh, just made 50 in a tri-state
I spend it all cause when you young you can’t pace
I bet I double up, ’99 Mase
My ex said “I be missing you” Miss faith
It takes two, like Rob Base
All of them pretty, but a rock in a hard place
Meet a lot of girls, state to state
Some one nighters, some I might date
I’m a fat boy, slim skinny tatted face
Brown Louie hard case, make your jewelry sleep safe
On my king shit, like the middle east
And the swagga stink like Kimchi
I’m the shit ? for the money bags
Like ? throwing dead presidents
It’s all good that you’re living nice
But when I get it all my niggas we gonna do it right

[Hook]
All my niggas that be hustling we up tonight
And all my niggas that struggle we up tonight
And all the girls around the world going out tonight
Take a shot make toast we up for life, and we up

And all my 9 to 5 niggas we up tonight
And all my unemployed homies we up tonight
Always doing wrong trying to make it right
Take a shot make toast we up for life, and we up

[Tyga - Verse 1]
Like a new born in the cradle, uh
Feet first like a baby born backwards (we up, we up)
Tell the bank tell em time to re-up, re-up
Damn, everything I see call it Mcdowell's
So many niggas copying my style
Coming to america through a cloud
Just left Switz sold out crowds
Uh, Vietnamese chicks with the big smile
Pekingese puppy rapped in a beach towel
Killing me softly like Lauryn Hill
Built for love but love won’t keep it real
Can’t waste time we up and dollar bills to my soul
In god we trust
I love women when they tease but she down to fuck
Tell the bartender to fill me up, fill me up

[Hook:]
All my niggas that be hustling we up tonight
And all my niggas that struggle we up tonight
And all the girls around the world going out tonight
Take a shot make toast we up for life, and we up

And all my 9 to 5 niggas we up tonight
And all my unemployed homies we up tonight
Always doing wrong trying to make it right
Take a shot make toast we up for life, and we up

Yeah, we up, yeah, we up, ow, we up
We up, yeah, oh, we up, ah, we up, we up

[Hook]

[Intro]
Yeah, I put my shades on

[Verse 1]
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

[Chorus]
And I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

[Verse 2]
Stunna, I got 'em, I'm back on them bitches
All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting
Eastside, MOB Piru Damu

[Hook]
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my teeth glowing, I'm on my Deebowin'
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

[Verse 3]
Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM
Beach bum, call me Ocean Drive Slim
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin
Young Mula, skinnies and some Supras
Belly of the beast 'til it puke us, motherfucker

[Hook]
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

[Outro]
I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home
It's Young Mula, baby

[Verse 1]
Faded off the kush, I'm gone
Only two years old when daddy used to bring them hookers home
Looking like my grandma, my niggas got that ammo
We jack-son and then light up the L, Samuel
Tunechi in this bitch, nigga, y'all niggas bitch niggas
Rats gon' rat, and snakes gon' hiss, nigga
Baseball rich, nigga, do this shit for all my homies
Where them bad bitches at? Come and put that pussy on me
Tunechi, you a murderer, boy, you just be killing shit
Yeah, you know that money talk, I am the ventriloquist
Tranquilizer in the trunk, put your ass to sleep, man
Birdman Junior, got the world in my wingspan
How you niggas want it? Have it your way, Burger King
I get deep in that pussy, dig her out, surgery
Fucking with a real nigga, fucking right, certainly
Break in your fucking home, take your life, burglary
Whoa, nigga, die slow, nigga
For dear life you're holding on, En Vogue, nigga
Unload, nigga, reload, nigga
Tools on deck, Home Depot, nigga
Well, if life is a bitch, then mine a gold digger
Yeah, and all my bitches nasty, like a cold dinner
Every day I go so hard and work my ass off
I'm good, I'm 100, like a fastball
It's Carter IV

[Interlude]
Yeah!
Ugh!
I'm going back in, man
Yeah

[Verse 2]
We get fuck y'all money, how you wanna play it?
That AK sleep on the side of my bed
That's one eye closed, one eye open
Your cap get peeled, like ibuprofen
I'm sick, I'm ill, I ain't the nigga to fuck with
It's a crazy world, and life is shorter than Bushwick
Young Money, man, we got this shit by a land slide
Boy, I send them Bloods at your ass, like a tampon
Uptown shit, wet the whole party
Weezy gon' ball, bal' like Steve Harvey
The heater, I'ma tuck her; Tucker like Delores
That's my word, word like thesaurus
I don't see no future in your fronting, I be stunting hard
Rap game dependent on me, like a bungee cord
Fear nobody, but God almighty
Shoot that motherfucker 'til I get arthritis
I'm a beast, I'm a ass, I'm ahead of my class
I'm a diamond in the rough, like a baby in the trash
I don't talk it, I live it; I paint a picture, vivid
And them pistols popping, like they sitting in a skillet
I go so hard, go so mean, I'm so New Orleans
Told the judge I couldn't budge, it was him or me
Forget the bullshit and remember me

[Produced by Willy Will]

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Carter IV, it's on
Yeah, it sound like that Lil', man, they be like "Wayne
That nigga right over there, that nigga's from another planet"
Cut the weed, pop-pop
Insanity shit, niggas from this planet can't see
U-u-u-u-uhh

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Hot's what it is, watch what the kid drops
I'ma get the prop if you're not with the biz
Not only other regions, I really popped at the crib
So hatin' motherfuckers, you better stop with the jibs
Off of the thizz, but I'm boss
It don't matter what the cost
When I live right across from the Wiz
Killa City will have a nigga lost in the Mid
Leavin' nothin' but mothers stuck and plus a coffin to give
What is happening is a merger, different levels of murder
Lil Weezy cookin' and I'm a server
Further, that's what I'ma get doing this
Remember when eating Gerber
Mama said to kill 'em all and I heard her
Thank you Baby for what became Lil Wayne
He's gettin' all the people knowin' that Strange in the game
I been really able to hang in the fame
But when he shouted my name, it's been a change in my lane
I'm a Klusterfuk and lovin' nothin' but to get your brain
And I be stuck in lust and quick to a bust a nut
And take a nigga's dame with no shame
Really be bussin' up, they thinkin' they thuggin' tough
But never do knuckle up, you in the gang, you bang
You drug and touchin' every thang, you lame
Sucka, you cannot sustain the reign
Tech N9ne is such a cuckoo in this
Ballin' nigga, Strange Music, crew threw swishes
I know a lot of you prolly never knew who this is
Well, you listenin' to Tecca Nina, Soo Woo bidness

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Today, I feel electric gray, I hope tomorrow neon black
I tell a nigga, "All those flows are borrowed"
It’s the pharaoh, Three Stacks
I woke up in Cairo, lookin’ at stars
So bright in the sky, I thought they were marbles
No car doors, whatcha call those?
A whole carload, of raw hoes
In a Jeep Defender
Please remember, don’t feed the Simba
Three’s assembled like nobody
He's a symbol of what's safari
Pulled her ponytail to my body
She’s the only girl that was smart e-nough
To call me 'Mr. Benjamin' in the middle of a wild party
Skin was cinnamon; I pound it harder
How come the only girls that are thought of
Are the light ones? Well tonight then
We gon’ do it, do it, do it for the dark ones
It’s important that you are more than
Welcome to Tha Carter IV and
Y’all enjoy it, I will go ‘head
And I’ll kiss y’all on y’all forehead, out

[Produced by Angel "Onhel" Aponte and Infamous]

[Intro]
God bless america...
- Carter, are you prepared to take the constitutional oath?
- I am...
- Will you place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right hand and repeat after me, I...

[Chorus]
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

[Verse 1]
Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as God as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my Uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pot to piss in
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em
Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms
Tote tools like mechanics, mechanisms
Uh, detrimental on any instrumental
I say you rappers sweet I pay the incidentals
I'm beneficial, I've been official
I say you rappers sweet, tiramisu
I like my short cake shorter
Ain't no motherfucker harder than

[Chorus]
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

[Verse 2]
Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances
Your family tree, I will break branches
Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin
Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh, yesterday just died
Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives
When shit get deep I'm never afraid to dive
Let the money pile up until I'm buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell
Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses

[Interlude]
Amen, so now instead of pledge, we pray, yeah

[Chorus]
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

[Verse 3]
Ya dead to me, brown grass nigga
I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga
Bullshit for lunch, brown bag nigga
Reality’s a bitch and I'mma dance with her
140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground
Bitch I'm in the building you ain't even in the lounge
I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused
I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while
Uh, and we all want world peace
Murder show, I give your ass good seats
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech

[Outro]
Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth, 

[chuckles]
Thank you, thank you all, I am President Carter

[Intro: John Miles]
You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
'Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushin' the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargainin' on cocaine
So in other words, nigga, do your thing

[Verse 2: Drake]
Mind in one place, heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas
Who don't have your heart in your rap shit
And got too fuckin' comfy
'Cause we still fuckin' hungry, Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fuckin' faded, aw yeah I'm fuckin' faded
They tellin’ lies about me, aw yeah, I must've made it
Rikers Island on this flow, eight months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
Three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin' all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, stop playin', I ain't with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches, Sheneneh, oh my goodness
This is Wayne’s world, and y’all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish you would bitch
Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock .40's, nigga, you got 80 problems
Swimmin’ in the money, I'ma need some fuckin' goggles
It's better to give, but we don't give a fuck about 'em
I just came home, shit done got real, ho
Lil' Weezyana, the boot nigga, steel toe
I ain't workin' with a full deck but I deal, ho
I just touched down, kick the motherfuckin' field goal
Talkin ’bout baby money? I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that "how-much-you-love-your-lady" money
I know you fake, nigga, press your brakes, nigga
I’ll take you out, that’s a date, nigga
I'm a grown-ass Blood, stop playin' with me
Play asshole and get an ass whippin’
I think you pussy cat, ha, Hello Kitty
I just throw the alley-oop to Drake Griffin
I lay 'em down, Tempurpedic
This shits a game of chess, you niggas think it's cleavage
Its Young Money, yeah, tis the season
I give you the business, bitch this a business meetin'
My niggas hungry, my bitches greedy
Will I die a bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga, I'm straight, my girl a faggot
Potato on the barrel, pop-pop-potato salad

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

[Hook: T-Pain]
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it "Waynes" it pours
No really, I'm on my "fuck that bitch" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me

[Hook: T-Pain]
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Coconut Ciroc
Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well, and I wish I never met ya
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not forever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy F, for "Fuck you"

[Bridge: T-Pain]
No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here girl, I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writing for you
Now I see how you can be
I don't want you 'round me all you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cause girl done taught me

[Hook: T-Pain]
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

[Intro: John Legend]
Oohh, ooh
So special, you're so special
So special, you're so special
Oohh, ooh
So special, you're so special
So special, you're so special

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, boy shorts, wife beater
Now let me see it, I'm a sightseer
She was sleeping on me, but she's a light sleeper
I make her cum first, then I follow the leader
I talk shit, I hope it matters
We climax, without the ladder
Can't desert the future, no Nevada
Her body is a weapon, ratatat her
I spent the night in heaven, I slept with an angel
And when we finish, I swear that pussy said thank you
I said, "You're Very Welcome" I'm so well mannered
And I go down south, Louisiana

[Chorus: John Legend]
Baby won't you spend the night
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
(So special, so special,so special, so special)
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl
(So special, so special,so special, so special)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Then we take a shower together, and wash each others back
And if she kick it off, I'ma run it back
And then she say my name, like I forgot it
She crazy about that dick, Lorena Bobbitt
Love be the pilot, but it's kamikaze
Yeah, body language, girl let's talk about it
Freedom of speech, Weezy a beast
Open her up like a book, read it and weep

[Chorus: John Legend]
Baby won't you spend the night, uh
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
(So special, so special,so special, so special)
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl
(So special, so special,so special, so special)
So special

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, thinking bout you girl got my mind on E
You know them other niggas ain't me
Girl I got that 12 play for ya, that 12 play for ya
Just sit on my grill, that's that tailgate for ya
I, put it together, common denominator
I tear it up like loose leaf paper
I got drinks on chill, my bedroom huge
I knock her lights out, I blow her fuse
See we don't even fuck no more, we make love
And now shes on the tip of my tongue, my taste buds
Cause she my honey bee, yeah, buzz buzz
And now I'm itching and scratching, that's that love bug

[Chorus: John Legend]
Baby won't you spend the night
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
(So special, so special,so special, so special)
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl
(So special, so special,so special, so special)

(Girl I got that 12 play for ya)
(So special girl, so special to me)

[Intro]
There's a lot of things in this world you got to accept, you know
Especially me, listen

[Verse 1]
A lot of niggas be playin' the fool
And I ain't havin' that shit like prayin' in school
I'm gonna keep more tools than True Values that I know how to use
I don't need "how to's"
Nigga's don't believe they can bleed or bruise
That's why solo niggas always leave in two's
Weed and booze'll have nigga's leaking from wounds
Ain't no comin' back home, Mom's leasin' your room
Nigga's will lose their grins when it's Lupe and friends
And them orange juice Timb's in a foregin coupe that swims
Now a days emcee's be wildin'
And my mic check be better than they whole album
They wonder why they can't touch it
Cause my shit stay over there head like carry on luggage
I'd give it to any performer on any budget
The rhyme in the I am niggas want nothin' of it

[Refrain]
You got to, accept the troubles, it's not like it's hard
Yeah no choice but to, accept the troubles, it's not like it's hard
You know you got to, accept the troubles, it's not like it's hard
Accept the troubles nigga, live with it
You got to, accept the troubles, it's not like it's hard
Yeah, listen, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm never blunted
Cause table's can turn like 1200s
But I keep a 'three-eight' on that burn next to my stomach
Shells punished concerned well from it
Cause I learn customers return if the product is humming
Yo it's Was, one hundred will walk for duke
Runnin' best believe them bullets be in hot pursuit
Especially don't pull it dawg it's not for you
You dressed up like prom and deaded I'm the alarm
I got Winter in my grill and Summer in my palms
And numbers on your Moms dumb and dumbers for the strong
I know them bars is hurting cause I'm a hard working dark child
Like R. Jerkins I see the sharks lurkin', honest, hungry
CCF sponser the alumni and rep Madison constant money
I'm a fast learner with a fast burner
And I hope you can fast, cause there's no eating when it's my turn to

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Am I what you expected, the good die young and I've been resurrected
The hood's my son, I'm quite impressive
Best believe it's yayo with WJ Goals and them writin' credits
Yo, I mouth piece niggas swearing ya tough
And you're that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
And that 8-40 hoody with the wooden guts
With the AK 4-fully that'll cook you and ya tux
Ya ain't thorough, you got it mixed up like Dourough
Just cause they in suits that don't mean they the Bureau
Your small time so close to worthless
Only feds at your house is the Postal Service
It's all love why try and hate us
Don't make me call thugs
And you shook like vibrators
Head shots to ruin your linings and tapers
We hustlas flip cane like five Phi Thetas
Understand nigga

[Refrain]
I do not talk
I do not talk, I am just a rapper

Childish Gambino, hot as a flaming Cheeto
I'm tighter than baby speedos
I'm shifting another kilo
And that's because my shits dope
Walking past the red rope
The bouncer is my kin folk
So I don't need credentials

Sick boy is my clique
I got that shit inside a headlock
Love to make that bam bam
We were born to make the bed rock

I am so hip hop
More so than you guys
I am legend
You guys are true lies
Tipsy like some Jenga
Shout out to my topangas
Them thicky thick girls stay wrapped around my finga
Nerdy girls from every where
They scope me out like there he is
My whole crew's sick
I'm hanging out with Jerry's Kids

Hold up mother fucker
It's gambini on the microphone
Screaming like your father when he comes home and the light are on
Girls addicted to my dick
My wallet is their methadone
Brain dead niggas love beef
They are vegetables

I am on that fly shit
Fuck that, I'm orbiting
My face is everywhere
Fuck that, I'm Norbiting

I can feel your heat, momma
I can hear your feet, momma
Dude wit a hoodie and hair in cornrows
With a dick size bigger than niggas in pornos
That satisfy cause they know that I care physically
I walk inside the party and know im the man instantly
I hate bars, I can't stand the clubs neither
I'm not dancing I'm fucking having a seizure
A lyrical legend lately lot a punks wish they
Got that ice needed for niggas to call them pimps; bull shit
I bite niggas heads off call me alligator
I wear bright clothes like a pack of now and laters
My hood is darth vader, cuz thats my light saber
And my golf socks will probably make your eyes dilated
Pimp juice concentrated, my swagger fresh squeezed
And them haters can't stand it cause they got weak knees
Treat banks like restaurants pass the cheese please
Im the bees knees I got little kids saying like:
Get like me
Get get like me

My flow is retarded, call me Rainman
Cuz I make it rain man!
My hoodie print bright like a fucking toucan!
What's the frequency ken?
Kicking it with french girls like the can-can
We can be friends, call me Adam
Cuz I am the man
Let me put it like this
Rapping ain't easy, there's only me and weezy, and jeezy, kanyeeze
Boys wanna be me, but my swaggers off the heezy
Call me crime mob
I run the big apple like my names Steve Jobs
My shoes custom made, white top bright green
My pants top shelf so I call em' high jeans
My clock is sick like the hospital
So if you somebody vomit in the street I'm probably responsible
If I got some extra dough, I buy these kids a bunch of ice creams
Not the food, but the shoes so they walking down the street like
Get like me
Get get like me

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
My watch is obnoxious
Ring is enormous
My chain is humongous
My brain is abundant
Kush, humongous
Purp, enormous
My jewels are flawless
My girls are bossy
My flow so awful
(EUGH) I'm barfin', (PLAW) I'm coughin', (SWISH) I'm ballin'
(SSS) I'm pissin, (PTT) I'm shittin' (Every verse 100, my watch 100)
Ha-choo sneezin', still breathing?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My front yard still look like a car show
Mansion so big, kids playing Where's Waldo
Where's Waldo, Gucci where's Waldo?
I jumped out my Vette, to jump in my Gallardo
That new Gallardo? That stanky new Gallardo?
That baby blue Gallardo, cuz I'm so far from Harpo
Harpo beat me, baby girl beast me
Pulled up, hit the horn twice like beep beep
She remind me of a ????
These jeans ain't cheap, and the kicks aren't either
Either way, I'm a ride illegal
I'm higher than an eagle on ether
I'm higher than a falcon on California reefer
Got money like a Falcon, no Dan Reeva
Humongous bracelet, rings like I'm Jordan
I'm not 23, but not far from it

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
She flyer than an airplane
On my private jet mane
I'm not talking air train
Flyer than a ??
Can I be your old man?
Promise we can hold hands
I can't be no blind man
I am not a blind man
Smash her backer crack her crack her back
Like a chiropractor
Shorty saw my cauliflower
I gave her $800
$800? Gucci Mane you trippin'
Nope, I'm not trippin', I got it I'm not trickin'
Ha, jokes on you, jokes on you, Eddie Griffin
Hoes on my Scottie Pippen, that's my Sidekick
My side chick's a dime piece
You side order Jive bitch
Damn you a Jive Turkey Gucci worth a thousand bricks

[Hook]

But I’m the first to bust (bust)
And you’re the first victim, (victim)
Quenching my thirst for blood (Ugh)

Tell me what’s the difference between love and lust?
Cause I love the love (love)
But I’m in love with lust (lust)
Walk up to your bitch and tell her I would love to cut
And when them devils come up
Leave the crack in the crack of her butt (yeah)
Make her lay down in a back of a back of a truck (truck)
And when she come up like a squirrel

24s on my Caddy I’m just askin’ for putt (fore)
So when you come up to my trap you’re just asking for us

[Hook]

[Verse 2--Mack Maine]
They say thou shall not talk, (talk)

Leave his shit all puffy so
Thou shall not see (see)
Thou shall not smile
Thou shall never show his teeth
I'll paint thou art thou, thou shall repeat
Thou shall not (Thou shall not)
Bitch I said don’t talk
Shoot you in your ass and stab your feet
Now how you’re gonna walk?
I’m sick in the head, I piss in the bed
Hop up out the ocean and I leave the fisherman red
So much blood on the set, the cops hollerin’ out “soo-woo”
Bitch I’m from New Orleans, you know I know that voodoo
IPod blastin’, 2pac yeah hit ‘em up
Chow down, spit ‘em up
Black bag, get ‘em up
Call the chef tonight, were having sinners for dinner
Ain't no wireless in the hood, so I ain't talking about Twitter
When I say

[Hook]

[Verse 3--Snoop Dogg]
The run around, the rap around (Rap aight)
You talk, then you walk, me I’m shaftin’ down (sh-sh)
See me and the pigs, we don’t fuck around (uh-uh)
That snitching in the hood, lemme’ break that down (break it down)
They do theirs, we do ours, understand me?
I’m blued up, crippin’ with my family
And we don’t give a fuck about the
POs, the COs, cause we know
If we goes
Then we go
We do time, then parole
Now I’m back on the black at night shift
Stack on the top I’m cockin’ it
Back in the block and you know I’m cooping it
Shoebox full of money with a sock in it
And we celebrating the ghetto by popping it
So no champagne or crystola
Machine guns and pistolas--
Blaw, hood shit

See in my hood we crip, or dip
So follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
On some gangsta shit,ya biotch

[Hook]

[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah
Elite Elite Elite, Elite
Ya know

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Slim nigga, lyrically on my limbs
Bigga then a nigga hittin' the gym
Regular benchpressin' the bar
Ten steps up from y'all, you could follow my lead
If you shoot for the stars, I guess you aimin' at me
But please hold your applause
Y'all holdin' up the wall goddammit I'm on the flo'
Good Lord, can't you see me gettin' down on a ho
And she drop it so low she sittin down on the flo'
I never pound with the flo', at times I wonder
Aye when they listen to my shit man can they hear my hunger?
Or will these hatin' ass rappers try to steal my thunder
Aye this is big shit poppin', you gon' need a plunger
To take me under, niggas in trouble
You lookin' at LeBron James of the game
I could do anything that you name
I could blaze any rapper in the game that you bring
Pour gasoline on the brain, got the flame for that
So you hatin' niggas refrain from that
A little bitter 'cause yo game is whack
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah

[Hook]
Aye you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me
I know it won't be long 'fore you hear about me
My head's to the sky and I'm on my grind
I'm reachin' for the clouds, tryna take what's mine
Take what's mine
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
A dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So, if it's 'bout that C.R.E.A.M, then I'm all up in the spot
I'm just warmin' up, I'm hot but nah, I ain't flashin'
I never gave a fuck about no high-end fashion
And maybe I was too broke, maybe I'm just too dope
To rap about that regular shit, or bag a regular bitch
These niggas talkin' like they on the next level and shit
But Cole's flow so cold, Bet the devil get sick
How do you want it? So sick I make you mentally vomit
These rappers askin' for beats and they ain't even fit to be on it
I see 'em writin' about rappers, I should be sick to my stomach
Because they talk 'bout the future but didn't mention me on it
So now I'm back in the kitchen, cookin' I'm meant to be one of the greatest
No niggas seein' me, this century us and you hate it
Look how I played it, other niggas was jaded
Under-appreciated, now Carolina is rated
I let Elite breathe, yeah
Hey, uh uh uh
I let Elite breathe, yeah

[Hook]
Aye you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me
I know it won't be long 'fore you hear about me
My head's to the sky and I'm on my grind
I'm reachin' for the clouds, tryna take what's mine
Take what's mine
Hey, hey

[Kanye West - Alternative Second Verse]
The brown hero, live from Ground Zero
Machine gun flow, made of ghetto Ross Perot
And this is disestablishmen-tarianism
With my night goggles on, yeah, military vision
And it’s still a very Christian way to think about livin’
When you prayin’ for freedom ’cause your mind been in prison
‘Cause they tryin’ to control every single big decision
You ain’t effin’ the system, then why the eff is you livin’?
Look, dawg, you can cop whatever suits you on
Three-piece, cuff links and the accoutrements
They been feedin’ us ish without the nutrients
So I’m back with another hit to let the truth be known
And your boy still fresh with the Gucci on
Them Italians sure know how to make what the moulies want
And they really can’t take what dude be on
But I be on the same thing ’til you prove me wrong

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead, long live the king"

[Pre-Chorus 1: Chris Martin]
One minute I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus 1: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

[Pre-Chorus 2: Chris Martin]
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

[Chorus 2: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

[Bridge: Will, Jonny, Guy, Brian]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)

[Chorus 2: Chris Martin & Will, Jonny, Guy, Brian]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
My missionaries in a foreign field
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
For some reason, I can't explain
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

[Outro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Haha
Mhm, don't mind if I do
Ahem
Hey

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
It seems like every day, I got a filled-up phone
Ladies tryna text me, sayin' that they home for the summer
And they heard that I'm livin' on my own
So they wanna come to the crib, maybe cook me some supper
But I'm busy, so I'm ignorin' her
Yeah, I just touched down in California
Now I'm headed to the beach
Go and swim in the water like I'm tryna sneak in across the border
I do all different types of crazy shit
I'm the youngin hoes tryna make a baby with
'Cause it'll make 'em rich
Know I'm headed to the money, so these funny little girls wanna take a trip
But no, only the M-O-S-T Dope with me
Other fools homo, Roy and Siegfried
No disrespect, though
I got addictive cigarette flow for the green pesto, presto

[Chorus: Adam Young & Mac Miller]
I'd like to make myself believe (Haha)
That planet Earth turns slowly (This is what I was talkin' about when I said K.I.D.S. was gonna be some life-changing shit, bitches)
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep (But shoutout Pittsburgh, man, Most Dope)
'Cause everything is never as it seems (Big Jerm makin' me sound crispy and shit, hey)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I'm highly underestimated
So educated and getting paid quick
If you ever hated, anticipate that I'm famous
Got a bunch of bitches to sip on the champagne with
Celebrate that we seein' another day
Life good, never wanna end this
Me and mary jane got a really nice friendship
Yeah, they give me money, but I gotta go and spend it
Man, I been a bad little Jew
But I gotta pay the bills now, so I gotta chill out
I ain't walkin' 'round like I'm splurging with a mil' now
Feel like the kid working at the mill now
Used to just chill and smoke joints up at Bill's house
Now I got a schedule, things I gotta do
Doing interviews, see it up on YouTube
I say it feels just like a dream
'Bout to wake up from a nap, how fucked up was that? Like

[Chorus: Adam Young & Mac Miller]
I'd like to make myself believe (Yeah)
That planet Earth turns slowly (Haha, this shit just feels good, I'm not gonna lie)
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep (Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause everything is never as it seems

[Talkin: Nicki Minaj]
Chea, Nicki Minaj
Dirty Money, Young Money
Yo, why the fuck these little bitches always talking shit about what they did and...?
I don't give a fuck, bitch!
Nicki Lewinsky
Look (fucker!)

[Verse: 1]
When you was on stage with your brain on drugs
"Nick-Nack, Carry Crack", what my nickname was
And when you was in the hood with bottles of OE
I was OT, looking real low-key
I do a striptease if the cops stop me
A pair of Guess jeans and some beef and broccoli
I was at the Rucker, I was sippin' on a Smucker's
I was rockin' hats that was made for the truckers
That's when I hopped out the pink on pink
Hate it when a bitch act like her shit don't stink
See you was drippin' wet, you was jumpin' in the crowd
I was in a jet, I was swervin' through a cloud

[Spoken: Nicki Minaj]
You know, I'mma put them bitches in a time machine and, and, and, and... send 'em back to the past and shit
Bitches always talking 'bout shit they did and all that
Bitch, get in a time machine!

[Verse: 2]
Time machine bitches always talkin' about the old days
When they was hot, when they was tourin' with the OJ's
I tell a bitch this: "I'm not impressed, bitch"
I'm Nicki M, trick, I'm always on the guest list
I'm on my way to Riker's Island with a couple hard
I'm on a bike, nine-five-four double R
And they don't write shit, they might write a couple bars
That's why they getting drop-dropped, like a couple cars
(You shouldn't have said that) NY to NO
Late Night shows, like Letterman and Leno
End, where you cut it, home-slice, your gar-bage
White boys tell me that I rock, like guitars

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
See, see, you see Anna Mae?
I'm about to slap ya'll bitches 'round and call ya'll Anna Mae
Like, that, that's what y'all gon' get in a minute, real talk, like
Cause, you know, this is '08 now, like
So, anything you talk about, like, it gotta be, it gotta be, at least, within a two-year radius type shit, like
I don't care what happened 50 years ago, like
You know, you know, you know, call-- all bets are off, bitches
You know, game just begun
I'm already knowing ya'll cowards at heart
And I'm prone to school niggas like Howard and Clark
Any youngin' get it crunk is surrounded by chalk
Niggas is street...where the kid is highway
And I'm known to sling bricks like Craig in Friday
Steam clips and hold submachines sideways
It's not a game, akhi
I even aim my stray shots with stones the size of raindrops
200 all in the same watch
And you don't want to owe me money like Kain pops
24/7, I'm always here like the theme from Bay Watch
With 'Caine, rock, and Trainspot
They all cooking the same, hooking your brain
Like Sugar Shane, I'll leave you shook and ashamed
It's essential, smell me?
Run this wisdom 'cross your nose
I'm a hustler, I ran them chickens 'cross the road
It's not a joke. I made chickens cross the road
Lay the mack down, run this pimpin' 'cross your hoes
Pick the mack up, you sponging stitching up your hoes
Flip your Lac truck
You're running tripping over your clothes
I'ma seize ya, I'll make you a believer
You the type to get charged like Visas
Get in the bing and sing like divas
Buck shots leave your face looking like receivers
Stay on my op, stay on the block, and stay on the top
Like freezers, I'm over the wall
Running from blood hounds and retrievers
I don't like you and I don't fuck with him either, so give me three meters
I bang nigga

[Intro: Alori Joh]
I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
Figure I would hit the NBA and make me a fortune

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, every time I’m in my city, I be acting like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' Me Against the World—hello, world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes

[Break: Kendrick Lamar]
Michael Jordan
Bounce-bounce ho, bounce-bounce

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head
Or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich
Pull up on these 26’s, I’m a vanity slave
I’m a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see
I’m a Comp-town representer, a concrete back-flipper
A.K.A that nigga, don't wuwwy!
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see
This is HiiiPower, since the Eddie Bauer I been popular
I’m popping now, every other hour paparazzi come
You jocking her, let her be a ho, why you stopping though?
We stopping the traffic, what you know 'bout them hockey pucks?
Skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em? You should learn from 'em
Seen too many of y’all getting money, know my turn coming
I don’t know why your bitch wanna fuck me
I don’t know why (Hey, wait a minute, motherfucker)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I’m in my city, I be feeling like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Ridin' 'round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Man, the game chose me, what am I to do?
The only thing I did wrong was make it possible
I diddy bop and make them titties pop
Out there on my bumper like a city cop
Walking out the Fred Segal, put my girl on it
Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it (Aye)
Pussy crazy, pussy crazy
You fuck niggas, you pussies crazy
Man, I know I can’t tell you about the world homie
But I know I can tell you about your girl homie
Her pussy crazy, her pussy crazy, I fuck nigga, I know you hate me
I know they pay me too much of attention
Bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned
I need me an engine that go real fast
Call it hall of fame once it haul ass
Give me tall glass, Coconut Cîroc
Please, no soda pop, I make my solo pop
Life’s a bitch, her pussy crazy
But I make that pussy pay me

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I’m in my city, I be feeling like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these hoes, Wayne told me that…

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
I remember tripping, walking through the set
Like my Glock don’t think
Grandma in the kitchen, neck bones in the sink
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don’t know why you sucker niggas can’t see
I’m from Hoover man, high as Superman, shit you Lois Lane
You pussy man with the pussy game, shit, we off the chain
We popping the fortune, not the fame, shit, you backwards, man
You chasing hoes, we replacing those, bag and pass them hoes
Your broad done chose, guess she moving on, yep, we do it wrong
We fucked her homes, fucked and sent her home, marijuana strong
You know I’m gon' turn my swagger on, am I swagged enough?
My paper long, yep, you left alone, y-y-you gets no fucks
Leaning off the Actavis, passing blunts round and round
Told me Mary was a go so we passed her round and round
Your bitch texted me, wants it now so I had to knock her down
Hurt her bouncing off my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth
You let it slide, I hit home-runs, clean her dugout till I’m done
I can be her number two and you can be her number one
Her pussy’ crazy, her pussy crazy
You fuck niggas!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I’m in my city, I be feeling like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes

[Verse 1]
Why am I mad? I don't get it
It seems like every time you give me signs and I miss it
I did it again, I admit it
I left you standing there and now I regret it

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems like every time I get the chance
I lose my cool and I blow it
And I get all tongue-tied, lost in your eyes
I'm a fool and I know it

[Chorus]
I should've kissed you, I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And next time I won't stop, I'll listen to my heart
'Cause what I feel is real
I should've kissed you
I should've told you how I feel
I should've kissed you
I should've showed you just how I feel

[Verse 2]
Now why didn't I give you my two cents?
A million reasons why I should have and it makes no sense
So here I am, by myself again
Stopping for green lights and I know I wanna be more than friends

[Pre-Chorus]
How come every time I get the chance
I lose my cool and I blow it?
And I get all tongue-tied, lost in your eyes
I'm a fool and I know it, hey

[Chorus]
I should've kissed you, I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And next time I won't stop, I'll listen to my heart
'Cause what I feel is real
I should've kissed you
I should've told you how I feel
I should've kissed you
I should've showed you just how I feel

[Bridge]
So I turned the car around and you were right where I left you
And your smile said you were feeling it too
And the moon shone bright 'cause when your lips met mine
And yeah, I finally got it right, I'll be leaving with you tonight
And I won't have to say...

[Chorus]
I should've kissed you, I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And next time I won't stop, I'll listen to my heart
'Cause what I feel is real
I should've kissed you, girl
I should've showed you how I feel
I should've kissed you
I should've showed you just how I feel

[Outro]
Girl, I should've kissed you
I should've told you, told you just how I feel
And this time I won't stop until I have your heart
'Cause what I'm feeling is real

[Lupe: Talking]
The uprising has begun
The revolution is here
The propaganda will be smashed
Your establishment will be shaken to the core
A new regime is being ushered in on the back of the people
We will not be held down any longer
This is a new day. Yeeaaa, spazz out

Fiasco
Fiasco
Fiasco 

[x3]
Fiasco
Fiasco
Fiasco 

[x3]

[Verse 1]
Uh, Uh, Uh
The revolution is here, a evolution of years
The building of skills now my brilliance is clear. Chea!
The anointed one to point a gun that's been appointed by the slums
To make u get it, show u how to get it done
Get a gun if u got it, tuck your chain, remove your watches
Brush up on your slang and your knowledge
Just acquaint yourself with making wealth, join a gang
Pick a system, take it hostage
Stuff your shoes, get a white tee, say hello to the impoveraged
Not completely poor, but they are completely more
In the midst of getting missed and getting pissed and taking yours
What u shaking for, you scared? Naw
Well I'm just makin' sure
No cowards will not take this cause

[Hook:]
Spazz out (Oh, really now)
Spazz out (Oh, really now)
Spazz out (Oh, really now) 

[x3]
Spazz out (Oh, really now)
Spazz out (Oh, really now)
Spazz out (Oh, really now) 

[x3]

[Verse 2]
No problem we will take wit force
We properly will break em off
Got em, lead em, freed em, teach em, rape em, make em, take em off
Look homey run your chain
Not the one that's on your neck
But the one that's on your brain
That they use to keep in check
Rebels that don't have a cause
The devil down here doesn't pause
So you gotta keep it moving
So the movement doesn't fall
And this consist of white and black and all
That's tired of fronting, tired of jumping for the man
Every time he ask for something, NO
Don't they think they got to drinking, smoking just to fit in
Women that think they gotta screw the owner just to fit in, NO
The overlooked and undercared, it's over look
The son is here, they unprepared, so we took them unawares

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Get ready, it's about to change
Things might never be the same
You might never be the king coup! (Coup)
As long as they release the reigns
If you think that we are playing
Watch us leave here with a bang BOOM!
Be careful cause there's thinkers here
Most the crooks are slingers here
Who know the tricks and know the books
And what took to bring us here
Now, a coup is in effect, you serpents of the throne
Bring a bird for the next and a murder of the known
The propaganda's ugly, the truth is on its way
This is a lot felt, they just didn't know how to say
They mouth is here, the stakes is high, the doubt is here
The threat is real, they can't survive what we are about to do

[Hook]

[Lupe Talking:]
Pimp the system
Things are never gonna be the same
FNF full reign
1st & 15th
Chea
Spazz Out

[Verse]
To my Metal Face bros with stomachs of cast iron
Who been in to win and blast to the last siren
On the slow-mo the calm artist with the so-so chick
Chased them all like how he did to Slobodan Milosevic
Anyhoo, how 'bout them Yankees?
Once I leave off-stage the party people thanks mee's
If I may speak freely nasty like the freaky-deeky
At your local sleazy speakeasy
For any fan of the limelight
In the mic stand was left a lit stick of dynamite
It's risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale
With rappers who's better off on the cover of Black Tail
Jumpin Jehoshaphat, who's that?
Who cats who do magic be like "Tell me how you do's that"
Heck no, especially those who cop pleas like Gecko
Let go the mic, do techno
Ha ha, betcha bust out laughing at the bet
For no reason he get cussed out like Tourette's
Yet tight flow to make her bad ass stutter
Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter
But uh... word play since third grade age
Back when we used to play "Bang! Open bird cage"
Hip hop Benny Hill, Sip Henny straight
Get every penny, wait, then he chill, at any rate
My metal face hoes with tongue or 'least eye ring
Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing
Like Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting
Then the super-villain struck again like lightning
In the same spot (bzzz!) now what's the chance of that?
And a name drop like pick the name out the hat
Thats a no jiver from the liver conniver
Who vote player out the rap game like Survivor while I
Drop degrees like a nerd cat, willy intense speech
From way back to spin your back and then freeze
While I play high-ball, low-ball, to zero
So called rhymers, go call Cleo
While I, steal the show like "thought so, try hikin"
Super-duper stars need Ortho Tri-Cyclen
Sometimes the men, mostly from the women
I hear voices saying that's the super-villain
(Uhh, I hear voices)
Mostly from the women, I hear voices... super-villain

[Chorus]
We are young, we run free
Stay up late, we don't sleep
Got our friends, got the night
We'll be alright

[Verse 1]
Tonight, you won't be by your self, self
Just leave your problems on the shelf, shelf
You won't wanna be nowhere else, else
So let's go, so let's go (We got the club like)

[Pre-Chorus]
(Woo-ooh-ooh) And all the girls sayin'
(Woo-ooh-ooh) The whole world sayin’
(Woo-ooh-ooh) Yeah, yeah
Come on, let’s get drunk, toast it up, we don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
We are young, we run free
Stay up late, we don’t sleep
Got our friends, got the night
We’ll be alright
Throw our hands in the air
Pretty girls everywhere
Got our friends, got the night
We’ll be alright

[Bridge]
(Woo-hoo-hoo-ooh) Alright, alright, alright
(Woo-hoo-hoo-ooh) Ah, ah, ah, ah
(Woo-hoo-hoo-ooh) Alright, alright, alright
(Woo-hoo-hoo-ooh) Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
We walk the streets like we don’t care-care
Our middle fingers in the air-air
So come and join us if you dare-dare
Yeah, let’s go, yeah, let’s go (We got the club like)

[Pre-Chorus]
(Woo-hoo-hoo-ooh) And all the girls sayin’
(Woo-hoo-hoo-ooh) The whole world sayin’
(Woo-hoo-hoo-ooh) Yeah, yeah
Come on, let’s get drunk, toast it up, we don’t give a fuck

[Chorus]
We are young, we run free
Stay up late, we don’t sleep
Got our friends, got the night
We’ll be alright
Throw our hands in the air
Pretty girls everywhere
Got our friends, got the night
We’ll be alright

[Bridge 2]
It feels like, ahh-ah-ah-ah-ah
(It feels good, don’t it?) Ahh-ah-ah-ah-ah
(Yo, yo, yeah, d-don’t it?) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah) We’ll be alright (Ahh!)
It feels like, ahh-ah-ah-ah-ah
(It feels good, don’t it?) Ahh-ah-ah-ah-ah
(Yo, yo, yeah, d-don’t it?) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah) We’ll be alright (Uh-huh, ha-ha)

[Chorus]
We are young, we run free
Stay up late, we don’t sleep
Got our friends, got the night
We’ll be alright
Throw our hands in the air (Ahh-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Pretty girls everywhere (Ahh-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Got our friends, got the night (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We’ll be alright

[Intro]
Yeah, we gon' start this one like this

[Verse 1]
Driving down the road with a couple more miles to go
I'm so close but they don't know
Got some freaky hoes and weed to blow
Rock the cleanest clothes
My life different from every single kid you know
Places I go out on my own
Hoes stay blowing up my phone
But, I wanna be left alone
Doing shows, hitting four, five cities in a row
Hit me with some dough, 'cause they know I'm 'bout to blow
You can always say, "No", if you wanna lay low
Girl, you look so good you need to get up on the floor

[Chorus]
Don't you feel good, don't you feel great?
I feel so fly and I hope you can relate
I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee
It's the same old dude but a brand new me
I've been up and I've been down
Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around
But, I'm just another face in the crowd
I said, "I'm just another face in the crowd"

[Verse 2]
They tell me it's impossible to do it, I'd be stupid if I tried
But I'm using a maneuver, keep on moving 'em aside
I'm just trying to make some music for the ride
Listen to it when you drive, destination, you arrive
Russell Crow, just a beautiful mind
Got talent, imagine what I'll do with some time
I'm giving you a high feeling, moving your spine
Usually, find me chilling up in Jupiter
I'm so happy when you mad, Khakis, let 'em sag
Mom says, "You could see my ass" and she laughed
Blindfolded on the turnpike, hoping I don't crash
Stashing the weed under the passenger seat
Hope these sixteen wheelers don't crash into me
People taking pictures when I pass in the street
Zoom by, don't fasten my seatbelt
And now you know how we felt (Aha)

[Chorus]
Don't you feel good, don't you feel great?
I feel so fly and I hope you can relate
I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee
It's the same old dude but a brand new me
I've been up and I've been down
Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around
But, I'm just another face in the crowd
I said, "I'm just another face in the crowd"

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Don't you feel good, don't you feel great?
I feel so fly and I hope you can relate
I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee
It's the same old dude but a brand new me
I've been up and I've been down
Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around
But, I'm just another face in the crowd
I said, "I'm just another face in the crowd"

[Chorus]
She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)

[Verse 1]
She got me going, I'm all in
Fifty stories, I'm falling
Where you been? Is it planet Mars?
Far beyond the stars? Are you a Martian?
You're unfamiliar but still, I feel ya
Energy sending me towards the ceiling
I'm high now, are you up there?
If you was, I would climb every other stair
I gotta stare, I mean wow
And I'm wowed, no one compares
A one-on-one, you must have won
Every pageant in America when you was young

[Pre-Chorus]
Lips, hips, hair drips down her back
(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)
The only girl that can make time
Then make me, stop...

[Chorus]
She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)

[Verse 2]
So now we on, so now we going
Living in the city of the unknown
I show her off, I stunt with her
We do it sweet, they look bitter
Look at her get up, I hear 'em say
But why him? I hear 'em hate
I laugh at it rather than jab at it
Then continue eternal life as a crack addict
'Cause I'm addicted, and you the drug
Cold turkey? No sir
You gotta be an Odyssey from heaven and above
You definitely know, probably I gotta give it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Lips, hips, hair drips down her back
(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)
The only girl that can make time
Then make me, stop...

[Chorus]
She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)

[Outro]
You something different, I'm glad I found you
So pretty, I'll never do anything to hurt you

[Verse 1]
Turn a lamp on
Let me talk to you
See that light bulb, does something to you
Makes it a little harder to tell a lie don't it?
Make it difficult to run and hide don't it?
Tell the truth to me, good truth to me
Come close to me if that's you
I wanna see the details inside those beautiful eyes
The lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for

[Chorus]
No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

[Verse 2]
Just turn the lamp down
Don't talk to me
That light bulb, took something from me
Or gave something to me
I can't decide, I can't decide
Took freedom, gave purpose
Can't blend in, too perfect
All this beauty ever gave me was a reason for some beautiful lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for

[Chorus]
No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

[Bridge]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is the fairest of them all
Mirror, mirror oh you're so unfair to all of the beautiful ones

[Chorus]
No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

[Intro]
I do not talk, I am just a rapper

[Verse 1]
Nigga, I'm the capper
Rapper slash not actor
Cause I could never act the part of being fakey
You should really thank me
Who else would do this shit?
All that fucking wishing and waiting
These niggas are mistaken
You don't speak my language
Dressed like I'm Cambridge
Bowtie make me Muslim
Switch it for suspenders
Two at least
Clickin' through on hypebeast
Thom Browne, Hells Bells, Kitsune, Jay L
I don't wear shit unless it got a logo
Now it's time to go and walk around SoHo
All high schools showing out, Pay less
Man fuck that, yo I earned this

[Hook]
I love clothes
I love clothes
I love clothes
I love clothes

[Verse 2]
Go to TOPMAN, that's the hot spot
Check Kanye's blog for the high tops
Check shake appeal lookbook right quick
Bape hooking up with Ambush, that’s sick
Sperry top-sider with a black trim
Pink leather jacket, gotta get him
New t-shirt and I put it all
On a charge card
Burning through my Goyard
And it's so dumb, but it's so tight
Ain't nothing like new shoes every night
And it feels so good in the new jeans
And the new shirt, it's addicting
I'm an addict, I don't want help
I'mma die in my brand new Louis belt
But not Louis, it's too gaudy
Check the lime green frames a girl bought me
Billionaire Boys Club, I'm living it
One shirt, eight dubs, I'm spending it
Got shoes that I know I won't wear
And the problem is I don't really care
Got money, but nothing is forever
Every time I'm out to buy a new sweater
By 211 I'll be dead broke
I'll be the homeless dude in a peacoat

[Hook]
I love clothes
I love clothes
I love clothes
I love clothes

[Verse 1]
I’ll stack these magazines in the corner
After I’m done with them
And I still got the same hope that I started with
That you’ll be in one of them
My camera shed some tears since you left him
With nothing, with nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
How am I supposed to remember? Oh
I got the memories
But memories fade, baby
What am I gonna show to my kids, girl? Oh
When I’m older, and my mind is telling me to forget you
What’s gonna make me remember?

[Chorus]
That’s why I was always taking pictures, pictures (Ooo)
'Cause I didn’t wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures (Ooo)
When you knew they were all that I had left, nothing left
They were part of our history, this story (Yeah, yeah)
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn’t wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so

[Verse 2]
We didn’t make love
We celebrated its invention (Yeah)
Confetti on the mattress, I used to have those images (Oh, yeah)
Tonight I came home they were just embers in the fire
Along with my hard drive (No, no)
No notes, no goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
How the hell am I supposed to remember?
Ooo, tell me now, I got the memories
But memories don’t last…
What am I gonna show to my kids, baby? Yeah, yeah, ooo
When I’m older, and my mind’s telling me to forget you
What’s gonna make me remember?

[Chorus]
That’s why I was always taking pictures, pictures (Ooo)
'Cause I didn’t wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures (Ooo)
When you knew they were all that I had left, nothing left
They were part of our history, this story (Yeah, yeah)
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn’t wanna miss you (With flash)

[Verse 3]
No videos, no polaroids, or (With flash)
No record of the love we had, or (With flash)
My Nikon wasn’t fast enough (With flash, with with with flash)
To catch my heart break in half
No smiles on my picture frame, no (With flash)
Just got them
Little basic ones that the pictures frames come with (With flash)
Models, wedding pictures, you know (With flash, with with with flash)

[Chorus]
That’s why I was always taking pictures, pictures (Oh, baby)
'Cause I didn’t wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures? (Ooo)
When you knew they were all that I had left, nothing left
They were part of our history, this story (Ooo, ooo)
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn’t wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so…

[Verse 1]
Maybe I should just be clear
It sucks not having you here
There ain’t a better way to say
Other than how I just said it, clear, clear, clear, clear
Like a bottle of Evian, you can see through me
My ego ain’t here

[Pre-Chorus]
So many clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now has been the same

[Chorus]
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can’t run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still

[Verse 2]
I try to go some months without a call
I mean, I'm an attractive guy and all
Maybe I could find something in the club
Or something in the mall, mall, mall
But them girls didn’t matter
And this money ain’t distracting me much at all

[Pre-Chorus]
I know some clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now have been the same

[Chorus]
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can’t run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you

[Bridge]
Girl I wanted to cry
But I made it look easy (it ain’t easy)
To hold it in and save face
And it was harder to stay
So I made it look easy (it ain't easy)
To just get up and walk away
Now I’m alone and the tears do fall
Open my mouth and the words do fall
Now I'm standing here after all, with this broken heart

[Chorus]
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can’t run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still

[Verse 1]
She’s the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen on a skateboard
And I'm just a guy with a couple of open ears for her
She told me every story behind all of her tattoos
She’s thinking maybe the next one should have something to do with me, to do with me

[Pre-Hook]
Okay, well you gotta do mine in color
Cause all of your exes are in black and white

[Hook]
You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn’t let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

[Verse 2]
Said you should get a rubix cube over your heart
But you say I’ve already figured it out
Already figured out the love
She want me to get a spaceship tatted inside of my lip
Cause that’s what she feel like she on when we on each other
Loving on each other, kissing on each other

[Pre-Hook]
Okay, well you gotta do mine in color
Cause all of your exes are in black and white

[Hook]
You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn’t let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

[Bridge]
Paper to pen, needle to skin
I'm in the chair
And she’s over there
Taking these pictures
And blowing me kisses
When I asked her to hold my hand
She told me to take that ink like a man
Told me to take that ink like a man
Told me to take that ink like a man
She told me that, told me that

[Hook]
You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn’t let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

[Verse 1]
She is a pyramid
But with him, she's just a grain of sand
This loves too strong, like Mice and Men
Squeezing out the life that should be let in
She was a hurricane
But now she's just a gust of wind
She used to set the sails of a thousand ships
Was a force to be reckoned with

[Pre-Chorus]
She could be a Statue of Liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he’s scared of the light that’s inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

[Chorus 1]
Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe she’s become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a pearl

[Verse 2]
She was unstoppable
Move fast just like an avalanche
But now she’s stuck deep in cement
Wishing that they never ever met

[Pre-Chorus]
She could be a Statue of Liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he’s scared of the light that’s inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

[Chorus 1]
Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe she’s become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a...

[Bridge]
Do you know that there’s a way out?
There’s a way out, there’s a way out, there’s a way out
You don’t have to be held down
Be held down, be held down, be held down

[Breakdown]
'Cause I used to be a shell
Yeah, I let him rule my world, my world, oh yeah!
But I woke up and grew strong and I can still go on
And no one can take my pearl

[Chorus 2]
You don’t have to be a shell, no
You're the one that rules your world, oh
You are strong and you'll learn that you can still go on
And you'll always be a, a pearl

[Outro]
She is unstoppable

[Verse 1]
Oh, we’re in this together
Have a little faith
Oh, you ought to know who you are
Oh, we’re all children
We’re all human, we’re all breathing
We’re all needing, more than what they're giving
Can’t you feel it?
The space of what’s missing

[Pre-Chorus]
You look up and they tell you it’s a godless sky, a godless sky
So you look down
Cause you’ve convinced yourself
That this is all you’ve got, all you’ve got

[Chorus]
But picture four billion hearts beating with yours, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there’s one thing about this world I know
It’s that we’re in it, together
You’re not alone, I’m not alone
If there’s one thing about this world I know
We’re together, we’re together

[Verse 2]
I love you
And I don’t know you
But I know the light in you
Is the same as in me
I trust you, like a brother
Cause who could understand the pain
Better than someone who’s going through it

[Pre-Chorus]
You look up and they tell you it’s a godless sky, a godless sky
But don’t you look down
Don’t you convince yourself
That this is all you’ve got, all you’ve got

[Chorus]
Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there’s one thing about this world I know
It’s that we’re in it, together
You’re not alone, I’m not alone
If there’s one thing about this world I know
We’re together

[Bridge]
I’ve searched the souls of my people
For something to believe in
Oh, not words that I could say
But I heard them, I heard them

[Chorus]
Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there’s one thing about this world I know
It’s that we’re in it, together
You’re not alone, I’m not alone
If there’s one thing about this world I know
We’re together

[Verse 1]
My baby, my sweet pumpkin pie
My honey, my darling, my love
I only really miss him when he’s gone
Cause when we’re together we argue two thirds of the time
And I miss him more than a fraction when we part

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh you’re calling me crazy
Saying I’m always complaining
I tell you, just leave me alone
Here you go
You’re packing your things and
You're lacing your sneakers
I’m screaming get out

[Chorus]
But don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
I say that you should leave but don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 2]
Sugar bunches of oats
My buttered toast on the side
My full serving of love
And then it’s like
Whenever it’s just me and you
You know I don’t wanna fight
But I know that you know my buttons
And when to press them, baby, dammit

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh you’re calling me crazy
Saying I’m always complaining
I tell you, just leave me alone
Here you go
You’re packing your things and
You're lacing your sneakers
I’m screaming get out

[Chorus]
But don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
I say that you should leave but don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Bridge]
I told you to go
So why did you leave
I beg you to stay
I want you to go
So why did you leave
I told you to go
So why don't you stay
I begged you to stay
So why are you here
You gotta leave

[Verse 3]
Boy, you know I bet the sun won't set
Before we go at it again
It’s just gon’ happen
I don’t understand it
My heart’s sane
But my mind’s going crazy

[Chorus]
But don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
I say that you should leave but don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Outro]
I told you to go
So why did you leave
I beg you to stay
I want you to go
So why did you leave
I told you to go
So why don't you stay
I begged you to stay
So why are you here
I want you to leave

Oh, just go
No stay, go
Stay, go, stay, go, stay

[Verse 1]
Got a heart full of gold, that I own
The clothes on my back and a pencil
I can draw my own money
You wouldn’t even tell the difference
But I just can’t sketch the feeling
I get when you’re not home
Or recreate the paintings
You’ve hung onto my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh but I bet they’re worth millions
Oh, beautiful works of love
Oh, I’m a go to all the fancy places
All the fancy people and
They can’t tell me nothing, nothing

[Chorus]
Cause they all want what I got
And I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can’t buy what I got
Cause I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room

[Verse 2]
She got a heart made of glass
What’s inside of it's like lightning in a bottle
Now what would that be worth in your museum
Recently we traded
And now that hearts my own
And since we’re sewed together
I feel like I got both

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and I bet they’re worth millions
Oh, beautiful works of love
Oh, I’m a go to all the fancy places
All the fancy people and
They can’t tell me nothing, nothing

[Chorus]
Cause they all want what I got
And I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can’t buy what I got
Cause I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room

[Bridge]
Time itself wants what I got
So I don’t care about what you’ve got
All I know is my girl is precious
You make me better, baby
You make me happy, baby
Nobody needs to remind me exactly why I’m
The richest man in the room

[Chorus]
Cause they all want what I got
And I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can’t buy what I got
Cause I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you

Cause they all want what I got
And I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can’t buy what I got
Cause I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room

[Intro]
Uh
A lil' Compton nigga
Just a lil' Compton nigga
One time for my niggas
You know Compton, nigga
Just a lil' Compton nigga
Kendrick Lamar

[Verse]
Back with a vengeance
Back with my heart and I'm venting
Back with another war pendant, salute me or shoot me
I never wore a kufi, ignore my religion
I believe there's one God, there's one love
And I believe if I fly, we all doves
I make a way for my people to see the light
Brighter than yellow bones
Me and my microphone could be one
Until I see BIG, Pac, see Pun but this ain't Eazy
I can't take a Big L, my city needs me, I gotta win
The proof is in the pudding
And I been fucking with Cosby since I was ten, you damn right
Any means necessary, get the campaign right
Very emotional I'm a Gemini, I love hard and I fight harder, a born author
A born starter, in the game for real
And the games appeal to the struggling youth with no father
You can't learn if mistakes ain't made
You gotta pay your homage in order to get paid
You gotta pay attention in order to pay dues
And you ain't gettin' it, 'til you start payin' Jews
Lifestyles of the young and the broke
With my hand under oath, I recite these quotes
And if I ever lie then I die where I stand as a pest not a man what I wrote through a rap
In order to see the front, I had to play the back
We played our position, we let y'all play y'all self, y'all made y'all decision
We pray while we prey on competition
To flip another page of Corinthians
I see stars when I write these sentences
Words crash cars when I write these sentences
Open jail bars for my niggas' life sentences
Free J-Dove, kill all witnesses
Y'all better hope 2012 really real, cause the way I feel I'ma make y'all suffer
And take y'all supper
I haven't ate in the last 22 summers and I'm 22 now it's about to go down
So en garde, my God we got these artists in awe
Oh, I'm free
Finally I can say I'm me
The Kendrick Lamar EP, classic EP
The question concerns
I dropped it and gave the whole world my germs
Hope y'all infected
Hope y'all ain't have no protection
Still I'm progressing, room for improvement
Make room for the groom married to his music
I was at the XXL just trying to excel
Networking, meanwhile my stomach turning
Wanted to be a part of it cater it to my audience
J. Cole runnin' late
If he don't show up, think I can take his place
Ladies start laughing
No pun intended I ain't being sarcastic
Homie popped up with about twenty bags and
Fresh out the plane I couldn't even complain
My nigga was on his hustle I introduced him my name
Said I'll see him on the bubble in the future, my dude I salute ya
Contributing the real shit
Talk about it make the people talk about it
Make the world see, for every MC that I see tryna stay afloat
Tell 'em build a boat like Noah
And take him to a place that I'm sure we all can blow up, boom
I ain't a star yet but I'm gettin' close to 'em
And if you see a whack artist do more than boo him
Throw him off the banister, shoot him on camera
Then kill his manager
Then hang a banner up, that reads you can't proceed without bein' conceived by one album of the 90's
On Rosecrans where you'll find me
And all my niggas is grimy
But I remain the good kid
Tryna make a difference where I'm from, where you live
Oh no we got to slow the city down
I told the homeboy pump his brakes
He said that he rather put the pump to his face
Sawed off
Torture, turn the saw off, its scorchin'
Hot where I'm from, the newscasters don't come
Another ratchet got dumped, in the trashcan I ain't done
A baby in there with it
She said postpartum did it
Molested at eleven and she always reminiscing
When he was undressing said it'll only be a minute
That's why I always think I'm kicking something with feeling
I should've been a dentist
I should've been a blizzard-cold
Flash, pose, flash, pose, a critic paparazzi got me on my toes
I wanna jump on him like a tad-pole, tad-pole, ass-holes
Tryna kill my dreams
Not elevate
Those are not my dreams, I'll be straight
With a little bit of passion
And a drive like an Aston
Motivation from Nipsey or Glasses, Jay Rock
Mykestro , Bad Lucc, U-N-I
Dom Kennedy, Murs and Fashawn
Lady G, Willy B in time
I'ma blow like I'm mothafuckin' sniffing lines
Go like I never seen a red light shine
Flow to my heart, hit the flo' when I'm dying
Heart of a lion, tell 'em get in line
And pass the baton, I won't pass it back I ain't good at dimes
If the bitch bad I could pass you a dime
Haters better duck like I'm passing a pond
Know I'm the king and I'm passing you pawns
Pad on the hill (as in a big house on the hill) that's a passion of mine
Problem is I shine like two mics under heavy strobe lights
I'ma need two mics just to get my point across
I'ma get my joint across, country y'all gon' want me
P—

[Outro: Sample]
"This is a song that makes me spill out all my guts—"

[Verse 1]
Taking turns with pressing ignore
Only to come to the conclusion
That there’s no one we both love more
Back and forth, emotional tug of war
Girl I love you
But I just can’t do this revolving door any longer

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in these circles
What happened, we were close
Where did we go wrong
Better yet, how do we make it right
This ain’t making sense no more

[Chorus]
Yeah, so I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I’m waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I’m calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Maybe it’s the "me" in you that I dislike the most
Ironically, in the beginning that’s what made us close
And now that’s the very reason
That we’re slamming doors
But we’re both adults, it’s time we get over it

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in these circles
What happened, we were close
Where did we go wrong
Better yet, how do we make it right
This ain’t making sense no more

[Chorus]
So I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I’m waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I’m calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah

[Bridge]
If we stop this fighting
We can dance all night in this bitch
Be no fighting if you keep on rocking that shit
Won’t be no fighting, I’ma throw the towel in
Cause I decided, I like us way better like this

[Chorus]
So I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I’m waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I’m calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Look up, look up, look up
You’ll see the lies flying in the air
Reach out, reach out
Try to catch one if you can

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, right now they’re flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they come crashing down
It’ll be the worst surprise

[Chorus]
But you just right stand there
You ain’t looking ‘round
And baby, you won’t never see it coming
Causing kamikaze
On they’re way down to you
But you won’t never see 'em
Oh no, you’ll never know he’s lying
'Til you look up
And I bet you’d catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you’ll never see it coming
You’ll never see it coming

[Verse 2]
Feels like I’m on the 30th floor
Staring out my window
See them, they about to crash
Right into you
You’re marching on the sidewalk
Umbrella up, oblivious
No clouds, shades on, no sun

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, right now they’re flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they come crashing down
It’ll be the worst surprise

[Chorus]
But you just right stand there
You ain’t looking ‘round
And baby, you won’t never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze
On they’re way down to you
But you won’t never see ‘em
Oh no, you’ll never know he’s lying
'Til you look up
And I bet you’d catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you’ll never see it coming
You’ll never see it coming

[Bridge]
Look up, look up
You better look all around, all around
Baby you better
Look up, look up, I know
They’re coming down, coming down
They’re coming down
Look up, you better look up
Look up, look up, look up, look up

[Chorus]
But you just right stand there
You ain’t looking ‘round
And baby, you won’t never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze
On they’re way down to you
But you won’t never see 'em
Oh no, you’ll never know he’s lying
Till you look up
And I bet you’d catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you’ll never see it coming
You’ll never see it coming

[Outro]
Look up, look up
And baby you’ll see the light
You’ll see him flying
Look up, look up
You’ll see the lies
No, look up, look up
Flight 143 took off a minute ago
Flight 143 was just on the ground

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
My money burn
Synonymous to treatment of the fuzzy herb, I keep it G
In places you wishing you and your niggas be
Salute the gang, bitches cheer loud for the winning team
Bring it home, pull it out, break it down, roll it up
Smell it while we rolling down the street, you niggas know it's us
We got that fire, man you niggas know what's up
King Zag papers, Juan the only nigga rolling blunts
Other than that, you lame niggas is wack
Smoking on a J, while I'm smoking on a track
Cliche shit, stay way way far from basic
Kush cologne, I wear mines no K-Swiss
Damn, all I get is high; and brains
From a long-haired mistress preferred skinning light
Prejudice, marijuana evidence
Pipes, bong, vapes got me blown out my element, element

[Hook: Hodgy]
Every single day I smoke (smoke)
Every single day I smoke (I smoke)
Every single day I smoke
Every single day I smoke
I get high, I get high (Grams of the greenback)
I get high, I get high (Grams of the greenback)
I get high, I get high (Grams of the greenback)
I get high, I get high (Grams of the green sacks)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I grasp my intoxication, digital cinema
Third dimension, I can't move, verb suspension
Putting my lips to the purp, hemp burns is tempting
Bitches in the studio and we copped about a quarter
On the phone with her dad, I'm getting high with his daughter
Euphoria, mouth cotton, percent? A hundred
Many places I go or I have went, I'm blunted
Weed, you got it, I want it, I want it if you got weed
T, T-H, H-H, H-C
Out of no eyes, I'm so high, hashish I can provide
In your life, you gotta pick it up, cause I have no ride
When you arrive, I'll be outside loitering
I hate potheads who front like they don't blaze it
Your body needs Mary Jane, nigga, it craves it
I welcome Mary Jane, she doesn't violate
Inhale, exhale, feel the vibe-er-ate

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator & (Frank Ocean)]

[Intro]
I do not talk, I am just a rapper

[Verse 1]
C.G. but I'm real light talk
I know these motherfuckers wish I'd turn my mic off
Fuckin' Teddy Roosevelt
Big stick, walk soft
On top of this hill of pussy where I get my rocks off
Yeah my raps kill laundry
Knock socks off
Rappers think they're on the court
All they do is trash talk
But I do not talk, I am just a rapper
He's rapping over indie songs? This is a disaster!
But I made it dope like I'm cookin' in the kitchen
And these niggas couldn't see me now I'm fuckin' with they vision
And these bitches wasn't listening
Now they fucking listening
Shoot from the hip, motherfucker I'm a hipster
Do big things like a whale is your sister
Bitches get all dolled up, Westminster
Fake niggas ain't happy, are ya dude?
More raps than vegetarian barbecues
Can't learn, this rapping has to be part of you
Big dog, I'm steady reppin', I'm Marmaduke
And I'm trying to do
Everything
Sick Boy
Medicine
And I kill beef
Burger King
Elroy, and I jettison
Out the atmosphere
I was always here
Girls tremble when they see me like it's cold in there
I do not talk don't chat neither
If it ain't about me then you shouldn't talk either
Bambi mixtape got poppin'
All the super late girls asking when the album droppin
If you ain't gettin yours then you better get something
My shit hot shit like turd in the oven

[Verse 2]
My mouth drops classics
Lips are historic
Tongue is amazing
Ask your clitoris
Underground king like the young Bun B
And these haters are pussy so they should love me
Cuz I'm so T-I-T-E
Niggas can't believe that my shit is free
Indie rap niggas smoke purp, drink tea
Nigga, pop quiz: what you know about me?
And what you should know, I do a lot of this
I mean business, I'm the Economist
Big bad wolf, blowing over your cottages
Nigga on Twitter, but ain't easy to follow this
I'm dropping new shit, like the early bird
Shout out to Silver Lake
Shout out to Williamsburg
To all my Slick Rick kids looking dapper
Do your thing and you are just a rapper

[Intro: Rihanna]
Feel it comin' in the air (Uh huh)
Hear the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can't be scared when it goes down (This, this goes out)
Got a problem tell me now (To everybody in middle school)
Only thing that's on my mind (That didn't fuck with me)
Is who's gonna run this town tonight? (Listen)
Is who's gonna run this town tonight? (This goes out to all them, them dudes that get picked on)
We gonna run this town (Here we go)

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Yea, the flow so absurd
It's C.G. boy, king of the black nerds
I gotta get my Urkel on
I won't stop until I see an afro at Comic-Con
And not just Samurai
I was an outcast, nickname Aquemini
The wait's over, like two pounds over scale
I'm doing big things like I'm eating out a whale
These niggas do the same shit because they scared to fail
I'm in a hot pink hoodie, I ain't ever scared
These niggas frontin', sayin' like "he gay and shit"
And then they wonder why nobody wanna play they shit

[Hook: Rihanna]
Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gonna run this town tonight
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Hey-heyyy-hey-hey-heyy
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
(Is who's gonna run this town tonight)
Hey-hey-hey-heyyy

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
We are, yea I said it we are
Nigga I'm a soldier, trooper like I'm VR
Where's my fuckin' key card
It was right behind me
Fuck it, home girl you can blow me in the lobby
My girl loves brains, so she is my zombie
Na home boy, I don't practice, this my hobby
They all say make a demo tape so they can sign me
Cause yo boy stay mo hot than Gandhi
Listen up (Illll)
I don't do this for the limelight
I do this for kids who get picked on for talkin' white
I do this for kids who rock out to The White Stripes
If you a nigga with glasses and skateboards, I got you right (Illll)

[Hook: Rihanna]

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow
To get here, it takes guts like the aggro
Crag
They used to call me fag
Cause I ain't wanna be on the corner holdin' the bag
"Well fuck them niggas, they only holdin' you back"
Said a little voice inside of me wearin' a yellow cap
Or maybe it was bright pink, I can't remember
Alls I know I wrote my first verse that December
Now I'm so sick boy, yea I'm straight loungin'
Niggas used to say "who?" like I'm Pete Townshend
Yea, it's hard to stay grounded
When you're Andre and MST 3000
All rolled into one nigga
I 69 a 49er boy, gold diggers
I grind all day to stay alive
So I guess I'm a Mac with a hard drive
If you think you hype now, see the boy live
Bright colors in the streets like I'm gay pride
Yea my hoodie look like it drank five alive
And these dudes play my shit like I'm Goldeneye
If you could see the best, go be it
And if I die young nigga so be it
Like I told you on the other track
If there's a dude tight as me, I ain't seen him yet

[Outro: Rihanna]
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Hey-heyyy-hey-hey-heyy
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
We gon' run this town tonight

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Queens, Queens

[Verse 1]
It's Minaj, little mama, get a taste of the hot sauce

In the ocean is where they gettin' dropped off
All I wanna do is party

You arrive, when it just get started
I come through at 2, and I don't get carded (haha)
Excuse me, I had to beg ya pardon
Mami ya flow sick, my flow's retarded (okay)
Cause you can take something and you won't be sick
But um, I can't help my retarded shit
Cause my flow stupid, wheelchair bound (okay)

Bottle of new meds, a good pair of Keds (word)

[Hook]

Now hit the dance floor, nigga 1-2-3

[Hook]

And to my dudes
If you keep a good bitch in ya crew (uh-huh)
And you rock a good hood, fuck a suit (yes sir!)

You can get it

[Intro: Childish Gambino]
Uh huh
Ok, here we go

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Yes I'm back to bat again
Yes these rappers sad again
The beat is hot and grabbin' them
And holy shit, like Vatican
Boy so sick he need a doctor in his condom
Don't worry about that hearsay just worry about what I know
Cause I know how to rhyme though
I got these girlies wailin'
Country's in my backyard, I'm Mr. Sarah Palin
Girls call me cutie pie but I don't really know them
Call me Mr. Facebook because I superpoke them
Leave that pussy open
But only if you want it girl
We can play SF4 grab a controller girl
Callin' me the prostitute, not cause I got a baby
They callin' me the prostitute cause "Fuck you. Pay me."

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Uh huh
Ay yo
Y'all niggas need to stop, stop, stop, stop
Uh huh
Ok, listen up
Y'all heard this shit before
Y'all niggas need to stop, stop, stop, stop
This is the part of the song where somebody's supposed to come in
And talk and shit
But I don't talk
I just do baby

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
My turtleneck tucked in
I'm spittin' shit like I'm Teddy Ruxpin
With batteries in
I don't really eat words but I do eat carpet
A nigga stay down like I'm made of stock markets
I love to sport green like my last name Flanigan
I'm breakin' up with girls over twitter like Aniston
Cause ain't nobody know me but my momma and my daddy
My flow stay hot like I keep it in the attic
Put my cash in the freezer
Cold presidents
So I call them Frost Nixons
Or Eskimo Clintons
Fuck with my pension, you 'bout to get your head lost
You gotta pay me double back and that's your overhead cost
Cause I'm the boss
And yes I stay sauced
To that creak in the cave
Oh behave
Bitch

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
Uh huh
Let's do this
Keep it bouncin' y'all
I gotta get outta here
Yo, you know, it's C.G

[Hook: Akon]
We get it poppin' on site
I'm sure you already know my stylo
See I've never been a buster just a true hustler, my squad is lethal
Come with the right price
I can make you look bigger then nino
Just put a gun in your hand let you ride with the man cause I'm a motherfucking hero

[T.I.]
Just to make sure he don't get it clear like Pallegrino
From asceno to a kilo I'mma neighborhood hero
They be talking blow but they ain't never seen a key though
Never chop them 63's down to triple 0
Hate on me so much but I'm what you wanna be though
Might of went triple platinum but you never been a G though
I keep the 50 with me tote it round like it legal
Fly like a seagull, ride around with 3 girls
Keep it pimpin' with me you know you don't want to see those
So what we can meet up you get your ass beat up
The reason people honor me the reason why you under me
You don't believe we run the streets well come and see nigga

[Hook: Akon]

[T.I.]
I'm the man that's apparent even when I'm running errands
Got to be the McLaren or what I'm wearing got 'em staring
Bitches I share em if they in my harem
They ain't getting high well I don't go near 'em
Nigga wanna die tell him buck I dare 'em
I ain't gonna spare 'em homie I'm gonna tear 'em
Apart from his heart to his ass swear to God
Give a fuck about his partner give a damn about a charge
I take it to far pull up where ever you are
Empty clips in your new car
Picture you dead and zoom off
Admit it you lost probably cause shawty to raw
You flaw ayy tell em how we do dawg

[Hook: Akon]

[Akon]
Got a box of ammo that I rarely use
9 millimeter that shine like shoes
Hope the day never come where a nigga have to
Let it go on the bust and hope it ain't you
Cause I be on deck on the grind like sex
Taking over local city street like feds
Breaking down ever nickel, every dime, every brick
Down to the last dollar, I mean every bit

[Hook x2]

[Intro]
Just got off the phone with my nigga Smitty
Shit too real back home boi, for real

[Verse]
This for my nigga, Ced, hold ya head
I know shit rough, but nigga we don't give up
We don't get mad, nigga, we just get tough
We just get right, nigga, we don't get left
Fuck what they said
'Cause what we learned coming up, you can't teach that shit
Life deal a nigga blows, but we eat that shit
This one here's for my brother, we gon' beat that shit, now
I say my prayers
I got too many people in my head right now
So many that's in jail or they dead right now
One time for my nigga Craig right now
He in the feds - damn, the times change
And these stupid niggas talking 'bout crime pay
You can keep that shit
I just made a million, call me when you reach that shit
Ain't bragging, I'm just shedding some light
One time for my granny up in heaven tonight
And the young boy from a show down in Hampton
Told me that my song was the reason he beat cancer
Ain't know what to say, I just froze
Little too deep, I suppose
But after a year of review
I figured out it wasn't me, it was you, nigga
Congratulations
Kill a flow cuckoomani last king and on the daily
Call a mother fucker by they government, but call me crazy!
Yeah I’m on that fucking juice
Have a sip I’ll fuck you later
Money on my table, pick it up, I’ll call it tip the waiter
Yeah, I’m the first to last, alpha, omega
I ain’t trying to talk, bitch I’m concentrating!
I'm the dopest nigga , word to Ronald Reagan
She don’t play no games, she blow me like a Sega
Hundred thousand on my tax
Twenty thousand on my tats
No lie, I’ve got twelve hundred snapbacks
Go yard everywhere, bitch I’m ballin
Young money running shit, you niggas just jogging
Shoutout Drizzy I’m posted in Toronto
Ice so bright, diamonds on vitiligo

Hotter then the summer coupe
South beach fountain blue
Cherry pie leather seats roofies on tomato soup
German shepherd in my engine, barking at you scary bitches
Best defense, nigga...!
Had a couple tickets, I was young into wrestling
Choke slam a nigga, big show pick ‘em
I’m on my P's and Q's
I don’t ask questions, I figure shit out

Multiplying decimals
Son o' hecklin in my denim, lick the bullet like a lizard
Couldn't see me with a sigma, definately ill autism
Hard alliance but its Tyga hotter then a fucking iron
Put that bitch on silent cause she talking like she Tyra
Too much, Uh niggas say they baby mommas love me
Crazy, I was on a tour with Diddy counting that Ciroc money
But it’s young money, YM hoes
T Raw go , nigga they know!

Cause you’re real or fake, real or fake
Real or fake, real or fake!
Most bitches, niggas gone me real or fake

Stop blowing up my cellphone

[Intro]
Yes it is
A crime is a crime
From the tiniest marble that rolls down a storm drain
To an autographed baseball that rolls down a storm drain
Now who's doing this
I'm in, I'm in
To the storm drain
No Charlie
No

[Hook]
Good morning, I gotta take a stand
Nigga this who I be, nigga this who I am
Good morning, I gotta take a stand
Nigga this who I be and I hope that you understand
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Childish Gambino
Hot as Nevada, Reno
Niggas that say, what he know
Give me five like I'm Tito
I never touched a kilo
Opposite Al Pacino
I keep a light saber like I fuck around with Greedo
It's time to be a grown-up
Nigga get your odor
See a nigga rolling
Riding on diplomas
Damn this beat is so nuts
Thank you, MC DJ
Yeah, my mouth is nasty
Like I gave a BJ
I don't give a fizzuck
These niggas are out of lizzuck
This nigga is off the hizzook
Like walking out a prison
For me I see the vision
You're fucking with ambition
Casino money like Navajo
Their money says, Geronimo
My money comes in lotto dough
Be me on the other tit
Call me Mr. Masturbate
Tighter than your jerking grip
You looser than some turkey neck
Haters need to listen up
My attitude's a prostitute who broke
Cause she don't give a fuck

[Hook]
Good morning, I gotta take a stand
Nigga this who I be, nigga this who I am
Good morning, I gotta take a stand
Nigga this who I be and I hope that you understand
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever

[Verse 2: MC Chris]
The game is afoot, the mystery's at hand
We like to pilfer podiums, in other words we take a stand
We make a plan, attack that jam like it was Afghanistan
We like to ride our bikes, mother fuck a mystery van
Stop and listen be shoplifting 'pocalyptic Stephen King
I take a stand, fuck the man
Now will you please pull that string
I need your case and a dime
But we also take Fruit Roll-Ups
Takin' a bite out of crime, so all criminals better hold up
I be riding forever
Like a vampire on a bus
Like a roller-coaster tester
I be riding till I bust
I got my magnifying glass
My bike matches my cup
Watch my seekers eat pedal
You can dine on my dust
Whatever it is we can handle
But we really don't do murder
Fuck up suspects, gather clues
Then we break for a cheeseburger
No shit Sherlock, mad like Murdock
If there's a mystery going on
Be in it like Robin Williams chilled in Good Morning, Vietnam
Nanu, nanu, nanu, nanu

[Hook]
Good morning, I gotta take a stand
Nigga this who I be, nigga this who I am
Good morning, I gotta take a stand
Nigga this who I be and I hope that you understand
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
This comedy movie was not fun to make
At all
So when you're sitting in your living room and you're yucking it up
Or in the theater
Or, you know, and you're saying oh with your little friends
Oh this is so funny
It's not funny
We started making this five years ago and we're still trying to get shit right
I'm going to get some Cheez-Its from Krafty

[Verse 1]
I'm Ace, what's your name? (Britney)
Oh that's nice, do you wanna hang out some time
That time on the clock, we could either go to Rosco's or Wingstop
Unless, you wanna see a flick, my homie work at pacific
That means I could get a ticket for a couple six bucks
But that's priceless compared to getting my dick sucked girl
I'm just playing, I'm not really hanging out with you for laying
I'm tryna mold a relationship I'm claying
So I can hear your thoughts and see what your saying
Favorite color, AP Government, this conversation I'm loving it
We can talk about your favorite music, talk about politics
I got an open mind I'm into all type of shit

[Hook]
I just wanna be your friend girl (you're so respectful Tyler)
I just wanna be your friend girl (we could be friends)
We could go to the movies, you don't gotta kiss me
I could pull my pants down, you don't gotta lick me
Even if we go to the bathroom, I'll help you, we don't have to getta quickie
We could have study groups, girl just hang with me
(Best friends) yeah, (forever)

[Verse 2]
Look bitch (yeah) I'm not here to conversate, and listen to all your feelings, aight?
I got things to do, my daughter hungry, bills to pay, and games to watch (what are you talking about?)
I don't feel like listening to your feelings and how you feel and your favourite colour and all that (*gasp*)
If I can't put nothing in you, I shouldn't put no time in you (*gasp*), you understand what I'm saying? (no!)
Holla at your boy, here's a lesson to all men (what are you talking about?)
Yo, if she trying to stay in that friend zone, zone her ass to her friends (gasp!)
(I cannot believe you) N-no, don't give me that, don't give me that
Bitch, roll up
(Aww, I thought you were different)

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
We are really close and this party's really loud
We should go outside and talk, better yet, let's take a cab
We're kissing in the back, my apartment's pretty close
Baby, let me make you breakfast, an omelet with some toast
These girls are on my mind (On my mind)
Wasn't my design
To be sitting here across from you, pretending I ain't lyin'
I know exactly how you feel, I wanna keep you real
I never thought that I'd be working for the start 'cause

[Chorus: Garfunkel & Oates]
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
I know this thing will never last
I need to tear it all apart
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I can lose it all

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
I don't have the heart, fuck it, I don't have the head
Every time that we're apart, someone's sleeping in my bed
I wanna be alone, I wanna be alone
This fame and fortune shit shows me things I wasn't knowin'
You're my biggest fan, I promise to be there
I wanna be that guy, but I don't think I can
I'm losing everything, I wanna let it go
I wanna take it right and slow because

[Chorus: Garfunkel & Oates]
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
I know this thing will never last
I need to tear it all apart
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I can lose it all

[LiL' Wayne:]

Too late your brains already beachcabla

[Verse 1]
Ambien's in my travel bag
Fiji water, first class, destination France
Fascinated by my watch
Hypnotic trance
We on the coast jetskiing with exotic fish
I like a fresh sea bass on my plate
Cruise ship dinner cause the dollar's levitate
Yours like a centipede slower than a turtle face
Pop, shake, lap dance
Move your body like a snake
It's all Gucci when dollars is flowin'
Pourin' Moët in bitch's hair
Livin' in the moment
Tell your mother you're good
I'm a rap star
To pay the hood
Took the top off Bat Cave, Bat Car
Batman mask off, Bruce Wayne in the flesh, Mr. Alfred
House guests Sinbad with the genie luck
Always winnin' when you don't give a fuck, so

[Hook]
Don't wake a nigga up
Don't wake a nigga up motherfucker I'm
Dreaming
Don't wake a nigga up
Don't wake a nigga up motherfucker I'm
Dreaming

[Verse 2]
Eatin' taters wakin' up in Vegas
Some girl look like Katy Perry said we had her naked
The hangover can't remember shit we barely made it
Housekeeping said there's panties hangin' from the ceiling
Tyga strike bed and Penthouse guest level
We all got suites, niggas all thorough
Turn the jazz on, said she thirty-two but she like them young
Real MILF, she blow me like Bubble-Yum
Don't spit 'til a nigga done
Ten minutes recoup beat it like a drum
We all getting laid tonight
It's a Laker night, win it in overtime
Primetime on your satellite
YMCMB that's Tyga tight
Last king covered in gold
You see me dazing so nigga don't

[Hook]

[Alarm clock ring]
I do not talk, I am just a rapper

Stompin' on these niggas like a whack-a-mole with no hands
Get girls on the floor like slow jams
Fuck yeah, I'm feelin' myself, no lotion
My light shine bright, no roaches
Nigga, I'm focused
You the one who eyes wrong
Only time I'm worried is when I'm the no-fly zone
Cause I'm so fly, homes
Fresh like pinecones
Female phone book my iPhone
Margarita bright, meanin' limelight
Nerd girls losin' their shit like prom night
Mouth like a pussy, it can never be too tight
Let me guess, you know a better rapper you, right?

Bam-B
Sicker than your grandma
Pass the mix-tape to a friend like Chandler
This track is gettin' over written:
'Sports Night' banter
Tell 'em that you know me when you runnin' through Atlanta
I am at the top
Whether you want or not
And I am in my prime
I am an autobot
I do not talk a lot
I am just a rapper
Fuck a girl's pussy bright red like snapper
Sick

Yeah, I stay fly like a pelican
Get new kicks everyday like an ottoman
Ex-girlfriends askin' if they get a shot again
I try to call 'em back but there's a lot of them
Someone tell me why these muthafuckers busy hatin' me
Just because I'm rappin' and my style is kinda Japanese
Band of outsiders
Kitsune, APC
Macy's got shit on me

Fuck what you heard like a dick inside alarm clock
I ain't got no jewelry, I leave it at the pawn shop
Two of your chains equals one of my shirts, sir
You got Jacob's Jeweler, I got Anna Wintour
Niggas jealous cause I got more green than seven splinters
I'd rather spend that money on a polo from La Tigre
Young, smart, and handsome
Who could even ask for more?
I change the situation like auditioning for Jersey Shore

I'm the prince, put your crown on the ground (x7)
Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh
Sick
I'm the prince, put your crown on the ground (x7)
Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh
Sick

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah, yeah, ey

[Verse 1]
I know what you did
I know
So I'ma let you taste her
I ain't washing my sins
I ain't washing my sins

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're lying about the nights
Hiding all it behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did
You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
But, baby, it's okay
I swear it's okay

[Chorus]
'Cause I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything

[Verse 2]
Now these tongues don't twist like they did before
It's hard to keep me up
And you are dry
But, baby, it don't hurt
Oh, like you thought it would
The more of you the merrier, oh, oh, oh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're lying about the nights
Hiding all it behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did
You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
But baby it's okay
It's okay

[Chorus]
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything

[Verse 1: Earl]
Welcome to my home, the place that I hate
The place that I love, the Planet of the Apes
The place that I loathe, the boy minus father
Equals boy minus heart, always testing mama
Mic sessions thrash, life lessons trashed
Nights get cold as the knife that I grab
Zoom to your wife room take her life with a stab
Sure her ass look nice, it'd look nicer in a bag
And slung over shoulder, village slum soldier
Bayonet bloods when my cup runneth over
With sith lord dark side of the force
In the trunk of a Porsche tryna butt fuck Yoda
Shotgun, drop T, Earl flow shogun
Jabbing with a pen while you faggots getting toes done
Hold up, I was four going on grown up
So before you niggas tell me I'm nuts, you better grow some, faggot

[Hook]
Fuck this Christmas
Fuck this Christmas (Nigga fuck Santa Claus)
Fuck this Christmas
Ain't nothing for you (Ain't no gift for you)

[Verse 2: Tyler]
Crazy mothafuckas in the North Pole causing ruckus
And the punk nut-crackers couldn't cuff us, how I fuck her
It was quiet how I stepped in, I crept in with my cock out
Now she's having make-out sessions with my weapons
Drunk a fifth of eggnog, stole Santa's reindeer
Joy-rode the North Pole, steering is a bitch so
I hopped out and ask some Jasper elves for some info
Where I can burn some Christmas trees with large amounts of thick snow
I've been acting naughty problem child in attendance
John Ritter said he taught me how to mothafuck a Christmas
Dismissing all the wanting and the presents are forsaken
See if you're the gift from God then I'm the Christmas wrap from Satan

[Hook]

[Outro: Hodgy]
You, bitch you can't get nothing
No more, no more presents, no more cranberry sauce
Bitch you can't get nothing no more
No more fleeces for your caprices and shit
Bitch give me my mothafuckin' presents back, ain't none for you
Alright for real, you gon' have to give me my fucking presents back
Cause those are for my grandma, yeah that thong, that was for my grandma
Give me my presents back, give me my gifts

[Chorus]
I've got so much to say
I know I've came so far
You understand my Swag
The you should look up in the stars
The stars, the stars, the stars

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
No big names. No big chains
Just Plain Pat visions with some sick aim
Cool Beans though, 10 Deep Jeans ho
Stampede fitted in the range with a knitted
No gimmick: Real time, Real heart
Real words...Elegant: A piece of art
No famous name vouch and I'm still the shit
Nigga first couple songs, no guest appearances
Now you sick, mayne. I ain't takin stabs
I'm just taking names, then I'm kickin' ass
I'll never be retro like a Cool Kid
With only two songs, look at what I did
Me and my nigga Wale let them suckas pass
Till we fed up and wet up Where niggas keep they swag
To the 'R'. Ruin niggas hopes of success
After LeBron, I'm what's next

[Bridge]
Look up at da stars
Look up at da stars
Look up at da stars

[Verse 2: Wale]
Now I'm back on my grizzle, A plethora of strippers
I'm throwin around broads playing monkey in the middle
I'm curious Jorge, Fuck what dem whores say
Most of them is faker than the horse hair they forced in
I be in the club looking for a couple more of dem
Sorta like my first date. Fresher by the hullin'
I don't need your girl. Man I got a lot
They say he got a lot of whips, well I got A LOT
You can't unwind it. Rising and climbing
Ain't nobody brighter... I'm the man Winona Ryder
Lex Luger, narcissist, the mirrors get excited
The game is a store, Then miracle what I am
Maryland where I am, You niggas is behind us
There is not a list to find 'em
Anti-violent...Stylin, Lyrically inclined and
Who so ever hate, Mother shower him in violets

[Chorus]
I've got so much to say
I know I've came so far
You understand my Swag
The you should look up in the stars
The stars, the stars, the stars
Bitch I'm the shit, B-Bitch I'm the shit
Bitch I'm the shit, B-Bitch I'm the shit
Bitch I'm the shit, B-Bitch I'm the shit
Repeat it to yo' bitch, Tell yo' bitch I'm the shit
I'm so dis-disrespectful
Ask them bitches that you next to
Prolly hit it if I met you
I don't remember none of yall names
This ain't legal in yo' state
This that fire arm, that cherry balm
I light in yo' face
Mr. Edison, I put it on
That jewelry in my safe, now yo' vison gone,my bad my dawg
I'm sippin' on that case, Michael Kohrs on my face, so watch yo' step nigga
What, you deaf nigga ?
Don't you ever greet me with yo' fuckin' left nigga
All, all tinted up
I can spot you way quicker
I'm in the fashion district
Polo, fuck that Hilfiger
Yeah
Maybe you some bullshit
And I talk that real shit
I'm bout' to hit that kill switch
And burn this bitch like chili
I'm ill, and it's so evident
I just threw my evidence
In the crowd, I don't give a shit
Too many people just got them tips
I'm hoggin
Slim, skinny nigga doe, ballin'
Pay cash for the cashmere, Ralph Lauren, Carlton
Your just a square in the office
Arlis, I'mma need a agent I'm spalding
Bi-Big donkey butt
She could be my target
I pinned the tail, I did it well, well done, so applaud me
This beat got me joggin'
Easy for a caveman
I'm inline, you talkin'
Cooler than my Ray-Bans
Darker shades, rain man
Get the cash, rain man
Killa' J's, Space Jam
The muthafuckin' Son of Sam
Pull up in that all white ice box
Hottest out the sweat shop
Pull a bear, mink out
Nigga I'm the muthafuckin' truth
You ain't't notice what I do
You don't do this how I do
I be rollin', 3x2
That's that BM-Dub 6 Coupe
Yeah I got that photoproof
Photobooth, no photoshop
Red beans, I'm super hot
Wait till my album drops
Nigga

[Verse 1]
Aye nigga I'm the best man
As if my best friend was getting married
Even with my eyes closed I'm something like a visionary
Paint you a perfect picture, nigga this is pictionary
Man they goin' have to put my picture in the dictionary
Right next to real then put your picture right next to fictionary
Claiming that you trill but you want bitches, all you niggas scary
Don't try to hide from it, oh boy we see you
Claim you goin' ride, oh no we don't believe you
Help wanted, classified, you need more people
Hating mind, I'm greater sign, hey we are no equal
My life is like a movie you like 3 or 4 previews
This the city where they glad to see your soul leave you
You're body laid back like neil so evil
Cole world baby 3 below zero
Getcha life snatched and your vehicle repo
I bring it to you live you gon' see it no TiVo

[Hook]
We on (nigga)
We on (cole world)
We on (cole world nigga)
We on
We on

[Verse 2]
Look man I'm tryna count money like a CFO you see us ho
Doing shows with hoes speaking languages that we don't know
Look here man, if love is blind then these bitches can't see no mo'
They fucking with the boy like a pedophile
If she won't go then we goin' roll cause J. Cole got a mean old flow
I looked up to some niggas but they ain't fuckin with me no more
Chip on my shoulder like I just left the casino oh
Nigga I been broke so don't hate me cause you don't see no dough
Hip-Hop was like Santa Claus cause no body believed no more
And then I came around, now nigga watch me paint the town
A lil black, a lil brown, a lil white, we a mess
This is Carolina repping you can check-in, be our guest
Me I'm blessed, shout to Khaled while I'm howlin' we da best
All these corny rap niggas tryna be my BFF
Nigga please, go head with that old bullshit you rhymin'
See this that good music, so we ain't got shit in common nigga

[Hook]

[Intro]
You never know how things
Gon' turn out huh?

[Verse 1]
I know you got the best love that I ever had
I swear that when I look at you, the time don't pass
Intoxicated without a sip from a glass
Infatuation was real, thought we would last

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're gone away
Thought you were gonna stay
I got deceived again
I can't believe

[Chorus]
And now you got someone who don't treat you right, treat you right
Treat you right, treat you right, treat you right
You already know who used to treat you right, treat you right
Treat you right, treat you right, treat you right
You look for me and you know I be out of sight, out of sight
Out of sight, out of sight, out of sight
When you the one who told me to get out ya life, out ya life
Out ya life, out ya life, out ya life
That's unfortunate, that's unfortunate
That you didn't believe in me

[Verse 2]
You know I got the best love that you ever had
Tell me how it feels to know you'll never get it back
Baby, tell me how our train never got up off track
Never be the same, thought our hearts were attached

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're gone away
Thought you were gonna stay
I got deceived again
I can't believe

[Chorus]
And now you got someone who don't treat you right, treat you right
Treat you right, treat you right, treat you right
You already know who used to treat you right, treat you right
Treat you right, treat you right, treat you right
You look for me and you know I be out of sight, out of sight
Out of sight, out of sight, out of sight
When you the one who told me to get out ya life, out ya life
Out ya life, out ya life, out ya life
That's unfortunate, that's unfortunate
That you didn't believe in me

[Bridge]
Pain don't last forever
I'm telling you 'cause I done been there
Hurt turns to anger, friends turn to strangers
But right now I don't care
And you'll get there, you will, you will, you will
I promise, you didn't keep
So unfortunate
Your promise

[Chorus]
And now you got someone who don't treat you right, treat you right
Treat you right, treat you right, treat you right
You already know who used to treat you right, treat you right
Treat you right, treat you right, treat you right
You look for me and you know I be out of sight, out of sight
Out of sight, out of sight, out of sight
When you the one who told me to get out ya life, out ya life
Out ya life, out ya life, out ya life
That's unfortunate, that's unfortunate
That you didn't believe in me

[Outro]
You never know how things
Gon' turn out, huh, huh, huh?

[Verse 1]
I think I started something
New chick, just started fucking
Kinda early but I know we both love it
We both rushing
We can add titles but then we both cuffing
Rolling in the sheets until midnight moaning
I'mma go down south, then call it (?)
Pussy pink like like a lotus
I'mma eat it good like something out of lars
I'm all good like a summer day
Blowing out the cake, blowing novocaine
She really shouldn't but she prone to the lifestyle
TAC, ecstasy, in the white cells
Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?
Baby pick up
Heard she with some niggas, ballplayers, playing pickup
My pretty little princess, now she promiscuous
Supposed to be my misses, out here fucking niggas
I ain't tripping, I'mma get another bitch
I don't mean the shit, it's too hard to end the shit
I'd rather stay than call it quits
And now we fall in love again

[Verse 2]
Real nigga got hoes on my dick, oh
Couldn't see 'em, love how my eyes closed
Now I see 'em, ain't nothing worth it though
Rather be with you than out here a lonely soul
On the road, entertainment hoes
Bitches I don't know tweeting from their camera phones
Man this shit getting old
I just hope we still involved

[Intro]
Yeah, Hey, Warmup
Hey yeah
J. Cole, cause I got it yea
Hey warm up, yea hey uh yea
Cause I got it

[Verse 1]
I remember me and my niggas goin' hard on that BlackPlanet shit
Was finna go to college, need a BlackPlanet chick
While you was playin' hard like a BlackPlanet Crip
Talk that shit in real life I had to backhand a bitch
Remember back in '99 my favorite rap Canibus
Bomm Sheltuh was the shit, Nervous Reck and the clique
Put the battery in my back, gamme' the gat and the clip
Now these hoes want a nigga phone number and a dick
'Memba back in '98 that's when I first planned this shit
Watch when I hit the streets these new niggas can't exist
When ya'll was wearin' rap diapers I was tearin' down cyphers
This ain't no overnight I put in time like a lifer
'Memba back in middle school they used to think that I was hyper
Now I throw the Ritalin in my flow, get 'em hyper
Watch for vipers, that girl is a snake
He gon' wife her, shit
You know powder blue suit, white Nike her
Hey she that nigga leftovers
You the microwave
The bitch done seen more clubs than Tiger, (aye)
Get a driver plate, while he drive away
Yea you was almost fly but your flight delayed
A little late boy
Me and my niggas been eatin' off little plates boy
And yeah I'm hungry so trust me don't feel safe boy
This is Carolina's finest
I'm high without the marijuana, honest, I promise

[Hook]
Yeah, Fayettenam
Yea, you know that I got it
Yea you know man
I'm a sure shot right now homie, I got it

[Verse 2]
Ay 1996, my own room now, I'm hangin' posters up
Holes up in the wall my stepfather said I ain't supposed to
But I'm hoop dreamin', hangin up pictures of my idols
Jordan was like Jesus, SLAM was like the Bible
I used to read it twice and cut the pictures out
Had the Jordan free throw dunk tongue stickin' out
Focused tryna' figure out, should I leave it here or move it there
Even hung them shits on the ceiling
I had to use a chair
Cause I was only like eleven, ain't even had no pubic hair
Told my mama when I make the league I promise you a crib
And I meant it, was ill wit the pill
Real skinny nigga, you couldn't tell me I wasn't a little Penny nigga
Pictures of Reggie Miller, even David Robinson
Kobe with the half-fro Stackhouse and Iverson
Was all over, reflectin' my life, boy, you heard me
Top it off I throw on my Carolina jersey, fo' real

[Hook]
Nigga, I thought I was going To Carolina Nigga (I got it)
I coulda swore I was gunna be a Tarheel, Nigga, Dean Smith Nigga, You know?
It didn't take long though,Figured I'm not balling my nigga

[Verse 3]
Look I'm 13 now ain't shit the same
Yea nigga still hoopin' but the shit done changed
I got a new love, addicted to rhymin' it's like a new drug
Plus a nigga sick with it
I'm fuckin' whole crews up
And all hell, I started studying my idols
Pac was like Jesus, The Source was the Bible
I used to read it twice and cut the pictures out
I know my Mama wonderin', what the fuck is this about
Cause all that basketball shit on my wall was gone
Replaced it with pictures of some rappers with firearms
And plus a couple posters of bitches posing in thongs,﻿
You niggas was mowing lawns I was in here writing songs PUT ME ON
I just wanna be the best for real
I wasn't doing it for no money or no fuckin' girls
Back then I knew I was the nicest nigga in the Ville
Right now I feel like I'm the illest nigga in the world
The World world word

[Outro/Hook]

[Verse One]

Professional thugs, police raids, federal bugs
Who else is here, Belvidere, several jugs
Home made rocks, eye-drops, and medical drugs
Selling you for revenue, sell and use incredible plugs
A shell or two no respect for you edible slugs
Execute feds arresting you
You confess to a lesser two without even pressing you
Before the questions through, you leaking street names and addresses too
The block fiends, I lock things, stones I sling
Rock jeans, grab Glocks cocked under boxed springs
Most niggas want money and power
Half of them niggas is funny and cowards get hit with dummies and flour
Most niggas sleeping, like lights out hours
But I'm eating, trying to ice out hours
The spoon to the floor, the glass to the door
Take the flash off the Ford about to mash on you all

[Hook]
It's Hustlers & Customers and
Niggas and snitches and
Players who want to profit and haters who want to stop it
It's snakes up in the grass and fakes who want your cash
Lock your daughter door and cock your fourty-four

[Verse Two]

I got few friendships, cause friends tend to shift
Leave you to fend for yourself in the midst defenseless
In any instance that right hand can turn witness
Had to develop long vision like senseless
View the business of hard white
I sat too close so now I read with far sight
Get money hand over like all right, homo or dyke, armor light
Red dots like record all white force Nikes rhymes to short mics
My niggas rob Peters to pay Pauls and extort Mikes
I don't pop Cris but to be Frank I was hurt when I heard they popped Chris
Now I'm moving mach-six
Y'all niggas is week, I'm leap year
Nothing to see here
Cops be at your house like "There's Nothing To See Here"
L-U-P get it clear in each ear
Before you get it ear to ear and need mouth to mouth for wiling out

[Hook]

[Verse Three]

The basics: court cases and ignore faces
All you little jokers can keep your war faces
Niggas is easy to get
These Weezy and Smiths turn bracelets into Hinckley and Schmidt
Get ya stuck, they're drying their sleeves
Or exceed the recommended miles per hour trying to leave
If you pull your guns out all the cowards will flee
Cause they can't front if they lose the power to breathe
I keep a good grip like OXO on the auto
Ready to cap from cop to Capo
Streets niggas get potholes
Carlos will get it in his paco
Pits get parvo, peezy part, yo
Your peeps probably think pop be playing
Cause I just started shitting, like potty training
Just give me two killers and a raw
And I'mma keep your "City High," without two niggas and a broad

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Girl I make you come fast, I mean come right over
Yes a nigga so street, call a nigga Grover
Hit it like I'm supposed to, love it when you're smiling
Except when you're not smiling giving my dick oral hygene
Girlfriend you know me, I'm all about my benjamins
But you stay sweet like an ever-lasting entenmann
Girfriend center them geniuses, that's me
Talking bout in and out with a girl named ashely
Jessica, Tamika, alison, stacy
Why does every girl in the world wanna date me?
Specially right now man, specially when I'm busy
Tell me that they love me, then they try to kiss me
Baby don't you see me? Knee-deep in that dope game
Meaning that I'm dope mane, hotter than that propane
Hotter than that propane, yes I said it twice dude
Always on the move I love the Journey like a white dude
Yes I know I'm quite rude, arrogant as alva
But I have the decency to back all of my words up
So let's not pretend like every girl don't wanna be ya
You can be my Ms. Obama minus Sasha and Maliya ugh!

[Chourus: ?]
You make me feel, feel so shiny and new
Like I'll never be blue again
And the magic moment feels so right
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you oooh!

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Why you always mad at me, I was gon come right back
Fucking with them fly girls, that was only chit chat
It's part of my job, yes I'm young and charming
And I smell like money so these girls are all up on me
Let's have bygones be bygones, they don't know what they're doing like a cylon
Trying to get my python, you can check my iphone
Rolodex Gchat
When you come over all I ask is "Where my V at?"
Like I work at APC, look at me rambling
You can be a pimp, these girls making money but they'll never make sense
Half of yall crazy, the other half trying to get their paper having babies
Naw I ain't down with that "Hooohh!" like a thundercat
Try to poke holes in the base where I keep soldiers at
Sneaky like a Cheshire cat, sneaky like a baby sneaker
One of these girls got my number I ain't trying to meet her
Yes you are fine Anita, but I ain't trying to be the
Father of five you need to find a new guy or either
Step it up 2, but you are not Cassie
Cause you have full head, I mean you're smart nasty

[Chourus: ?]
You make me feel, feel so shiny and new
Like I'll never be blue again
And the magic moment feels so right
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you oooh!\

Ooohhh girl
Ooohhh girl
Ooohhh girl
Ooohhh girl...

[Refrain: Claret Jai & Ludacris]
We're so furiously dangerous
Fur-fur-furiously dangerous (Mr. Porter)
We're so furiously dangerous
F-fu-ur-furiously dangerous (Luda!)
Fur-fur-fur-fur (Listen...)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Death by lyrical injection, I kill you rappers
A lotta green with a yellow complexion
Women call me the Green Bay Packer
I pack the zero's, meaning mucho dinero
So paid, rappers is waitin’ on trades
And they all gettin' Knicked like Melo
Hello, Luda
Tell theses other boys double up
Cause I got some work all on my waste but I call it a tummy tuck
My every records jumpin', or playin' double dutch
I shit on rappers every verse just got the bubble guts

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Let me tell this to the people not understandin' my moxy
Animal, watch me if you think it's tangible, stop me
But then I hit 'em with a flow that they can't even copy
See we don't play that where I'm from it's like fantasy hockey
Sup with the dog, thugs want a war
Bad GM, what you want to trade slugs with him for
While you cuffin 'em all, I'm stuffin' her jaw
Then leave 'em for you to rebound
Kevin Love on the boards
Dog, you and your skill retard hard from of our squad
I'll put you on a crash course in a Smartcar
While I'm speedin' not relyin' on the brake pad
In a car that you should only drive on a race track
So the lines about your phantoms and your Maybach
Are ghost tales of the phantom, face facts
You ruined hip-hop
Slaughterhouse will payback
Get in shape and a tatt
We done faded to black

[Refrain: Claret Jai]
We're so furiously dangerous
Fur-fur-furiously dangerous
We're so furiously dangerous
F-fu-ur-furiously dangerous
Fur-fur-fur-fur

[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9", Claret Jai]
I went from eatin' Top Ramen to bein'
Top Rhymer, check full of commas
No regrets except for the drama
I remember a time when my only perfection was my momma
My mind a long erection
Now it's time you bow down and erect a monu-ment in my honor
Cause bitch I'm bonker, plural
In the whip with my Ivanka, pompous girls
She on E, feelin' on me, singin' on-key
While I'm bumpin', We Are the World
Got her sniffin' Britney, no he didn't did he
We run this town, No he isn't Diddy
I feel like tiltlin' the glass
She take a sip with me
She from the city of Jackson
Call her Mississippi
That was pretty witty
Your man like a Black man tryna get re-elected
He ain't gettin' diddley

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Stickin' it to the pedal, pedal to the floor
Just whippin' it through the ghetto
Metal in the door
In case I gotta throw some lead into ya, boy
Referee mind state, I’m settlin' the score
I don’t know what ya’ll hatin' for
Wait, wait, know what, matter fact
I don’t know what you’re waitin' for
I ain't finna say nothin' turn the bass up more til the speakers pop
I get a kick outta that, like a sneaker spot
See I was a little kid with his thumbs in his ears
And his tongue in the air going na-na-na-nah-naaar
Just when you think it stop na-na-na-nah-naaar
Everything I speak is hot
Don't be mad at least everything you speak is
I can’t think of nothing nice to say, you’re not nice okay

[Verse 5: Crooked I]
Rapper, hustler, entrepreneur
My shit fly like I'm launchin' manure
Lord of the underground, God of the sewer
On Hennessy Black, on Con-to-the-jure
Yeah, I'm off the block
This ain't work, homie I'm off the clock
I'm a syllable Hannibal killer
A cannibal with a mechanical mandible to deliver the flammable
Ammo, lyrical animal off the top
Rep that West til I walk with Pac
We the 2.0 Boys, Tiz, Crook and Joe, Royce
New Ghost Rolls Royce pulled off the lot
Pop me the only way you could stop me
I'm top seed, I clock green at mach speed
So watch me if you haven't seen a phenomenon
Spit fast as Lamborghini's and Ramadan

[Refrain: Claret Jai]
We're so furiously dangerous
Fur-fur-furiously dangerous
We're so furiously dangerous
F-fu-ur-furiously dangerous
Fur-fur-fur-fur

[Outro: Claret Jai & Ludacris]
I suggest you shut down
Pack your 'ish and turn around
Because tonight we run this town
So let your feet swiftly hit the ground
We too dangerous for the world

[Verse 1: DC Pierson]
Mr. DNA, flow so Jurassic
Clumsy archeologist about to drop a classic
Damn right we got a t-rex, I paid for that in plastic
Clumsy archeologist about to drop a classic
Mistake still burning but I'm learning like a raptor
Take what I'm given make it work like an adapter
Make short work of her, then I will adapt her
Critics all agree it was the work of a master
At last my success will match my fatigue
And at last I'll send my children to an ivy league
In the masks from The Strangers, freak the whole place out
Get your glasses on, girl, geek your whole face out
Don't open up your mouth unless to let something great out
And that's not a beef, that's just a peek at the steakhouse
A week at my maid's house to recharge my battery
Then I'll be right back on top like Slattery
You know from Sterling and Cooper
If she's paid out then I will recoup her
And if she's paid out then I will invest
And if she's really played out then I will impress
Upon her the need to please please me, whoa yeah
Girl I'm on my knees, Ooh, I need it so bad
It's like I work at NORAD
It's DEFCON-5
Go out back to my car and drive
Cause shit just got real
Take a thirty wreck drive into a field
Pass out in my vehicle
Hope I wake up in a world more agreeable
Hope I wake aboard unidentified flying objects
Or a reject Enterprise
A Starfleet drop out odyssey
A route to cop out galaxies
'Til then I'm in the light, right where the moths are
Impressive, depressive I'm a Goth Star

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
I do not talk, I am just a rapper
Nigga I'm on
Niggas try to off me
Like these girls like I like my coffee
In my lap Fuck this track
It goes off beat but I'm on like clap
And dog, you can have my scraps
I'm close to these girls like her tampon flaps
I'm having an effect on the hood like crack
Even though I'm so suburban like a backpack strap
Don't you get it? Read Ayn Rand
Then you'll understand why they call me the man
I'm just fucking special-er
Different from you other guys
Hating me in high school made me metamorphosize
Kafka-esque, The way I dress
I need to send Bo Diddley some checks
On Marc Jacobs, Commes Des Garcon tie
Diddy is my swagger coach, can't stop, won't stop
Heavy hitter, short stop, horse face, horse cock
Bouncer, door stop, tell me when enough's enough
Looking at me warming up, microwave a nigga flow
Pity y'all don't see me though the rest of y'all already know
I get it like I gotta, man, Flier like a college band
Niggas looking for a deal and I cut out the middle man
Drinking fucking grape juice, early at a wine bar
Blacker than Depeche Mode so I'm a Goth Star

[Verse 1]
Girl I make you come fast, I mean come right over
Yes a nigga so street, call a nigga Grover
Hit it like I'm supposed to, love it when you're smiling
Except when you're not smiling giving my dick oral hygene
Girlfriend you know me, I'm all about my benjamins
But you stay sweet like an ever-lasting entenmann
Girfriend center them geniuses, that's me
Talking bout in and out with a girl named Ashley
Jessica, Tamika, Alison, Stacy
Why does every girl in the world wanna date me?

Let's have bygones be bygones, they don't know what they're doing like a cylon
Trying to get my python, you can check my iPhone
Rolodex Gchat
When you come over all I ask is "Where my V at?"
Like I work at ABC, look at me rambling
You can be a pimp, these girls making money but they'll never make sense
Half of yall crazy, the other half trying to get their paper having babies
Naw I ain't down with that "Hooohh!" like a thundercat
Try to poke holes in the base where I keep soldiers at
Sneaky like a Cheshire cat, sneaky like a baby sneaker
One of these girls got my number I ain't trying to meet her
Yes you are fine Anita, but I ain't trying to be the
Father of five you need to find a new guy or either
Step it up 2, but you are not Cassie
Cause you have full head, I mean you're smart nasty

[Hook]

Ooohhh girl (x4)

[Intro]
Yeah

Pokin' holes off in the condoms tryna have a baby ass (what?)
All up in Saks Fifth when you deserve Macy's ass (*scoffs*)
Talkin' bout "Shit, yeah nigga, better pay me" ass (bitch)
All up in my house and I ain't tryna room-mate her (mate her)
She in and out my drawers like it's, like it's Room Raiders (raider)
She crazy and deranged (yeah), when she in the Range (*car screech sound*)
Skip the jewelry store and grab rocks
Like she Tomb Raider (raider)
But before you hit that Alter and the preacher start pronouncin' (uh-huh)
Gave her half your heart but she got half of your amount (oh yeah)
Of whatever's in your account
So take that into account
And you best get to count-in'
Before you gets to bounc-in'
Bitch

[Hook]

Headaches every night a nigga get it from the drama
Man if she don't make that money, she gon' take that money
Not from you?
Then she'll get it from Your Honor (your honor?)
Believe that, fuck you get my password?
Readin' through my emails and you ain't even ask first
I know I should leave her
For damn sure don't, don't need her
Every time I try and hit the door I always hit that ass first

[Hook]
(Man I should've known)
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
Should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muh-fucker

Man I should've known, should've known, should've known

Till The World Ends

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Aye, chimpanzees is hatin' but I take it all in stride
Put her in a jungle with bananas on the side
Told you they'd revive your career but somebody lied
I ain't talkin' poultry when I say this chicken's fried
Anyway, Britney
Why they so jealous that you teamed up with me?
Tell 'em they my son, yup, gyal 'em a mi pickney
Anyway, brembedell
What's that? I don’t know, but Femme Fatale
Sniff, sniff, cries
I done slayed your whole entire fucking life
Oh, you got some Epsom Salt
I done balled all day, you ain't touched the court
What? What, you tired? You need a break?
You was hot when? Ricki Lake

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

[Verse 2]
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
For ever and ever

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
"Is that Charlie? Hello Charlie!
Great..."

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Lord forgive me

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Kill him where he stand and stand over him
Shake his hand, then jump back in that minivan
Double back to his block and blam
I ain't backing down for nothing
I'ma back 'em down like Shaq
With this black 2-2-3 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single, man
Police radio signals saying that a 187 land on your corner
Coroners comfort your momma
"Momma, he's dead," the next morning
I toasted up with my homies
We drink and smoke marijuana
Want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from
Uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished
I don't know, I don't have conscience
I just load up and start dumping on enemies
I'm headhuntin', no sympathy
Ain't no love when you in these streets
Just get something, protect your neck
'Cause they coming for sets, respect
Split your onion, then chop your deck
Your head tumbling like gymnastics (Ooh...)
'Cause ignorance is bliss

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
We all tryna ball, and when I got the rock, I'll dish off
Until the day I pistol-whip you posers 'til y'all pissed off
Then peel off in a hoopty
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably, I'm too street—indubitably, I'ma do me
Better than your bitch would, 'cause you niggas too weak
But just give me two weeks and I'm good
I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card reading; I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game—I'm including the planet
Cats so watered-down, clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around their neck and watch 'em panic
Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently, you're a parrot, mocking me and my blueprint
But I won't share it, just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff
Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments
The critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?
Proves... that ignorance is bliss

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hittin' so hard

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm So-Cal, you so-called rappers need to go call Ghostbusters
'Cause you busters are Casper when I go off
I show up to show out and show off
You a hundred percent behind me
And if you are, then wreck your car
And walk up to my crime scene
I remember bein' seventeen, wishin' someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backin' down bargains, backin' down bitches
We gon' flip her
Once she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her
'Cause ignorance is bliss

[Outro: Kendirck Lamar]
And Willie B, I'm a fool on your beats
I bleed out the speaker as the speaker that spoke when they didn't speak

[Intro]
I remember, uhh
When my uncles
Served smokers
On Alondra
In front of our building, they was my heroes

[Chorus]
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe

[Verse 1]
Uhh, and that's scary to me
Dope beat, dope flow, vary to me
Especially when Sounwave is on his P's
Nigga cue me in I'm a Peruvian drug lord
Don't fast forward, I'ma serve you some keys
This is crack co-caine, I'm Kurt Co-bain
And I bang like a C-R-I-P
P-I-R-U, high you I'm a I-V
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack— STOP
I said a I-V cuz when I be in the studio, I shot
A needle in your veins, take it in vein
Or itch till your eyeballs pop
I'm cold on the cold turkey
I hate chickens but I do fuck pretty birdies
Where your girl at? Over the Pyrex, where my world at

[Chorus]
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe

[Verse 2]
Uhh, and it's scary to me
Every listener is a strawberry to me
You pussies ain't shit but venereal disease
Z's on K.Dot? Uh-uh better wake up
A nightmare, I'm right there like a Siamese
-Twin, when, you mothafuckas gon' learn?
Curl up like Big Worm when I drop
Who fly? I'm a red eye with eye drops
I Big, I Pac, you Chris, I Rock
That's Pookie on New Jack head first with a cyclops
I'm the first one to do that I bet you never knew that
Back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on?
If ain’t about me about ho it be about face
If you ain’t on higher—learning
There's soda in the pot and the fire—burning

[Chorus]
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe

[Verse 3]
Uhh, and it's scary to carry
A smooth type flow like a drink of Merlot
That'll freak y'all out like a girl Virgo
When I turbo on any track, it's a Reynold's wrap
And I rap like a nigga who invented rap
Rapping heat, you can fall to defeat
If you don't pay ya tolls like the limbs on ya feet
I suppose this is bigger than life
This is probably everybody, Illuminati
Guess I'm the blood sacrifice of the party
I undress her like a Harley
Lights will flash, cars will crash
Smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
So my bad if I put you in rehab
You are reimbursed, put it on my tab

[Chorus]
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe

[Outro]
Aw dude, you're about to fuckin' OD bro

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
One time
Reporting live
Compton, California

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
Back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
Chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet
Oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter
And life's a bitch, don't hit women, so I bit her
I struck enough pain let her know I wasn't playing
I was so sincere like Nas' first name in Belly
They tell me, it's very difficult to see 25
And if I survive it's probably with a celly
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
In the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppe's
They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets
Fulfilling voids of broke D-Boys selling weed
Fucking up my prestige, 'til I live with the blues
BB King or the neighbors of Snoop, that's why I'm

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar, Ash Riser & Alori Joh]
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say I can't live comfortable
I'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire
We are, we are (Fighters)
We are, we are (True)
Through the, through barbed (Wires)
We will, will break (Through)
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
Tryna get away from the world's stereotype
Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny, she desperately
In need of some inspiration, see what the people saying
She gon have a baby then flee from her education
At the age of 16, credit card scam schemes
See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
She'll never get by, no how, no way
Welfare recipient, property of the state
Housing, Section 8, corner store prostitute
The owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she's cute
Hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies
And this baby daddy is new to the family
Chilling in pajamis, waiting on the first
Fast forward spilling drinks on her fur, that's why she

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar, Ash Riser & Alori Joh]
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say she can't live comfortable
She gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Through the barbed wire
We are, we are (Fighters)
We are, we are (True)
Through the, through barbed (Wires)
We will, will break (Through)
So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Through the barbed wire

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Have you ever felt like, you finally got life
You finally got right? No longer a black sheep
Living off ya dreams like Christina uh-Milian
In the front seat of a convertible eloping to get married
What a feeling of overcoming the odds
It's like we just hit the lottery, my God
There must be a God, cause golly
You done made it through the fight while squabbling Ali
Now ya lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cuffs
And you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
And she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
Making good decisions, got a independent business-mind
And both of y’all are steady grindin', doing it the legal way
Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
But they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth
You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out

[Chorus 3: Kendrick Lamar, Ash Riser & Alori Joh]
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say they can't live comfortable
They gone tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So even if you overcame doubt and ya living ain't bad
Know it's a barbed wire that's always in your path
Through the barbed wire (Just laugh)
Then everybody say...
'Cause I won't get caught again
And I'm here to stop the trends
You can catch me if you try
Disappear into the night
And I'm gone

[Outro: Alori Joh & Kendrick Lamar]
So you made it past all the barbed wires?
There's one more left *Gunshot*

[Verse 1]
I’m cooler than an ice cube, yeah I’m rude
‘Bout to get your head sliced, yeah I’m nice
And you ‘bout to pay the price
Like The Price Is Right, but I’m not Bob Barker
Yes, I get down like I’m Charlie Parker
Meaning that I’m musically inclined
If you try to get with mine I’m about to blow yo head back
Get another bullet and I spray bullet (bullet)
And I spray back, pop, pop, click, click (drop, drop) down
Now they lookin’ for your body like all over the town
Niggas, my name Gambini, I used to be clean
Now I’m dirty martini, ‘cause this boy met world like Feeny
These niggas make wishes like genie

[Chorus]
Nigga you know how we do
Latinos, black people, and gringos
This money stained my fingers like Cheetos
Blast it out your speakers like credo
‘Cause I can barely hold it all in like Speedos
These niggas got a lot of nerve
These niggas got a lot of sneaks
And all these skinny bitches busy shop at Anthropologie
Who you tryin’ to be?
I’mma take my girls to BIM and treat ‘em like a VIP
Because I am a G, ugh (G, ugh)
I start the party like Chex Mix
Put it in your house like Netflix
Beef, nigga, it’s what’s for breakfast
Y’all niggas got beef with this kid
Y’all niggas’ punks and stay punks like the Misfits
I'm way off in the distance
Y’all done lost the race like McCain
But like McCain, you used to be cool but now you lame
It’s hard to maintain ain’t it?
Because I am so much better (than before)

[Verse 2]
My swag is so sick, you might catch it
I’m tired of fuckin’ ‘round with little kids like I’m Brad Pitt
These little kids need to play in traffic
‘Cause all they words make a nigga giggle like Mad Libs
I’m hot like an attic in the summer
And girls scream “Sick Boi” like we know each other
But we don’t know each other, you ain’t my fucking brother
We need to separate like organic peanut butter
My lightsaber flashing, my kneecaps ashy
And girls of the world used to walk right past me
Now I hang with girls like my girl Kate Perry
I might have to marry Kate like my name Ashley
These rappers don’t know what they up against
They can’t see a nigga like my names Snuffleupagus
If you don’t like my shit, why the fuck you bumpin’ this?
I am so much better (than before)
You better get it clean good ‘cause this the last straw
And break inside your house and leave your gas on
Nigga, we NASA, ‘cause we ‘bout to blast off
Go in the bathroom, we see you peein’ like I’m Shasta McNasty
Get it? UPN? Shasta McNasty?
Nigga, I’m a master
And I’m fucking plastered
I don’t need a fucking beat for this, I can make my shit up
While I go here’s the part that I’m about to show ya
I’m the best ‘cause I gotta
The devil wears Prada
And he’s got a boom boom like Welcome Back, Kotter
Leave your guy like Madonna
Got cheese like frittata, green ensalada
Got ya, mama
Most rappers want the drama, but I don’t want the drama
I just want a quiet night down at Benihana
I rap ‘cause I gotta
Dude’s got nada
I make ‘em all proud like my middle name Obama
Yes, sir!
Is the boy wiz khalifa, man!

I’m down here… so come holla at me
I came to kick it with my man, dj… you understand?
The whole town…
Shut up, stay bye
You know me!
The hottest around
Do this! yes!
I would tape that will light the talk as if it’s all now…
I ain’t about the …this bitch made ain’t the type of this …
You want me to switch blade like the knife i’m sharp
God damn, man!
I mixed steps to…
Yes, I was blessed to outlast you
My… so yes, i’m at the castle!
Put up big numbers, i’m not a little nigga
You do it way big, i’m just a little bigger!
And I move with the unit, I move …
Just stupid, you’re losing bitch!
Hey! and I ain’t here to entertain you, fools
I’m here to snatch my… give you lames, the news!
You all stay and impose… i’m on my job
Writing gems and flaws
..with a bird, no cameras, no
Long gone, i’m on the …lurking in the…
And it’s for certain i’m a channel
Because i’m perfect with the rhyme
And i’m hurting niggers, hey!
When the boss in the place gets paused in his way
Cause sees a skinny nigga
But its large in his ways
It could be the car or your face, bitch!

[Chorus]
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?

[Verse 1]
Dear Anne, my number one fan
I write with the light from the lamp on my night stand
With my pen in my right hand and that's also my mic hand
Codeine in a Sprite can, ink on the white pad
And I'm thinking of life, Anne, and wrong and right, Anne
And sometimes I'm right and sometimes I might
Cannot find the light still my rhymes are bright
So I continue my plan and I'm sure like white sand
That they'll be price paying before my flight land
But still, I want to see more than my sight can
Adore so I can't ignore what I want anymore
So I just go you can call me the goer
And oh, yeah, I got a girl, she act like I owe her
And uhm, sometimes it seems like I just don't know her
And yeah, the relationship is starting to feel like a chore
But I really hope I'm not starting to bore, page one

[Chorus]
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?

[Verse 2]
Dear Anne, my number one fan
I write you this letter, I hope everything's grand
I hope everyone's good, I hope everybody's praying
I hope, hold up baby, let me switch hands
See, lately I've been dealing with a lot of shit, Anne
It's burning me and I can't get out of this pan
And everytime I look there's a problem with this man
But I ain't tryna expose, I'm just tryna expand
But your support held me up like kickstands
And I'm also being more careful in how I pick friends
Anne, I'm trying to stay up out them chicks' pants... but I just can't
But on another note, this ain't just another note
This is more than a rap, this is more of an oath
And I know you're wondering what this letter is for
And I'm just hoping that you read this far, page two

[Chorus]
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?

[Verse 3]
Dear Anne, my number one fan
By now, you probably think that I'm portraying who I'm saying
And sometimes I wish I wasn't him but I am
And it's people like you that make me proud of what I am
Hey, you are the shit, damn, pardon the gram'
But it's like you make me feel like I'm a part of the fam
And shit, when my life is like some sort of exam
It's a jungle out there, lions, horses and rams
Shit, as I sit and wait for the war to begin
I just think of you then I'm rewarded again, Anne
With you is where my artistry can, Anne
So with you is where a part of me stands, Anne
I hope I see you in the stands, Anne
Because you know I understand, Anne
And I'm sorry about Stan
So I wrote this to say that I'm your number one fan

[Chorus]
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?

I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a 9 to 5, fresh out of school that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then I had no job
Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association story of my life, nigga
You gone make me flip then split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louis's Burgers
Hold my tears I tried my best, let it go drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin's margin
Maintaining my modest, modest as I dream
So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it
Life itself I know it helps let me scroll through my Blackberry

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Hey, whats up, daddy?
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I said keep reading my diary, when my life's entirely
Surrounded by the irony of living in the city
I said they wouldn't hire me, I said I got my ass beat
And the only thing can help is ass and some titties
So what's up, baby? I said what's up?
I had a long day and I really wanna fuck
See I ain't tryna think about no phone bills
Credit card late fees, Capital One popping up on my caller ID
Pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow-tip shots
Watching my vehicle break down on another man's block
Man that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear
You know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
Or run through a pothole at two in the morning
Scared to hit your emergencies cause then they'll be on it
See I know when the harsh reality take its toll
Open up your contacts then scroll

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Hey, whats up daddy
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Welcome to my diary, hmm.. where should I begin?
Finna get a Swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step, better yet they work my every nerve
Cutting me this worthless check, the concept is so absurd
Like a church in debt, a turtle in a turtle neck
Convertibles with turbojets, fueled by 7-Up and prometh'
I feel like deaths around the corner like the quickest wide receiver
So I took another shot, Tequila hit me like a nina
My sky's gray, my bitches brighter
Always saying lights please, J. Cole's her ghost writer
And I'm the God MC, join my diocese
Free your mind, don't mind society
And finally, everyone got their own problems
Everything is subject to change like broken dollars
I'ma drown in my drink and swim in my woman's vagina
Like a piranha fin, it gets harder than Rihanna when

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Chorus]
When I get old, I'ma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe they'll be makin' it big
And I know
That life is nothin' easy (Nothin' easy)
One day, I'ma change the world
And they'll finally believe me

[Verse 1]
Hey
From the outside lookin' in, it seems that I'm fine
But they don't know shit about the everyday grind
Time is money, money is time
They tell me get there at five but I'm runnin' behind
I try and live a little, go and have a little fun
You only young once, all the hatin', that be dumb
If life a joke, then I'm waitin' for the pun
You all about the beef but me, I'm 'bout the bun, the bread
'Cause I was just a little knucklehead
Now I got my shit together, spittin' what they fuckin' with
If they ain't, it's great, no attention to the hate
Nothin' changed, still cuttin' up, Henny's still my drink
I'm still the same old dude, now I'm makin' moves
It's like everything I do front-page news
I ain't playin' in this game to lose
I want it all, no secret, the change, they can keep it

[Chorus]
When I get old, I'ma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe they'll be makin' it big
And I know
That life is nothin' easy (Nothin' easy)
One day, I'ma change the world
And they'll finally believe me

[Verse 2]
Hey
My grandpa told me one day I'll be everything and more
It's better never to question every lesson that's in store
See, it's a blessin' that I'm gettin' through the door
The money gon' fall, when it rain, it pour
Dear music, you're everything I have now
When there's an army comin' for me, I won't back down
'Cause I never was a kid in the background
Just a class clown, but who's laughin' now?
My moms cried when she saw me in a cap and gown
It feel great to see my family proud, but
I make mistakes too
My people always tell me, "Mac, please don't ever let the fame change you"
They say I'm so different, but it ain't true
Still got the same girl, roll with the same crew
I'm just doin' what it takes for me to make do
And everyone around me gettin' paid too

[Chorus]
When I get old, I'ma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe they'll be makin' it big
And I know
That life is nothin' easy (Nothin' easy)
One day, I'ma change the world
And they'll finally believe me

[Verse 1: Drake]
Took if from signing my own yearbook to booked for the year
Got a condo and I couldn’t even cook for you here
Took it from bs checks to TSX
To people wondering if its the Phantom he gets next
Who knows, its the rabbit its buzzing for real here
The rapper everybody got a cousin he’s feeling
Its kinda ironic you fit with them
Cause they wasn’t really around when it wasn’t appealing
Now its denim diamonds an perfume spraying
Four star rooms are the worst you stay in
(I love the line about the range with the rims to match)
What girl that wasn’t me who’s verse you saying
Shit I would never tell you nothing like that
Them other niggas you spend on, cuff em like that
See the difference with me I don’t forget the past
And you gave me nothing so I’m gonna give you nothing right back, like…

[Chorus: Drake & Colin Munroe]
Where were you when I...
Would’a loved the person you trying to be now
Its funny I’m the dude you trying to see now
Where were you when I…
..was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but
Where were you when I was…

[Verse 2: Drake]
Young, dumb, looking in the mirror
Trying to figure out who Im gonna be this year
Its funny you managed to be around for the present
All puns intended your funds are mended
If I take back the cheddar it'll better for both us
No debts owed we can both let go
Before this I could never get a call from ya
Now all texts finish XOXO
But this ain't hollywood squares to me
Sweetie I’m far from a hollywood charity
And I bet when you talking to your friends
You messing with other dudes that you probably compare to me
But if its not Drake and one of us wrong you forget my birthday and know none of my songs
You coulda told me before your heart wasn’t in it, fine
But try to get a start at the finish line
Ah

[Chorus: Drake & Colin Munroe]
Where were you when I...
Would’a loved the person you trying to be now
Its funny I’m the dude you trying to see now
Where were you when I…
..was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but
Where were you when I was…

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I come from a city
When 9/11 dialed up, everybody riled up hundred gun pile up
They lay it on the line, make sure you don't get file up
Hammer in and out of court, nigga don't get trialled up
I'm chasing cheese, dodging rat traps
Chasing pussy, you might end up with a Kat Stacks
I'm outtie like a hatchback
For them whole and half stacks
Trying to make at least half back, nigga af-tax
D-town I honor ya, they hearts drop when they see me on tall monitors
Blasting my city that's your ass in my city

Help, you know I need someone
Help! Help!
Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
So sick, need a doc, yes
A creature, monster like the Loch Ness
I gets hotter by the toc, when I sizzle to death
I just tell the clock, "Give me a sec"
In the middle of the war where my enemy at
I'm running this shit like Eric Bieniemy back
Cause every time I hit a track, I'm like an energy pack
The instruments are crying out, "Where the sympathy at?"
I attack before you begin to react
I'm from the dirt where the Beatles and John Lennon be at
And now these niggas looking yellow like a penalty flag
It's Weezy baby with this hustle 'til infinity, yeah
Like somebody let the dog out the kennel and ran
Whoever did it was a very smart women or man
Cause I'm coming like the stomp of every marching band
I need y'all to arch your hands and pray for me
I need

[Hook: The Beatles]
Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody

Yeah, well alright
Uh huh, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's a celebration, clap-clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscato
For the girl who's a student and her friend who's a model
Finished the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl ya on fire can I be the one you match with
I give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where ya tats is
Show me where ya hands at, maybe I can grasp it
They say if ya get her you can understand her better
And she known to be a cheater but that's only if you let her
Yeah, and I got it together
So when they talk they try deter me it's like whatever
Tell em' I appreciate the help but I just gotta know for myself

[Verse 2]
This lifestyle is foul this shit'll damage ya
Especially when you think noone is understanding ya
These girl groups with they overprotective managers
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space
You remind me of Tony's sister in scarface
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate
Goodness gracious on top is such a hard place
Yea... but if you never even been there
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures in ya swimwear
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air
I know that shit is exhausting girl
And your mistakes are costing girl
And maybe you don't need the help but I just wanna see for myself

[Intro]

So are us
No such thing as sobered up
You closed-minded

High yellow woman with her hair to her ass
Bring her home, fuck her like a bear, then I crash
And when it comes to head

Got coke for the snorters, drank if you slurpin
Even got a couple pills for if your back hurtin
Uhh, they call me Mr. Pharmaceutical
I'm gettin money every time I'm in the studio
I'm gettin money bitch even when I do a show
I get the money even if I have to sue a ho
That's how the game go
East side play it cold

You couldn't be me if you could
Weezy Baby, Lucci Lou, and we good

[Chorus: Lucci Lou]
I'm Goooooood
I'm Goooooood
I'm Goooooood

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
This is the finish, my friend, this is the end
It's a revolution, it's a civilian revenge
There's no need to move or adjust your television
Whenever an era dies, another era begins
These American fights, these American wars
These American stripes, these American stars
But these American cages have American bars
We hunger for truth, so we headed for y'all
Towers are crumbling, bridges are falling
Limits are fading, the normal is boring
Looking at time move progressively forward
Look at the days just, just vanish before me
You wanted a Benz but you couldn't afford it
Now you would kill to put your foot in a Taurus
It's different from the madness, and never look backwards
But this is a crisis, prepare for disaster

[Hook: Female Vocalist (B.o.B)]
Start spreading the news (Start, start, start, start spreading the news)
I'm leaving today (And I'm gone, and I'm gone, and I'm gone just like that)
I want to be a part of it (Be, be, be, be, yeah)
New York, New York
New York

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Breaker breaker 9, breaker breaker 1, 9
Could you please get a operator on the phone line?
This is not a riot, it's way much more than that
These people are dying, we are under attack
Wait, let me call you back, let me get my strap
'Cause we ain't taking shit, so therefore we're fightin' back
We ain't waitin' on the line for a 9-1-1
9, 9, whatever man, I ain't got time
For all this nonsense, enemy responses
Ain't a dial tone in a home on the continent
Got me in these bandages, this jungle is up under me
Man I swear they sleeping, they unconscious, or they slumberin'
So we break the peace to get a piece of what we want to get
Act like we new to this, like we gon' rummage it
Let them know we run this shit, and let them know this how you feel the way your country is
Now look how beautiful destruction is
POW

[Hook: Female Vocalist]
Start spreading the news (Start spreading the news)
I'm leaving today (I'm leaving, I'm leaving, yeah)
I want to be a part of it (Be a part of New York)
New York, New York (New York)
New York

Okay, thought about it for a minute

You're my homie, baby you're my homie
Simple math, pen & pad; gotta work out
You're my homie, baby you're my homie
But you're my only, baby you're my only

You're my homie, baby you're my only
She's the past, you're my future, my right now
You're my only, baby you're my only
And I'm sorry, girl you gotta know it
Grab a seat, just try to hear me out girl

[Intro]
Woooo! It's Shady aka the Army Shady Records
Break it down

[Bridge]
I do a lotta spittin' and I don't gotta try
But I ain't got rhymes to waste, so let's make it
I don't say I'm a gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop something

[Verse 1]
I got a friend of mine, named 50 Cent I signed
This shit's official now, the deal is finished and it's time
To get down to this business, let's go get these nicks and dimes
So hurry up and cop G-Unit shit before it's gone
Its like a goldmine for my man to take nine
And bounce right back, gotta be like Michael Myers
This shit must be a sign, these labels must be blind
Columbia, I know this must be fucking with they mind
They know they 'bout to cry cause they missed out, but I
Know how to get the dough cause Dre gave me a business mind
I said in my line, I hit 'em with the nine
I had a empty clip but they ain't check the chamber (Ha!)

[Chorus]
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel our shit, you gon' hit the stop button
We gon' fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel our shit, you gon' hit the stop button
We gon' fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'

[Verse 2]
Damn, 50
This shit's about to hit the fan, 50—Fuck happened to Ja?
He got the sickest vendetta, he must think that you better
You 'bout to play with his paper, you gonna fuck up his cheddar
Now homie think we gon' sweat 'em, but we just gon' forget 'em
If he don't shut up we'll dead'em, let Yayo stomp his head in
It's all good 'cause we'd rather rap then to let a pussy play us
Out of pocket homie, so tell 'em, he better be easy
Start some bullshit, he'll get his whole crew wet
D-Twizzy, Obie, 50 Cent, and G-Unit
Yo, he don't want it, cuz, he's always drugged out
You won't see one picture where his pupils ain't bugged out

[Chorus]
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel our shit, you gon' hit the stop button
We gon' fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel our shit, you gon' hit the stop button
We gon' fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'

[Verse 1]
She singing, "Bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say"
I'm like, who knew? Who knew? Who knew?
That after all the years, I'd make a Weezy fan
Out of you too, you too, you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke
Chris Martin and U2, U2, U2
When you met me, I was Three 6, Pimp C
Bun B, 8-Ball and MJG, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always

[Chorus]
I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, "Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me"
My girl found it in the car and said
"Baby, why you trying to diss me?"
'Cause you know you're my baby
Oh, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
You said, "One day, I'll start up my car and it'll explode"
Well, now that's the last time I'm letting you watch Casino alone
You hate when I leave you in the motel while I hunt for jobs
So now I let you drive and wait outside in the parking lot

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we're both a long way from home
Just keep the windows down, the radio's on, always

[Chorus]
I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, "Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me, kiss me, kiss me"
My girl found it in the car and said
"Baby, why you trying to diss me, diss me, diss me?"
Don't you know you're my baby?
Don't you know you're my baby, ooh?
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah

[Outro]
You'll live a better life
(A better life, young one, a better life, young one)
A dull life ain't nothing
Don't speed, who cares what car you're driving?
No Benz can make you friends
She don't care what car I'm driving
And no Bentley can kiss me back
This song is dedicated to my '91 Acura
My 1991

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Uh, first verse, uh, I'm armed 'til I'm on an island
My life's ridin' on the autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, or kill y'all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been borned or if you conformed
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past, so
That basically resurrected my cashflow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight, my blood type's the 80s
My 90s was like the Navy, you was like the Brady's
You still fly kites daily

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Catch me in my Mercedes, bumpin' "Ice Ice Baby"
Screaming, "Shady 'til I die!"
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinking 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Danish)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is
‘Cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really, I belong inside a dang insane asylum
Came to drive them trailer parks crazy
I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's "back" with a capital B with an exclamation mark
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
‘Cause when I rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim, a statistic of this shit
‘Cause after I spit the bullets
I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics; so get this dick, I'ma live this—

[Chorus: Sly Jordan]
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Uh, yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with a bottle as Captain Morgan attacks my organs (C'mon)
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the devil that says
"I'll let you take me, you let me take a shovel
Dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian" (C'mon)
Go back and forth and, more beef than you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy, down
My tenement chimney now, the semi’s the remedy, pow
Spin him around, enterin' in the vicinity—

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Now, was called M&M
But he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up (*ptt*), and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get-get down
He's lookin' around this club
And it looks like people are havin' a shit-fit now
Yeah, little tr-tr-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I st-st-stutter, motherfucker?
Fuck the mall, he shuts the whole motherfuckin' Walmart
D-d-down every time he comes a r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with 5'9" to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater he's tryin' to dr-dr-drown
Shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dick-suckin' lips
I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick
Then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head
Then I'ma have to take it

[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9"]
And then after takin' that I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gon' say the whole rap game passed away
On top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater, slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson's activator (Woo)
Meanin' I'm on fire, off the top, might wanna back up data
Rollin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor trailer
Homie, they're sick, you could normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense?
That these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Dropped in the lap of a tax evader, homie, they spent

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
What, girl? I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator of this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell your boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You're rollin' with a player
You won't be exaggeratin' when you say you're livin'

[Chorus: Sly Jordan]
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)

[Outro]
Pedal to the metal
Pedal to the metal

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
I'm rolling through Ladera in a Bimmer looking cleaner
Drinking on a blueberry Slurpee, eating that fajita
My passenger seat is occupied by señorita
And mother keeps on bugging me about wanting to meet her
I don't really need her, I'm just tryna treat her real nice
And later on, up in the night, I could go eat her
And make a lie about the gonorrhea
So she don't feel guilty about me wanting to leave her
That "FUCK" on my t-shirt print is cheetah
And I got that '87 bunny flow, like an Easter
Basket, you faggots is plastic, like nerds with old glasses
But I'm still liable to get my ass kicked
Kinda sorta active, a Baby Milo addict in the attic
Where you losers can't get me
Nikon and the Canon, they were never the same
And please do not take a picture, I can't be seen with you lames

[Hook: Tyler, the Creator]
Man, y'all some muthafuckin' lames
Man, y'all some muthafuckin' lames
Don't lie to yourself, y'all some lames
Man, y'all some l— fuckin' lames
The Canon don't flash, y'all some lames
I cannot be seen with you lames
You mothafuckas is— lames

[Break: Tyler, the Creator]
Ahem
Tyler, the Creator
Ugh

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Can't stop, fall, flashing, like a cop car
Me and— ("Yay"), no Rockwell, I'm a rock star
Fuck y'all, the O.F. is banging on 'em
Custom crewnecks rolling 'round with Ronald Regan on 'em ("Yay")
Y'all drug dealers, I Carl Sagan on 'em
Chop and screw Nas tracks, I got piano's waiting on 'em
My shirt is yellow, but the grill is gold
I couldn't take the Rit-lin 'cause my therapist said the pill is old
I can't stay 

[?] lost control
I don't have sense, sorry, I sold my soul
For some gold Bapes; low-price, stale rate
Authentic, never fake, check the poll, our statistics
Stay with authentics, check my steelo
Cause my mob's goodie like we Cee-Lo, and he know
I am, yes, and even she know
Every instrument is a gram, kilo ("Yay")

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
O.F.M.
Bangin' on your F.M.
Ace the Creator

[Hook: Stefano Moses]

The city’s gone with electricity
No lights so I can hardly see
And all the smiles, screaming rescue me, rescue me
Who to trust, who can you believe?
The devil owns this reality
And all the smiles, screaming rescue me, rescue me
Storm

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Hate lies, never truth when it’s televised
Devils on the screen, fire in their eyes
Put your face to a spell make your soul fly
Pray everyday, so I’m close to God
Looking at the murder rate never ask why
Colt 45, with a 4 5, the innocent die young can’t judge life
Never did so I live fast every night
Wonder why they breathe hate through their wind pipe
Motherfuckers wanna take instead of give advice
Niggas left me now I’m living right
Trying to cheat death with a trick dice
Gambling can’t rely on management
If it’s ’bout business I’ma handle it
I see it all like an analyst
Views of the water, big bills like a Pelican
I’m into different broads, fucking in foreign cars
Wizard of OZ, teal colored Benz, I ain’t got a heart
No love shoot the cupid with a dart, danger in the park
Motherfucker don’t walk past dark
What the fuck is Illuminati
Old niggas with money
Bitch get the power light, stand tall tower light
Gotta fight, can’t let ‘em take our life

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Take a step as the world spin
Rumors come and go faster than a whirlwind
Whirlpool, bitches all getting sucked in
Booty model shake your ass but you’re broke bitch
Man you niggas ain't balling in the bull pen
Riding on the black mag, I’m a cool kid
Last king living, give me space like a movement
Cream get the money, whip icy like cool whip
Oh shit, who shit nigga art gallery flow painted on a globe
Use the colored dope nigga I’m a lobe
Levitator pro, crisis when he spoke, kicking in your door
Hit the flow like Leeroy with a globe
Trying to win but the finish line's far, race against the odds
Race don’t matter when you're dead or start praying to the gods
Don’t let me die so young

[Hook]

[Outro: Stefano Moses]
You're too brave, who will paint that creed on our faces
Like the stars you are far with your back to the others
Storm, storm

[Intro]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
AAAAHHH!

[Verse]
Satan's getting jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferring us
Books on not giving a fuck is what they're referring us (Wolf Gang!)
Wolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers
And young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us (Bitch!)
You niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
Instead, I rap about fucking bitches and getting heads
While you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead
Bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby
I'm not a rapper, nor a rapist, nor a racist
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
Brag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter
Then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox
Atta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our categore
Torture with the super soaker at the Asian liquor store
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore
That make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours (Umbrella)
I hate this, screaming, "Fuck patience!"
Got a nigga shaking like the calmest, fucking Haitian
After chronic masturbation, asking where Mary Kate went
I want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick
I make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose
Game of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose
She running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose
Until I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops
Victim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one
Honey on that topping when I stuff you in my system
Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome
You got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done
Nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you
With a leaf of salad and some dressing pouring out a teacup
Bitch, I'm Tyler, The Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches
Rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker
Jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper
Take her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
And snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's trying to suck our dick
Hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders
Gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer
They will never catch him or catch up
They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex mix, she bleeding from her rectum
Odd Future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up, yeah (Wolf Gang)
This the type of shit that make children break in apartments
When you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin
(I hate you!) Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover
Where I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder
Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland
Catch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossing the border (arriba!)
I'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water
Cause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Jesus' daughter
(Fuck Mary) I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins
Sicker than the starving Nigerian kids barfing
Odd Future Wolf Gang Nazi bar mitzvah
With your sister at the bar playing leg and arm twister
Evident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick
I got these cracker doctors saying, "yeah Bob, this nigga’s sick"
Animal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry
Because I'm the blackest skinhead since India Arie
I don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches
I said fuck coke and now I'm snorting Hitler's ashes
I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
Being the only bastard in a box logo casket
Rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets
In some Kanye West glasses screaming out "fuck faggots"
Catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
Drop the beat here to make it extra climactic

[Outro: Dr. TC]
What the fuck?
I... I'm speechless, that was... fuck
Shit, Tyler, you're gonna need some help
I'm not a... fuck it, different subject
How's that girl you were telling me about?

[Intro]
(Make it stop!)
Silicone, saline, poison, inject me
Baby, I’m a free bitch
I’m a free bitch

[Verse 1]
Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track
She won’t walk away, but she won’t look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a mess
She's a mess, she's a mess
Now the girl is stressed
She's a mess, she's a mess, she's a mess, she's a mess
(Tell 'em, girls)

[Chorus]
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he’s looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
(Tell 'em, girls)
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he’s looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
(Tell 'em, girls)
(Saline)

[Verse 2]
Run, run, her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights her way while she’s howling at him
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she’s a tramp
She’s a tramp, she’s a vamp, but she still does her dance
She’s a tramp, she’s a vamp, but she still kills the dance
(Tell 'em, girls)

[Chorus]
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he’s looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
(Tell 'em, girls)
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he’s looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
(Tell 'em, girls)

[Interlude]
In the dark
She loves to dance in the dark
In the dark
She loves, she loves to dance in the dark

[Bridge]
Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia
Tell 'em how you feel, girls
Work your blonde (Jon) Benet Ramsey
We’ll haunt like Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus, find your Kubrick
You will never fall apart Diana, you’re still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together, we’ll dance in the dark

[Breakdown]
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he’s looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Baby

[Chorus]
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he’s looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark

[Outro]
In the dark

[Intro]
If I said it, I meant it nigga...
We all in... everything's Taylor'd
And fuck it, we ain't gotta go to the store no more
I got my own papers baby girl, I'm finna get my own weed too
Get you a pound and let you roll that shit

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm rollin' up the windows while I'm smoking weed
Driving through my town like I don't know the speed
Countin' so much paper I can't fold it up
Bad bitch, she sucks me while I'm rollin' up
Yeah bitch, you probably see me everywhere
Money long, now my house got tv's everywhere
Literally everywhere you turn you see a flat-screen
New bitch...looked nothing like my last fling
Ridin in a Maserati nigga no shirt
Niggas probably hatin' on me but it won't work
Camo shorts on like a general
Mind on a mill blowin' on medicinal

[Chorus]
I'm just a young nigga hustlin', yeah...
Hustlin' yeah...

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Been through every nigga town, neva had a problem
Young millionaire, never had a job though
Throw that money up and watch her hit the ground
As long as your money up she said it's goin' down
Brought her homegirl said that she don't do friends
Kicked the bitch out and make her find new friends
Should I get hella high or buy some new rims
745 or a new benz
I take every day and live like it's the weekend
Doin it all if you ain't ballin', take a seat then
If I said it, I meant it...throw a stack at that bitch-ass
And let her pay her rent with it

[Chorus]
I'm just a young nigga hustlin', yeah...
Hustlin' yeah...

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
You wouldn't do that Tyler, kill yourself or anyone. You don't even have the balls to begin with. What you need is me, someone to talk to, uh, it's been a while since our last session. So, tell me what's been going on

[Verse 1]
I'm not a fucking role model (I know this)
I'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
Since Kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit
These mothafuckas think I'm 'sposed to live up to something? Shit
I'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless
But getting more pussy 'cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)
Philly to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares
At skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird
Yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
Now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
He still hasn't called me yet (that's not your fault)
But that's a whole fucking different argument, shit, I got over it
And a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy
A couple Hot Pockets and grandma could stop cooking
Them nasty ass collard greens, pressure's on me like this top hat
Bastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?

[Interlude: Tyler The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
"Tyler, you'll top it, you'll top that, you're a very capable individual"
"Okay, you guys caught me, I'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer, I lied"
"You know, you just want attention, you'll be fine"
"I try too hard, huh?"
"No, you don't"

[Verse 2]
Made a couple thou' and I just don't know what to buy yet
The 'preme shit is free and I don't drink, so fuck a wine set
Nigga, fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity
I'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity
Oh, that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper
Cause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research?
I'm the star of the group (Yeah)
So no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you
(Bastard was good though) What you think I record it for?
To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?
Like I didn't make "Parade" or "Inglorious"
Cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?
Of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off
In the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off (I bet)
Message boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver (here)
Let me bust one in they mouth, I know they full of flavor

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
"Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing, living out his dreams? Why they got to fucking hate?"
"I think everyone's happy, everyone's immature, everyone loves you Tyler, you have to believe that."
"I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fucking busy, I can barely kickflip now."
"Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time when you're at  home?"
"What the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the shit that I've been doing?"
"I have, I mean you're a great person."
"I mean, I'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole, I'm pretty cool, right?"

[Verse 3]
People excited, thinking shit is so tight (For what?)
Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic?
And start Jackson him off until his cack blasting off? (No...)
Fuck that, (Yeah) These niggas ain't fucking with me
Cause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech-of-the-nique
And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week
I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T
And some Waka Flocka Flame instead (I love that shit) of that real hip hop
That's bull-of-the-sheet, but they want to critique
Everything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released
But they don't get it, (They don't, it's not made for them) cause it's not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him
But they do not have the mindset that's same as him
I'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
"It is, but Tyler, you're going to have to cut down on that "faggot" word, that's very, that's a bad...
"I'm not homophobic."
"I mean, I don't think you are but..."
"Faggot."
"Alright, well, since the last time we..."
"The fuck is a good performance? I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can."
"I mean, you, you, it seems like you have fun. But your Twitter posts, just.. I mean, they're really random and it's ADD."
"Who doesn't have ADD..? Well, I don't."
"I mean, sometimes, you just say really outlandish things and we just want to know, what's the problem for this?"
"I wish Thebe was here."

[Verse 4]
Therapy's been sinning and niggas getting offended
They don't want to fuck with me cause I do not fuck with religion
You see, that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen
Here, put this middle finger in your ear (I'd rather not)
When someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed (What?) his AK-47
At 47 kids, I don't wanna see my name mentioned
(I don't think anyone's going to men—I don't think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you.)
College wasn't working and I wasn't working
So I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
But I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait
Cause the four days that I went, I wasn't learning shit (I mean, you...)
Now I'm living dreams that I wanted since eight
And can afford to get my mother something on her birthday
(I mean, you've explained to me that you were in school, but, I mean, I...)
They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone
My life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now
Wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons, nigga, throw 'em at pedestrians
(So, what are you saying, take advantage?
I mean, you've been doing pretty good, I've seen that)
I still live in my grandma's house
Sell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fucking life, but when I make that announcement
My hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
And then I am confused if I want in or just out
My friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling
I sit in grandmother's living room and just pout
And shout loud inside, sometimes I just want to die (No, you don't)
Odd Future came from the bottom
And it's gonna take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em
(I believe you) All you fucking lames don't have to like me
The devil doesn't wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fucking white tee

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
Whoa, umm, alright, uh, so you was telling me you went to New York...

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (Denim pockets)
On my waist, there's a black Glock (Black Glock)
New girl moved on the block (On the block)
She been plottin' on my brown cock (Brown cock)
Last night I slept over hers (Over hers)
During sex, I overheard (I overheard)
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen him sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude

[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Tyler, The Creator]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
And you touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window (Swag)
He's at your window

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'm a down to Earth nigga with intentions that's right
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one (Nope)
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top, I'm writing songs about we
We, as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
And you touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window
He's at your window

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
One, two; you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest
And fornicate with it
But that's because I'm in love with you, cunt

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place (Cunt)
I just wanna talk and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place, cunt

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
And you touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window
He's at your window
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
He's at your window

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
One, two; you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous

[Intro]
Left Brain, Wolf Haley
Golf Wang, Free Earl, uh

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, I love women
Daydream about penis being in 'em
Meet them with a big grin with a Mac-10
Rope, katana, and then I skin 'em
All beige suit made out of white women
With the red lipstick, dancing to John Lennon
With the red splattered jeans made out of blue denim
They can catch me in the spot where the sun don’t shine
Bitch, don’t mind me, shake your hiney!
The only motherfucking Wolf here that spit venom
You’re a bad bitch with a real good kitten
And I got the appetite of them fat black women
Wolf Gang in this bitch with a bunch of rats with 'em
Lookin' like the holocaust with Supreme hats with 'em
I am tryna get Miss Piggy by the motherfucking hairs of her chinny chin chin
Umm, what’s that? The cock of a black dude
Mad cause his daughter got the swag of a vacuum (Aw, fuck it!)
I’ll take her to the back room dungeon, fighting and punching
And now the slut is under the fucking assumption
That I will be fucking and munching her muffin
Cunt will be bleeding, but that’s not from the
Time signature of the month, umm

[Hook]
(It’s because) I’m Dracula, bitch!
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shit
'Til I grab them throats and start smacking them shits
(It’s because) I’m Dracula, bitch!
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shits
'Til she decides to take Dracula’s dick

[Verse 2]
Goddamn, I love bitches
Especially when they only suck dick and wash dishes (What?)
Cook and clean and grant my wishes
And make me and the Wolf Gang sandwiches
Transylvania crypt, let's take a tour
Bitch, try getting through that black trap door
Keep yelling and working them vocal chords
And that’ll be more of a reason that you get slapped up for
Is that Ford trunk's comfy? (Fuck you!)
Fuck me? No, fuck Buffy!
That little bitch keeps trying to hunt me
Jumping over gates, what the fuck she want from me?
She keeps sending me garlic
How many times I gotta tell her I’m allergic?!
(I like your cape!) Oh, this Bathing Ape cape?
Bitch, I got it for a bargain at the neighborhood Target
Fangs are sharp, and I hope you know
That all I really want from you is that throat
I can’t eat pussy 'cause I might leave cuts
Then there’s blood on my sheets, but that might be a plus
On the channel, a fucking animal, leaking like pairs of candles
Bitch, is it hard to handle?
I don’t want a bride, I just want bone marrow (Oh shit!)

[Hook]
(It’s because) I’m Dracula, bitch!
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shit
'Til I grab them throats and start smacking them shits
(It’s because) I’m Dracula, bitch!
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shits
'Til she decides to take Dracula’s dick

[Outro]
Bite her in her fucking neck, bite her in her fucking neck
Bottom of the fucking lake, bottom of the fucking lake
Call my gang of wolves and bats, call my gang of wolves and bats
It’s a full moon tonight, and these hoes ain’t actin' right
(It’s because) I’m Dracula, bitch! (swag, swag, swag)
(It's because) Left Brain, Wolf Haley, Free Earl, Golf Wang...
Golf Wang, Golf Wang, Golf Wang
It's the fucking (Golf Wang)
It's the fucking (Golf Wang)
I am from the (Golf Wang)
Nigga, this is (Golf Wang)
Fucking faggot (Golf Wang!)
Kill them bitches (Golf Wang!)
There's no one like us (Golf Wang!)
Fucking niggas, I am from the (Golf Wang)
GOLF WANG!

[Intro: Dr. TC]
So, you tell me that everything just isn't going well
Well, first off...

[Verse 1]
My only problem is death
Fuck heaven, I ain't showing no religion respect
Brain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret
Talking to me is like a fucking body missing a neck
But, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off
Life is a bitch and my cock's soft, the Glock's cocked
My hands tremble, my finger slipped, the wall's red
Her life is fucked, she's sad now, her son is dead

[Hook]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems

[Verse 2]
When I was younger, I would smile a lot
I'm getting older, getting bolder, but a wiser top
Now I'm drunk driving, lap's full of Budweiser tops
Life is a movie and you're just a prop
They begged me to stop, but I listen like deaf drums
Love? I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some
My father called me to tell me he loved me—
I'd have a better chance of getting Taylor Swift to fuck me
Annoying and I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me
I'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me
Feel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all
I'm Ace, I'm parentless, odd, kinda arrogant
Ignorant as fuck, offend people for the hell of it
Because I am the devil, fucker, get on my level
Doughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers
My life is Ms. Mon-unique Parker, but a little darker
I'll see you in a couple, OF

[Hook]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems

[Interlude: Dr. TC]
Tyler, here's some water, man. You seem a little tense. How's Thebe?

[Verse 3]
All because a nigga just don't give a fuck
Parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up
But fuck that, you're a shitty parent, face it, suck it up
That's what you should've did before that nigga bust, huh
Feel like I missed my little brother growing up
Feel like my little brother missed his brother growing up
But this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growing up
I got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bruh
Now I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm pouring up
But I never had a drink— (Sydney, Tyler's throwing up!)
My nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough
I won't feel the feelings I be feeling when I'm sobered up
But that's a fucking lie, why would he say that? I'm
As emotionally straight as Travis when he--(Tyler, calm down)
Don't look at me, I'm 6'5", about to fucking cry
About another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die
I finally had a family
Domo's in another state, and where the fuck is Riley?
Now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me
But before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?
Fuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death
One ear I got kids screaming, "O.F. is the best"
The other ear I got Tron Cat, asking where the bullets and the bombs at
So I can kill these levels of stress, shit
They say that I'm shock value
How about you hop off cock and turn volume down?
I haven't got around to telling my mom shit (why?)
Cause I don't know how to...(whoa)
All I want is her support, but no, it's the fights at home
When mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown
Now she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown
And hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone
Looking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone
Then they wonder why I stay at Travis' pad with a backpack
For the whole week, full of plastic-wrapped black tees
And deodorant like his house is my home
I could live with the same hat
And the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack
And the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday
Where I skate with the same fucking friends that
Didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh
"Message from The GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat"
Email full of emails, I never write back
Ain't kill myself yet, and I already want my life back

[Hook]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems

[Verse 4]
One shot, two shots, one gun, two cops
I'm going in flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers
You're on the side of faggots and cock blockers
I'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches
I'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human
Cause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys
You niggas can't harm me cause y'all know that
We at the fuckin' Dirty like it's laundry (Tyler, calm down)
Nigga, get off me

[Outro]
(Calm down, man)
Fuck off me man, fuck (what's gotten into you?)
I don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times
Sometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not (yeah, you...)
It's like I got a fucking voice in my head
Telling me to do all this fucked up shit, man (yeah, what's this?)
I don't fucking know, man (what's this person named then, Tyler, huh?)
He tells me to do this shit, that I don't wanna fucking do (what's his name?)
Tron Cat

[Intro]
Oh, I don't need the metronome, bro
Ayy
Kahn-da-muh duh-cay
When you wanna be, ahh
When you eat all the cheese
In the store, in the store, in the store
In the store, yeah, yeah yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
(It's this girl)
She lives next door
To the store that I loiter at
We talk every night, she cry to me about her guy
And if we text I get pissed when I get no reply
(It's this girl)
I know that she's the key to love
She is who I'm thinking of when I am beating Richard up
To mental images—her face look
The closest that I got was when I'm poking her on Facebook
(This girl)
Video chats are so exciting
'Cause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy
I'm getting gassed up, I think she's liking me
She's gullible and I just wanna take it like a pirate (Arrrrgh!)
(It's this girl)
I see her in class
Not really, two doors down, but anytime that I pass
To take a piss in a stall, I picture us in the hall
Locking lips on the wall, her hand grabbing my dick
My left hand on her tits, ah, my shit's getting hard
From thoughts of dating this bitch
(It's this girl)
Her name is my password
Fuck

[Verse 2]
(This girl)
All my niggas got they bitches and stuff
But all the bitches they fuck are known as bitches and sluts
And she's special
I know, to y'all, I come off as rough; but I'm the nicest to her
And I just want to concur, a relation
I want the cheesy dates at the movies
And stupid walks at the beach, and sharing straws in a cup
I never had that, so when we holding hands, walking home
I look past that, the fact she's fucking guys that I hate, but
(This girl)
Things are looking great; cut, copy
Last time we talked, she said that her relationship was rocky (Action)
Now that Mr. Faggot's gone, there's no one that can stop me
From bagging her, I got these tickets to the Roxy
(Girl)
Next day, metro's taking me home
I see her in the cut at Wendy's, she's not alone (Fuck)
Who's that guy? Wait, why the fuck he 'bout to kiss her? (Shit)
Come to find out, she got back with her nigga...

[Interlude]
(Damn!)
Fuck
(It's this girl)
Another one
It's not the first time

[Verse 3]
(It's this girl)
She's so pretty
Fuck self-pity, I feel so shitty
I wanna text her in a jealous rage
But if she reply to say anything, I'ma smile, I know
What do I do with myself?
Sit in my room for some days?
Play Xbox with piles full of wet socks? Fuck that
(Girl)

[Verse 4]
My nigga ask, "Ace, what happened to such-and-such?"
I could slander her name, and then tell him I probably fucked ("Yeah, I fucked!")
Or I could tell him the truth, and just say she ain't like me much
But instead, I lie, and say she moved to Nebraska

[Outro]
(It's this girl)
But she's not mine

[Hook: Tyler]
I can grab the fireworks, and soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous, but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you can bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke, but I'm just asking baby; сould you meet me by the lake?
Said bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake
Bathing suit, it's going down, shit just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me

[Verse 1: Hodgy]
I'm give it to her, she wants that summer time
I'm give it like no other cause she knows I'm hers
Damn right she's mine, we both know it
So when we separate everything fine, her phone ringin' in her purse
Damn right it's me, I'm her nigga, nigga
Come for mines in summer time, I'ma bust that trigger, nigga
Catch us Venice beachin', she wanna go shopping
Sun down after club cause she like to get it popping
Sangria on my freedmind, cause she likes to get it popping
No ecstasy for her, but she wanna get it popping
Drop topping, I measure her pleasure
Then drop in, when she get out of place I quantinize
She is my concubine, I am her porcupine
I poke her face her throat for taste, give me head like I'm on her mind
I know her analyzation, so when she try to fake
Summer time in the boat of love, meet me by the lake

[Hook: Tyler]
I can grab the fireworks, and soda, all the cookies we could eat
Make you nauseous, but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke, but I'm just asking baby; сould you meet me by the lake?
Said bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake
Bathing suit, it's going down, shit just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me

[Verse 2: Tyler]
I packed a couple sandwiches inside that basket
And brought some extra towels if anyone was asking
We should take a dip in that lake quick and then split
Then do something that's beyond what we both can imagine

[Outro: Tyler]
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, grab a drink
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, look in the sky
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, we never have to leave
Watch the sunset (There goes a rainbow)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (We can stay here)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (All night long)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset
Watch the sunset (There goes a rainbow)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (Look)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset
Watch the sunset (Let's go to sleep)
We're here, all night, school is in session
Look, you know, the water's pretty deep, let's go to sleep

[Intro: Jasper Dolphin]
Oh, shit (Swag!)
Three icy ass niggas from Odd Future (Swag!) doin' some crazy shit (Bitch)
By the way, we do punch bitches, huh

[Verse 1: Jasper Dolphin]
I'm a swagging, bitch (Swag), I'm iced out (Iced out)
Oh, you mad, bitch? (Bitch) 'Cause I'm laying on the couch (Woo)
Smoke a blunt, fuck a bitch in the butt, I'm bossing (Bow, bow)
Don't give a fuck, I never roll Slauson
I'm fly, bitch, I should poke you in your eye, bitch
Got the burner, bitch, bow, bow! (Bow!)
You dead, bitch, I'm hot as fuck
I ain't never cold, but I'm icy, bitch (Woo)

[Chorus: Jasper Dolphin]
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick (Bow, bow, bow!)
My bitch suck dick like (What?) she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick, nigga (Bow, bow!)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Got the bops in the house, socking bitches in they mouth (Bitch)
See my neck? Iced the fuck out (I'm getting money, nigga!)
She at the fucking mall, forty bitches on my nutsack
I pulled up on a mothafuckin' unicorn (I'm getting ponies, nigga!)
Wolf Gang, nigga
Scream that 'til they motherfucking show me death
Golf Wang, nigga
Free Earl, better show some motherfucking respect
All this ice around my neck, all this ice around my dick
Gun to her head, make your bitch massage my shoulders

[Chorus: Jasper Dolphin]
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick (Bow, bow, bow!)
My bitch suck dick like (What?) she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick, nigga (Bow, bow!)

[Verse 3: Travis Taco]
Shut up, bitch (Shut up, bitch!), suck my dick! (Suck my nuts!)
You fucking bop (Bitch!), you better swallow it
I got a chain with a fuckin' platinum plaque on it
Is that a hundred dollar bill? I'll shit on it
I bought a fucking whale, 'cause I'm ballin' (Ballin')
Your bitch work for me, she my dick washer
Swag on my dick (Refridgerator), 30 thousand million (Nigga), nigga

[Chorus: Jasper Dolphin]
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
Goddamn!

[Verse 4: Jasper Dolphin]
You bopping, bitch, (Question mark) you like this dick?
We all know why, 'cause you's a boppin' bitch (Bow, bow, bow)
I got the burner, I pop you in your lip (Bow, bow!)
Zoom-zoom, yeah, I'm going fast, bitch
I'm loud as fuck (I'm loud as fuck), I'm ignorant (Ignorant)
Punch a bitch in her mouth just for talkin' shit
You lurking, bitch? Well, I see that shit
Once again, I gotta punch a bitch in her shit
I'm icy, bitch, don't look at my wrist (At my wrist)
Because if you do (If you do), I might blind you bitch (Bitch!)
Mount Everest ain't fucking with my fucking wrist
Fuck global warming, this the Ice Age, bitch! (Bitch suck dick)

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator and Jasper Dolphin, Tyler, the Creator, Jasper Dolphin]
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Yo, yo, Jasper, Taco, y'all my niggas, man
I love y'all niggas, I'm sorry

[Gunshot]
Ow! What the fuck-?!

[Gunshot]

[Intro: Dr. TC]
Tyler, we, ah, I know it's short notice, but I brought all your friends here
For some reason, I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends here to talk to you
Because they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme, I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the skyline
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind, I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner, yeah, yeah, yeah, you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow!
Thus, another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? Where we at? Where we at? Where we at?
We on top of the world, where we at?
We on top of the world, where we at?

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back (Wolf)
Hurling himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs (Aah!)
All was gray, all was gray, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell I was going through it
Had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Bimmer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several, but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says "Fuck 'em!" on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter, that's where I'm at (Where we at?)
Now, where we at? Where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at? (Wolf Gang)

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah, I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright might make your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah, she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we were in premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? Where we at? Where we–
We on top of the world, on top of the world
Nigga, top of the world

[Verse 4: Mike G]
Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane?
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, 'cause she know
Where we at, nigga? Where we at, nigga?
Uh, we on top of the world, on top of the world

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Where we at, where we at, niggas? Where we at?
Where the fuck we at, man? Y'all niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?

[Verse 5: Tyler, The Creator]
Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth, Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying "Fuck everybody", I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book, and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home, but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do, Clancy and David are taking percentages
That could pay the whole fucking city's mortgage
Hopefully, I make a lot of porridge from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully, I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but they're complaining, making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
"Can we get backstage, man?" — No, faggot, it's sold out!
"Come on, why you holding out? I thought we was boys
Without me, you wouldn't be Tyler, The Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change its spots!"
But I'm a fucking unicorn! — Whatever, man
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full Monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach "Fuck age, live dreams and have fun"
"Here’s some 'Give a Fuck' cake" — Oh, maybe I should have some
"Asshole, have none!"
How can I wake up on the wrong side of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
("Shit, I don't know")
When I'm on that stage, I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me...
In school, I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero, and they fear it
You can hear it when that little fuck is reciting my lyrics, yeah, rebel nigga
Cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building!

[Outro: Tyler The Creator, Hodgy, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]

[Gunshots]
Fuck, take this!
Nigga, what the f— (Hodgy)
Nigga, what the fuck are you doin'? You just gon—
Nig— hold on, hold on, nigga, can— (I'm sorry)
Ay, nigga, all the shit that we been through, can we just fuckin' talk about this? (I'm sorry)
Nigga, you just gon' shoot me in my moth—

[Gunshot]
I'm sorry, fuck... the fuck did I just do? Fuck! Ah, shit!
Tyler... (Fuck, man) Tyler, give me the gun
(Ah fuck) Give me the gun. (The fuck, man? The fuck?)
It's gonna be alright (Ah fuck man, I'm fucked, I'm so fucked! Ah, shit!)
It's fine, Tyler, believe me
I don't know why the f— I don't know what the fuck I was thinking, man, I don't f—
It's gonna be okay (Ohh fuck, dude, M— Ahh)
I gotta hide the fuckin— I can't hide the fuckin' bodies
I'm here to help. I'm your friend
(Now w—) You were supposed to fuckin' help me!
I'm here to help you, Tyler. (The fuck?!)
Calm down, I'm here to help you. (Fuck! Shit!)
I'm your friend (*Crying*)
You're in your good space with me. We'll figure all of this out. You don't have to worry about a thing

[Intro: Dr. TC]
Tyler, you... obviously have some fucking problems
And, this— This is... This is the end of this session. Let's... Anything else you've gotta say?

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator & Dr. TC]
Mom is getting jealous, I see my manager more than I see her
Before I go on tour, and it hurts (Yeah)
I miss the days when this was fun, but now, it turned into work
And getting legal, so I gotta watch the shit that I blurt out
(As you should, that shit's outrageous)
My friends are turning into opposites
Because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist
And all the bitches who forgot about me want to ride my dick
Harder than the white kids who copy shit
Ending it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about
All alone, bawling 'til my muh'fuckin' eyes bleed
See, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets dis-gur-sting
When there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man, fuck (I'm here to talk to you)
I'm putting myself at a distance
For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant
(Who, Travis?)
Niggas saying "Free Earl" without even knowin' him
See, they're missing a new album; I'm missing my only friend

[Interlude 1: Dr. TC & Tyler, The Creator]
You have everyone around you
You have thirty meetings a day
I don't see what it is
I mean, you— you act like you don't have anyone to talk to
I'm here for you. I'm your friend
When I say "Odd," y'all say "Future!"
Odd... Uh-uh, nah, that shit's corny as fuck
Fuck!
You're doin' good, you have a cult following
You're— "Yonkers"...
Tch— To these white kids?
Oh, my gosh

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator & Dr. TC]
Charbroiled nigga on these dark beats
Nauseous with the Nazi, but it's normal what the cops see
Awesome at his concert, but he never had a pop, see
Mommy was a living single queen, with a La-ti'
So while my wallets piling with symbolic-colored paper
I lace her, 'cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age
Twenty, why didn't she get that abortion?
Probably 'cause that motherfucking embryo was morphing
Into a Grammy-winning, schizophrenic fucking orphan
Oops! I mean "bastard," (Yeah) skinny-ass disaster
Mom works hard, still working on her master's
Son lies about taking classes at community college
Just to record some bullshit he calls Bastard (Yeah?)
Start a fucking cult, clash his talents in a brash way
Before he even had a mustache and cash
And all I got was a fucking shitty article in Thrasher

[Interlude 2: Dr. TC & Tyler, The Creator]
All right, just calm down
That ain’t shit, man!
Now, don’t— don’t— don’t make yourself feel guilty
That— That article was great...
No, fuck that, nigga!
You're beating yourself up, and you're living the fucking life right now, kid!
When I was your age, I would have loved to be fucking doing the things that you're doing right now
Fuck that, fuck all this shit!
You— You— You act like I’m not here
You're not!
I'm exactly who you’re supposed to be talking to
You don’t fucking help me with shit!
You don’t help me with shit! Fuck!
Yeah, you get... That— That— Who wouldn’t do that?
Fuck you! Fuck, you!
Who wouldn’t— Who wouldn't shoot their friend?
Old fucking fuck!
That’s fine, it’s not your fault
I killed my fucking friends! Fuck!
(We're gonna need security in here, and, uh…)
Fuck! I didn't fucking sign up for this shit!
(Gonna need something to calm him down)
I'm— I'm not fucking crazy— I'm a fucking table! I'm a fucking table!
(Yes, come quick, he’s losing it)
No, fuck this shit!
Tyler, calm down!

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & Dr. TC]
I'ma grab the Nina (No!) and find a nice arena
'Cause I can’t even choose between Ortega or Sabrina
(Get security in here!)
And I’m not even human, I’m a body-shaped demon
With some semen in my sack, and some problems in the back
(Calm the fuck down!)
And a life that’s fill with crap, and a finger filled with hate
And a gat that’s filled with love, now let opposites attract
I can finally be one (No!), like a marriage in a church
But this marriage has a hearse
And the parents of the one that’s getting married has a curse
And it’s made up inside of him
Too late to reimburse, but wait, it gets worse!
All the guests that’s in the church all decided to disperse (Tyler...)
So there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse (You don't want to do this...)
So they tied the knot; now it’s too late to reverse this arrangement
(Yes, it is!)
And the nurse is amazed at the hurt that he was pained and
(Calm the fuck down!)
But it was obvious in all the photos he was painting
Now, a bunch of whispering immerse...

[Outro: Dr. TC, Tyler, The Creator, Security Guard & Nurse]
Yeah, he's right there, security's right there
Shit! No! Get away from me!
Get him
(And then, the nurse blurts...)
Come here
What the fuck is his problem?
Here, we have two doses to give him, here
(Why didn’t anybody ask him first?)
Get on the ground!
Hold him down
I’ve been asking you this whole time, Tyler
Get the fuck away from me! Get away from me!
Come here, motherfucker!
(Because nobody gave a fuck!)
Get the fuck off of me... *inhale* ugh...
Someone gave a fuck, Tyler, and, uh...
The person that gave a fuck was me
See, you’re not going crazy...
It’s me, I’m your best friend, Tyler
I know everything
I know everything about you
You’ve been helping yourself this whole time
Your friends? They’re just figments of your imagination
Dr. TC... See, Tyler, I’m your conscience
I’m Tron Cat...
I’m Ace...
I’m Wolf Haley...
I’m...
Me

[Intro]
Uh, Jesus, heheh

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Nigga, this is my cup
Drink the cyanide up
Dope as fuck
So I would really shoot a group of guys up
Deep thought I'm often lost in (Fuck it)
Put me next to awesome
Still can't tell the difference
Just like Asians with their eyes shut
Butt fuck a couple Rots
In the Wendy's parking lot
Barking at the sight of light from my bright sparkling
Cock-a-doodle
Eatin' toaster strudel
At a nude beach in Rome
In a black Bape spaghetti strap made of Ramen noodles
My bitch is bad
Mixed with a thicky ass
Get my dicky rocky
This will end up in a sticky blast
Chrissy Brown, mask on my face, now I'm kicking ass
Life's a bitch, fuck college, mommy, I am ditching class
I rather be happy than fucking forty
So fuck that teacher's lecture, I'm having Sydney record me
For the 2Dope– (They didn't like it!) Oh, well
Let's get XXL to write us a fucking story

[Hook: Hodgy]
It's sitting right in my lap, I see it (Hey)
Scribbled across the lines, I read it (Hey)
I'm the fucking poet who knows it
You know it, you bogus
Comprehend the language (Hey)
You scared of war? I'm all anxious
We got the Angus if you want beef (Hey)
Now that's a burger for ya ass, nigga
(Slice the onions)
Now that's a burger for ya ass, nigga
(Put on the cheese)
Oh, now that's a burger for ya ass, nigga
(Where's the barbeque sauce?)
Now have that burger, eat it fast, nigga

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Fucking aw, get you some
Obviously intended pun
Same time it took Jason Dill to get the stitching done
Custom-made, one of one
Sold out Roxy performance
Ski mask color of a pickle just to perform "Sandwitches"
Started back in fucking London
Cracker children wanted something
They could bump and punch a bunch of fucking faces
(Stomp 'em out)
Moshing pits to breaking arms
Zombie Circus, not a carn–
Evil wolves is on the farm
And were all evil harmed
Any sheep creep
Quiet tendered sleep
Make a peep
Fucking body will go missing in a week
Roam around the city with her titties like a fucking Greek
God
Bastard was the shit, explains why it never leaked (Damn)
I am coming of my age with my Memphis Bleek
Shooting from the sky, the only problem is the missing beak
(Once I have my wings and my motherfucking chain!)
Oh, that's the black talking in me
Let me down a couple cups of bleach

[Hook: Hodgy]
It's sitting right in my lap, I see it (Hey)
Scribbled across the lines, I read it (Hey)
I'm the fucking poet who knows it
You know it, you bogus
Comprehend the language
You scared of war? I'm all anxious
We got the Angus if you want beef (Hey)
Now that's a burger for ya ass, nigga
(Slice the onions)
Now that's a burger for ya ass, nigga
(Put on the cheese)
Oh, now that's a burger for ya ass, nigga
(Where's the barbeque sauce?)
Now have that burger, eat it fast, nigga (Swag)

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
Free Earl, that's the fucking shit
And if you disagree, lick a couple pimple-covered clits
From some stripping lesbian dykes that fight niggas
That like to rap about those dykes that fight niggas
Alright, enough with this shit, let's talk business
Acquire more currency, disregard bitches
Go to Shake' house and play Goblins in his kitchen
Then force him and his mom to listen to track six, then
If he doesn't like it, I'll just slice his fucking dick and
Put it in the cabinet where the fucking cookies and chips is
Take a bunch of pictures, and
Post 'em on my Twitter, then
Go to Jimmy Fallon, like "Faggot, when we perfomin'?"
Then a bunch of Golf Wang niggas start stormin'
On the stage
In a rage that will scare Zack Rocha
Better get your tanks before this wolf war's over
History repeats itself, I'm a O.F. soldier

[Verse]
Rollin' in a golden Tacoma, the shit's stolen
If that bitch tell on me, I'ma do a fuckin' drive-by in her colon
With my meat, gotta keep it obsolete
Like Chris Brown when Rihanna got her fuckin' ass beat
Fuck Jeeves, ask me for advice
If I'm not reading a Vice
I'm squatting down, picking cracker bitches' scalp for some lice
Everything that I write is dope, because the pipe, and nope
You can't have a hit unless you give me the light
We be burning Dutty Rocks with a light switch
Bitch nigga, you're about as hard as a dike's clit
I'm going as hard as Bishop Eddie Long's John
After I bought a Sidekick and sent that fag some nice pics
They say I try too goddamn hard
No shit, I want a Grammy you damn retard
You can't be great when you settle for a flea bargain
Unless you're a thrift hipster bitch in a leotard
Painless
Hodgy lost his motherfucking mind because the brain left
Wolf Gang got the ink on me now it's banged out
Box Logo hoodie, still haven't got the stains out
Congress
I guess I'm fuckin' with the best blondes
Um yes, I am now beating off to mom sex
Raquel is wrestling a prom dress
While me and Ray Charles have a fucking staring contest
To all the stepdads in here
Trip-six kids got you motherfucks scared
It could be worse, nigga that's absurd
Nigga, I am at Pharrell's tryna butt fuck nerds
This just in, Tyler the Creator and Justin Bieber
Was just in the room flippin' Selena Gomez
Go 'head, give some, pucker up
I'll fuck her up until the kids come in, umm
After Tron Cat I got the rat shook
And I ain't even have a hook
For the white kids to sing along
I don't wanna sing a song, fuck that
Now cyberbully sissies on my little sister's Macbook
I got you niggas nervous like a Pop
Tryna ask his virgin, hot, vegan daughter where the cock goes
Wake up, wash ass, go and eat some Roscoe's
Head back to the studio to munch up on some tacos
When I was younger I was bitchin' and
Now I'm coming quicker than
The shit that's swimmin' in my sock hole
When them teeny boppers ain't around
So Johnson and Johnson baby lotion
Beat on my Johnson 'til my cock swole
Stop saying you're sick, shit is kinda old
I'm a fucking Herpe in a coma, you're a common cold
Have you heard my brother' verse on Llama?
When that nigga's home
Me, him, and Hodgy gonna take the game and
Get a stainless steel AK and aim it
To the fucking referees head and put his lifeless body in a chokehold
Uh-oh, these niggas is loco
Best thing smokin' minus all of the tobacco
Still hard to be black, well
Malcolm X would be proud, this white bitch getting black-maled
Blue-eyed cracker named Jenny, and skinny
And Obama wanted change, I threw a couple fuckin' pennies at him
Just a chip off the old block
Chipped tooth Ruth got some dick off my swole cock
'Cause I bag bitches, she's a zip off the old lock
And that's just a logo on the center of that old Glock
Oh stop, tryna be me, kids will go cop anything
That I put on, from the gold watch to the boxers that I put on
Probably 'cause I'm going harder than erect cock dick filled with Botox
Oh shit, you're as hard as senior citizens dick
Oh fuck, don't slip, break hips and pop backs
Show some respect to old chaps with my left fist
'Cause I'm the next best spitting wreck that's left here
That's my ex bitch
Her? She's my next bitch
Have you met her mouth? No? Oh, that's my bestest
Bestie, and she gets beastie
And she's my favorite babysitter cause the children never exit
I was taught to act my shoe size, I'm eleven and a half
Cock the umbrella cause when I spit Seven on your ass
It's gonna be mid-stage Coachella
Shake's faggot ass keep hatin'
But I work hard for the shit that I got
So it's still fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Planet Earth
All associates can suck cock

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now
(Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga)
Where are we going, we should be slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
That’s what she said to me, that place I used to call home
Is just a bed to me
We don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I’m in these streets with everybody, I’m trying to get it
And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don’t reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
That’s what it said to me, but the place I call ambition
Now dead to me, gone and forgotten, I’m off track
Like Dale Earnhardt, my liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls
Balling out but I'm 'bout to drop the ball
I’m calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me come to the studio but I wanna tell him, nah

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
That’s what he said to me
But that place we call Heaven's unfair to me, only 144 can go
Seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I don’t know
I know to follow Him rather following people
Or follow vanity cause that means I’m following evil
Guess I’m following evil, I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need but live like I don’t need you

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
So in conclusion
We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what is important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted, the question is
Would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action?
It’s just a part of life and if your vision’s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight

[Outro: Jhene Aiko]
Tryna visualize how to get it right but my vision’s so blurry
Tryna slow it down, stay close to the ground, but we’re always in a hurry now
And if I could make this world spin a little slower, then I would
Then we could grow a little closer, I think we’re getting closer
I think we’re getting closer

[Chorus]
We had a hell of a ride
But you thought we were riding to heaven
Well, I motherfucking lied
So crank that funky shit to eleven

[Interlude]
"Hey Man!"
"Sup, Bro!"
"You hear about Bo, dude?"
"Yo, the kid sucks, man!"
"Yeah, he sucks man
Kid's trying to rap. He was in theater in high school and now he's trying to-"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, yo is that him?
"Huh, what?"
"Yo, is that him?"
"Holy shi..."
"Oh fuck, this motherfucker scares me, I can't do this shit"
"Shut up."
"I can't fucking do this shit."
"Dude, just shut up!"

[Verse 1]
Photosynthetical, I want 'em botanical
And I'm kind of theoretical (What?)
Quantum mechanical (What?)
Alphabetical, a word puritanical
Not a hypothetical, I rule tyrannical
Tyrannical-saurus Rex
Fuck the system, solar plexus
A lone star Texas, yeah
Too smart to be sexist, hey
Slow it down, the shit's too quick
Fuck it, stick with it, the kid is too sick to quit
Haters, suck my dick
Handle the candle, lick the wick
No, stop, you're better than that
C'mon, "mail" definition, there's a letter in that
Spell "male" then repeat the second letter in that
AA, if you got a girl, don't let her in that
I said I got a green light, Jay Gatsby
You know leaking's just for maxi
So leak my tracks, they're tax-free
And that's the way to be if you ask me
Take this music, choose it, use it, fuse it
Abuse it, lose it
If some of you like it, sweet
But if it's just me, then B, let's ride the beat
Fuck it, get a bucket, my stomach is gonna upchuck
Texas Ranger, no Walker, get up, Chuck
Pixar's dicks are slick 'cause they fucked up
What a fucked up stuck-up suck-up

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Say this shit is crap, scoff
Write me off 'cause I'm a white kid tryin' to rap
Because I'm willing to quit, just kiddin'
The kid will keep killin' this shit, oh

[Chorus]
We've had a hell of a ride
But you thought we were riding to heaven
Well, I motherfucking lied
So crank that funky shit to eleven
We've had a hell of a ride
But you thought we were riding to heaven, heaven
I motherfucking lied
So crank that funky shit to eleven

[Verse 2]
Lyrical acrobat, listen
Empirical mathematician
The miracle aftermath, is it part
Due to the fact that rap's elastic addict acts dismissive?
Too smart to be dismissed, hey
Miss Heart meet Mr. Fist
Kids can't cut it, so they try a wrist, shit
You got nothin' on me, I'm a nihilist
Come on, Bo, flow
Blow like the wind go
Flow like the wind blow
Blowin' out the window
Amnesty, amnesia, I remember a window in Indonesia
Pleased to meet ya
I don't believe in Jesus
Jesus, please don't sneeze your Cheez-Its
Please it's just what I believe, it's not
Jesus, it's Cheez-Its, right?
Not like the Jeremiah Wright guy
Rhyme too tight, and it's makin' ya fight
My skin Lite Brite like at night what you write by
Lord of the Rings, but I'm the Tolkien white guy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Too dense, gotta rewind it
Hate my brain, but too sane to mind it
The meaning's there, but as a rule of thumb
Just hum if you're too dumb to find it

[Chorus]
We've had a hell of a ride
But you thought we were riding to heaven
Well, I motherfucking lied
So crank that funky shit to eleven
We've had a hell of a ride
But you thought we were riding to heaven, heaven
I motherfucking lied
Now crank that funky shit to eleven, baby

[Bridge]
We've had a hell of a ride
But I thought we were riding to heaven, heaven
You motherfucking lied
So crank that funky shit to eleven-leven

[Outro]
(We've had a hell of a ride)
If you think I'm jokin', well, then you don't know me
(But I thought we were riding to heaven, heaven)
You don't, you don't, you don't know me at all
(You motherfucking lied)
If you think I'm jokin', well, then you don't know me
(So crank that funky shit to eleven-leven)
You don't, you don't, you don't know me at all

We had a hell of a ride
(We've had a hell of a ride)
(If you think I'm jokin', well, then you don't know me)
But I thought
(But I thought we were riding to heaven, heaven)
(You don't, you don't, you don't know me at all)
Thought we were riding to heaven
(You motherfucking lied)
(If you think I'm jokin', well, then you don't know me)
But you lied
(So crank that funky shit to eleven-leven)
(You don't, you don't, you don't know me at all)

I'm a lie, I'm a lie
(We've had a hell of a ride)
(If you think I'm jokin', well, then you don't know me)
(But I thought we were riding to heaven, heaven)
(You don't, you don't, you don't know me at all)
I'm a lie, I'm a lie
(You motherfucking lied)
(If you think I'm jokin', well, then you don't know me)
(So crank that funky shit to eleven-leven)
(You don't, you don't, you don't know me at all)
I'm a lie, I'm a lie

Oh, if you think I'm jokin', well, then you don't know me
You don't, you don't, you don't know me at all
If you think I'm jokin', well, then you don't know me

[Intro]
*lighter flicking*
Ten steps ahead of these niggas... fool
That's why they fuck with me instead of these niggas
Yeah!
Ahahaha yeah

Hahaha
They match my Damier luggage too
Joints rolled up
That's Louis Vuitton
Uhh
Bad bitches & cold drinks
"Cav?" you know what it is man
Taylor gang
Uh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
No joint roaches in my car
Play the game smart
We gone get this cheese
Don't give police a reason to fuck us off
I done seen the ups
Not a stranger to the downs
But for now we smoke divas in my loft
Champagne with bitches with foreign names
My homie hit me on a text
He ain't want nothin' just to tell me that I got next
And keep it G
I'm in your town frequently
Got the bottle, bring the trees
Watch some movies hit this weed
Yea a nigga livin' care free
Please don't blow my fly pardon the high nigga tendencies
Can't duplicate us but the planes what they pretend to be
Through all the bullshit overcame and still remained a G
Clicquot slow and sour D's smoke
She leave the room, you smell it on her fingers bro
Askin' silly questions, bout where you been
Saying you look different
Had the time of her life not to mention
You ain't been this high in a minute
Took ownership of the air
I'm fly, You niggas just trying to visit
Yea... Yea bitch

[Hook]
Where ever that paper go
I'm gon' get it, so mommy are you wit it?
I gotta know
We in the spotlight
Never been high as you are 'til you get on my flight
Up and away we go
On my plane, mama they know my name
Everywhere that we go
And they rep the gang everywhere that we go
Everywhere that we go
Ohohh

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
While you at home on twitter tryna hack in her page and shit
We smoking and crackin' jokes at how lame you is, uh
Hotel room right up by the water even taught her how to use a joint roller
A Titan but came from underground like a oiler
Here like I never left back like a spoiler
Give my keys to valet, waiter take my order
Y'all been waitin' for real niggas to eat the way they oughta
Kyleon

[Verse 3: Killa Kyleon]
Young Khalifa, cooler than kush reefer
Good drink that'll seat ya
Put you in a sleeper
Louis on my peepers but I see that bread (Clearly tho)
Good music is the consequence we legends (Really Doe)
Minus Kanye, but we got this money in common
We get it day and night
Could've married to it no woman
I'm the shit, no bummin'
Money talk, no hummin'
Put the GPS on it, locate it, I'm comin'
I'm in somethin' paper plated
Get it, decapitate it
Ichabod Crane
Super boats swangs fascinated
With the fast life
Haters to the left I got my cash right
Irish spring green make 'em blow me like a bag pipe
Lit up like a flashlight
VVS's in my necklace lookin like bad dikes
All my bitches bad like
Mike no homo, Amber Rose, Kim Kardash type
5 star chicks, first class like my last flight

[Hook]
Where ever that paper go
I'm gon' get it, so mommy are you wit it?
I gotta know
We in the spotlight
Never been high as you are 'til you get on my flight
Up and away we go
On my plane, mama they know my name
Everywhere that we go
And they rep the gang everywhere that we go
Everywhere that we go
Ohohh

[Verse 1 - Cee-Lo Green]
I've been living for the weekend
But no not any more
Cause here comes that familiar feeling
That Friday's famous for
Yeah I'm looking for some action
And it's out there somewhere
You can feel the electricity
All in the evening air
And it may just be more of the same
But sometimes you wanna go
Where everyone knows your name
So I guess I'll have to wait and see
But I'm just gonna let something
Brand new happen to me

[Hook]
And it's alright
Bright lights and the big city
It belongs to us tonight

[Verse 2 - Cee-Lo Green]
Now Friday is cool
But there's something about Saturday night
You can't say what you won't do
Cause you know that you just might
I'm alive this evening
It was love at first sight
A-this Saturday, and every
Saturday for the rest of my life
And everyone's standing in line
Yeah looking good
And looking for a real good time
So I'll never have to wonder if
I'll have someone to share all of this with

[Hook]
And it's alright
Bright lights and the big city
It belongs to us tonight

[Verse 3 - Wiz Khalifa]
Hear the night life when it's calling
So we drink until we falling
Ain't a Laker but I'm balling
Meet about 3 girls and
I brought these girls to the club
Can I get em all in
Make a movie and let 'em star in it
Get drunk, get her in my car and
Do the same thing in the morning
Hear 'em hatin' but we ignore them
Which one wanna go
Rolling this green, hit one on the low
Champagne, meet broads on the floor
We getting bread so we toast
To the life and the fact that we major
Not to mention we Taylor
Been in the game, player
Who up next like neighbors?

[Verse 1]
I'm a diamond in the rough, everybody knows the score
Bambino on top and them haters claymore
"But the people want more!" And I'ma give it to 'em
I was born a winner, all I had to do was show 'em
My hoodie canary yellow but I'm bright on my own
Most haters out there take naps like combs
I never sleep, I'm always on my grind
I never eat, unless a rapper spit a rhyme
Sick girls jockin', haters keep hatin'
They pissed off cause I'm more Eli than Peyton
Cause I'm the underdog, which means I'm under, dog
I'm not a nigga who moves snow like Santa Claus
I'm just a nigga with watermelons instead of balls
Cause I work from the bottom to the top
I used to be lost like Locke
Haters got a shook core like Pac, get it?

[Chorus]
Said the proof is in the pudding, the secret's in the sauce
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss
Said the proof is in the pudding, the secret's in the sauce
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)

[Verse 2]
He work hard for the money, but it ain't about cash (Oh oh, Oh oh)
Life's a schoolyard, I ain't gettin' picked last (Oh oh)
Better think fast, there's a pop quiz (Oh oh, Oh oh)
On which nigga get popped before his 25th (Oohh)
Y'all niggas need to learn to live, life is awesome
Open up your own store, get a house in Boston
I know it's not easy, it takes some drive
Some niggas get desperate like the Housewives
And they only see fortune, they don't see wealthy
You can lose a fortune, wealthy is healthy
You can't lose wealth, it's everywhere
The world's made of Brewster's, there's millions here
But if you Richard Pryor, they having the cash you get
And hard work and hoping and your faith is set
I know the world's tough, I was just like you
I used to eat Lay's, now my chips is blue

[Chorus]
Said the proof is in the pudding, the secret's in the sauce
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss
Said the proof is in the pudding, the secret's in the sauce
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)
I'm a winner (I'm a winner)

[Outro]
Two step (Two step)
Two step (Two step)
Two step (Two step)
Two step (Two step)
Now bounce it out (Bounce it out)

[Verse 1]
I love that lavender blonde
The way she moves, the way she walks
I touch myself, can't get enough
And in the silence of the night
Through all the tears and all the lies
I touch myself and it's alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Just give in
Don't give up, baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me
Just (Just) know when (Know when)
That glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend, yeah

[Chorus]
Happy in the club, with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) So happy I could die
Be your best friend, yeah, I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever
Eh-eh, eh-eh
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) So happy I could die, and it's alright

Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Aha-aha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Aha-aha

[Verse 2]
I am as vain as I allow
I do my hair, I gloss my eyes
I touch myself all through the night
And when something falls out of place (Place)
I take my time, I put it back
I touch myself 'til I'm on track

[Pre-Chorus]
Just give in
Don't give up, baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me
Just (Just) know when (Know when)
That glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend, yeah

[Chorus]
Happy in the club, with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) So happy I could die
Be your best friend, yeah, I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever
Eh-eh, eh-eh
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) So happy I could die, and it's alright

[Interlude]
So happy I could die, and it's alright
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
So happy I could die, and it's alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Aha-aha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Aha-aha

[Chorus]
Happy in the club, with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) So happy I could die
Be your best friend, yeah, I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever
Eh-eh, eh-eh
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) So happy I could die, and it's alright
Happy in the club, with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) So happy I could die
Be your best friend, yeah, I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever
Eh-eh, eh-eh
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) So happy I could die, and it's alright

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, weed lacer, 97 burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the Mercury Tracer
I’m on some loced shit, some fed up with the bein’ broke shit
I’m not to joke with, bitch I don’t sell crack, I smoke it
Havin' a coke fit, goin' through withdrawals daily
Shoot up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailie
My brain’s dusted, I’m disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets, empty medicine cabinets
Losin' battles to wack rappers cause I’m always too blunted
Walkin’ up in the cypher smokin’, talkin’ about “Who want it?”
Thug and a crook; every drug in the book I’ve done it
My 9’s at your brain, is that you chain? run it
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavor
Aggressive nature got me stickin’ you for your Progressive pager
Spectacular, battle rap manufacturer
Stole your momma’s Acura, wrecked it, and sold it back to her
Boostin’ Nike jackets, escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me, I might be back, trick
So barricade your entrance, put up some extra fences
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses
Chasin’ dips, take ‘em on long vacation trips
Kidnappin’ ‘em and trappin’ ‘em in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips, slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Gut you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama, don’t you cry, your son is too far gone
I’m so high, I don’t even know what label I’m on
I’m messed up, I feel just like an overworked plumber
I’m sick of the crap, what’s Jack Kevorkian’s phone number?

[Hook]
What happens when you get involved?
Niggas start telling lies (start telling lies)
Both wanna be involved
But loves like suicide
Now that your too involved
Infatuated to the high

[Tyga - Verse 1]
Uhh took a deep breath, Inhaled this love in the air
Only just to find pain cause its all that I feel
Motherfuckers say they real, but they really ain't for real
I’ll show you who’s real, when you broke ain't a thrill
Got bills waiting on me, and its drama in my ear
I wanna sit still, but I’m busy tryna live
Forgiving all my sins, crucifixed now I’m fixed
Road to eternal bliss
Now they hate me like Chris, Rock on my arm
Gotta keep a piece of mine, hot cherry balm, lip locking with a dime
I make bitches scream for me like I’m Lil Jon
Last king to flow, sweeter than a bon bon
Quick sand bitches running out of time
Got my shades on, I ain't waiting in the line
Whatever it is I’m on some better shit
All black barreta shit
Leather coat, leather mitts
I don't leave no finger prints, Eddie raw, semi clips
Violence ain't for little kids
But I keep something cause these niggas wanna test me
Niggas on that ice like Gretzky
Montage chillin', life on a jet-ski
Haters left I like Leslie
Nigga ball hard, never been on ESPYS
But now you walk alone, no holding hands
Just wishing somebody could understand
No father figure, taught myself to be a man
Mama said keep God in all your plans
Let the sun shine keep your head high
Its always people after your spot, gotta stay high, gotta stay high
Don't let it stop, then ask yourself why?

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Last king nigga ready for war, jeep threw off the doors
New paint now the car reborn, and I’m flying overseas
Now my dollars is foreign
And the Bentley got wings now the angels is calling
Uhh, the good son, Macaulay Culkin
Getting money til my last show
Word up to Oprah, the whips pull out like a leather sofa
Coolest nigga couldn’t hang with me like Mr.cooper
Super duper, need a pooper scooper
I’m the shit; cleaner than a white loofah
It’s Young Mula hustle like an oompa loompa
Young tutor teach you niggas how to do this
Shame on a hater, we on pop charts, so the bread pop up like pop tarts
Red coupe, hot sauce, bitches getting locked jaw
Big titties top off, ass like Sasquatch
The rap star, highlights, player of the week, gotta get five mics
Clever when I speak, motivation for your life
They under-rating me, Mike verses A.I.,
But I’ma get mine motherfucker, sh-shootem' in the line motherfucker
Like hi motherfucker, head light from trucka, like dear to a hunter
I’m aiming at something!

[Hook]

[Produced by MF DOOM]

[Intro: Dr. Doom]
My servants began to forge what was to become the most dreaded costume on the face of the earth. The last thing to fit was the mask. Will it conform to my twisted features in comfort?

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
He cleans his metal mask with gasoline, they after him
Last seen pulling chicks like a fiend pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who or they fancy crew
That's no mystery, like Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew
Saw her with her drawers down, caught her
The extorter bring slaughter like "Well I oughta"
I suggest you hand over the formula, 'dullah
A villain in your land, in his land a ruler
Hard hitting like puffing a woolah with Lieutenant Uhura
Every day feel like it's an off day with Ferris Bueller
Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet
No matter how you spell it, we still got beats

[Verse 2: Kurious + MF DOOM]
Don't question how we live, question what we give
Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me
Still they judge, but they be butt ass
Twist that wig like a muppet, keep it simple, can't truss it
Light's the fuel, mic is the tool
Drink Jack, kick back, drop jewel, finish what I start
Mastered the art, living hell can't explain it
Inhale confuse it more, cop the .44
Contemplate, meditate, dictate
I direct my direct fate, coming of late
Kurious, can I say, "Shit?"
Do it for CottleRock, do it for K.Nit
(RIP)
K-N-I-T, Sub R-O-C
(Eternally for M-I-C)
Only we save we

[Interlude: MF DOOM]

[Verse 3: MF DOOM]
By candlelight my hand will write these rhymes 'til I'm burnt out
Mostly from experience, shit that I learned about
Topics and views, generally concerned about
With different ways to come up and earn clout
I take a look at my life and pace the trails
From Tablik and savage females with fake nails to face veils
You out your frame for still bagging 'em, too
You know I know, these hoes be asking me if I'm you
Like my twin brother, we did everything together
From hundred raka'at salats to copping butter leathers
Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys?
I had all the different color Cazals and Gazelles
The "SUBROC" three-finger ring with the ruby in the "O", ock
Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block
I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand
Everything is going according to plan man

[Outro: Dr. Doom]
And now I seek revenge on the one who forced me to hide behind this mask. Don't move you fools. Within my gauntlet is concealed a most effective weapon!

[Laugh Track]

[Dr. Doom]
Why are you smiling?

[Sample]
You see

[Commissioner Robbins]
Now!

[Explosion]

[Commissioner Robbins]
That's the end of Doom

[Reed]
I only wish we could be certain of that commissioner

[]
Oh ya? I bet'chu we won't see him again until Doomsday. 

[Laughs]
Get it? Doom-Doomsday!

[]
Ya, we get it. Oh Borther!

[: Laughs]

[Verse 1]
Look what this girl done did to me
She done cut me off from a good, good love
She told me that those days were gone (gone, gone, gone)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm sitting here going half crazy (oh, oh)
'Cause I know she still thinks about me too (oh, oh)
And it ain't no way in hell
That I can be just friends with you (you, you, you)

[Chorus]
And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved it
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you
And now it ain't no way we can be friends, right

[Verse 2]
The way it felt no faking it
Maybe we were moving just a little too fast
But what we've done, we can't take it back (back, back, back)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm sitting here halfway crazy (oh, oh)
'Cause I know she still thinks about me too (oh, oh)
And it ain't no way in hell
That I can be just friends with you (you, you, you)

[Chorus]
And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved it
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you
And now it ain't no way we can be friends

[Interlude]
And all I can say is
La-la-la la la la la
Laahaahaa
La-la-la la la la la la la
La la la la-ooh
La-la-la la la la laah, hey
Ain't no telling what we could have been
Ain't no telling what we could have been, no

[Bridge]
And if I knew it'd ends like this
I never would have kissed you 'cause I fell in love with you
We never would have kicked it
Girl, now everything's different
I've lost my homie, lover and my friend

[Chorus]
That's why I wish we never did it, woo (oh yea)
Ooh yeah and I wish we never loved it (I wish we never loved it)
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you
And now it ain't no way we can be friends (friends)
We can't be friends

[Outro]
La-la-la la la la la
La-la-la la la la la la la
La-la-la la la la laah
Ain't no telling what we could have been

[Verse 1]
I know it's not your fault, but I’m a locked door
And inside, I'm a mess by someone before
And I wish that I, I could find a key
To unlock all the things you want us to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me open up and start again
But there’s a safe around my heart
I don’t know how to let you in
And that’s what keeps us apart

[Chorus]
And that’s why I need time
I said I need you
I need you to understand, you, you, you
I need you to understand, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
Call up the locksmith
Tell him we need him quick
We’ve got a million keys
None of them seem to fit
While you’re on the phone
Call up the clocksmith
'Cause I could use some time
Even the slightest bit

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me open up and start again
And break this safe around my heart
I don’t know how to let you in
And that’s what keeps us apart

[Chorus]
And that’s why I need time
I said I need you
I need you to understand, you, you, you
I need you to understand

[Bridge]
I’m thinking now's the time
Maybe it's time to go
If I gave you my heart, be gentle
I’m tired of laying low, let's give the world a show
And when you know, you know
And when you know, you know, you know
And when you know, you know, you know, you know

[Chorus]
And that’s why I need time
I said I need you
I need you to understand, you, you, you
I need you to understand
I need you to understand
I need you to understand
I need you to understand

[Outro]
I need you
I need you
I need you, you, you

And when you give me a kiss, I give it right, back (Oh)
Licking your lips, do it like that, baby

[Verse 2]
Yeah, let me step up to the plate now
Big kids in the room, no playground
I wanna kiss everythin' from the waist down
Keep ya ass up and your face down
Oh girl, lovin' the way you do it
Freakin' me to the music, keep a hat on like I'm Jewish
Ha, they be like, "Chris you foolish"
Uh-uh, what you take me for, a groupie?
Naw, just wanna get you to my sex room

[Outro]
Shawty, you're the illest, oh
Yeah, oh, woah
Your love, your love
Hahaha, nah

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Man, this girl a dime with a penny added
Lookin' like my future wife, somebody let me at it
Damn baby, it's the business and built for it
Sittin' on swole, man, I had to get some seals for it
I walked up and said, "Let me introduce me"
You lookin' like a star, we need to make a movie
She said it's cool and all but you must not remember that
We made one in September, damn I must've slept on you, girl

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You, talkin' 'bout we met before this
Girl, I must've slept on you
But shawty are you really sure?
I don't how I could of slept on you
It's gotta be that dress on
You killin' em, dead wrong
And I don't wanna sing the same song
But I don't know how I could of slept on you
I slept on you
I don't know how I could of slept on you
I slept on you
Baby girl, I must of slept on

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Ain't no way that I could miss you, girl
Your face is worth my kisses, plus you paint that perfect picture
You the baddess and I never had a chick that has your status
So I'm glad but all them hatin' chicks, they mad
Haha, laughin' in they faces, guess they just gon' have to face it
Coppin' cases of your favourite bottles, prolly gettin' wasted
Layin' naked on the beaches, check the facial on your features
I mean features on your facial, all them divas they must hate ya like they racist
But they racial profilin' on your style because we colors, you be wylin'
Girl, your tan is from the island, as your man, you keep me smilin'
Buy you handfuls of the finest, you the finest
Time is money, use the label but your face is just so timeless

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You, talkin' 'bout we met before this
Girl, I must've slept on you
But shawty are you really sure?
I don't how I could of slept on you
It's gotta be that dress on
You killin' em, dead wrong
And I don't wanna sing the same song
But I don't know how I could of slept on you
I slept on you
I don't know how I could of slept on you
I slept on you

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
I slept on you, girl, I'm so sorry
Come here, work that body, rock that dress for me
Yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, Canada

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You, talkin' 'bout we met before this
Girl, I must've slept on you
But shawty are you really sure?
I don't how I could of slept on you
It's gotta be that dress on
You killin' em, dead wrong
And I don't wanna sing the same song
But I don't know how I could of slept on you

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people
I'm inspired, so get inspired

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
And so he said "Why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
Why you couldn't be a con artist? Why you couldn't?
Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
The moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?
Why you let me use yours 'cause I don't got mines?
Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up
And when niggas holla, "What's up?" you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me?
Why you always thinking of me?
Want my company rather than going club hopping?
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that you'll forever do?
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you" (Sometimes)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us

[Bridge: JaVonté]
Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And so she said "Why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you don't know what you mean to me?
Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
Out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
Why text messages popping up saying, "Hi, Daddy"?
Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don’t ever ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still like my ex?
Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid
You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's ya favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel I'm the last option after ya homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
Even though you get violent and put your hands on me?"
Sometimes

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
We hurt people that love us, love people that
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us

[Bridge: JaVonté]
Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

[Outro: Lamont Carey]
She says she loves me
She says she loves me
So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like, sometimes, when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
And she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning, she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me
She says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
She says she loves me... and I don't know about love

[Intro: DJ Drama]
See you niggas killin' me man
Did you think I don't hear you talkin'?
Like "Why Wayne and Dram' workin'?
Didn't wayne dis Dram'?
Didn't dram' dis wayne?" (Gangsta Grillz, you bastards!)
See ya'll niggas just wait til I turn around then talk about me
Fool-ass niggas
But I'll do this for ya'll
Ya'll ain't learned that? HAHAHAHA

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Weezy F. bitch, I'm tired of y'all hatin'
I know ya head hurtin', you Tylenol-takin' mothafuckers
I'm the man, just ask your old lady
Like a true gentleman, I'm after your lady
I'm a massacre waitin' to happen, fuck all this rappin', boy
I get to cappin', leave you with holes like a napkin, man
He gon need napkin, no a band-aid, no a damn grave
I am Rampage Jackson on a rampage, step in my cage
Picture on my page, printed in the best book
Come up out my left pocket with a left hook
Mama said knock ya out, money made me block ya out
I got the game on lock, and I lock ya out
My jewelery singin' like a opera house
I brought that drop-top Phantom of the Opera out
Yeah, "Get Silly," not stupid man
Never save a ho, she better ask Soulja Boy to Superman
You can bet when I sleep, I'm Poloed down, head to feet
Polo horses on my sheets, I get that from Pimp C
Tall cup of DJ Screw, sippin' on a pint of Big Moe
Sharper than a tack ho, you can keep the tic toe
Yeah, red scarf on my neck
Red diamonds lookin' like red barf on my neck, ugh
And to my Bs, nigga, "Soo-woo"
Cause I be with more Bs than Juju-
Big bro, I'm a big dog
And I don't mean fleas when I say I'm ticked off
Haha, nigga, I don't ever scratch
And if she throw that pussy, big dog fetch
Type of soldier on some sketch that shit
I'ma draw that pistol, make your chest a tablet
You are just a tad bit and I'm a whole lot
Young Money mothafucker, but the money so not

[Interlude: Gudda Gudda]
It's Young Money, nigga!

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
Sick with' it, hard body like Iron Mike
The flow is C4, I drop bombs like dynamite
You niggas is sweet, yeah sweet like Mike'n Ikes
Bob Barker with the Phantom white, cause my price is right
Hit the club nigga, then I leave with' two dykes tonight
Let my niggas cut them up, they gon' get a slice tonight
Nigga peep my wrist game, you can see the ice is right
Blind everybody in this motherfuckin spot tonight
Superman, blowing on a Swisher full of kryptonite
Got the wolves with' me here, I'm howling in this bitch tonight
Niggas say they hard body, but I can't tell
Nigga, you can get yo shit cracked like a crab shell
You want war with' the boys, so be it
We in all red like the fuckin Soviet Army
Rush a bitch, nigga if he talking crazy
Hit him in his left leg, have him walking crazy

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(It starts with one) One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal)
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Rememberin' all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Verse 1]
Every dollar counts
And every morning hurts
We mostly work to live
Until we live to work

[Chorus]
She said
"You know
There's nowhere else to go"
But chang-
-ing roles
It struck me that the two of us could run

[Verse 2]
Worlds away from cars
And all the Stars and Bars
Where a little bit of condensation means so much
And a little bit of change is all your little fingers touch

[Chorus]
I said
"You know
There's nowhere else to go"
But chang-
-ing roles
It struck me that the two of us could run

[Bridge]
'Cause, honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
Is the only honest way to go
And I could take two-ooh-ooh-ooh
But I really couldn't ever know
Honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
And a little bata radio
We could try

[Verse 3]
So lead my feet away
'Cause all they do is stay
And I don't think your eyes
Have ever looked surprised

[Chorus]
She said
"You know
There's nowhere left to go"
But with
Her fund
It struck me that the two of us could run

[Outro]
'Cause, honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
Is the only honest way to go
And I could take two-ooh-ooh-ooh
If I really couldn't ever know
Honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
And a battered radio
We could try, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

We just struttin the streets, like when the Levee broke

And whatever's on the bar, D.R. is gonna push it

You can be my patient (Man I'm tryna fuck) all night

[Verse 2: Slim da Mobster]

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Aftermath, gettin' money
West Coast get ya ass up
You know what this is

[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]
Crusin' down the street, watchin' biatches roll by pimpin'
You, that's all I can think
They say don't drink and drive, so I drive while I drink
Pull out bare hair, albino mink
Fist full of (?), might make you blink
(Flashing!) Like a Arab Shink
New denim, fine linen, from my head to my feet
New women, cool women, that's all I meet
I hit 'em, you hit 'em, then rinse, repeat
(Flashing!) They all love the freak
And some or another, I got burnt last week
I got (?) up in here, I gotta wrap up my meat
See it coulda been worse nigga, HIV
And I ain't got Magic urban Johnson sheets
So niggas wrap it up, at least more than three

[Hook: Bishop Lamont]
(Flashing!) From my head to my toe
Big chains make me glow, even with the lights low
(Flashing!) What, you ain't know?
Everywhere I roll look like a car show
(Flashing!) Make it rain, pull them dollars out
Pimp swayin', picky rain, time to show out
(Flashing!) Got gold in my whole mouth
Top row, cost more than your whole house

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
It's the high life, in them bright lights
With all stars on a hot night
It's nothin' but models on sight
All pausin' to let the paparazzi get the shot right
(Flashing!) If you a boss, bitches raw, what?
It's like a model when she fucked up
When she get drunk, she gon' wanna fuck
Daddy girl, got a runway life
She got a June 5 flight, to drink all night
With some stars at the club, gettin' high as a kite
But when we pay the cost, get as high as you like
And stay (Flashing!) The alcohol got along me
She wanna dance like a pussycat
Panties and her bra like she posing for Baby Phat
(Flashing!) Ya, here it is (Move that shit!)
Here we go, get money (Push, Flashing!)
Westside get ya ass up (Move that shit!)
Eastside get ya ass up (Push, Flashing!)
We pick 'em up, we put 'em down (Flashing!)

[Bridge: Dr. Dre]
(Flashing!) Your boy's back, you know what's up
West coast bossin'
(Flashing!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bishop Lamont]
Nigga, owe me
Now that I got G's, nigga I'm a OG
Now a OG, nigga I'm me, OG
Over gold, overload, over go 'till my nuts fold
I'mma need a neck brace, and a whole lot of comments for these hoes on MySpace
First I need to see some ID
Cause you ain't seein' me on MSNBC
(Flashing!) I'm a pussy predator
But not for young girls, that's that R. Kelly fella
(Flashing!) Here comes the paparazzi
Put 'em where the (?) be 'fore they spot me
(Flashing!) Too late, camera in my face
(Flashing!) Uh oh, there goes another case
Oops bitch, gimme some head
And if you swallow you can keep the kids like K-Fed

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Hot shit, from the city of big lights
Where ever you look out it's a star
With their cellphones out, doin' bid'ness by the bar
They bein' (Flashing!) That shit that have you on the island
With money in the bank and you riding a real Stallion
Now you flying to Venice, for Italian
And you ain't goin' home until you blow a hundred thousand
(Flashing!) Boss dogg baby, on that patron
Long as you're riding with me, the party is on
Look at how they shake it when they know their daddy at home
(Flashing!) So many models, so much love
Ridin' with the boss doggy, so many drugs
In the air, it's gettin' foggy, we at the club
Smokin' in the back, everybody gettin' bust
Stayin' (Flashing!) Ya, here it is
Westside get yo ass up (Move that shit!)
Eastside get yo ass up (Push, Flashing!)

[Bridge 2: Dr. Dre]
We pick 'em up, we put 'em down
We at the bar, another round

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Bishop Lamont]
(Flashing!) Like that shit Kanye wear
But no purses, no scarfs or stars cut up in my hair
(Flashing!) Diamond's sparkle when you stare front glare stop, you go blind looking over here
(Flashing!) Carpal tunnel made us in the chair
(Flashing!) I need a bandage from the damage and heavy wrist wear
(Flashing!) Doctor says stop, but I don't care
Fuck I'mma floss till I'm out of here
(Flashing!) I'mma ball till I'm gone
Then I don't give a fuck, you can kick my bones
I'll be buried like a Pharaoh
Draped in the Deniro
20 inch chrome on the whip, call it Will Ferrel
(Flashing!) Blades of glory, I put "Ice, Ice Baby" on all my jewelry
Robert Van Winkle, watch my watch twinkle
Bitch make a wish, I'm a star, what he ain't know

I can't tell what's a better accessory
My new watch, or the chick that's standin' right next to me
Killin' niggas that rap
But bein' the man is my specialty
I love ishin' on all my exes, especially
Oh-oh-oh-oh, boi I'm dumb high
Dumb high, yeah from the Westside -itch
Slow it down like I got my thumb high

Like I got my gun high
I'm in my old-school

Car lookin' like it's sittin' on thirty floors
Thirty doors
Thirty whores
Few black bitches and Fergie whores
This shit look like Jersey Shore
I'm on fire boi, loose cannon
My car's Bruce Wayne
I feel like I'm Bruce Banner
I'm ripping clothes off
Car's so big
When I whip that shit
Don't stand too close
When I hit them curbs
Muh-fucka might rip them toes off
I said B-I-G, I'm that important
You spent all day with her spooning
I spent all night with her forking, what
Ridin' low, puffing on loud
I came way too far to -uck it up now
Texts from my mom say
Me and your Grandma proud
Came way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd
Teacher told me
Get a job, save up for 401k
I'd rather be young as hell counting 401k
I'ma probably die gettin' some head
I'm just multiplying my money and dividing the legs
B-I

But I'm never dividing the bread
Bitch I better get the debit if I don't get the cred
That I deserve
Uhh

From the Westside

A block up
Big Poppa
Flock off

Where all ya -oes hidin'
20k for the fifth because it's 24-karats
I can't lie, the price probably go up when I wear it
I'm just D-Town reppin' (KEEP GOING!)
And making all them niggas who second-guessed it, regret it
Regret it like half the -oes I smashed in the sheets
At least now I realize how much I love 

[Assy?] Marie
When it's all said and done I'll probably give her my name
She put too many games not to have her a ring, boi
What, keep goin'
Big Sean in the building, keep going. Keep going
Yeahh, yeah, uhh

Old raps, new raps, whatever, we do it
Come Up Show Cosmic Kev, Big Sean baby
Uhh, yeahh, yeahh, uh, uh

Got a million on line one

Mama on line four
Telling me how much not to spend
'Ye on line three
Telling me how we 'bout to win
You on hold trying to get conferenced in
Man, I just gotta have it
Imagine it, make it happen
I dreamed about it then grabbed it
My life is a fuckin' movie
The baddest bitches get casted
I'm in a race with myself
To see who can get it the fastest, huh
Sippin' on sh- older than me
The warmer the weather
The colder the drink

[Big Sean speaking to Cosmic Kev]
Alright man, look, I gave a lot

Y'all gotta go get the album
That's just a couple bars
Big Sean in the building, oh man

[Hook]
Can't help but think about it all the time
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
I told her "recognize Smith and Wessen"
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?

[Verse 1]
Hey, oh no, not another line about how life's a bitch
Well fuck the world and enjoy it
If she is, wonder can she ride the dick?
If so, I take her on a voyage
I like 'em long-legged, mega thick
Work it out, you know, employ it
You wanna know how I know I'm the shit?
Cause I keep clogging up the toilet
Coley Cole, fresh as a 4-week old
Not a scratch on me, hoes ask for me
Niggas ask about me, silly if you doubt me
Close your eyes and see where the game is headed without me
Give you the real, this nigga give you the chills
You looking at the reason the label give you the deal
You remind them of me, let's see, how does it feel
To know I fathered you niggas and left you out of my will?
Ill

[Hook]
Can't help but think about it all the time
You know what's on my mind

Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?

[Verse 2]
Enough of that bullshit cake rap
With your childlike scriptures
I'm busting off, nigga, take that
Don't let the limelight get ya
The hood say "We fucking with you Cole, see?
And we're gonna ride right with ya
Yeah, we know you got college degrees
But we got priors like Richard"
And here we are, raps just like CPR
Nigga turn on your TV, BET, you see a star
Me and my team like E.T, completely we be from Mars.
Damn he got bars, as if he's speaking of CB4
Need a barrage of freaky broads to keep me hard
Like 3 Nicki Minajs, flow completely retarded
So I'm deeply regarded as one of the gods, and yes
Her ass clap and so that's a round of applause, I guess

[Hook]
Can't help but think about it all the time
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind

Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing

Ion displacement won't work in the basement
Especially when I'm not with you
Here in the heartland, a feeling so startling
I don't know what I should do

[Chorus]
Oh, Bryn, you see through the dark
Right past the fireflies that sleep in my heart
You know it's easy to see
Wait for the season to come back to me

[Verse 2]
Nights by the ocean, a westerly motion
That moves California to sea
Eyes like a seagull, no Kansas-born beetle
Could ever come close to that free

[Chorus]
Oh, Bryn, you see through the dark
Right past the fireflies that sleep in my heart
You know it's easy to see
Wait for the season to come back to me

[Eminem]
Slim Shady, asshole

[Royce]
For any nigga with guns
We got guns too
More heated
Ready to outgun you
It's too late I already outgunned you
You was around
You know the outcome too
Let's play, let me show you what Game is
Heartbreak, I'm showing you what pain is
Please, I'm repping the D homeboy
Where your guns, you stepping to me homeboy
Royce 5'9"'s the name, niggas know
And niggas know, dealing with me niggas know
Ayo toots, how you get here, you wanna ride
I got a five in Southside, you wanna drive
Psych, I ain't got no five, you gold digger
You wanna suga-daddy, go get you an old nigga
I got money, I'm just here to bug you girl
You can't get none, but you know I love you girl

[Refrain]
Yo she the one that wanna ride hot whips, huh
Same one that ain't really got shit, huh
She want her hair done, then get her nails done
Go to Fifth Ave, just to shop for Chanel, huh
She the one who ain't really got shit, huh
That little bitch that really ain't got tits, huh
The fucking slut with her chest enhanced
Titty dances to pay for her breasts implants, huh

[Eminem]
Anybody with knives, we got knives too
More sharper and ready to outslice you
About five dudes deep, who out-size you
And wanna see insides coming outside you
Get me drunk and I'll drink anything you can think
What's up Ms. Bitch; (Yo, what's up with the ring
You married?) Shit, I'm still mingling, bitch
I just wanted this ring, this the only finger it fit
Wattup with you, you married (Naw, I'm divorced)
Of course you are, you little fucking trailer park whore
(Trailer, I don't live in no trailer
I live in a mobilization unit, for your information)
Bitch, I got a dick, wanna fuck
Hold still, swallow this birth control pill, slut
Before I pump so much cum in your stomach that when I pull out
A year-and-a-half old, potty-trained baby falls out
And I ain't staying to pay no child support
Are you playing? Be a man? Bitch what you saying
You tryin to pull some bullshit while I got one arm free
You want me to make this half-nelson a full

[Refrain]

[Royce/(Eminem)]
What's up boo, this is for you and your girlfriend
You Bankhead, up in Detroit we Earl Flynn
Assholes get guns and flashed those
Never ever go to Detroit, we blast those
(Hi, my name is)
Royce, I'm the king
Gimme money, gimme jewels, everything
Ayo, you with the long hair, is it yours
I guess so, got a receipt paid for
Got anymore lipstick? I'm sick of red
Get a perm, you nappy head, you chicken head
I know you ghetto, I ain't trying to take the ghetto out
Things about you to tell about, mellow out
I'm the one that be making the clubs say 'what'
Getting love, and making the club say 'what'
Some of you cats hate on the low and got sick
Any songs that's not hits, it's not this

[Refrain]

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude
But you ain't looking at no other dudes
'Cause you love me (I'm sorry baby, so sexy)
So you think about a chance
You find yourself trying to do my dance
Maybe 'cause you love me (Uh, you do it well)

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
So then we tried singing it slow now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (Fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear your ass up (Tear your ass up)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin' (You know I want you, babe)
I'm ready to bury it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya (You should stop frontin', babe)

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
But still you sneak and look at me, and girl, I love it
Then you give your other girl a shove
Tell her you gonna call her, ask how it was
And she's gonna love it (Whoa-oh whoa, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
So then we tried singing it slow now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (Fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear your ass up (Tear your ass up)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin' (You know I want you, babe)
I'm ready to bury it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya (You should stop frontin', babe)

[Bridge: Jay-Z & Pharrell Williams]
Ho!
We got another one, Phar-real!

Whoa-oh, ohhh-ohh
Young, great Hova
Dance, oooohhh
Uh, yeah, let me talk to 'em
Whoa-oh, ohhh-ohh
I'mma keep it real

[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Pharrell Williams]
Every time your name was brought up
I would act all nonchalant in front of an audience
Like you was just another shorty I put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told, you threw me for a loop, this Hov
I'm too old to be frontin' what I'm feelin'
Denzelin', actin' like you ain't appealin' when you are
Stuntin' like you ain't my only girl when you are
(I was just frontin') I'm ready to stop when you are

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin' (You know I want you, babe)
I'm ready to bury it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya (You should stop frontin', babe)

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
C'mon (ho!)
Dance, oooohhh
Whoa-oh, (oh), ohhh-ohh
Dance, oooohhh (aoww!)
Whoa-oh, (oh), ohhh-ohh

[Verse 1: Domo]
Maybe it's all this smoke in me that's loking me got me thinking Ocean deep
Always want it close to me, I'm drifting in this potency
If you niggas cool, then ain't no one in here as cold as me
Domo Genesis, Hodgy Beats and Mike fucking G
Appropriately fucking beats, MP3's all in my sheets
Busting on the bitches wipe me down and put it on repeat
Hot shit like Mexicans sitting on toilet seats
And I'mma keep it G cause that is all I had a choice to be
Fuck lovers, play fight with rubbers
Wolf Gang I hunt her, then feed it to my brothers
Eat big for supper, scrape plates of butter
All to keep that green bouncinh in like Flubber
Sweet shit, we spit, these is, Reeses Pieces, sweet hit, we shit these bricks
We disrespect, fuck a beat, I'mma be sick, Domo G shit, fuck with me

[Hook]
I'm drunk, rolling through the interstate
Peddle to the metal on these bitches while they niggas hate
I'm buzzing, this is how it goes in my life
I've been on these niggas' hoes while you masturbate
I'm tipsy, wild as I want to be
About thirty feet deep daring any nigga to fuck with me
I'm fucked up, drinking of this beer all

[Verse 2]
I swear, last year they ain't know about Domo, bro
Now they all lined up for the Domo show
I dont need much give me beats and an ounce of dro
My main bitch, we just sit and watch the dollars grow
Like a hate plantation, and I just been waiting
For my season and watch them crops start flaking
If I'm awake then more than likely I am baking
Watch the world fall into my hands, I'm patient
I just got a dollar and a dream
I mean a wallet full of green and a pocket full of steam
And I been on the scene with the hardest of the teams
Me and my goals, ain't no stopping in between
I gotta keep it clean, I'm fly by any means
High in the air on a rocket, Yao Ming
Middle finger up, fuck what y'all think
Middle finger up, fuck what y'all think

[Hook]
I'm drunk, rolling through the interstate
Peddle to the metal on these bitches while they niggas hate
I'm buzzing, this is how it goes in my life
I've been on these niggas' hoes while you masturbate
I'm tipsy, wild as I want to be
About thirty feet deep daring any nigga to fuck with me
I'm fucked up, drinking of this beer all

[Verse 3: Mike G]
See we beyond def, so for respect O.F. will never need a pass
Far from the average, that the most will prolly see me as
I'm elevated, these niggas don't want to step up
I spit bullets see thats a real audio tech, huh?
But I ain't aiming, don't let it hit you
And have me looking for a place to put the bodies when I'm through
He bluffing, I might shoot, fuck it, I'm like you
Cause then again gun ain't the weapon I might choose
I'm a regulator, a hater decapitator
Just after sunset its murder on an elavator
So, be scared when you see them wolves mobbing
After all you prima donnas like Hoskins
Tromping, no lust, I give no warnings
Still ill, will, kill, I'm stomping
Hot boxes don't stop my nigga I gotta fight on
Rasta Mike G, I'm a lion, right on

[Outro: Hodgy]
I don't know 'bout what you heard about cash, but
My niggas get money, nigga get money
I don't know 'bout what you heard about ass, but
Domo Genesis got them honies, we got them honies
They up in the jeep smoking hydro
I'm like crazy bitch, she like I know
Yeah, homie we gon' ride slow
Odd Future, I shoot ya, die slow

[Hook]
Thanks, it's been real
I love you but I just can't deal
With the stress this game is giving me...
But before I go
You know
I can't close the show
Without no closure
So before I leave...

[Eminem talking]
Yeah
I just want to take the time out to basically say
Rest In Peace to Deshaun Holton
That's my heart man
Dr. Dre
For giving me the opportunity
Just to even listen to me
To get me to this point
I wanna thank Jimmy Iovine
Interscope, Aftermath
Everybody in the whole Shady staff
Everybody who’s basically supported me from day one
Paul Rosenberg, Tracy McNew
You know I love you guys
I couldn't do it all without you
D12
Ca$his, you're gonna be a beast when you get out there man
Trust me homie, my ears don't lie to me
Who else am I forgetting?
Oh yeah, Obie Trice
Bobby Creekwater, and basically man
The whole city of Detroit
8 Mile Road for making what I am today
Which basically goes back to Proof and D12
I love you guys man
Runyon Ave for holding me down when shit got thick
Oh, it wouldn't be complete, If I didn't
Thank my mom, bitch
Haha
So

[Hook (Fading)]
Thanks it's been real
I love you but I just can't deal
With the stress this game is giving me...
But before I go
You know

Without no closure
So before I leave...

[Intro]
Uh-huh, hey
'Scuse me, son, can I see your identification?
Hey

[Chorus]
I wanna walk into the mall
Tell 'em that I'll take it all (Hey)
Drop in from the rooftop (Hey), what's gon' break my fall? (Hey)
I think I might go on and on forever (I might go on and on)
I think this could go on and on forever (Hey, hey, it go)
I wanna walk into the store (What?)
Buy everything and more (More)
Travel around the world (Yeah)
To places I ain't been before (Mac Miller)
I think I might go on and on forever (ID Labs)
I think this could go on and on forever (Aha, look, hey)

[Verse 1]
I've been ridin' in my car with the music all the way up
See me shinin', I'm a star, take a picture, see you later
I've been dreamin' of some crazy shit
And every time I wake up, gotta head back to reality
But reality is greater than you could ever imagine
You say that you cooler but I'm way better at rappin'
I'm forever the captain
I'll be makin' moves without a joystick
Thumbs up, joint lit, y'all get what the point is
Baby, I'm here, I ain't goin' nowhere
All these haters say I'm fakin' but I really don't care

[Refrain]
Got my teammate right beside me, you know where to find me
'Burgh representative, I need y'all behind me 'cause it's all about the...

[Chorus]
I wanna walk into the mall (Mall)
Tell 'em that I'll take it all (All)

I think I might go on and on forever (On and on)
I think this could go on and on forever (On and on)
I wanna walk into the store (Store)

Travel around the world to places I ain't been before ('Fore)
I think I might go on and on forever (On and on)
I think this could go on and on forever (On and on, hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
One day I'ma get mines too
And I think that's sometime soon
Whatever you got in your crib, I'ma get it times two
If I win or lose, what the fuck I gotta prove?
I've been livin' out my dream, everything I saw came true
Travel on a tour bus for screamin' fans
I got a stellar reputation, girl, be who I am
I'ma be the man, son, connectin' people everywhere like Samsung
Thought I'd shoot around the back, alley-oop, and one
This the championship game, you ready, yo?
You don't sound ready, better scream it just to let 'em know

[Refrain]
Teammate right beside me, you know where to find me
'Burgh representative, I need y'all behind me 'cause it's...

[Chorus]
I wanna walk into the mall (Mall)
Tell 'em that I'll take it all (All, hey)
Drop in from the rooftop, what's gon' break my fall? (Hey, hey, hey, it goes like, hey)
I think I might go on and on forever (And it goes like that)
I think this could go on and on forever (On and on, uh, uh)
I wanna walk into the store (I wanna die with my thumb held high)
Buy everything and more (Said I'ma die with my thumb held high)
Travel around the world to places I ain't been before
(Said I'ma die with my thumb held high)
I think I might go on and on forever
I think this could go on and on forever (Hey, can I see ya ID? Hahahaha, yeah)

[Outro]
This how it goes... gotta make sure everybody knows... when it comes to the flow... fuck y'all, man

[Intro: Puff Daddy & (Mary J. Blige)]
(It's a shame that y'all put me in such a box... Check it!)
Ayo Mary, I want you to talk to em like you supposed to
Come on

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Looking for someone to love me
I’m-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me
Yeh-yeh-yeah

[Verse 1: Mary J Blige]
I’m no angel, there's so much I can take
Calm down, patience, don’t lose your temper, hold on, wait
I’ve got issues just like you, sometimes I get so confused
I’m strong but I can break, I be prayin so hard to get thru the day
Bad thoughts in my mind I can’t shake
Having nightmares in the day can you relate?
Please somebody calmly wake me
I can’t let this cold world take me, I was looking

[Verse 2: Diddy]
My drama, my karma
My love, my life, dear momma
The war’s I’ve fought, scars that I’ve garnered
The hustle, I got that honest from my father
Mix me with violence, blend me with peace
Combine me with hate and I can’t face defeat (nope)
I did it all in a week
Still incomplete as I stand on my feet
It take a lot to still dance to the beat
Skin more cold and callous than concrete
I love swimming but there's just one ski
In a rich man’s chique hotel with bed sheets
Uh ah, you know what I’m looking for

[Hook:]
Looking for someone to love me
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me
Yeh-yeh-yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
It’s my life, my life, word to Mary
Niggas can’t fuck with me, Virgin Mary
Go ahead make my day, dirty Harry
Weezy, fuck the world, pop the cherry
Everybody pushing but I don’t fall back
And everybody looking but blind to the fact
The clock on the wall say it’s time for some action
Now you can take that to the bank and cash in
I’m feeling myself, fuck if they feeling me
Can’t spell them without me, it's them or me
Yesterday was a memory
Looking in the mirror at my enemy
But today I’m...

[Hook:]
Looking for someone to love me
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me
Yeh-yeh-yeah

[Verse 4: Mary J Blige]
My rise, my falls, enemies wanna see me crawl
My ups, my downs, y'all know I’ve been around
But sometimes it bothers me when I hear people say a non truth
Am I sane, am I crazy, pick one there all the same
In this world we’re living in, I’ma make mistakes, I’m only human
I was...

[Hook]
Looking for someone to love me
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me
Yeh-yeh-yeah

[Verse 1]
Last born of the clan, first one to be free
Lived inside a house beneath the hanging tree
Londonderry nights that chilled him to the bone
Words were cried at night in unforgiving tones

[Chorus]
Blood of his men was gone beneath snow
He picked up his knife and his bow
Killer of Jonathan Low

[Verse 2]
Violence from without and anger from within
Crawling through the fields, informing next of kin
They all turned their backs, but they all knew his name
And if he could return, they'd probably do the same

[Chorus]
Blood of his friends was gone beneath snow
For all that I know, he died
Killer of Jonathan Low

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
The blood of his friends was gone beneath snow
For all that I know, he died
Killer of Jonathan Low

[Intro]
Yeah
Kush and Orange Juice
Fuck it
Kid Frankie

[Verse 1]
I live life sucka free
That's why the niggas you be with talk down
Like they don't fuck wit' me
I get money realistically
And the homies show me love
Groupies wanna leave the club wit' me
Ain't nothin' to a G
Let your hair blow in the breeze
Roll some bomb-ass weed
Get high, cruise out at jet speed
Do it like I do it for TV
675, Damier LV's
7-somethin' with tax
And when I'm on the plane
Got the carry-on to match
Nigga that's fly shit
Tryna peek game lil homie, just watch this
Champagne in my cockpit
Talkin' bout you got a man, Mami just stop it
Please
As we proceed
To give you what you need
To roll up our weed

[Hook]
You out here talking it
I'm out here livin it (Out here livin it)
Niggas know that we doin' our thing
Cause we out here gettin' it, out here gettin' it
But I rep the gang gang gang gang gang (Gang gang)
Ain't nothin changed (Nothin changed)
Still rep the gang (Still rep the gang)
Okay

[Verse 2]
Self-made, been through what I been through
So I know what I know
I write bomb rap songs tellin bitches what I'm into
So the hoes wanna roll
First class roll to another coast
Just to smoke kush
I know a nigga who grows
And that's on the real
Mama if you tryna slide gotta bring one for Will
Just another day in the life
'Nother plane, 'nother night
Gettin faded wit another nigga wife
Drinkin hella champagne
Tanqueray wit the Sprite
Then I'm up in the A.M. to catch another flight
Niggas reppin the gang
Simply because everything else lame
The fans want real niggas
Them hoes lookin for change
I seen it all, player in the game
First they bitin our flow
Now they jackin our slang

[Hook]
You out here talking it
I'm out here livin it (Out here livin it)
Niggas know that we doin' our thing
Cause we out here gettin' it, out here gettin' it
But I rep the gang gang gang gang gang (Gang gang)
Ain't nothin changed (Nothin changed)
Still rep the gang (Still rep the gang)
Okay

[Hook: Eminem]
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
My life is like a highlight reel
Some might consider this my twilight but depending how I might feel
I might continue on with my career for 5 light years
Critics can fly kites here?
Welcome to my nightmare
Pressures on, blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step, pacin’
Don’t know if I’ll meet expectations
All I know is the World better get set
Dre’s in effect
Been in it since you had cassette decks taping
I’m sick

[Hook: Eminem]
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
It’s on, blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step which is to accept my expectations
They're soaring too high to meet, my reputations in jep’
Yep, face it, the fans they’ve been upset yet patient, I love ‘em for that

[Hook: Eminem]
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight

Nigga, fuck yo' time, nigga

[Verse 1]
I waited my whole life to be the man of the hour, I really can't lie
I was the man when I started, I'll be the man when I die
Man, these hoes take your money and I take they virginity
I'm high, I split an O in half and now it's a parenthesis
Crazier than crazy, ape shit, retardedly stupid
I put that weed in the air and pass it, yep, that's alley-oopin
Okay now, oh that's yo' girl? Well, I don't give a mass of two shits
Okay, I'm west side, west side 'til I'm died and underneath them tulips
You bordo like Enrique, I'm too paid, I'm three-paid
I'm looking like I'ma sweep stakes but I treat your girl like a cheap skate
'Cause I need a crib, a big estate, I need a boat and that need a lake
I need some salmon that need a plate, that need a chef so I feed my safe
My crew is who I'd be widdity-wid it, Rosé, I sippity-sip it
I'm Quagmire, I fuck hoes, my cashflow, I giggity-get it
Oh, boy, I'm cock-a-mamian, the most zaniest, insaniant
Pulling up in Merced-iance (Ballin'), rolling up like I'm Damian (Marley)
I love girls that's Arabian, Albanian, Caucasian
I ride around gettin' cranium 'cause my dick is hard as titanium
Oh, boy, you had your chance and blew it (You blew it)
Stand aside and watch a real nigga do it, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
I do it, do it

Niggas staring like we the only one in this mothafucka (Do it)
How could you not know we in this mothafucka? (Boy)
I got my haters looking lonely in this mothafucka
Woah (Woah), I'm sipping on whatever I get handed
Throwing house parties so crazy that my crib look like a campus
Play your cards right and I could blow you up, nah, I ain't gambit
Shit, I'm wasted-wasted, this looks like a job for Captain Planet
Nah-nah, good lordy, whoadie, I just took more shots than Kobe
The realest niggas is reppin', the baddest bitches promoting
She put that thong on my groin-groin and then it go boing (Boing)
Got my fronter on her bumper, does it look like she towing?
I hustle hard like I'm finna lose the crib
And party hard like I'm finna do it big
All I ever do is big (So what?)
So all she wanna do is Big
Girl, what your name is? I really can’t remember
And Tone breaking tree down, somebody yell out timber
I'm up, up in them Kush clouds, lighting up like I'm Zeus (Ooh)
Bitch, stand back, watch how a real nigga do it

[Pre-Chorus]
I do it, do it

This world mine, yeah

[Outro]
Boy

[Intro]
Lets go
Well alright, well alright
Look
Uh

[Verse]
Feeling sorry for the runner up
I’m still awake, getting money while the sun is up
And they keep saying how they need me to deliver
Cause they hate it when the rookie star doesn’t put the numbers up
Man, hate is so passé, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day
Nigga and it’s just me and my money
Ya don’t even get to play when ya’ll leading by 20
Yeah I infiltrated the game
I was hesitant at first and fear what it would change
Now I’m high off the success and faded off of the fame
And still managed to keep all of my opinions the same
I am so far gone bitch I'm outta here
Hotter than standing inside rocking outerwear
I want it all man, I never learned how to share
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires
Wow, I swear I'm killing shit I'm killing shit
Shout out to the niggas I just made a couple million with
Yeah from the beginning to the end
Know I’m into making history not into making friends
Muthafuckaaaa…

[Intro]
Yeah
Tu-turn me up a little bit in the headphones
Just a lil bit so I can hear myself
Yeah...Okay
It's Wiz Khalifa man
Mr. Spacely
Teach you niggas how to fly the fuck out you know
I told 'em it's gonna be a big year
It's a lot of shit on my plate
This what you want
Okay or okaaay haha
Yeah
Taylor gang or fuckin kill yourself man
That's how we get down
Uh ya

[Verse 1]
So far so good
Cause I been doing things that you wish y'all could
Hoppin outta planes
The kush numbs problems in my brain
And Rosé bottles for the pain
The lines that I ink make rappers get kinda nervous
People telling me to sink when I'm trying to surface
Groupies all up in my face like they got a purpose
Cause we ain't gotta pour drink bring bottle service
Orange juice and some more flutes
Let a friend sky dive man I need more chutes
I'm live wire you a cord loose
No charge I go so hard
Hookin up a table on a promo tour
Say I live a dream but I'm just on my job
And can't quit cause the first class flights get addictive
Try and get a ticket

[Hook]
Say I'm on my way but I don't know where I'm going
Been gone so many days don't know my way back home
Now I'm starin out this window
And I see my life in aerial so
I might as well write my name on a cloud

[Verse 2]
Ain't comfortable but got my feet up
It's hard to hear you when you thirty thousand feet up
Claims since I got my cheese up
I been walking round chest out like some D cups
OG puff say you got it locked and we found out its the key stuck
Used to fuckin with that cheap stuff
I show you Rose bottles of that Clicquot
Then we drink till we fall
And when you wake up and realize what you did
It'll be me that you call
But I'll be on a plane
And even though we had fun
Shit I don't know your name

[Hook]
Say I'm on my way but I don't know where I'm going
Been gone so many days don't know my way back home
Now I'm starin out this window
And I see my life in aerial so
I might as well write my name on a cloud

[Spoken Intro: The Lonely Island, Secretary, & Michael Bolton]
Guys, Michael Bolton is here
Oh, great, send him in
Hey, guys!
Hey! Hi! Thanks for coming!
Sorry I'm late, I just got caught up watching the Pirates of the Caribbean marathon. Have you seen those things?
Oh, yeah, yeah, those are... those are great
Well, I checked out the track and I loved it. And I wrote you this big, sexy hook I think you're gonna really dig
Oh wow, that's great. You wanna just lay it down?
Boys, lets get to it

[Sung Intro: Andy & Michael Bolton]
Here we go
Uh, Lonely Island, Michael Bolton
Yeah!
The night starts now
Together on the track
The boys are back
The night starts now

[Verse 1: Andy & Michael Bolton]
The night starts now, baby, roll with us
Chickies snapping at the neck when we rolling up (Rolling up)
Club front doors, ain't no holding up (Yeah)
Black card at the bar like I gives a fuck (Come on!)

[Verse 2: Jorma & Michael Bolton]
Ladies shifty eyed when we walk into the set
Fuck the fellas looking jealous, play that back and get wet (Yeah, yeah!)
Three pound at my waist, shank in my sock (Oh)
You either get cut, get stuffed, or get shot

[Chorus: Michael Bolton & Andy]
This is the tale of Captain Jack Sparrow
A pirate so brave on the seven seas (What?)
A mystical quest to the isle of Tortuga
Raven locks sway on the ocean breeze

[Verse 3: Akiva & Michael Bolton]
Yeah, that was kind of weird, but we're back in the club
Buying up the bar so the groupies show us love (Keira Knightley!)
Motherfucking iceman, I'm the top gunner
Heater on blast, I'm the number one stunner (Jack Sparrow!)

[Verse 4: Andy & Michael Bolton]
Watch your girl because I ain't your Mr. Nice Guy
More like the "Meet you, take you home and fuck you twice" guy (Yeah, yeah)
All dressed up with nowhere to run
That's know I make you feel crazy when I— (Now back to the good part!)

[Chorus: Michael Bolton, Andy, Jorma & Akiva]
From the day he was born, he yearned for adventure (no!)
Oh, Captain Jack (Yeah), giving them what-for
He's the pauper of the surf (uh huh), the jester of Tortuga
But in Davy Jones' locker, what lies in store? (Yeah, we've seen the movie)

[Bridge: Andy, Jorma, & Michael Bolton]
Put your hands in the air and say "Hell yeah," come on
Captain Jack! What? Johnny Depp! No
From the front to the back, say "We count stacks," come on
Davy Jones! Nope! Giant squid! Wrong

[Interlude: Akiva, Michael Bolton, & Andy]
Michael Bolton, we're really gonna need you to focus up
Roger that, let me try with another film (Wait)

[Chorus: Michael Bolton, Andy, Akiva, & Jorma]
Life is a box of chocolates and my name is Forrest Gump (not better)
Though I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, I give Jenny all my love (come on!)
Okay, then I'm a legal aide, Erin Brockovich is my name (oh, God)
Then you can call me Scarface, snortin' mountains of cocaine
(close enough)

[Interlude: Michael Bolton]
You cockroaches wanna play rough?
Okay, I'm reloaded! Ha ha!

[Chorus: Michael Bolton & Akiva]
This is the tale of Tony Montana (this is the tale!)
Cubano flame with Miamian guns (take it home!)
Got a basehead wife (yeah), her womb is polluted (woo!)
This whole town's a pussy just waiting to get fucked (to get fucked!) (whoa!)

[Outro: Andy & Michael Bolton]
Okay, it turns out Michael Bolton is a major cinephile
You complete me!
Yeah, yeah okay

[Verse 1]
Tall skinny flaco, that's for my nigga Paco

Hot like Fahrenheit, I'm tight just like virgin twat
Fucking awesome that I am but a lot of swag that I'm not
Ace the Creator, chronic masturbator

[Verse 2]
I'm sipping on some, pissing on some, kissing on some bitch

[Verse 3]
Macaroni, I'm horny, these bitches on me like herpes
These bitches coughing I'll eat they coochie, I'm burping like Burpie
These niggas looking at me like I'm Ernie, but I'm more Berthy
Shit that I'm rocking it ticking and tocking
No watch and no chain, I do not make it rain, I bring the drought
Cause it's money I'm without, the shoes is fucking beat up
The dirties fucking heat up, them nolly treasures see us
The "fuck you buster" skate video coming, two-thousand and nine
We fine, we flying high, in the sky
Naw we flying in Ocean, the potion, I got the motion like
Piano keys got these bitches on they knees
Begging please like uno, dos, tres, three
Mexican bitches they love the cock like they love the cheese

Half of it discount, half of it at bargain
Niggas is looking at us wishing they charge, like a charge car

All y'all niggas front when in ya heels
While all y'all acting harder than dicks when they see a...bitch

[Verse 1]
Chest to chest (Chest to chest)
Nose to nose (Nose to nose)
Palm to palm
We were always just that close (Just that close)
Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

[Pre-Chorus]
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

[Verse 2]
Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets

[Pre-Chorus]
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

[Bridge]
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
Been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

[Guitar Solo]
My California king

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
Turn me up on the beat, yuhhh!

[Intro]
This Big Meech from the richest black muthafucking gang in the world
My nigga always say, there's only two things a nigga can do for you
You either got time or money, can't have em both
Nigga with money, ain't got no time
Nigga with time, ain't got no money
We don't have a lot of time around here - cause time is money

[Verse 1 - Akon]
Give me one minute, cause you tripping
Too much time on your hands, you slipping
Why you focused on all this dealing?
When niggas coming in through the back door stealing?
Crib on the hill: now that's good living
Harder to reach when you make your first million
So much money gotta stack to the ceiling
And I'mma keep doing this forever, God-willing
Real niggas like me don't catch feelings
Only broke niggas be out there grilling
Say you getting money but you ain't even tipping
A big-booty girl in front of you dipping
Fronting like you really doing all that shipping
Mayne you gotta be, gotta be kidding
Don't even try cause my weapon is hidden
My nigga is ready to do some killing

[Hook - Akon]
I'mma tell you just one time: give me what's mine
Cause I don't have time to waste
I'll be on my grind, money on my mind
And I don't stop getting paid
Living this life of mine
I don't know if you really got what it takes
Hustling's in my blood: just won't go away
Time, money, time, money

Nigga with money, don't have no time
Nigga with time, don't have no money

[Verse 2 - Akon]
Kon Live in one year, made millions
Everybody got money: nigga, we chillin
Ain't got no time: it's some bad feelings
Especially when you want a little sexual healing
Girlfriend's pulling, family's pulling
In every direction, everybody need money
My lifestyle redefine how y'all living
If you keep it up I'll be broke in a minute
My kinfolk's on the block and they dealing
All my goons are still out there killing
Man I be running, got no time to be skipping
I'm trying to hit a home run in the 9th inning
My bitch locked up, for a killing
Taking care of mine, San Quen chilling
That's my homie, you can trust that nigga
Just a matter of time before I get back with him

[Hook - Akon]

[Verse 3 - Rock City]
I don't know about you but I'mma ride for mine
Everyday I'm out here trying to grind
If I ain't got a 9 to 5 I'mma still get it
Even if I gotta live a life of crime
Clock's ticking but it's not a bomb
Every minute passed is a dollar sign
But there's money, no matter how much money you make
None of that shit will really buy you time
I am on the block still hustling crack
If Babylon shoot, we busting back
War on the streets, don't trust the police
In other words: we really don't fuck with cops
Came my way from the bottom of the block
Where the good die young and the crime won't stop
Someway, still make it to the top
Time is money, so now it's back to this Glock

[Hook - Akon]

[Verse one]
Well i’m a wiz with my verbiage and speech
The only thing that I give is the words on this beats
And it’s easy to see that I encourage the streets
So uh, a leader is what I must certainly be
Eastside
I’m in the game permanently
They say they calm but they really lookin’ worried at me
Man i’ma be up in this bitch till they bury the b
The o the b and all the periods in between
Man I do this shit here for the city i’m from
And i’m ’bout to change what y’all consider the slums
Plus by thus far i’m as real as they come
So if you wanna stop me best pick up a gun
Bust something

[Hook]
Well all that i’ve have got to give
Is these words I say
And when the timin’ is right
I promise you, you’ll understand one day
How how how how how how how how how
Ohhh one day
How how how how how how how how how
One me, one day
So all that I have got to give
Is these words I say
And when the timin’ is right
I promise you, you’ll understand one day
How how how how how how how how how
Ohhh one day
How how how how how how how how how
One day

[Verse two]
Haha, pleeeeease don’t hate
You know i’m nice
Comin’ through your screen like i’m poltergeist
The flow is somethin’ like snow in october right?
So when I hold the mic bitch, i’m dolomite
Huh, but y’all doin’ nothin’
Me? i’m up in the sky, i’m abductin’
Y’all earthlings with my super duper button
I got a space ray, fuck what y’all bustin’
But man, i’m really just advanced
I’m not a human, I got antennas that are hands
And I got government transmitters in my head
So i’m paranoid I got bullets in my bed
Right next to the fullies, so i’m fully gettin’ dressed
In the mornin’ with girlfriend, busy cookin’ breakfast

[Hook]
Well all that i’ve have got to give
Is these words I say
And when the timin’ is right
I promise you, you’ll understand one day
How how how how how how how how how
Ohhh one day
How how how how how how how how how
One me, one day
So all that I have got to give
Is these words I say
And when the timin’ is right
I promise you, you’ll understand one day
How how how how how how how how how
Ohhh one day
How how how how how how how how how

And we can both watch and fall like it’s bungee jumping
Man I’m so high, next time we won't smoke all of that ounce you buy
Oooh, I almost forgot to blow them candles out
Cause I don’t really want to fall asleep and light this house on fire
Goodnight, I’m still up, I told my girl to lay down
I see the bottle is full, I’m bout to drink it way down
What up Bun my nigga
Man you know we stay down
And I’m an honoray resident in UGK town

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
Money by the Ton

Millionnaire from nothing
Mind on hustlin
Pussy’s a commodity but dick sell better
Em dickies and high shoes to a cashmere sweater
Paint that got wetter than it was in 94
The drink that got thicker and the dirt weed rolled
96 Impala with the stick on the floor
Now its Bentely Four Doors with Patron on the Doors
Light wood nigga Polo fuck Hilfiger
Jammin Slim Thug, Belly fully of drugs
Young hard nigga, underdog nigga
Yellow Lights on the Masa (maserati)
Yellow diamonds on my finger
Playing in the car

Not cause they empty, I’m just greedy for some more
I need some more dough I’ma PIMP for sure

[Hook: Drake]
What up, what up
H Town in this bitch

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Well its the Trill OG
I got the neighbourhood soul
Kush is dead Im getting blowed
Riding bangin getting throwed in the candy painted low
Chrome grill in front of it
Belts on the back of it, my homie shoes running it
And shorty on the side of me is straight up off the king cover
Don’t care what anybody say long as the King love her
Wish I could tell her that I dont but it would kill her
I just keep on gripping grains dripping stains
Being trilla ain't another brother realer
Blowing thousand dollar killer
With the Filipino flow that I just got it from Manila
Bout to snow up in my city
So let me put on my chincilla
In the ‘rari doing donuts like my name was J Dilla
All about the skrilla so just point me to the dealer
Keep the work up in the attic and the money in the cellar
Your girl up in the second automatics for the fella’s
You see us in the back than all you gotta do is tell us

[Hook: Drake]
What up, what up
H Town in this bitch
What up, what up
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city
What up, what up

I know she do what she want
What's gon happen when she leave?
Huh uhhh
Here’s a few words of advice: better act right
I promise, I promise

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Long ass money, short ass temper
Big fucking gun, soft ass trigger
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for "fuck them hoes"
Got your girl walking ’round my crib in her underclothes
White man money, tight pants thuggin’
Pussy think it’s sweeter than a Sprite can, crush em’
I ain't got nothing but some weed and bitches
You niggas ain't eatin’, clean ass dishes
Gangsta Grillz bitch, I am still the dentist
Hit this motherf-cker, like Willy McGuiness
I coach the winners they throw Gatorade on me
Silent four five, potato head on it
Ask me how I’m doing, I’m day-to-day homie
These bitches on my back, I fade away on ‘em
Young Tune, no Bugs Bunny bitch
And as long as I got a voice, I’m talking Young Money shit, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Mack Maine]
Young Money bitch
Young Money sick
Now shut the fuck up and suck a Young Money dick
Velcro on my Asics sticking to the basic
Black white, and black pinky ring
I’m looking like a racist?
I’m higher than a satellite
You just a hermaphrodite
I’ve been real since BC, guess this is the after life
Drop out from heavens like, just to raise plenty hell
Boy I’m tryna touch a billion bucks before 2012
So that mean I’m focused
Beat my demeanour
These bitches talking dirty to me
Take ‘em to the cleaners
They say men are from Mars
Say women from Venus
But I’m in my space shuttle
Bout to serve em like subpoenas
The niggas keep me laughing like hyena’s
They only show they guns, Gilbert Arenas
Wassup Serena, you could be my baby momma
I’m with Barack O-Drama
This Young Money’s Obama

[Verse 1]
There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
But I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it right when it's so wrong
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

[Chorus]
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

[Verse 2]
Another shot, before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life, tonight
(Alright! Alright!)
Put on your shades, 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
It isn't hell if everybody knows my name, tonight
(Alright! Alright!)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

[Chorus]
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you

[Saxophone Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you

[Chorus]
Today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna kick my feet up, then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me I can't, nah
I'll be lounging on the couch, just chillin' in my Snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle, I'm the freaking man

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, yes, I said it
I said it, I said it, 'cause I can

[Chorus]
Today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, ooh)
Nothing at all (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, ooh)

[Verse 2]
Tomorrow, I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out, "This is great!" (Oh my God, this is great)
Yeah, I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry, pops, you'll just have to wait

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, yes I said it
I said it, I said it, 'cause I can

[Chorus]
Today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything

[Bridge]
No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, ooh)
Nothing at all (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, ooh)
Nothing at all

[Verse 1]
The songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Finally give a nigga leg room and a whip
Yeah Cole World, make way for the chosen one
Ain't nobody else I’d rather be, not even Oprah’s son
Momma’s youngest gettin' paper like the oldest one
We livin' better, guess God felt he owed us one
Closets barely had no clothes in them
So you throw my niggas in hoopty
But we still bag hoes and them
These niggas give they heart and soul to them
I wonder if they know we dovin' them
Ass fat so when pinch ‘em like a Doberman
Run up on em politicing like Keith Olbermann
What’s your name
Where ya from
Ya got a dream
I’ll sell ya one
Come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top
Won’t stop, won’t stop
Hey and don’t stop
Now if it don’t jam the hoes won't rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends won't cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got

[Refrain]
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
And don’t stop
Now if it don’t jam the hoes won't rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends won't cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it

[Verse 2]
There’s so much pain on my brain I gotta jot it out
But as of late nigga, it ain't been shit to pout about
I turn up the news, my blues seem petty
Cause my view of the city is incredible with no album out
I’m blessed nigga, I’m blessed
When I’m all alone these words just flow out of my chest
Turn ‘em into poems, they worship, I’m the best
And though I’m takin' long
They fuck with me none the less
Yeah, enough sleepin'
I put you niggas to rest
The only one sayin' shit is like a nigga got tourettes
Unimpressed with you niggas
You the shit only cause I digested you niggas
But I digress, boy you bout as G as a fucking tie dye vest
And your wifey is a bird even in her Prada dress
Want a nigga like me to come and get her out her nest
Like come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top
Won’t stop, won’t stop
Hey, dont stop
Now if it don’t jam then them hoes won't rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends won't cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it

[Chorus]
Ayo, paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread
The cream is better, cake niggas fiend
To get a piece of this American dream
It seems it’s sunken to where this money is all they in love with
Like paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread
The C.R.E.A.M. is better, cake niggas fiend
To get a piece of this American dream
It seems it’s sunken to where this money is all they in love with

[J. Cole - Verse 1]
Yo, Tasha, a fox but, been round the block cause niggas jock her
The wannabe model she dating mobsters
Been involved with street kids to kingpins
Got a thing for the bad boys
Thats how she meets him, see him is cat named "Black"
Real name Jack James, stacks change
Real big in the crack game
She’s seen that Range and she’s seen that chain
The bling made the dame wanna give up her last name
She was wit, but he was pimp like, just like Ike was
Treated her like it was the Fight Club
Hit her with rights, blood drippin’ on white rug
By the end of the night, they would kiss and she was iced up
Long as he kept her iced up, she piped down
Hit her off with a little pipe to mic bounce
Down south where a nigga wouldn’t return for days or weeks
She was too afraid to cheat
So you ain't even gotta ask
As long as she got a Prada bag
Or an Armani exchange skirt showing a lot of ass
She’s good, living the life, she’s ballin’
Too bad she picked the wrong nigga to get involved with
See the nigga black had problems and enemies
And snake niggas is friends only pretend to be
And cats is out for his head, he caught in some shit
Just watch how Tasha gets tossed in the mix

[Chorus]
Ayo, paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread
The cream is better, cake niggas fiend
To get a piece of this American dream
It seems it’s sunken to where this money is all they in love with
Like paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread
The C.R.E.A.M. is better, cake niggas fiend
To get a piece of this American dream
It seems it’s sunken to where this money is all they in love with

[J. Cole - Verse 2]
Now Black owed money and when it comes to this money, trust me
You can’t tip toe with nobody cause
Niggas will do insane things to get they cream
Won’t even speak, let the bullets explain things
Thats how it is, paybacks a bitch, right?
Especially if you didn’t pay back niggas is sick like
Run up in your crib like “bitch where’s the bread at?”
“You got a week to get it, dont got it, you’ll regret it”
Funny I said it cause Jack’s in the same exact predicament
Got a foot in the grave and still digging it
Owe some niggas money with no intentions of giving it
Them niggas is sending warnings, he isn’t listening
Tomorrow morning they buss in his front door
And a swarm of muthafuckers with guns drawn coming at
On the hunt for Black, Tasha gets smacked
But Jack’s gone a whole week before he gets back but
Niggas is through waiting, they been too patient already
They ain't recieved a fucking penny
So they called a nigga up
Told him if he doesnt get the dough
And give it up n the next 6 hours, his bitch is fucked
But, hold up!
The nigga Black answers with “So What!”
“I gives a fuck, shoot the ho up, still won’t show up”
Hung the phone up, toss it back and she knew
Sorry baby girl, this is what cheddar can do!
(2 silenced gun shots)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Big house, four whips, hella tattoos
Smoke good and your bitch think I’m bad news
Bout to go nuts nigga, cashews
Promoter asked me if I’m booked
I say I’m past due
Maserati look mean and it’s fast too
Cinderella bout to get that bitch some glass shoes
Niggas acting mushy like cat food
Niggas acting pussy like cats do
Get a little money nigga, that's cool
But put your niggas on, then you really that dude
Smoking two Ls, living large
See my watch and wanna know how much it really cost
AP that’s an Audemars
Agents calling, bitch I’m balling like I’m Stoudemire
Store running out of papers cause I bought em all
Niggas claiming that they Taylors but they not at all
Not far from the tree thats where the apple fall
Say the wrong words, guys knock your apple off
No sweetener straight apple sauce
Doing movie roles, rapper slash actor dog
I’m not a star, somebody lied
I’m rolling weed up in my car
And getting high
If I die today, remember me like Jimi Hendrix
Butt-ass naked covered in all bad bitches

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Chevy
I’m praying for you niggas
I put that on my Rosary
Flash like diamonds, tell me what you tryna see
Us high beams, this just a pinky though
Washing machine work, I keep a couple loads
Foreign bitch, she don’t even talk
She just drop the money off and got a sexy walk
365, no days off
Shit I’m the reason they say hard work pays off
Twenty-eight to fifty-six is what I learn first
Parks Bonifay, you see just how that work surf
Oh I’m some big shit, Notorious
Get you some gunplay basterd inglourious
I got the top chopped off riding Ichobad
Head riding shotgun, oh that's your broad
Bright lights, dead Charley
Ignorant white, Bill O'Reilly

[Verse 3: Neako]
I’m kinda high
They looking for me, I was probably in the sky
I’m always fried when I hop in that double S
I can be there in a minute
Pepsi blue, I’m the ice cube riding in it
Lightly tinted, I be ghost
Blowing smoke, calling them bitches up
Dick em down when I pick em up
Never keep em close
Hit em and then I switch em up
Audemars bruh, Wizzles riding in Pick up trucks
Riding puff bus, tough luck you dumb fucks
Never came up, while we riding on planes bruh
Yeah we counting hundreds
A lot of hundreds, these niggas know that we run it
We never blunted
Smoking them raws cause we raw
Never flaw, fly as you ever saw
Real life we riding real cars
Hustle hard for muscle cars
Fuck the best broads
Blowing O’s at all cost
Natural born stars, what they saying, yeah

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
Taylor Gang Or Die
Wizzle

[Intro]
Yeah bitch
That's what I like to call
My type of shit

[Verse 1]
Yeah, forward progression
Niggas got it backwards
I'm relevant
But nothing like you other rappers
You see, I fuck with trap niggas
Because really I'm the only one rapping
Get it how you live
Survival of the fittest, you should know the code
All I got is what I give until they overload
Nigga, I'm the shit, overflowed
And I grab a blunt, split it like a chromosome
I'll have it where you're bitch ain't phoning home
We done blown a whole O gettin' our stoner on
Ain't gotta say shit, I know you're gone
See my chain, make the same face from "Home Alone"
All this good weed that I'm puffing got me feeling
Like there ain't a place I can't go
Ain't a thing I won't do
And I'm awake
So I guess my dreams come true

[Hook]
And the game gave me a feeling
That no one can take away from me
I said no one can take away from me
On the road doing shows, oh no one can take away from me
I get a feeling that no one can take away

[Verse 2]
Down to take a trip
My nigga, what's the ticket hitting for?
I got some hoes that wanna roll too
And if you wanna see what it's like to be just the team
And tired of the background, so you make your own scene
I'll hit you up when I roll through
Yeah, California weed
Keep a Pistolvania mind state
Hard to get it honest
So my niggas boost the crime rate
It's obvious I'm ghetto
Still they love me like I'm Kid Rock
Try your luck with what's around my neck
And get your wig chopped
Fucking with I, can get you so much cash
Or nowhere fast
I got your bitch in awe, she never flown first class
Or had the driver get her bags

[Hook]
And the game gave me a feeling
That no one can take away from me
I said no one can take away from me
On the road doing shows, oh no one can take away from me
I get a feeling that no one can take away
Testing 1 2 3, can you hear me
Yeah yeah yeah

Your daddy was a real nigga
The real rolling stone of our time
He’s the reason why you wanna be a killer
Still wondering why he left you behind
Now you a blood or crip so ain’t you
Fuck that nigga, this my clip that’s the motto
Living the life and hoping that you make it bigger
Either you end up in the cage or in the ground

Ohh you’re just like your daddy and your son will be just like you
Ohh you’re living on the edge and you know that you gotta

Burn this bridge down if you’re falling across it
Burn this bridge down like you’re playing in the stars
Put your lighters up ohh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn
Put your lighters up ohh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn that bridge
Your momma used to be a hooker
So many men coming in and out the house
She’s the reason why you’re working as a stripper
On your knees picking dollars of the ground
No way you’ll rustle for that money ain’t attractive
That’s little Kim, Lindsay Lohan, Kardashian
You ain’t gonna get no surgery on your figure
They’ll only bring the wrong daddy for your child

Ohh you’re just like your momma and your daughter will be just like you
Ohh you’re living on the edge and you know that you gotta

Burn this bridge down if you’re falling across it
Burn this bridge down like you’re playing in the stars
Put your lighters up ohh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn
Put your lighters up ohh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn that bridge

Let it burn let it burn
Find another way to the other side
Let it burn let it burn
We’ll make it to the top even if we gotta climb
Let it burn let it burn
Our kids are counting on us to still arrive
Let it burn let it burn
Now raise your lighters up I wanna see it light
Burn this bridge down if you’re falling across it
Burn this bridge down like you’re playing in the stars
Put your lighters up ohh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn
Put your lighters up ohh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn that bridge

[Intro: Chris Richardson]
Walk a thousand miles
Just to see her (see her)

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Sittin’ on a plane
Reminscing back when I made that mistake
I wish it never ended with a heartbreak
Now your heart broken, tears in ya face
Ask myself why, looking at the sky
If I could turn back I’d make it all right
Praying that you better but its still stormy weather
Don’t wanna let go but the rain won't let up
Now you gone, still thinking bout you everyday
And I know feelings was hurt and you can blame me but
I’m sorry for the games that I played
But now it’s too late
And now she’s…

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Verse 2: Tyga]
It’s cold putting up a fight
Arguing back and forth through the night
Regardless what I said I don’t mean most of it
You know I really love you, this the realest goin’ get
It take time to realize what you really wanna know
You was ready for it all but your feelings I ignored
I know my fault, I should’ve gave more
Now you’re miles away and I’m miles on tour
Now it’s drums playing, crowd singing
Life changing, wish you was here to witness all
Now that starts fading
They say two wrongs don’t make it right
And I was wrong and now it ain't right

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Bridge: Tyga + Chris Richardson]
Na na na nah
If I could turn back
If I could make it right
I’d do just that
If I could make it right
I’d do it all tonight
Hold you in my arms, with you I’d spend my life
Na na na nah
If I could turn back
If I could make it right
I’d do just that
I’d do just that
If I could turn back
(Come back here again)

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Bridge: Tyga (Chris Richardson)]
Na na na nah
(Far, far away)
If I could turn back
If I could make it right
I’d do just that
If I could make it right
I’d do it all tonight
Hold you in my arms, with you I’d spend my life
Na na na nah
(Far, far away)
If I could turn back
If I could make it right
I’d do just that
I’d do just that
(Far away, far away)
If I could turn back

[Intro: DJ Khaled & Drake]
I get 'em up! (I'm on one)
I get 'em up! (Fuck it, I'm on one)
I get 'em up! (I said, "I’m on one")
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ugh, I'm getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was eighteen
Apologize if I say anything I don’t mean
Like, "What's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me"
And, "What's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?"
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah, and I be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Tripping off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tan and my hair long and my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work, but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit, hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking—watch me take it

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody should've told you

[Chorus: Drake]
I’m on one, yeah
Fuck it, I'm on one, yeah
I said, "I'm on one"
Fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple or could be pink
'Pending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one
I said, "Fuck it, I'm on one"

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Huh! I'm burning purple flowers, it’s burning my chest (Huh)
I bury the most cash and burning the rest (Stuntin')
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air (Yeah)
The ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear (Check it)
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on your neck and tell you, "Everything is great" (Right)
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing eight
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully (Haha)
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams (Woo!)
In a room full of money out in London as she screams? (Woo!)
Huh! Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So, yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double MG until I get the chair, chyeah

[Pre-Chorus: Drake & Rick Ross]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from (Huh)
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody should've told you

[Chorus: Drake]
I’m on one, yeah
Fuck it, I’m on one, yeah
I said "I’m on one"
Fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple or could be pink
'Pending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one
I said, "Fuck it, I’m on one"

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money ain't enough money
You know the feds listening—nigga, what money?
I’m a made nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused, might as well say "cheese" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sellout, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration, bitches: Mazel tov
It’s a slim chance I fall: Olive Oyl
"Tunechi" be the name, don’t ask me how I got it
I’m killing these hoes, I swear I’m tryna stop the violence

[Pre-Chorus: Drake & Lil Wayne]
All I care about is money (Yeah) and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody should've told you

[Chorus: Drake & Lil Wayne]
I’m on one, yeah (Young Mula, baby)
Fuck it, I’m on one (YMCMB)
Yeah, I said, "I’m on one" (Uh-huh)
Fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple or could be pink
'Pending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one (Haha)
I said, "Fuck it, I’m on one"

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
I get 'em up
I get 'em up
I get 'em up
DJ Khaled

[Intro]
Hey, turn the beat up a little more (Ya)
Yeah, haha (Uh)
That's good
And it's the best day ever
Uh
What's good, Chuck?
Hey (Somethin' for the ladies)

[Chorus 1]
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat (Off my hat)
But now she think she got it like that (Like that)
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat (Off my hat)
Hmm, I think she think she got it like that (Ha) (Like that)

[Chorus 2]
Baby, you could wear my hat
Just make sure you give it back
Baby, you could wear my hat
If you got somethin' to match

[Verse 1]
Baby, you could wear my hat, just twist it to the back
We drinkin' out the bottle while you sittin' on my lap
Then we could go outside, let me take you on a ride
With the top down, show you off to people, you my prize
Nothin' like a girl who likes to wear a pair of Nikes
Shinin' like my high beams, cooler than some iced tea
Yeah, I got a female who like to send some pictures to my email
Professional with shoppin', you would think she worked in retail
Snapbacks make 'em look so cute
And that girl know how to blow somethin' like she play the flute, ha
That long hair, and it's fallin' down her back
I put on my hat, and she reach and tryna snatch it
Baby, you be hotter than a match stick, bad bitch
Make a snapback look fantastic, but sorry, you can't have this
She smile big, kissin' on my cheek
Baby, you could wear my hat, make sure you give it back to me

[Chorus 2]
Baby, you could wear my hat
Just make sure you give it back
Baby, you could wear my hat
If you got somethin' to match (Haha)
Baby, you could wear my hat (Baby, you could wear my hat)
Just make sure you give it back (Just make sure you give it back)
Baby, you could wear my hat (Baby, you could wear my hat)
If you got somethin' to match (If you got somethin' to match that)

[Verse 2]
She like to play those stupid games with me
She never seem to have enough
She brought some friends for whoever came with me
So, my homies sayin' that's what's up
And I hear her name's pretty, from different continent
Tellin' me she single, but to tell the truth, I'm not convinced
It's all good, I'm used to boyfriends always talkin' shit
Thinkin' that they players, but I'm coachin', call me Popovich
Baby, I ain't doctor rich, but I'll probably show you a good night
When girls come out with me, they make sure that they look right
She used to be so grounded, all the sudden she took flight
And we ain't seen her since, so tell me, what does that look like?
I'm the type to bring you right back down to Earth
And for what it's worth, I'll put that Louis on your purse
She like to wear my hat, make me laugh, so I'm guessin' she a keeper
I think she stole it though, I keep tryin' to reach her

[Chorus 2]
Baby, you could wear my hat (Call me back)
Just make sure you give it back (Hahaha)
Baby, you could wear my hat (Uh)
If you got somethin' to match (It's the best day ever) (Aha)
Baby, you could wear my hat (Baby, you could wear my hat)
Just make sure you give it back (Just make sure you give it back)
Baby, you could wear my hat (Baby, you could wear my hat)
If you got somethin' to match (If you got somethin' to match) (Haha)

[Chorus 1]
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat (Off my hat)
But now she think she got it like that (Like that)
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat (Off my hat)
Damn, I think she think she got it like that

[Outro]
Aha
Yuh, yuh
Baby, if you wanna wear my hat, you can wear my hat, it's not a big deal
Just give that shit back
Blaow

[Chorus]
Girl, I don't wanna share you
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow, I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by
Baby, all I'm gonna want is you
Girl, I don't wanna share you (Share you)
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you (Leave you)
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow, I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by (Haha)
Baby, all I'm gonna want is you

[Verse 1]
Uh, look
They told me never fall in love, it never works out in your favor
You way too young and right now that's just human nature
You think you love her, but you don't
Think you gon' be with her for the rest of your life, you prolly won't
But on my side, shorty just attacked me from the blindside
Used to be a player now I'm sidelined
Connect like Wi-fi, mixed like tie-dye
She feelin' cute wanna wear a little lingerie, voila
It ain't a sexual thing though
We be stayin' up smokin' weed out her window
In love with me now, she never huntin' me down
I'm tryna have it all, she ain't comin' around
It's like a never-endin' chase, longer than a marathon
See the smile on her face, and I can't help but carry on
Uh, I know you love me don't lie (Don't lie)
Uh, but you just gotta be mine, 'cause

[Chorus]
Girl, I don't wanna share you (Share you)
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you (Leave you)
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow, I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by (Hey)
Baby, all I'm gonna want is you

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, haha, look
I know this girl who want the world to call her own
Goin' through these dudes like some minutes on a phone
And once she leave, she ain't comin' back home
Hit the road, forgettin' about everybody she know
Miss Hasn't Called Me In Four Days
But then we hit the bed and she obsessed with foreplay
Hey, she try and be a lil' player, think she cute too
But I'ma yank her out the game like a loose tooth
When the boy blow, I know she worried (Know she worried)
About all these girls who approach me actin' flirty (Actin' flirty)
See that's the thing-thing, I don't give a fuck
I want your heart so baby give it up
In this life, girl, all we can do is try
Forget that dumb stuff, it's just you and I
We can travel 'round the world, movin' through the sky
Or we can stay right here and you'll be mine

[Chorus]
Girl, I don't wanna share you (Share you)
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you (Leave you)
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow, I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by (Hey)
Baby, all I'm gonna want is you

[Intro]
This one goes out to you
Yeah
You know who you are
Look

[Verse]
I guess I'm wrong for thinking that I could trust you
For never holding all of that sh- against you
But now I'm strapped with my .45 special
I'm so special, so special, so special
Nigga, you softer than a homosexual
And I am so extraterrestrial
So you can keep my things, there's nothing you can bring
And you can have my ring, you can add it to your bling
'Cause I'm okay and I'm still a G
Pray for my enemies, my name's still Nicki
In time you'll change, but time don't freeze
You better leave before you get wetter than Pisces

[Intro: Don Cannon & Chuck Inglish]
Couldn't wait for this one
Fat Raps remix
Yeah
Chuck Inglish

[Verse 1: Chuck Inglish]
And it's falling off the side like back fat
Giving girls rides to the crib, not a rat trap
Cheese, peanut butter freeze raps, I want all these snapped
And it's back in the day, like a tall-tee tag
I need that whip clean, G, what's the weather gon' be?
Drop-top, no drips on this upholstery
Supposed to be headed downtown, car wash like Bilal
And my girl drive the Chevy while I break this tree down
Roll the window back up; good, turn it back up
Ugh, UGK: "Diamonds & Woods"
Hold up, yeah, roll up, that's tight, that's right
You do this right, you might have the time of your life

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy & Big Sean]
Yo, coming from the Westside but my fitted say Sox
Where you get banged on if you in it or not
Looking like Caine 'cause I watch Menace (A lot)
And I'm tryna fuck your friend, so is she with it or not? (Ah)
Shout out to ATL 'cause I'm in Lennox a lot (Uh-huh)
And I don't like looking, I go in there to cop
Houston High Rollers, I go in there a lot
Spending money with the strippers, you go in there to watch (Ugh)
Blowing on L's (L), smelling like Chanel (Uh-huh)
You say you the man, but dog, these bitches can't tell (Nah)
But ladies love Dom 'cause I'm gettin that mail (C'mon)
To make it out my hood is like to make it out of jail (Yeah)
Put the tens up and start breaking out the twelves
Bet I have your girlfriend shaking out her heels (Ugh)
We shaking all deals (Ugh) and chasing all meals (Sean Don, nigga, boi, boi, boi)
I'm popping all over, how you haters all feel, huh? (Okay)

[Verse 3: Big Sean & Boldy James]
Smoke good (Smoke good), fuck better (Fuck better)
Count money (Count money), what's better? (What's better?)
These lil' niggas can't hang (Can't hang)
Big shit popping, bitch, and "Big" my first name, I'm a—
Westsider ('Sider), Detroit player ('Troit player)
Fuck around and I might bring back gators (Nigga, what?)
Every day, I leave the crib with no money (With no money)
And come back later with that motherfucking paper
Finally Famous Over Errythang—that's just how I feel, bitch
They tryna stop my shine, they yellin hit the kill switch
Wrong nigga to deal with 'less you doing a deal with (Boi)
Grind hard (Hard), that's how I was built, bitch
Whoa there (Whoa there), whoa there (Whoa there), I'm who everybody know here
I come through in the club and get more money than promoters ('Moter)
Oh, that's your girl? (That's your girl?) I see her at my show there (Show there)
I be off in the hood—I bet you don't ever go there
Ayy, so slow there, boy, don't go there, boy
It's people you dont know there, boy
Young nigga that's addicted to the Polaroids (Flash)
And I gave these niggas more lines than corduroy
And my bitches be gorgeous, boy
Showtime I hope you recording, boy, I'm out here (A lot)

[Verse 4: Boldy James & Asher Roth]
Let's re-up half of a brick and bring it back to the kitchen
See the crack as it's fizzing, then bring it back when it's finished
Jimbo put that on a dish and chisel it, bag it, and sell it
Then Boldy factor the digits to know the cash that I'm flipping
Six gon' get stashed in the ceiling, six O's in traffic
I'm pitching this o; that one get split and get broke to halves
And then, this one his O, and that one is his, and this O, I'm bagging
And this one—this O the last one: Boldy a crack-a-matician (Concrete)
Rolling the ave' 'cause I'm getting dough in that slab
'Cause I'm getting over, they mad
I just grin and ball with my mag on my britches
Know I'll blast if you tempt him, bro, you will crash in your whip
With holes in your plaid 'cause you hit, going as fast as your engine
Go when you smash in the strip, smoking a bag with your bitch
Then, choking, gasping for breath, holding, grabbing your chest
From Boldy magging that tech, unload it faster than Vick's
It's Concrete, the school crafted the sick, bones and bricks (Yeah, yo)

[Verse 5: Asher Roth]
I be frustrated with the way that shit's been aging
And I'm about to take a break and get away on a vacation, like
Maybe Malaysia to escape through meditation
I'll just eat, pray, and wait for my day of revelation, or I'll—
Take peyote, roam the rivers of Nairobi
Change my name to "Navajo" and live alone and only grow weed
'Cause this Naomi-flowing show gets pretty lonely
Don't nobody ever know you, everybody call you homie, ugh
Mo-ney, mo-ney, they'll be sure to treat you phony
As soon as you hit your low, they won't be picking up the phone, see
I move with calm to show these fools that I am home
And when I'm on the microphone, all you wannabes can blow me, so
Take this boner to the dome, you little Bo Peeps
That may be inapprop-y but I'm certain-a-ly no sheep, see
I only lead in this game of entertainment
Roth and Big Sean, we on, Finally Famous

[Verse 6: King Chip]
Yeah, now roll ten of 'em up
Fuck the rules, we Auntie Anne's pretzel-bending 'em up
Don't give a fuck, word to your daddy leather sandals
Either pay the light bill or light up them candles
Regular White Owl cigarillo, no flavors
Break that bitch down and peel off the first layer
Smooth, like a baby's ass, Mercedes pass
The ladies ask, "Can they be next?" 'cause I'm kicking their favorite raps
Life is playing 2K and kicking raps all day by the lake
Smoking tree 'til I collapse in broad-day
I'm surfing, radical, gnarly, far out
My stoner chicks gather 'round soon as I break the jar out
Ayy, baby girl, pass the blizz-ard
Your woman chose me, so I had to jizz her
Don't be sleeping or taking no cat naps
We leaders of the new school with these fat raps, nigga

[Intro]
Fuckin' posers
Yo yo, yeah
Yo yo, yeah

Better call your boys

[Hook]
You can't be me, I'm a rockstar
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far

Yes, you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late to apologize
When you see the mantle or will you see the skies
It's almost over now, almost over now

[Post Hook]
You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think the light won't be ever lit
It's almost over now, almost over now
Something's on your chest
Better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gonna take it no more
Since it's almost over now, almost over now

[Verse 2]
You had plenty of time
There was no rush
But it was your dream to be like us
You're in dreamland so you don't care
And as you wait
I'm standing there

[Hook]
You can't be me, I'm a rockstar
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far

We ain't gonna take it no more
Since it's almost over now, almost over now

[Verse 3]
You don't succeed cause you hesitate
You think we're fly
But we levitate
Just be yourself
Don't ask us why
Cause if you don't we'll make you fly

[Hook]
You can't be me, I'm a rockstar
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
It's almost over now

[Intro: Strike (as Lyckety Splyt)]
Tell you something
Check this out, check this out
Yo

[Verse 1: Strike (as Lyckety Splyt)]
This guy's a choke artist, you'll catch a bad one
You're better off shootin' yourself with Papa Doc's handgun
Climbin' up this mountain, you're weak
I'll leave you lost without a paddle, floatin' shit's creek
You ain't Detroit, I'm the D, you the new kid on the block
'Bout to get smacked back to the boondocks
Fuckin' Nazi, your squad ain't your type
Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I tell you, you better use it
This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music
Trailer trash, I'll choke you to your last breath
And have you lookin' foolish like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that, 'cause
You follow Future like he got carrots up his ass crack
And when you actin' up, that's when you got jacked up
And left stupid, like Tina Turner when she got smacked up
I'll crack your shoulder blade
You'll get dropped so hard that Elvis will start turnin' in his grave
I don't know why they let you out in the dark
You need to take your white ass back across 8 Mile to the trailer park

[Interlude: Eminem (as B-Rabbit)]
Alright, look
Ayo

[Verse 2: Eminem (as B-Rabbit)]
This guy raps like his parents jerked him
He sounds like Erick Sermon, the generic version
This whole crowd looks suspicious
It's all dudes in here, except for these bitches
So I'm a German, eh?
That's okay, you look like a fuckin' worm with braids
These Leaders of the Free World rookies
Lookie, how can six dicks be pussies?
Talkin' 'bout shit's creek
Bitch, you could be up piss creek with paddles this deep
You're still gonna sink, you're a disgrace
Yeah, they call me Rabbit, this is a turtle race
He can't get with me, spittin' this shit wickedly
Lickety shot suspicious spickety split lickety
So I'ma turn around with a great smile
And walk my white ass back across 8 Mile

[Intro]
I wish upon a star
Finally, there you are
Dream love
I don’t mean to bother you but I was wondering (Can I turn her on?)
You make the temperature start to rise
Everytime you step into the room, O.M.G

[Verse]
I must be something like an X pill
Bitches start touching themself and singing
(Everything about you turns me)
Everything about you turns me on (on
Wanna fuck you so bad right now)
It could of been the clothes or could of been the way that I'm a rolling stone
Or could of been the scent of a hundred million
Bitches smell when there’s (money in the air, money in the
Money in the air air air)
7 stars must be my aura
A master levitation, I stay up in the clouds
Penthouse hovering a hundred floors up
I’m on some tantric yoga
The ladies love the way I (shine)
I’m like Merlin when I’m erotic
I make you squirm no hands on your body
(Under my control anytime
Anytime I wanna make you hit the dancefloor
You already know what's my name)
So I ain't gotta spell it no more
I did it to the fullest I ain't gotta sell it no more
Tonight I’m looking for my biggest fans
She in the crowd singing my jam
(Everything about you turns me on)
Everything about you
(Everything about you turns me on)
(I wanna fuck you
I wanna fuck you
I wanna fuck you so bad right now)

[Tyler, The Creator]
Ignorant, Atheist, sound like a fucking monster
Tall, skinny, lanky, buck it, fuck it badass posture
Cops are angering the hell
Where they discounted mounted
With the devil, he was formal and some Polo and some Dockers
Dancing with him playing vengeance Cindi Lauper with some Crips
In all red like they playin' Red Lobster
My bitch is white Italian to be exact
Mobster is her father and he'll kill me
When he finds out I'm reading her Harry Potter
FUCK HIM!, Im a Demon fill your daughter up with semen
With Supreme embroidered logos, making fun of homos cause its funny
Tommy rugby hilfiger screaming nigga with the klux
I'm a fuckin' Nazi with a condom, barely give a fuck
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Fuck Lame, 91'
We hockey fuckin' awesome, hit you with the Wolf Gang puck
Puck, trucks thunder now shes in the trunk wondering why shes about to get raped and chopped up, lumber
He said, write a sixteen, well she was seventeen
And I'm only eighteen and that's statutory rape
And if you fuckin' snitch on me I guess i'll make the great escape
To have a date with your dead body and I cannot be late
Might do a Ted Bundy, I can consider ya'll some haughtys
If they find me at my home, guess I gotta fuckin roam
All alone ,in the streets, gotta hustle drugs for food
Gotta sell beats for clothes if I really wanna eat
Fuck you, O.F.M. Bangin' on your mothafuckin' FM
Fuck Tammy

Chorus)
We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind
You're the one who started it
(Gangsta, ugh!)

1st Verse:
I gotta girl at home
But she don't cook
I have my condoms in the store cause she won't look
And she neva-eva go to the grocery sto
So I figure it's safe to pull a grocery-ho
She was buyin Alize out the liquor aisle
She said, 'i hope its not too ghetto'
Rock-Dawg, Gold Force, Baggy style
I kept her number on file
For my girl be actin wyld
Like last week, I told her take me to the mall
But she don't drive
My otha girl picked me up at 3:05
She got a brand new car, sixteen
Now the car only 1 yrs old, oh
Man, but the body look grown, "whooa!"
Before I catch a case I betta take my ass home
Where the problems is
Arguments be daily like
Carson is
Martin again:
Fuck you. Fuck yooou. I on't give a fuck whatchu have. This little indoor-indoor, outdoor pool, little bowlin alley. Material buuullshit. It don't mean shit. It don't make what's in the muthafuckin heart"

(Chorus)
We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind
You're the one who started it
(I'm gangsta, ugh-ugh)

2nd Verse:
Hol' up, wait a second man
That's that thrift sto info
That's sauce again
Why don't chu talk to the mouth a the horses
Bout my porshes?
Condo's in front a the golf courses
Instead you stay up
Count every second like a fake rolley
I'm real, so you know I move real slowly

The way this relationship should go if you know me
I ain't call you
You wanna know why? I mean you know why
How on the low I push jet-skee's so I
Couldn't return them pages, on my motorolla
Nextel, my cell it don't work down there
And what happened in cancun, stay down there
What's happenin here, made me wish I stayed down there
Take a seat. Why you always makin a beef?
You know these walls too thin in this apart-a-ment
Now everybody hearin our arguments
What the problem is?!?!?
Martin again: (audience laughs & applauds) "Why you actin like this? But letchu have some fly shit. Some nice beautiful shit. (Gangsta) They act like they gon leave yoou. You can tell em look here, Ya know. I'm tired a arguin"

(Chorus)
We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind
You're the one who started it
(I'm gangsta, ugh-ugh)

Last Verse:
Man boo you know what I do
So don't trip when I come home after two
Or three or four
I ain't messin wit them girls no more...this week
The benz coup is so sweet
When I roll down the street
Tears roll down her cheeks
She said, 'you must love that car more than me'
A nigga I was wit chu before the cheese
So you need to work on your priorities
If she went wit 'Fabulous'
I bet that she'd be a:
AR-GU-IN-G, Please
I'm not actin like this cause I'm gettin spins on
WU-KR, Cin-ci-nat-ti
You think I get my voice so deep
Like WU-KR, cin-ci-nat-ti
That's how much of a fuck I give
You seen cribs? That's how the fuck I live
As far as this...
(Chorus)
We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind
You're the one who started it

[Intro]
*Yawn*
Shit...
Man...
Dream on, dream on...
Hey...

[Verse 1]
These voices they tell me go
Why should I ever go?
Man I'm so comfortable here
Why should I head to a place where people live in fear?
Standoff-ish to really hear
Somethin' they can really feel
But see I'll never get
Why the earth is a puzzle that I'll never fit
I'm not of their world
So why should I leave my sanctuary?
Man, the whole thought of that is scary
How do I know that their kind will truly hear me out?
Will they understand I'm flyin' from a different route?
Posed as a human being
Mother Moon tells me that people need my help
I guess these are the cards she threw out and dealt

[Bridge]
She said I gotta do it alone
She said I gotta do it alone
I guess I gotta go

[Hook]
You gotta do it alone mane
You gotta do it alone
You gotta do it alone mane
Go on your own
It's bigger than you mane
It's bigger than you
It's bigger than you mane

[Verse 2]
She said to pack my bags dog and never look back
This is something that I have to do
A hero to save the world
A hero with no girl or no family just sacrifice as a friend
And struggle is the enemy
But weed is the remedy
And if you get lonely boy you can just roll up a dutch and
Keep your head high
Wanna see home look at the sky
Remember you're not strange
But you are not the same mane

[Hook]
You gotta do it alone mane
You gotta do it alone
You gotta do it alone mane
Go on your own
It's bigger than you mane
It's bigger than you
It's bigger than you mane

[Hook]
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?

You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?

You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?

You, you, you can look up, I never come down
I tap dance on the clouds

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I keep it plainer than Pat, dog
So plain it's almost like I don't even rap, yo
Mack load, with flame from a spawning of hauntings that aren't me
Even with my damn eyes open
Yeah, it's like my own never never land
Smokin' on kush, from a bush you'll never touch
Being approached by hoes before you couldn't fuck
And all they wanna know if you be down (you be down)
If you really understand what happen from point A
What, hey, how you doing it wasn't even enough
To escape but I can't go
See I dream on and I'm over the peons
While I be doin' the beyond the
Hatin' niggas be puzzled like how did he get on?
See, I did not dare perform with that coolery
So ante like nothing else matters
Walkin' with a spirit so tattered

[Hook]
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?

You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?

You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?

You, you, you can look up, I never come down
I tap dance on the clouds

[Verse 2]
New type of warrior
Modern day hippie if I get enough sticky
And if you don't get it I'll explain it to you simply
And iffy iffy, then homie probably never get me
Nothin' really special about lil' ol' Cudder
Except the fact I'd slit my own throat for my mother
If it could make it stress free and then my brother could sacrifice
A meal best served raw with a little steak sauce
Oh no, I bet you probably think I'm looney tune
After big big country bought an album from a leak through
He was cool but just seems some type whatchamacall
Other worldly, but I'm more of a worldly other
Sucker niggas like to state they undercover
But I'll peep ya, I'll see you from my cloud sanctuary
And there's something about Mary
She made me un-tame
There was issues way before I smoked the phillies

[Hook]
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?

You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?

You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?

You, you, you can look up, I never come down
I tap dance on the clouds

[Verse 3]
Expedited for you so homie run to it
We makin' the damn dough, who knew it
And everybody in the game with the same ol'
No-no's I'll be doin' it, but Cudi from a different mode
You can keep it goin' though, no I will never slow
Ol' girl want purp, she is silly, yo
I ain't trippin', I'm skippin' while I'm sippin' in
While I go in though (again and again)
Tell them motherfuckin' let somebody tell new ones
If you get high still strive to be someone
I am not a role model but I am the blueprint
Superstar concerts and honors when I spit
Only can be me, Scott, no one can do it, K
Only, I don't mean to be, I do it the CuDi way
No need to be mad if you not me
Lookin' for ill shit, you know where to find KC
Yeah, you know where to find KC

[Hook]
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?

You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?

You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?

You, you, you can look up, I never come down
I tap dance on the clouds

[Intro]
Maybe, Maybe
Oh

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, baby
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, my G
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, baby
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, my G

[Verse 1]
I can't lie, sometimes I'm feeling low
Please get out of my mind, I'mma find out which way to go
I need to take control, had a problem ahead of me
I could never let it be reality
I've come to find out, I'm not the one who says to hide out
So many alone insecurities
See you were checking and I get it
I am a maniac I admit it, do you get it

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, baby
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, my G
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, baby
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, my G

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe, ooh
Maybe, ahh
Maybe, ooh
Maybe, ahh (Whoa)

[Verse 2]
No lie, some days are better days
Walk into my mind, my heart will know the way
I need to take it slow, but I don't know another route
I could never let this be the end of days the end of dreams
So sure, I'll be okay
My mind is stronger than yours, way quicker no lie
See you’re projecting and I get it
Hey, I am a maniac I admit it, do you get it

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, baby
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, my G
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, baby
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, my G

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe, ooh
Maybe, ahh
Maybe, ooh
Maybe, ahh (Whoa)

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna marry the night, I won’t give up on my life
I'm a warrior queen, live passionately tonight
I'm gonna marry the dark, gonna make love to the stark
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness, I'm a winner
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night

[Chorus 1]
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

[Post-Chorus]
Ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna lace up my boots, throw on some leather and cruise
Down the streets that I love, in my fishnet gloves, I'm a sinner
Then I'll go down to the bar, but I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high, kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night

[Chorus 1]
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

[Post-Chorus]
Ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

[Bridge]
Nothing's too cool to take me from you
New York is not just a tan that you never lose
Love is the new denim or black
Skeleton guns are wedding bells in the attic
Get Ginger ready, climb to El Camino front
Won't poke holes in the seat with my heels
'Cause that's where we make love
Come on and run
Turn the car on and run

[Chorus 2]
I'm gonna marry the night (The night)
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road
I'm gonna marry the night (The night)
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

[Post-Chorus]
Ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry (Marry)
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night (The night)
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry (Marry, marry)
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night (The night)
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

[Outro]
I'm gonna marry, marry
I'm gonna marry, marry
C'mon, c'mon
The night, the night, the night
(Gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna)
The night, the night, the night
(Gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna)
The night, the night, the night, the night
(Gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna)
The night, the night, the night, the night
(Gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna)
The night, the night, the night (Gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna)

[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa

[Verse 1]
Whenever I'm dressed cool, my parents put up a fight
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And if I'm a hot shot, mom will cut my hair at night
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And in the morning, I'm short of my identity
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I scream, "Mom and Dad, why can't I be who I wanna be?"
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
To be

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to know
I am my hair

[Chorus]
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair

[Post-Chorus]
Free as my hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
As free as my hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I want some raccoon or red highlights
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Just because I want my friends to think I'm dynamite
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And on Friday, Rock City High School dance
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I've got my bangs to hide that I don't stand a chance
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
A chance (No)

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to know
I am my hair

[Chorus]
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair

[Post-Chorus]
Free as my hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
As free as my hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair

[Bridge]
I just wanna be free, I just wanna be me
And I want lots of friends that invite me to their parties
Don't wanna change, and I don't wanna be ashamed
I'm the spirit of my hair
It's all the glory that I bare
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I am my hair, I am my hair
I am my hair (Glory that I bare)
I'm my hair, I am my hair
It’s all the glory that I bare
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah (All the glory that I bare)
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah (All the glory that I bare)
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah (All the glory that I bare)
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair

[Outro]
Ooh, my hair, my hair

[Verse]
Things just ain't the same for psychos
Guns and rifles, sharp knifes, I like those
I might just O.D. by the end of tonight's show
With the right dose I might wipe out this light pole
But, the strangest things can happen from jabbin'
Pregnant women in the abdomen so they can't have children
Bitches get slapped up and drastic ass kicks
Gay-bashin' fags with tire irons and ratchets
I seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Versace "Whoa, hey!" Liberace "ho!" (echoes)
I might have bashed of somebody you probably know
Buncha' faggots in your clique screamin' "It's not me! No!"
Drag 'em out the closet and across the floor
Went you paid 'em a visit in the hospital
Stab 'em in the fuckin' tonsils with a popsicle
Stick, and sit back and watch 'em choke

[Hook]
Cause every chair that I throw
People sue me for dough
They press charges on me
Till I can’t fight anymore
But every girl that I choke
I got lawyers I know
Who got judges they know
So I suggest you stay home

[Outro]

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I swear you people don't know Kendrick, you don't know him
But you say you want some more Kendrick, I'm 'bout to show 'em
Everything inside this human being, I'm still growing
I'm a premature baby in this crazy life that we adore
Doors on the Lamborghini, I want 'em
Can't afford 'em so I tell the swap meet to clone 'em
I guess I really am a vanity slave
I guess my ancestors turning in they graves
Burning money when I get it, fuck a life savings
Overdraft bank statements, just to make a statement
When I put this fashion on, I'm a fashion junkie
Picking cotton in the country, I bought this out the country
Whips and chains, whips and chains, Jacob know my name
He call me Kunta, you my brother, we come from the same modern world
That's ya girl? I see she rocking Fendi
Try this on
If it ain't upscale then you may offend me
Copping everything in sight, ignoring they sacrifice
Amnesia if I see the black visa in my hand tonight
I show my dick and then I swipe, that's a punchline
They was hot and I wore ice, that's ironic huh?

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Gucci Mane]
Word around town that I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my 26's
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
It's the Gucci cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, (Burr! Burr!)
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
See my Audemar tick, as my Audemar tock
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Aw man videos got me wanting hoes
Appetite for flashing lights, all I can do is pose
A black male... on Melrose. I should get blackmailed
By my people hell rose, Niggas that ain't had shit
For 400 years overcompensate by over accessorizing with gear
Man y'all don't see my vision
I do it for the love of hip hop and the love of bitches
Am I a hypocrite cause everyday I'm contradicting
I think of how I'm living, then I watch "How I'm Living" I know this can't be right
My conscience tell me to stay righteous
It's unlikely to see what I like and say I don't like it
Biggest dilemma my priorities ignoring me, I wanna move accordingly
But baby steps are premature remember?
I'm flying to the south and I'll be gone 'til November
To see my family tree but this a shame I'm yelling, out, timber

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Gucci Mane]
Word around town that I'm all about the bitches

Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
See my Audemar tick, as my Audemar tock
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Cold, oh so cold
How ironic he bought it then sold his soul
Is it masonic for your vice to take it's toll?
The remote control is taking control
Lift up the doors
That Lamborghini I wanted come with a dumb ass model that in vogue
I like 'em both, I'll wife 'em both
Take these motherfucking Jordan's off, put on my loafs
Cause nothing goes bad, everytime I wear (Gucci)
I'm getting more ass, everytime I wear (Gucci)
They told me it's a fad, everytime I wear (Gucci)
But should I give a fuck when it bring me more coochie?
This a young nigga's pedigree, I pray the lord can better me
If not he 'bout to strike me down like this my third felony
The voices keep on telling me, Kendrick don't forget about us
I burned my wardrobe, hoping that I could live without it

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Gucci Mane]

[Intro]
Wolf fucking Haley
I'm not fucking crazy, fucking crazy
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Okay, it's my turn to rap (Do that)

[Verse]
Fucking modern day Ian Curtis I oughta been
The motherfuckin' bulls was hotter than a Dennis Rod-a-Man
All the men and girls was tied up inside a cottage and
Raquel, Riley, Brandun, Alexis, fuckin' Milan and them
House’s egg yolking, motherfuckin' ain’t joking
Throats chokin' hulkin that motherfuckers like I’m Hulk Hogan
Halloween at Neverland Ranch? I’m Macaulay Culkin
Fuckin' Superbad swag when I murder Seth Rogen
I’m sick, this asthma, takin' 6 Robitussin
I’m fuckin' this game up no trojans for the semen
On the boat, better vote and fuckin' pray
Even though the pope is bogus
Even though I’m hyped the dopest
2Dope don’t wanna post us
Copy all we are off how we all are rockin
And they kosher but don’t trip
My pockets got a loaf of that
I’ll show you how you’re supposed to rap
Yeah, for the blonde bitches
They say they enjoy the vision
I’m the man now the boys missin' from the decision
My television is eclectic
How can he move on Waka Flocka and back to Joy Division?
Yeah, I said that I received info now the surgeon is missing
Probably cause I dressed up as a nurse
Went it to his office, gave him his cup of coffee
Aw, now he is feeling nauseous buzzin' me to walk in
Takin’ all the doctor calls, ask her to prescribe
A bunch of shit that he can munch and such
He asked what was in the coffee, I just coughed a blush
Whatchu say? (Hey! Wait, your not! WHAT THE FUCK!)
Hit him with the uppercut then cut him up
With the roughest tools
And I found out the wolves had
Aten some sections of ugly sluts
Fuck! Now I got blood on my new fuckin' sneakers and stuff
Fuck it, storage room where this doctor's getting his body stuffed
By this fuckin' awesome, thrashin' African that’s marvelous
With green supreme hats, smoker’s head, it was a pot of luck
I love Taylor Swift, Date Rape Sirloin, in a wife beater with a Chris Brown iron-on
Bitch, I’m tighter than a stogie and a lighter
The cuts thats on Taylor or the Braces when I bite her
After that I will retain her from leaving gaps and gashes
When I brush her with the rubber bands leaving gummy rashes
Laughing Gas, Pass her out, fool beat this
Cause I’ll do to her what my father didn’t really give
And that’s not hard to figure out but just in case it is
I’ll make it really hard to get it out, if you catch my drift
Wolf, Gang
Fuck
Now I'm the newest member of the rockafella team
And I'ma bring Dame and HOV mad more cream
Hooks galore
Leave your city shook for sure
And I'ma bring 'em back where Beans took 'em before
For the last time it's 'Kanye' and not Kane
Everybody mispronouncing the name
So I spell it over and overlike my dog Fab in the game
Pick a bad chick up like a cab in the rain
All the girls that I had was the same
Cuz all they seemed to care about is what I had in the chain
Nevertheless, I'll say it again
Drop the bad bitch off take a cab in the rain

Go! Why she wanna say 'hello,'
Cuz my Rock-a-fello piece is all yellow?
Yeah! She tryna get nice
Get a crib, get a ring, throw rice
No, keep that raggedy chick
She's so masculine and I ain't on that faggoty shit
My diamond ornaments help me fornicate
Girls that look like they on a porno tape
My dogs is warning me 'bout girls is wanting me
For child support, this money born to make
They stick safety pins in my magnums
Steal my condoms, I swear that's a problem
It's like gettin' robbed without a pistol
For 18 years the job is not an issue
Cuz I made a mil off instrumentals
Classify me as husband potential
Niggas ain't think I rhyme for real
I got a 'You Hear It First' 'fore I signed a deal
Yeah, now it's time to bail
Cuz five years from now I'm tryna chill
Peep the wordplay, I'm kinda ill
I don't rap about guns dog I'm kinda real (I only rap about what I do and that 50 Cent's hot)

That's how I feel
To be down you must appeal
To the crew, we're rated R
OC, OG Bobby Johnson's son
Ask me "Ray Ray is that your car?
I seen MTV I know who you are
You did Takeover, do you got beef with Nas?"
I DID take-over the game, brought back the Soul
Got tracks to go, got plaques that's gold
Platinum and gold, yeah that's the flow
All I, know, I gotsta blow
And I don't play 'pause', I'm from Chica-GO
Eh everywhere we go, we know, are ya'll ready for this?

[Verse 1]

Man we going Harlem, Trot around the Globe and go
Places that you ain't know
You would go would that you could go
I be the man if you ever should go
Pull up to the party in my bestest clothes, then pose for the ho's
You know the hoes from the tv shows that we all know, yup she goin go (bitch)
Good life nigga so we only pop mo, mo
Man toast to the rose
Rozay rose even hop up in the Royce
I'd be god damn if I ever go broke
I made it out the hood, didn't have to deal dope
But a nigga that fire, you could prolly smell smoke (Damn)
And I'm on the block like defense, leading, never leaving, for a reason
Believe it

[Hook]
Everywhere we go, we know
Show up, they goin know us (x4)
Everywhere we go we, know

[Verse 2]

So now you a rapper, huh?
Your crew spent all day trappin, huh?
You and your niggas all smell like Vagisil
When I was in the hood like Castrol
Not by choice, more like force
Difference between me and you, you dreamed about a Porsche
I was in the crib scheming how to lease that Porsche (Jeesh)
I spit disease with no worts
Its a shame what you pay to see, It's cool you goin to pay for me
I never let this greedy world take from me
I ain't sleep but my dreams stay awake for me
See we do everything we dreamed we would
Hey say I can't, I say I could, man I should
Send these rappers to their death row like Suge

[Hook]

[Intro: The Weeknd]
All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I got something to tell you but don't know how I'ma say it
I guess that I could only say one thing
Girl, I been bad again, girl, I been bad again
'Cause with this money comes problems
And with these problems comes solutions
And I use 'em
When I'm faded I forget
Forget what you mean to me
Hope you know what you mean to me

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Pick up your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm all alone
I'm feelin' everything before I got up

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Poppin' again, I tried to quit again
I'm always tight with something I begin
That's why my niggas got me to the end
Supply what I take, I take what I spend, baby
I ain't lied to nobody but me
And you, and me
But you especially

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Pick up your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm all alone
I'm feelin' everything before I got up

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down

[Intro]
Oh, oh-ooh
Oh (Woah), oh (Woah)
Oh, oh

[Verse]
They say my brain meltin'
And the only thing I'll tell 'em is
I'm livin' for the present and the future don't exist
So, baby, take your clothes off, a chance like this
You may never get to show off, show off
Show off what you talking about
Unless you like to tease, baby
When in reality you don't know how to please, baby
Blue-ball queen, take your fuckin' seat, baby
Ride it out, now I know you wanna scream, baby
Better than your next man
And if he swingin' I get dumber than the next man
'Cause I don't play
Unless it's keys, then I play all day (All day)
You like them keys? We gon' play all day (All day)
Wet dream fry your brain all day, all day
I think you lost your morals, girl (What?)
But it's okay 'cause you don't need 'em where we're goin'
In that two-floor loft in the middle of the city
After rollin' through the city with me
I promise you gon' see
That I'm only fuckin' 20, girl
Amnesia, put your mind in a dream world
What you doin' in the bathroom? (Woah)
I hear noises in the bathroom (Woah)
Baby, it's okay
We can do it in the living room
Twisting turns in 'em, the only girls that we fuck with
Seem to have 20 different pills in 'em
They tell us that they love us
Even though they want a next man
And the next man's bitch want the third man
Eddie Murphy shit, yeah, we trade places
Rehearse lines to them and then we fuck faces
Yeah, we know just how to get a buzz
Mix it with the hash, come fuck with us
I'm raw, mothafucka, I'm raw
My love so lost, and my niggas, man
These bitches can't touch what we got if they wanted
I'll plug any nigga that'll step
Man, I got 'em, yeah, I got 'em
'Til the ending of our credits
Life's such a movie, filmed independent, us against the city
Please don't get offended when we don't answer your calls
And if you got a problem, come and find us, we can talk about it
What's good, young ho? You about it?
Got a loft right now, you excited?
You excited

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ah, ah
Ooh-ahh
What you thinkin' about?
What you thinkin' about?
Yeah
What you thinkin' about?
Ooh, what you thinkin' about?
What you thinkin' about?
What you thinkin' about?
What you thinkin'?
I been thinkin' 'bout, ooh
I know everything, ooh
I know everything
I know it all
I know it all
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ooh
Ooh-ahh, ahh, ahh
Ooh, oh no, no, no
Ahh, ahh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Mama, I found a man
Who loves me and understands
Papa, he's quite a man
He adores me, he's my biggest fan
And don't get me wrong
I know he's not perfect in your eyes
But somehow he's flawless in mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can't do that
We're too far down the hole
He's got a hold on my soul

[Chorus]
So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enough

[Verse 2]
Mama, don't judge me now
I'm not trying to hurt you
I know this won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?

[Bridge]
You'll see a monster
I see a smile
You say it's danger
And I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now

[Chorus]
So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enough

[Intro]
Seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama if that's movin' up then I'm—
(Alright you niggas, al-alright)
(Alright you niggas, al-alright)
(Alright you niggas, al-alright)
(Alright you niggas, al-alright)

[Chorus 1]
I never liked you niggas
Who knew, one day, I'd be just like you niggas?
Ugh-ugh-ugh, all right, you niggas
Ugh-ugh-ugh, all right, you niggas
When I become my mama's boyfriends?
When I become my mama's boyfriends?

[Verse 1]
He walked in our lives; I was only five
Superman pajamas, I was super-duper fly
Sitting there like, "Wow," he at least hooper size
You know I scrutinize, like, "Who this newer guy?"
I'm my mama boyfriend, I'm her little husband
I was the man of the house when it wasn't
Tryna get to know me, homie? Just kill the charm
You ain't interested in meyou just tryna fuck my mom
We are the voices of our parents' bad choices
The aftermath of divorces, the kids of bitter split-ups
And babysitters, grandparents that don't know what do to with us
And the last thing I want to see is Mama's new nigga
You ol' Old Spice-wearing, short chain-wearing
Dress shoes and jogging pants-wearing, church sock-wearing
When you first stop caring about your appearance?
When you get here anyway? I already got parents
Don't try to put me in line, I already got crayons
My mama said I could do it, I already got clearance
Keep your hands off my mama, how Anita got Clarence
Yeah, I know she look good, but you need to stop staring
I drew a picture of her that'd make her proud
But the door was locked, and the TV up so loud
I scream out, "I ain't going to sleep no time soon!
And when I do, I'm sleeping in my mama room!"

[Chorus 2]
"I don't like you, nigga
If I was old enough, I'd fight you, nigga
I want to run over you with my bike, you nigga
Don't go to sleep at night, you nigga"
When I become my mama's boyfriends?
When I become my mama's boyfriends?

[Verse 2]
Twenty years later: Where has the time gone?
Now, a nigga dating, having problems of his own
And now, a nigga grown, and the tables turned around
I never thought I ever raise another nigga's child
He don't like his mama boyfriend, just like me
Don't wanna do the wrong thing, that's very un-Spike Lee
But he be like Deebo 'round his mama 'nem
'Cause when she here, he be quiet
When she leave, he be talking again
He be wilding again—be calm
I don't drink the drama or sip the Dom Tyler Perry-on
"You gon' marry my mom?"
"Look, I don't read palms, and I don't read Psalms"
But I did take lil' man to church, took lil' man to school
"Look, lil' man: Kids don't make the rules
Even though I ain't raise you, and you your mama angel
Don't get it twisted, baby boy—I'll Ving Rhames you"

[Chorus 1]
I never liked you niggas
Who knew, one day, I'd be just like you niggas?
Ugh-ugh-ugh, all right, you niggas
Ugh-ugh-ugh, all right, you niggas
When I become my mama's boyfriends?
When I become my mama's boyfriends?

[Intro: Suai]
Tried to write a love song
I wanted it to be just right
Tried to make it beautiful
But all I could think of was our last fight
I was gon' play it on piano
Have the drums come in real bold
But I couldn't think of anything good to say
So the big ballad strings will never get played
Pretty melody I wrote will never get sang
Piece of paper that I started 

[?] thrown away
A song about our love will never see the light of day
Why? 'Cause you made it that way
Yeah
Yeah, you made it that way
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus: Suai]
I was gonna write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
Playing games, now you're just
A lame who's **** (Crazy ass b—) outta luck
I almost wrote you a love song

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
She threw my watch out the window, chain in her hand
She running through the crib, finding anything she can
Now our relationship is not the only thing that's outta hand (Look)
She even called my mama like, "You need to get ya man
'Cause your son lying on me, I ain't trying to get a tan
And this the last time he'll have me crying in my hands
So I'm heading to the club tr—tryna find a man"
Bitch, you headed to the club tr—tryna find a man
What is you saying? Had hoes and passionate night gowns
But you the only one I imagine in white gowns
So where ya left hand, you should let me add a ring to it
Because Mr and Mrs Anderson just has a ring to it
She like, "Why you act like that to me (What?)
And walk right back, Mike Jack to me?
Every time we fall out I'll throw yo ass out
But you just end up boomeranging right back to me, what the fuck?

[Chorus: Suai]
I was gonna write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
Playing games, now you're just
A lame who's **** outta luck
I almost wrote you a love song

[Verse 2: Big Sean]

[?] ayy
I think you crazy, crazy, you need medication
You should calm down, you need meditation
Sending me a text with a hundred exclamations (What the fuck)
About how I'm wrong without any explanation
At all before you say another nigga next up
I should call a maid down 'cause I messed up
But gave you what you need even on them shopping sprees
I would throw you paper like extra extra (Read all about it)
She said what if we reversed roles
And you was front row cheering at my first shows
And a couple dollars later and some Louis Vuitton clothes
I could fuck a couple niggas thinking that you wouldn't know?
And since I had no feelings for them then it shouldn't hurt yours
And since you thought I'd never do it it even hurt more
And I would lie about it, but you'd find out from the source
Whose word was more truthful then yours, fuck what you 

[?]

[Suai]
I’m so glad I didn’t ever pen it
Now you ain’t got nothing with your stupid name in it
And if I would’ve did it would’ve probably stay with ya
Listening to the lies you were constantly telling you did me all wrong
What would even make me wanna write you a song
So glad I moved on
Cause now I got a new guy thats turning me on
And the big ballot strings are about to get played
Pretty melody I wrote is about to get sang
A song about our love is going to see the light of day
Why?
Cause you made it that way
Oohhh, yeah you made it that way
Ohhhh oh yeahh, I was going to write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
Playing games now you’re just
A lame who’s shit outta luck
I almost wrote you a love song

[Hook]
Got campaign going so strong
Getting brain while I’m talking on the phone
Spend money when ya moneys this long
Real street niggas ain’t no clone
We at the top where we belong
Drank lean rose patron
Smoking on thousand dollar worth of strong
When the club bout to hear this song?

Got Racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks
Got Racks on racks on racks
Got Racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks
Nigga ain’t even tryna hold back

Got a car lot my garage
Got a condo down near the stars
I’m geeked up off them bars
Got a car ain't even gotta park
No keys push button start
She ain’t a dime I won’t get hard
Got hoes that need a green card
Say Ima dog but I dont even bark
Got em biting this swag like sharks
One hit I’ma knock it out the park
Trap beat so goddamn hard
Got Kush, Got Lean, Got barre
Got remix hard as scale
Got bricks don’t need no scale
I’m plugged in with the mail
I’m part of the cartel
Got rerock ain’t no cling
6 two hundred for a nin
Then fuck it all up on jeans
I’ma true religion fiend’
Got bands in the pockets of my jeans
Need a kickstand way I lean
Promethazine fiend
Stamped on sprite and lean

[Hook]

(Wiz Khalifa)

Racks on, racks off
See that blonde strip when my hats off
Looking at my rollie, bout 30 grand what that cost
Smoke like I’m in Cali, fuck, take a flight, i’ll blast off
Niggas talkin tattoos, we should have a tat off
Got racks on racks on racks, naps on naps on naps
Just made a mill, count another mill so put that on top of that
Way back in 2004 I told them it was a wrap
Now my life ain't my life no more I told you niggas its a wrap, eww
You claim you a dog, my nigga, I’m the vet
We can’t even talk unless you cut the check
I guess thats why all these niggas get mad
They say fuck a young nigga, fuck a young nigga
I know theres some girls in the crowd right now who wanna fuck a young nigga, ya
I roll one and roll another one bigger, niggas thinking they sick well I’m sicker
Ima smoke my weed, and ima drink my liquor
Better make sure you fuck your girl right before I dick her…. down

[Hook]

Y’all know I keep them racks
I stay counting them stacks
Ya girl won’t leave me 'lone
One fuck now she attached
Flow hot don’t need no match
Sell work don’t pay no tax
I’m turnt up to the max
Don’t even know how to relax
I drank so much that lean
Had to wake up on a bean
Got racks all in my jeans
Man busting out the seams
Got kush all in my lungs
Get High like cheech and chong
800 a zone I ain’t blowin unless it strong
Catch hell on my iPhone
Catch mine and then I’m gone
The girl won’t leave
I can not take her home
I’m gone on them bars
Bitch I’m not a star
I’m driving foreign cars
Strapped up no bodyguards

[Hook]
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don’t ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me it’s time to go
Tell me I gotta leave, then tell me I gotta stay
Tell me I’m all you need
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don’t ever wanna come down
So, baby, tell me who the best
Tell me it’s not me
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me I’m all you need

[Verse 1]
Understand, I am
The renowned, newest talk of the town
When errybody talk and just keeps on talkin’ about
Westside! Tellin’ girls “You should call if you down”
And if my phone doesn’t ring, then leave it after the pound
Cause I be up in the air more than I do on the ground
My city is on my hat, and I’m wearin’ it like a crown (Westside)
You’re now rocking with somebody on their fuckin’ bidness
Watch me do it big, no pun intended (Boi)
See, I done seen nights turn to days
Love turn to hate, hugs turn to laids
Niggas turn to sirs, Andre to Spades
‘Cause when it turns real, that’s when everyone turns fake
Instead of saying "fuck all of y’all" and turning away
Man, I was cool enough to say “Fuck it” and let ‘em stay
Fuck, I hate to say I told you so
So buying rounds is my way of saying “told you, ho”

[Hook]
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don’t ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me it’s time to go
Tell me I gotta leave, then tell me I gotta stay
Tell me I’m all you need
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don’t ever wanna come down
So, baby, tell me who the best
Tell me it’s not me
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me I’m all you need

[Verse 2]
Now, I can’t tell what’s a better accessory
My new watch, or the chick that’s standin’ right next to me
Killin’ niggas at rap, but being the man’s my specialty
I love shitting on all my exes especially
Double shots, then reload
Let’s toast to the interns that made it to CEO
Boss player, collectin’ every single check that’s owed out
Puttin’ on a show until everything is sold out
Man, I’m chillin’ with Jays, ‘Ye’s, and Common Senses
It’s crazy when legends are peers and your competition
I would hate to be a almost nigga
I call ya that, ’cause you gossip like y’all almost bitches
You know, went to school with Jay, and was almost Jigga
Or hooped against LeBron and would almost get ‘im
Y’all niggas make me realize how good almost isn’t
Would hate to look back on my life and say “I almost did it”
Fuck that, reflectin’ on the last chain I bought
They on my tracks, waitin’ on the next train of thought
Visualizin’ how the crown might be
Got the whole rap game tryna sound like me

[Hook]
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don’t ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me it’s time to go
Tell me I gotta leave, then tell me I gotta stay
Tell me I’m all you need
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don’t ever wanna come down
So, baby, tell me who the best
Tell me it’s not me
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me I’m all you need

[Bridge]
This dedicated to my ex girls, both of ‘em
It’s also dedicated to everybody who be talkin’ shit behind my back
And then when I see y’all, y’all act like “Awww, I’m so happy for you”
That’s some bitch-ass shit, nigga

[Outro]
Understand that what goes around comes around
(This also dedicated to everybody who’s fuckin’ winnin’ today)
And I don’t ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me it’s time to go
(Everybody gettin’ it)
(After niggas said you couldn’t get it)
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don’t ever wanna come down
So, baby, tell me who the best
(G.O.O.D. Music and the best)
(No I.D.!)

[Intro]
"Listen to the track BITCH!" echoes
Ay yeah girl... ay yeah
(Brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr) Gucci (brr-brr!)

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
The pretty bitches love me, them bitches love me
I think them bitches love that I'm a bottle popper

[Gucci Mane]
She caught up in my love triangle
I used to sell them things in triangles
And that was when I was in the eighth grade
Now I'm self made; and I'm high paid
Nigga you ain't even in my tax bracket
I'm pulling Gucci denim off the clothes racket
Gucci man, it's the Gucci crew
Brick Squad rappers, nigga who are you?
What it do nigga? What's poppin?
By them 30 next summer we droppin
We back again, yeah we back again
And we gotta win, she wanna be my friend

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
I pull up in that black and red Challenger
A com-pe-tition, where the challengers?!
I pull up in that 'Rari with them other ones
And thinkin 'bout it, I'm goin and gettin another one
Gucci Mane I run the land from Africa to Pakistan
Understand and overstand, Gucci Mane in Overland
What a fine ass yellow bonnnnnnnnnne
She got it goin on
Now I got so many chains on they don't know what's goin on
Find your number in my phone and don't know what be goin wrong
Find the number in my phone and don't know what be goin wronnnng
She had it goin on

[Hook]

[Wale]
Brr, brr, ay, lemme see, okay
A-T-L they know my name, Magic City throw some change
Flyest nigga in this bitch, and I don't even own no chain
Take yo' chick, with no complaints, she say my shit oh so great
And that's why she been feelin me.. and y'all got that novocaine
Go for mine, that ball shit, pour Ciroc 'til I'm nauseous
Stuck up when, she sober when, she rollin got no conscience
She OD's on Louboutin, she work at that nudie bar
Told her do it for the money, get your Cameron Newton on
Green we can all burn(AuBurn), 'til I am the highest man(heisman)
Y'all a bunch of pussies, why the fuck y'all near the lion's den?
Paper planes, pilotin, Y-S-L attirin'
Way a nigga be in gals you'd think I know Esiason
Burrrr!

[Hook]

[Intro: Jai Paul]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus: Jai Paul]
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)

[Verse 1: Drake]
I got car money, fresh start money
I want Saudi money, I want art money
I want women to cry and pour out they heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
Yeah, and lately I do bitches the meanest
Tell 'em I love 'em and don't ever mean it
We go on dates, I send the Maybach out in neighborhoods
They never seen it
That shit is dangerous, but it's so convenient, I ain't lying
Yeah, and comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italia's some fly shit
It's sitting at the house like I bought it in '96
'Cause honestly I'm too fucking busy to drive stick, I swear
Too fucking busy, too busy fuckin'
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't
Been hot before they open doors for me, pre-heated oven
I'm in this ho
But I ain't finished though, it's been a minute though
My newest girl from back home got issues with parents
And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?
Luckily, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled "Surprise!", I wasn't surprised
That's only 'cause I been waiting on it, nigga
So fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Of course...

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympias
We talked music for hours, she never mentioned ya
Can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
YMCMB
These niggas make it so hard to be friendly
When I know part of it's envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga, so far, these are empty
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ooh! I never seen the car you claim to drive
Or, shit, I seen it; you just ain't inside
And I feel like lately, it went from top five to remaining five
My favorite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive
And they tryna bring us down, me, Weezy, and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then I'll probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage you dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on?
Dreams money can buy
They told me it's like a high, and it wasn't a lie, yeah
Just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga
And fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Aw, yeah

[Chorus: Jai Paul]
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)

[Outro: Jai Paul]
Don't
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Don't

[Intro]
One time, reporting live, Compton, California

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
She go to work, she go to school, her body smooth, no tattoos
Type of girl that’ll make your mother feel comfortable
My pops love her too, she’s compatible, she’s independent
She handle her business, she believe in God and no other religions
She's never in competition, when it comes to her friends, she's dependable
She set her own trends, a confidant, a mediator, so sweet, every flavor
Just a conversation with her doing you a favor, look at her hips, I want to be her pager
Conservative, affirmative, actually she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
The beauty of her, swear to God, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me

[Chorus: JaVonté]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Five years later, an accounting major, work at a firm
Abundance of paper, she got a career, she look in the rear
View mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer
Call her boss, executive meetings, consecutive trips, vacational weekends
Dior reeking through her Prada dress, probably the only product of her pure success
Got a promotion, now she own the building
Headed to the top like she on the building, real estate, property
She order tender steak, only one mouth to feed, funded a youth center
Invested in some stock, doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
Oh what a girl, how great life can be, even though she got the world, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be, and though she got the world, she needs me

[Chorus: JaVonté]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
We lose touch, separated, years pass, I’m outdated
She’s dating one of Hollywood’s famous entertainers, Denzel good
Paparazzi spot ‘em out shopping, Tuesday morning brunch, Benihana's
Tabloids paint a picture of a perfect couple
Headline reads when a famous actor loves you, Emmy Awards, Academy too
On the red carpet, dress matching his suit, she holding his arm
She waves at her moms and wave at the world, got the world in her palms
Head in the clouds, star gazing, caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
He bent down, got on one knee, she looked him in the eye and said she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Even if we seem to separate, eventually it’ll come to pass, and she’ll need me
I need her, we need we

[Chorus: JaVonté]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on
I'm a faggot, I'm a retard
I got a girl's bag and a v-card
I got 3 friends and a whack ass ride
You can judge by the cover but it's shitty on the inside
No girls wanna fuck me, trust me
I don't give a fuck, don't adjust me
Just please shut your face hole for just one second
"Fuck you faggot, you're so fucking dumb"
Dumb? I'm the dumb one?
Calm down bo, just count to ten, um
One, two, three, whore- I meant four shit
Three, four, five, bitch- I meant six, shit
I quit, I got no patience, you won, I face it
Your life peaks at graduation
Well congratu-fucking-lations

*Chorus:*
Nerds
The faggots
The spastic fat chicks who
Sit in the back with no one to do their lab with
The nerds
The kid with acne
And tons of Proactiv®
Packed inside his backpack
I got your back, kid
Do you know why, kid, I can rap so mean?
I was reading while you were fucking the prom queen
Huddled up reading, no lacrosse team
Huddle up, huddle up
What? You lost me
Sorry girl did I inturrupt the
Circle of jerks all circle jerking
I need to savin, fuck, no
Quote the raven, fuck poe
Ah shit, I'm bitchin, listen
They don't know what they're missing, for instance
I like poetry, I like instruments. Similar interests?
It's no fall balls, no balls fall
Just sit and scawl on the stall walls
3 pm I pause, *bell rings* that shit sounds like applause

*Chorus:* x2
Nerds
The faggots
The spastic fat chicks who
Sit in the back with no one to do their lab with
Nerds
The kid with acne
And tons of Proactiv®
Packed inside his backpack
I got your back, kid

She stood in line and got cut
Tried out, got cut
Loved art, but the budget got cut
Then she got numb but she only felt when she knelt and cut

*Chorus:*
Nerds
The faggots
The spastic fat chicks who
Sit in the back with no one to do their lab with
Nerds
The kid with acne
And tons of Proactiv®
Packed inside his backpack
I got your back, kid
I know it's bad kid
I got your back kid

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'm smoking loudly, I woke them all
I pick up that tree, when it's not far
I'm gone off that tree, when it's not tall
I'm in love with tree, I'm a Avatar
I pick up a O from my nigga Ralphie
My bro and me, but he is not Alfie
Gone off that goo punch, it makes me drowsy
Roll up the windows, it makes it cloudy
Daaaaamn, if you ain't know
I make these girls nice, smokin' paper and bowls
My ladies like blunts, hit 'em twice if not once
Then I blow 'em off and just pass 'em to my bro
Now catch me gettin' brain if a nigga not learnin'
I be spendin' money if a nigga not earnin'
Catch me in the back seat if I'm not steerin'
And I be rollin' up if a nigga not burnin' boiii

[Chorus]
I got five on it (got it good)
Grab your fo', let's get keyed
I got five on it
Messin with that endo weed
I got five on it (got it good)
It's got me stuck, cannot go back
I got five on it
Patna let's go half on a sack

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper]
You know a nigga like to stay at that cruisin' altitude up in the sky
Tried to fuck with paper planes but it's not the same high
Cleveland niggas ain't no bitches we prefer the cigarillo smoke
If you say it take away from taste then get some better smoke
'Cus the shit I blow can be smelt on the next block
Ain't no middle mans everything you need is in-stock
This Glock is all the security I need
I be solo dolo when you see me blowin' on some weed
Why speed? No need, I be just takin' it slow
I be so clean, diesel overpowers my cologne
Now all the bad bitches who blaze are shiftin' this way
Ya'll just some white belts with these leaves I am the sensei
Now bow to the bag, never save the best for last
When I come around niggas know to hurry up and pass
Fuck a dime sack let's cop a quarter pound
Now what the fuck is you gon' put down?
Nigga I got five

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
High wired, 64 hydraulics
Not stolen, lost my keys I was high patna
Fuck you want, this a RAW paper not a blunt
You must got me mixed up with Chip 'cus
This Spitta, Zig-Zag a whole zip up
Shit strong, should'a came with a big pick-up
Bitches callin' me wanna smoke beggin' for me to pick up
She blow me while I'm blowin' rings of that killa
That weed you smokin' brown
Fake weed too much make-up, clowns
Get real smokin' green strawberry fields
High standin' up feelin' like I'm layin' down
Couple bougie Judys came 'round
Actin' all stuck up
Now they just stuck from smokin' with us
How the hallways smellin', is my windows open enough?
I hear walkie talkies is security comin' up? ...Fuck

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Fuck you
(Our love was lost)
Hey, hey, haha (Where'd you go? Where'd you—)
(But now we've found it)
Oh yeah, uh (Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?)
(Our love was lost, oh, lost)
Doin' the happy dance (Where'd you—, where'd you go?)
(And hope was gone)
Doin' the happy dance (Where'd you go? Haha)
Doin' the happy dance (Haha, yeah)

[Chorus]
(Our love was lost)
Where'd you go? What'd you do?
How the hell you make me fall in love with you?
(But now we've found it)
And then you leave, now you're gone
All I got is this damn song
(And if you flash your heart, oh, heart)
So I can feel but I can't touch
You said my love was a bit too much
(I won't deny it)
Broke my heart, can't find no crutch
So why don't you come on back home? (Can I spit?)

[Verse 1]
Hey, I'm a fuckin' workaholic with a passion in my heart
Treatin' rappin' as a art in which ya have to be apart of
I just copped a new car to hear it start up
Try to do the right thing and please karma
All I want to know is where the fuck did ya have to go?
I've been waitin' on you, baby
Why don't you leave and come on home?
I can't be mad, I'm livin' my dream (Goin' all around the globe)
Though you said you think you love me (You need to let me know)
So I've been fuckin' all these hoes and I've been blowin' all this cash
'Cause, baby, this just the beginnin' and I'ma make all of it back

[Chorus]
(Our love was lost)
Where'd you go? What'd you do?
How the hell you make me fall in love with you?
(But now we've found it)
And then you leave, now you're gone
All I got is this damn song
(And if you flash your heart, oh, heart)
So I can feel but I can't touch
You said my love was a bit too much
(I won't deny it)
Broke my heart, can't find no crutch
So why don't you come on back home?

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, It's all good, everybody tryna eat tonight
Tryna go to sleep, havin' good dreams tonight
You go home, it might get better
All I know: It don't last forever
So take it while you got it, try to get a little more
They say I'm gettin' better than I ever been before
Well, that's for sure, tell 'em what I do
Rap keep me fed like a spoon gettin' soup
I've been out here on the road and now they missin' me at home
All these ex-girls that I used to know are hittin' up my phone
But I ain't here
I guess you can call back
Sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll, I think I'll take all that, haha

[Chorus]
(Our love was lost)
Where'd you go? What'd you do?
How the hell you make me fall in love with you?
(But now we've found it)
And then you leave, now you're gone
All I got is this damn song
(And if you flash your heart, oh, heart)
So I can feel but I can't touch
You said my love was a bit too much
(I won't deny it)
Broke my heart, can't find no crutch
So why don't you come on back home?

[Outro]
Yeah
Huh-huh, and it gets no better than this
Huh, yeah, it gets no better than this
Yeah, It gets no better, yeah, It gets no better
Yeah, It gets no better, this shit forever
Get no better, it get no better
Yeah, it get no better, yeah, this shit forever
Bum-bada-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, ba-dum
You can cut it here and then we're done

[Part II: The After Party]

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I think I'm fucking gone, rolling on this floor
Messing up your carpet
I'll get on it after four more
Sessions of the strong on your floor
Should have fucking rolled, but I fucking pulled
Feeling like a million bucks before
I walked through this door
When I walked through your door
Can't believe I made it
But I made it that's for sure
For sure
Your loving
I need more
I need yours
She ain't looking for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on?
They want what I'm sitting on
They don't want my love
They just want my potential
Fuck it
I'll be sipping on this, baby, living off bliss
Got me drowning in your love
Got me drowning in the mist
Gimme right attention
Or I'll start drowning from my wrist
Baby, if you knew
The feeli'g I would give to

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
You
Oh, you
You
Oh, you
Cause I got it, girl
Oh, I got it, girl
With me
With me
Whoa, you
Whoa, you
Whoa, you
Whoa, you
Oh, I got it, girl
Oh, I got it, girl
With me, with me

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I, I got a brand new girl
Call her Rudolph
She'll probably O.D. before I show her to momma
All these girls try to tell me she got no love
But all these girls never ever got her blowjob
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops, then I might get violent
No call is worth stopping
So, momma please stop calling
We can play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fucking prove
This feeli'g I would give to

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
You
Oh, you
You
Oh, you
Oh, I got it, girl
Well, I got it, girl
With me, with me
With me
Whoa, you
Whoa, you
Whoa, you
Oh, I got it, girl
Yeah, I got it, girl
With me, with me

[Outro: The Weeknd]
Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh
Oh, I got it, girl

[Intro]
Yeah just my army
Lookin for my army
Cause your my army
Lookin for my army girl

[Verse 1:Lupe Fiasco]
Smarter than a mug, heart full of love
Mine feeling me, mine feeling hers
My zone is the home of the cubs
Westside where I reside
Just a rose that was grown from the mud
My gutta like going to the club
Just fly from her toes to the skull
Your peer pressure well we'll be fine
Insects we be fly
No roaches we deny
Off life how we be high
Rolling like Bun B and queen in ride
Straight edge, great cred, well read, well versed
Like me, love god, Mashallah, go to church

[Hook]
She look so good she from the hood yeah thats my army girl
She got my back we on attack me and my army girl

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
She got morals, she got ethics
Shes gorgeous, god blessed it
Feeds you breakfast
You do wrong, she corrects it
She be nice and I respect it
Give me space and don't press it
Do her best to leave me stressless
And thats precious, so impressive so I invest it
She is my respiration
When im breathless when the roads rough
She my exit when I came in what I left with
Shes my right now and my next year
She ride we ride

[Hook]
She look so good she from the hood
Yeah thats my army girl
She got my back we on attack
Me and my army girl

[Chorus]
I ain't your ordinary nigga
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya
I ain't your ordinary nigga
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya

[Verse 1]
Gam-B, the one like Neo
You didn't see it coming
Reverse Miss Cleo
I'm C-P30
Or better yet Anakin
When it comes to lightsaber's that I'm handlin
I used to be king of the whack look
Now I stay king of the MacBook
Yes, mack book, where you write your numbers down
Yeah, boy, I got girls in and out of town
You got it wrong like saying OJ; IJ
Stop the rumors
Asian girls don't got sideways
I gotta fuck every shade of latte
I gotta flow like my mouth to Kanye's
These niggas think that I'm playing, I ain't saying nothing
I'll fuck your girl on the burner
I'm so top stuffing
You can't stop nothing, I'm the juggernaut
That's why your B's sweet on me like I'm butterscotch
Yeah, we run a lot
Boy, the track runners here
I'm Elroy we jet sun out the atmosphere
Let me make it clear
I'm your inner fear
And I'm taking over, please don't interfere

[Chorus]
I ain't your ordinary nigga
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya
I ain't your ordinary nigga
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya

[Verse 2]
Uh, I'm the streets desire
You're getting too old man, please retire
Don't make me carry you like I'm Liar Liar
Bring the heat like a monster, I'm Elmo's fire
I'm too busy spittin' shit with a socialite
I'm too busy sittin' bitch with some model types
Yes, sir, my girl's look like Rihanna twice
With some packed bags, yeah, they ain't going home tonight
Get your camera phone, prove ya seen me
Or else you'll be with friends like "Please believe me!"
I'm all that, I'm Kel and Kenan
Nigga, I come hard like I'm filled with semen
These rappers bore me
Gun talk with black clothes
Y'all let me know when y'all let 1998 go
Y'all niggas scared to grow
I'm never scared to go
Anywhere that's new, I go outside, y'all niggas stay at home
But that's alright dude
I'm a special guy
Y'all been wanting to rap since you were ankle high
And I've been wanting to rap since like what, 05?
Do the math man, how are you one of the best alive?
Gam-B, yes me, best out there
Trying to get universal like healthcare
So fresh, so clean, like a new pair
When you get to the top what you do there?

[Chorus]
I ain't your ordinary nigga
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya
I ain't your ordinary nigga
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya

[Verse 1]
You be yellin' boom-boom when you really pum-pum
See, my flow hotter than noon in June, June
If Biggie was alive, he'd sign me
I'm the New Edition, like Bobby and Ronnie
Just give me the beat and a bottle of Dasani
And I don't need Clyde, I'm a boss; fuck a Bonnie, ya dig?
Religious like the preachers, I came to warn you
Listen bitches, I'm the teacher, go sit in the corner
How many times I gotta spit 'til they know that I'm the bitch?
I'm flyer than a maggot, I'm on some shit
First they love you, then they switch
Yeah, they switch like faggots
That is why I keep the llamas in Gabanna's fabrics (I'm the shit)
Should be in Pampers, like Markie Biz's
Give anybody the business, like her's and his'es
Cause my flow tighter than them virgin bitches
You know them asalamalakum, them Persian bitches?
And if you miss me, I'm swervin' sixes
Goddamn, ain't even pregnant, but I'm birthin' bitches
Cause I got flavor, like that girl Deelishis
Stop actin' like you a killer, with all them girly disses, bitches
I ain't Johnny, but my, my, my-y-y
She want it with me, tell her affi bloodclaat try-y-y
You ain't thorough, I'm the truth, you a li-i-ie
My whole borough yellin' out boom, bye by-y-ye
Cause when I seen her, she was shakin' in her boots (Word?)
When Nicki came through, she was throwin' up the deuce
Slapped her, then I asked her what's my name, she said N-I-C
The President of the NYC, you dead wrong
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
Soon as I walk in all the bad bitches on it

I saw you perform yeah, you put on a light show
I walk up in this bitch looking like a light show
Got a team but I’m by myself ISO
Killing shit lights on, lights on, lights off
On my job bitch, no nights off
And on my nights off, it still might cost

I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
Your girls on my dick and she trying to sit up on it
She hopped on my lap even took a pick up on it
And I passed her to my niggas cause I don’t really want it

I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
Brand new whip but I push it like it’s stolen
7-11 a nigga keep rollin’
I’m headed to the top bitch and I dont think you going
And how my checks look, stupid as hell
So tell me how my ex look, stupid as hell
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it

Ay, now every time I stepped in
You could tell I stepped out
I saw your girlfriend only from the chest down
I’m so dressed up but I pull her dress down
By the time she wake up, I’m in the next town

I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
I met your main bitch and I put my niggas on it
And she bust it wide open, hotel picture phoning
Send it all around the World so I don’t even want it
2,3 I’m in my zone bitch
Where’s the competition?
I need a clone bitch

I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
And I run GOOD music nigga Usain Bolt’n
Getting music so the drinks the only thing thats pouring
Damn thats what I like and it feel good
And it look right, tell her keep going
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it

What you got? nothing!
What I got? everything!
You was straight gassin, I put that on kerosine
I just give her dick dog, you give her a wedding ring
You need her at the alter now that is just embarassing
Let em talk shit though, go ahead, carry on
I just walk up in this bitch higher than a carry on
Flyer than a carry on, sipping on Pérignon
Gripping on derriere, gripping off Derrion
Somebody show these weak niggas where the exit is
Cause they always trying to be where my section is
Ay for real though, the number one question is:
Why is your girlfriend always where the sexing is?

I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it

[Intro]
Let me try this
Uh, Yeah
Money coming soon
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
Omen what up nigga?
Yea niggaaaa, yea, uh

[Verse 1]
Gimmie my money, man, why else would a nigga be grinding? (Right)
Out for them diamonds, dog, how else could a nigga be shining? (True)
I'm glowing, knowing that the flow intact
Get this record deal, I swear to God, my first 'mil I'm blowing that (haha)
Like fuck it, I know I'll grow it back, shit, it's nothing
Funny how blacks they spend dough on mad shit for stuntin' (yea)
But shit, that's all we know man, thats how a niggas raised (true)
You learn bout two things: getting pussy, getting paid (uh)
And you should be gettin' laid by the time you in ninth grade
So niggas lying on they dick and hoes giving nice brain, yea
In class dreamin' bout having these nice things (uh)
And then you look around and wonder why you strugglin' but them whites ain't? (Hmmm)
I brush it off like, "fuck it, it's motivation" (yeah)
Some niggas gotta walk through life, some niggas roller skating
Some niggas bypassing steps, some niggas chose to take 'em (yeah)
And for that fortune, man, some niggas sold their soul to Satan
But fuck it man, I ain't hatin,' I gotta go for mines
My little godsister pregnant now, I put in overtime
On my grind, yeah, just like the nigga making Folgers
I'm focused, on my bite, like a cobra, I'm tryna get my Oprah on
These hoes is crying cuz I won't pay 'em attention (nah)
Time is money, bitch, and a nigga payin tuition (aha)
Real niggas hustle by using their intuition (yup)
While these fake niggas ain't about doing, they into wishin'

[Hook]
Yeah
Uh
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
I'm talking Benjamins, nigga
Grants nigga
From Washingtons, man
Tired of those
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Till I'm rich, ain't no reason to settle, nigga
Its greed that make a nigga wink at the devil to get that cheese
You niggas couldn't think at my level, even with trees
You couldn't get this deep with a shovel, now nigga, please
I'm chasing G's tryna throw some diamonds on them freeze
Sick shit, sneeze on some thousand-dollar sleeves
Ease to the top and I'm not finna leave till I'm hot
But my watch gotta breeze, a south nigga
Boy, I'm shining without the diamonds in my mouth
Out grindin' while you reclining on your couch
I'm climbing, you haters blinded by the doubt
My niggas riding is devout, so talking violence out yo' mouth
And you gonna find what I'm about, nigga!
Far from a slouch, nigga, I ain't gonna parlé with y’all
I’ll probably hit ya, my hand game like Bobby Fisher
But check, them checks is all a nigga thinking
For them Presidents, I’ll treat a nigga like Lincoln
BLOW!

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah
Okay
Ayy!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Ayo, y'all niggas poppin' willy shit, let's see who really rich
Y'all ride the beat, I'm about to pop a wheelie, bitch
Really, this, I came up with on some silly shit
Look how good it is! I'll show you who you dealin with
Y'all illy? I'm iller, I'm from Illi-noise
Yo, Big Sean, why don't you call your Chi-Town boys?
Show me where they at, I will destroy
About to fuck somethin up, I might as well call the lawyer
G.O.O.D. Music run this bitch? Yes, we do
I know you thinking, "Damn, I wish 'Ye would bless me, too"
In the booth, I use the restroom—it's best you...
Gon' head and kiss the Jesus piece 'cause I just blessed you, ugh
And holy water, odds against Ye, it's slaughter
Ever since I opened up that Midnight Marauders
Now it's gon be a problem like a brand new installment
From the late, great Mr. Christopher Wallace
They call us pompous; can I be honest?
Honestly, modesty wasn't ever in my policy
Apology accepted, you ain't say it? Should've said it
As soon as I did it, all that bullshit was deaded

[Hook: Big Sean & Kanye West]
(Get it?) Yup, yup, I get it
G.O.O.D. Music, bitch, ain't nobody fucking with it
And nah, nah, they can't really do it how we did it
It's G.O.O.D. Music, bitch, ain't nobody fucking with it

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
B.I.G. is, "Gee, whiz!" He is
Sure he would be the man, ever since a fetus
I know it's niggas prayin on my downfall and weak shit
But I'm never going downhill, even on ski trips
I am the D, come and make an observation
It seem like the murder rate is higher than the population
Damn! I bet you just as sweet as you look, bitch
You are just Bushwick, I'm 8-foot-6
I'm so up-up on it like insomniacs
G.O.O.D. Music, man, 'Ye, where he find me at?
I'm so dominant, I'm so confident
That I'ma get a compliment on any fucking continent
From freaks that's fine as shit, without this designer shit
Big business, respect my conglomerate
Girls get check, but my bank get check more
Whenever niggas check up, I'm who they check for
Or have a check for; Louie V shit
So much Damier print, fuck around and play check-ors
And these rappers get critical damages
But I rap so good, it's no need for bandages
You the man in your city? Cool
When am I performing? Right after you
I'm sorry but you gone be ranked right after two
'Cause, I'm first place and second is my crew
So move, bitch! Yeah

[Intro: Simba & Dad]
One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here, and will rise upon you as the new king
And this will all be mine?
EVERYTHING
Everything the light touches

[Intro]
In my freshest J's, I ain’t slept in days
Girl, you gonna make me late undressing me
Know you ain’t seen me since yesterday
But, see, I got a date with destiny
Cause this the summer that our life change
Hov asked me, “Is you ready for it?”
I looked around at all his nice things
Told him, “Nigga, you already know it”

Bitch, I’m the man of the year
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Straight through this bitch
Bitch, I’m the man of the year

[Verse]
What you ‘sposed to do when the OG niggas don’t get it?
Lost what was once theirs but they won’t quit it
Homie, it’s a new era, middle finger to the suit-wearers
Lemme show you how to move in a room
Full of dudes that don’t got a fuckin’ clue how to do this
Prolly worked with Cube, so to them, this a Rubik
My President is black, but my jeweler’s still Jewish
So you know it cost, he makin’ a killing off me
Red diamonds he designing got me shining
Spotlight cover my body, my chain blinding
A cop light runner, they wanna but can’t find him
Me and Hovi Hov, out on the same island
Took the whip to the other side of Jamaica
Seen how he was living, said “I gotta get my weight up”
Formulated my plan, motivated by dreams
Parlayed with my mans, motivated my team
Ced said, “Look, my niggas, we got a foot in”
Being good is good, that’ll get you Drew Gooden
But me, I want Jordan numbers, LeBron footin’
Can’t guard me, Vince Lombardi, John Wooden
Garbage? Hardly, you niggas silly like Chris Farley
So like him, you’ll be gone too early
Mama hands together like 6:30
And Cole keep a thick bitch I like to call Big Shirley
All my ’90s niggas is gon’ get it
18 and under, that’s prolly gonna take a minute
I’mma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
I’mma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
At the time of this rhyme, 5 years ’til I know 30
Cole World in the summer brings snow flurries
This next shit is in no way to boast
But my city love breakfast, ’cause niggas had toast early
Coach had us doin’ jumpin’ jacks
Then sent us to the water fountain after runnin’ laps
My nigga went and grabbed his bookbag, threw it on his back
And brought it to me just to show me he was fuckin’ strapped
We was twelve years old, how was we to know better?
I analyzed his life and see that he was so set up
Live by the trigger, ’cause no father figure
Means you don’t got a nigga comin’ ’round to guide a nigga
All you got is mama bringin’ home these rotten niggas
Blowin’ reefers, all the teachers do is ride a nigga
So this is who I speak fo’
To give the young niggas somethin’ they could reach fo’
You better dream, boy
Yeah, I stunt, but I’m a li’l more realer
When it come from the heart, don’t it feel mo’ iller?
Watch my flow go bananas, I’m a li’l gorilla
So pardon me, man, y’all gon’ have to pardon me
They say I rep that ‘Ville too much, but that shit just a part of me
It’s flowin’ out through my arteries, who hard as me? You JV, I’m varsity
No field trip, ain’t hard to see, this real shit, you R&B
Seen a movie wit’ yo’ bitch in it, and listen it, was starin’ me
(Woo!) That boy Simba crazy
Hotter than Ike Turner temper, you December, maybe
And though you wish me well, I know deep down you wish I’d fail
It’s Judgment Day, I’m here to give you pussy niggas hell
And some food for thought, I can serve a plate
With dessert to take, with dessert to take
Yeah, I heard the hate, but the wait is fuckin’ over
It’s like I’m fuckin’ Oprah, well worth the wait
Maybe over your head, I’m ahead of my time
Niggas scared of my future, I know they dreadin’ my prime
Cause I only made classics, now what that take? Timing
Cole under pressure, what that make? Diamonds

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Thousand pounds of weed
Ridin' in my car so fast I won't turn down the speed
Them hoes dont use they feet no more, they break down to their knees
And suck me like a king
Rosé in my champagne glass and diamonds in my ring
Uh, roll some, thats your bitch on my dick
I might let her hold something
You niggas smoking sevens I'mma need a whole onion, whole youngin, oh
Same ones that hate, same ones that tag along
No Blackberry, too many lame niggas call my phone
Call me world wide Wiz cause I’m never home
Ever leave me round your bitch I’mma get her stoned
And you know that I rock camos and brought fros back
And go download some of my old track
And go play somewhere there’s hoes at
Fucking high, and you down there where them lows at
Gettin tired of hearing my flow jacked
Go head hand me a joint, you can't roll that

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I got a whole lot of OGs, and
I’m rolling up for anyone in here that knows me
Everybody smoking, yea it's a party, oh, its a party
Everybody smoking papers, nobody smoking blunts
Bitches rolling weed and my niggas fucked up
Yea it's a party, oh, it's a party

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Quarter pound of that sour, thats four days on tour
Sleeping on how we smoke, see all these pillows on this floor
Every state we score, fill those papers they be raw
Look like a piece of chalk in my hand
But I ain't writing on the chalkboard
And I heard its a party, its a party its a party but I’m cool
Them niggas smoking garbage, I’m no fool
We give 5 j’s out half zips? Nigga thats really smoking
Ain't enough weed up in that swisha to get you high, you joking
Niggas claim that they be high, they be hella low
When they gang up in the building you gon’ smell that sour smoke
I could get that shit from my backyard, go pick it out myself
Yellow light let me slow it down, niggas need some help
28 ain't enough you need more
All this weed over here, thats 1 weed jar
When them planes get the flying, niggas wanna part
Smoking crash with the plane, Amelia Earhart

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I got a whole lot of OGs, and
I’m rolling up for anyone in here that knows me
Everybody smoking, yea it's a party, oh, its a party
Everybody smoking papers, nobody smoking blunts
Bitches rolling weed and my niggas fucked up
Yea it's a party, oh, it's a party

[Verse 3: Neako]
What I smoke in one day, these niggas dont smoke in one week
Riding round and its just me, Pepsi can, playing that Bun B
Gotta smoke that dope on the run with me, comfortably, I’m smoking weed
Doing speeds, who with me, probably a chick from TMZ
I make her roll like two or three, let her smoke and feel the breeze
Ya’ll chip in on a half a zip, counting grams, saving weed
Average shit, it was us just smoking out in NY
Swear to GOD we let ten fly, thats ten planes with ten guys
Nine smoke, meaning someone left without his mind pot
Planes Continental, flights nonstop
You get some zips, well get some P’s
Smoke your spliffs around your bitch, tell me how does she breath
Perfect planes, we call them G6′s
And its just me chilling, me and three bitches
Rolling up its cool, come take this bong rip
Pack this bold straight dope, make your lungs rip

[Intro]
"Yeah, let's do this!"
"Take a good look at me. You need a bad guy like me."
"All I have in this world is my balls and my word, and I don't break 'em for no one."

[Verse]
Yo, hopped out the whip, pop the heater out the glovey
Ski-masked it up, bout to jack these fools, lovely
Blasted through the door, blazing hell with the shells flyin'
Spiderwebbed the flat screen in one shot, babies crying
Got these bitches nose bloody, face down in the shag
This bitch is flippin', shut the fuck up and fill the bag
All of a sudden, boom, shots from the back room
It was a setup, dude yelling: "Get lit up"
Yo, we bust out the back, dookie flying outta my pants
You got the keys?
Yeah, boy now make that engine dance
This shit is stallin', fuck man they strapped up
Let's make a break for it to the crib for the backup
We hit the pavement, dookie busting all out of my jeans
You hop the fence, so we can get away clean
We hit the dirt, this rottweiler snarlin', and smiling
He ripped my pantleg off, a bunch of dookies went flying
I had to blast, dog brains all in the grass
Mixed with the dookie, yeah man! nighty night! Time to smash
Yo, we cut through the park, dookies popping outta my shirt
A hail bullets from behind, like lead fireworks
Dookie filling up my sneaks bought to bust, no doubt
Pulled off my Isotoner glove, shook the dookies out
Yo, it's The Jakes, they want us to be chased
Yo, duck over here, I gotta ditch some dead dookie weight
Whipped off my skully so I could dump the dookie
Cop blazing out the eucalyptus tryin' to shoot me
I blew out his back, that's all she wrote man
Yeah, on his chest left two dookies for the boatman
They coming man, quick throw these dookies in the trash
Hold up more dookie, they comin' out fast
Yo, I can't move my leg, 'cause I'm stuck on dookie mountain
Fifty guns open fire, blood spray like a fountain
Now our bodies all shredded, shots blaze right through me
We're deader than dust, done in by the dookie

[Outro]
Trouble on Dookie Island

[Intro]
Aha

[Verse 1]
Wake up in my king size bed
Girls all around me, eyes all red (All red)
The true life of a player kid
It's nice to wake up to a naked bitch (Uh-huh)
Got the finest clothes, diamonds, hoes
Goin' to sleep on a pile of dough
Lacoste, Phantoms, yards, mansions
Piff in the cannons, house in the Hamptons (Livin' it up)
Big parties every night
This is the life of the paradise
My main man Twista told 'em right
I make 'em celebrities overnight (Overnight)
Grammys, Oscars, starrin' in movies
Got a pool house, four cars, and jacuzzis (What?)
On my way up, gettin' my cake up (Uh-huh)
Wake up!

[Chorus]
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away

[Verse 2]
I got groupies who got groupies
And I buy a new car every two weeks (Two weeks)
My chain got diamonds in it
And my whip got a diamond finish (Aha)
Got the MTV j-j-jam of the week (Jam of the week)
Sign autographs when I stand in the street (Uh-huh)
Plus I been all over BET, Columbia Records and D.T.P. (D.T.P.)
Both want me to sign to their label
Plus I got my own channel on cable (Haha)
Always fresh, court-side, best view (View)
Kanye West and beats from The Neptunes (Neptunes)
Stackin' cream, magazines
Kids dressed like me on Halloween
They lovin' my mixtapes, money like Bill Gates
I'm on top and it feels great (Feels great)

[Chorus]
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away

[Outro]
It's truly a dream come true

[Gudda Gudda]
I gets it in all day
In the studio all work, no play
I could pay a visit to your block all day
Fuck what ya’ll say I spit raw hard yay
Millz twisting up the sticky not that barnyard hay
We just getting to the money then get on our way
Yep, 3 whips back to back
Followed by a Cadillac
Trucks, sluts with us, fake tits and their asses fat
Gudda ain't your average cat, I’m something like a savage that
Came up in the jungle and adjusted to this habitat
I’m sick of nigga garbage raps
I ain't bout to battle rap
Grab the gat, hit 'em in his chest make a cabbage patch
I’m after that chedder cheese nigga
Where the cabbage at?
Gudda Gudda motherfucker there’ll be nothing after that
I’m bout to go HAM on this motherfucking track
In fact I’m better than a lot of niggas better get your raps intact
See me on that big screen and think shits sweet
Diarrhea music when I let this hot shit leak
Uhh, take heed and listen when a real nigga speak
Or slide on a razor blade up shits creek, nigga

[Hook - Gudda Gudda/Lil Wayne]
Uhh, I’m screaming MOB
Money Over Bullshit

Biatch

[Lil Wayne]
I’m talking big money bitch
Hammer stay cocked like Alfred the Hitch
Take money like a pimp make money like a mint
Gettin money is the only time life make sense
People like me, but people like spiders
And spiders eat flies and you know what flies eat
And kids are the only ones that really blush
I’m real as fuck
I pull that thing and get 'em up
That bullet travel hit a gut
Then hit your fitted up
Hit your whole city up
Hit you while you laying down
Shots leave you sittin up
Run in the bathroom on your girl and get a titty fuck
Right after I bust a nut I bust the gun get rid of her
Y'a bunch of pussy’s having a pity party
My guns look like they in kindergarten
I’m the dirtiest seed in any garden
Got more stripes on my sleeve than any sergeant
The paralyzed feel me, the blind see me
And the deaf can hear me
And the smart fear me
Wh-which side you on?
Hi-highway to heaven, I would drive you home
Uhh

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
Eagle street where them twenty’s go for 25
Bitch I’m a boss I got ya ho in my assembly line
Here’s Weezy F and the 'F' is for finish line
I saved us from hip hop genocide
Medication in my cup, it's cause my flow's sick
Got a syringe in my drawers, call it dope dick
And my girls say you niggas can’t fuck with me
Check my footsteps look like there was couple me’s
We ain't promised tomorrow, but I feel immortal
Bullets beat yo ass up like Miguel Cotto
I’m the real Zorro, Rest in peace Toro
And when I die, bury me in all Polo
Kanyeezy’s on my feet with two pony tails
Bitch I’m hotter than going to hell
Oh well and the money is my only mail
And I’m a God sippin’ syrup out the Holy Grail
Oh well
And you ain't on shit, nigga you ain't on shit
Its Young Mula baby lose ya mind on every song bitch
I’m in that cherry tone six

And she got very strong lips
She got baritone lips so I tell her carry on bitch
And when you in my home bitch
You are coming out of your House of Dereon, shit!
Twitter Wayne at the top of every song list
I’m spittin like a long kiss
Live from the throne bitch

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We outside, outside (Hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 1]
I wake up, throw on some clothes and out the door, I won't be back, ma
Shinin' sun, horizon settin' up a lovely backdrop
My life the topic of a lullaby
Ah, breath of fresh air is somethin' right
I don't wanna be inside today
Just keep it rollin' like we ridin' skates
I got a halfy of haze, I'm thinkin' we gon' get high today
And let the sun shine all in my face
Oh yeah, this life is good, don't let it all go to waste
Just walk outside the door to get your mom off your case, haha
Yeah, free livin', swear I be on some hippie shit
But gettin' way fresher than the hippies is
I got the, the gift of gab, somethin' that you wish you had
Don't need to get a strap, nah, I'd rather kick a rap
Enjoy the place that you livin' at, stay 'round
We just some kids and this world is our playground

[Chorus]
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We could post outside for the night
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Oh yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We outside, outside (Hey)

[Verse 2]
When I be on some kid shit, go and take my shorty on a picnic
And every day feelin' like it's Christmas
The kinda weather have the people livin' so privileged
I know the Lord take, today He was tryna giveth
Hey, hey, ayy, rich or poor, a sunny day a sunny day
We start the madness as soon as we hit the month of May
Rain, rain, go away
Waitin' for my homie Mr. Sun to come our way
Little kids runnin' through the streets playin'
Poppy on the porch, he ain't got time to waste it
He just an old man in the sea, Ernest Hemingway
Elevate, look up in the sky, stare at Heaven's face
Second grade, holdin' down the corner, slangin' lemonade
Every day hustlin', you ridin' down Penny Lane
You ain't gonna get a day like this
So put to rest your troubles with that goodnight kiss

[Chorus]
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We could post outside for the night
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Oh yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We outside, outside
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We could post outside for the night
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Oh yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We outside, outside

[Verse 1]
They were sitting
They were sitting on the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious
They were sitting
They were talking on the strawberry swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Cold, cold water
Bring me 'round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold, cold water
What ya say?

[Chorus]
When it's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

[Verse 2]
I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait 'til the morning
Wouldn't wanna change a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
People moving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna just curve away

[Chorus]
When it's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

[Outro]
Ahhhhhhh
Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
Well, the sky could be blue
Could be grey
Without you I'm just miles away
Well, the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time

[Intro]
Yeaaah Bitch!
Getcha some
It might look good on ya
Hahaha
Yeah, yeah...Get some
Yeah, yeah, Get some
Yeah, yeah, Get some
Yeah, yeah, get some
Yeah, yeah, get some

[Verse 1]
They say the boy is sick and they can't diagnose my symptoms
Went and seen the doctor tryna find me a prescription
Told him since an early teen all I seen the color green
He said it ain't nothing wrong, probably wasn't listening
Listening, out of town
I'm anywhere the paper be
Grandma tell me go to church somebody need to pray for me
So I leave and go and see the preacher he said "holy smoke!"
See I'm nothing like you, my pockets got the holy ghost
From that side of town where you can get for the shorty low
Fuck about a price tag everything's affordable
And my homie told me you a nigga be a rich one
Why you on ya ass?
If you ain't got no money get sum
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Get some get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Get some get some
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it

[Bridge]
If the streets know anything about me they know that I'm a ball
Different city every night I'm a star
And I don't need a piece I want it all
Tell em all
If the streets no anything about me they know that I'm a ball
Every night a different chick in my car
And I don't need a piece I want it all
Tell em all

[Hook]
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Get some get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some

Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it

[Verse 2]
I wake up and think of bout how to get my paper
Then roll some and stink up say hi to all you haters
No teacher can school me I'm smart but not a scholar
Shit if I was a book Id be all about a dollar
I never had a job or something of that nature
I've been hustling since a cub had a buzz like a pager
You straight from the path and I'm on one that's narrow
I'm chasin' muchavo, that mucho deniro
Fresh like a Pharaoh, my clothes come from Cairo
The beat kick like Bruce Lee
My flow some like Pyro (Like Pyro?)
Like payroll and ain't afraid to spend it
That mean I'm getting money if you ain't got yours get it

[Hook]
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Get some Get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it

[Verse]
Nigga, tell the world
I’m Compton, Compton, nigga, I’m Compton
Big-ass condom, motherfuck your problems
Make sure that you don’t bring your man to my concert
I want you to suck my whole band after concert
Compton, Compton, nigga, I’m Compton
Big-ass condom, motherfuck your problems
I’m killin’ every instrumental and I cosign 'em
And no 360 deals, see, that's advance at McDonald’s
I spazz like a wino, time and time a-
-gain, I often wonder where the time go, my daddy and my mom know
I stomp a rapper like a Kappa, beat him like a congo
Then speed off in a Bronco, O. J.​
Often reminisce about the old days, Hardaway/Alonzo
Back then, we was wearin' LA Gears with the rhinestones
Nowadays, I’m comin' headfirst like a rhino
I rhyme like I invented it, my wordplay is unlimited
Now nigga, spin my vinyl, club going apeshit
Rap like I ain’t ate shit, shit on any A-list
Artist, you a novice, I’m recordin' on a spaceship
And we never nodded to your sing-le, King K
D.O.T. is E.T.A. Primetime, new clothes
Close-minded niggas gettin' clotheslined, I suppose
Bitch, I think I’m 2Pac, bitch, I think I’m B.I.G.​
Bitch, I think I’m Eazy-E, I’m Big L and I’m ODB
And OMG, I might OD, yeah, that be my new tape
That’s appreciation tape, thanks for knowin' that I’m great
Middle finger to the fake… fuck you!
I’m the center of attention, Hut one, Hut two
And my bitch a mutt too, mixed with all type of shit
Got the keys to her pad like I’m 'bout to type and shit
Got 'em all hype and shit, I ain’t even do nothin'
Screamin' out “Fuck the world”, tell you when I’m through nuttin'
Compton, Compton, nigga, I’m Compton
Big-ass condom, motherfuck ya mama!
I go inside the studio, a suicide bomber!
I bomb on Obama if that nigga get in my way
I’m smellin' some vagina, y'all niggas is clitoris
Must be already dead, sayin' I ain’t killin' it
I’m in the lead and winnin' it, feelin' like a stunt double
I'm convinced we already in hell, pass the blunt, devil
Y'all talkin' "Illuminati", I’m talkin' eliminatin'
Everyone, includin' Satan, Lord knows heaven waiting
I’m the best rapper alive! I’m the best rapper alive!
I’m the best rapper alive! Tell Wayne to swallow his pride
Y'all niggas talkin' that jive, I’m talkin' that Malcolm X
Martin Luther hustles through to dip right through your fucking set
I’m the best rapper alive! I’m the best rapper alive!
I’m the best rapper alive! Jigga man should’ve retired
I’m goin' after Kanye, Lupe Fiasco, and Nas
Snoop Dogg and mister Andre, Eminem, Busta Buss Rhymes
Y'all better bust no more rhymes, I’ma start bustin' your ass
If you walk wit' a Mack Truck, then throw a bus on your ass!
Y'all be no action, no pass, we gon’ start bustin' on niggas
Choppers be bustin’ on niggas? Chopper be bustin’ on niggas!
Fuck you and fuck you fuck niggas, I’m do this for Soul-o
Ain’t not countdown to fuck wit' us, TDE, that’s the logo
And your bitch be my promo, yeah, she know my whole tape
I’ma make a nasty movie and make sure that ho tapes
They be like, "Oh no, wait, he’s 'bout to take the whole cake
You goddamn right, got a big appetite wit' a big tapeworm, every day, I yearn
Another meal, I’m hungry, give some to my homie
Nigga, we made men and cavemen, livin' in the stone age
I got this ignorant type shit, from my uncle Tony
And may my nigga rest in peace, from heaven, I know you see
I’m Compton, Compton, nigga, I am Compton
A big-ass condom, motherfuck the LAPD
DA, and your honor got pumped up on Alondra
Trap my body, free my mind, hopin' y’all could see the sign

[Outro]
Kendrick
Kendrick, Kendrick Lamar
OKAAYY!!

[MCA]
You talk and talk and you just can't stop
A word comes to mind, it's "crock"
What you say is lackluster
Plus it seems you're trying to pull a filibuster

[Mike D]
Yeah, right, yeah, ok
Tell me something new to start the day
Said "See you later, when you coming home?"
When you comin' home?
It's a gift, it's a curse, it's the telephone

[Ad-Rock]
Now let's start over with a nice clean slate
Please stop stressing with the hurry-up-wait
Heard you the first time, that sounds great
But back up out my space, ok?
(Yeah-yeah, right-right) ok
Ok
Ok
Ok
Ok

[Mike D]
Wrapped in pink ribbon, so pretty
My name's Mike D from New York City
I guess it's all in the mind
What I leave behind

[Ad-Rock]
Thought you'd be smooth like a nice Nutter Butter
But I start to cringe, every word that you utter
Yes, you said you are a big deal
But, money, calm down, for real

[MCA]
Got to control my mind
Got to slow down, rewind
What is going on in my head?
Why's the sky gone red?

What is going on in my head?
Why's the sky gone red?
What is going on in my head?
What is going on in my head?
Why's the sky gone red?
What is going on in my head?
Why's the sky gone red?

What is going on in my head?
What is going on in my head?

[Ad-Rock]
Now I don't give a fuck who the hell you are
Please stop shouting in your cellular
I never asked to be part of your day
So please stop shouting in your phone, ok?

[MCA]
You lie like a plainclothes cop
Take a minute, take a look, and take stock
Take a minute, get your mind unlocked
Get open and I'll throw you the rock

[Mike D]
What's going on in my head?
And why has the sky gone all red?
Be kind, rewind
At least tell me what it is I did
Or just say what should I say
Hmm... ok?
(Yeah-yeah, right-right) ok
Ok
Ok
Ok
Ok

Why, Will?
Fuck you, bitch

Hey (Yes), hey (Yes), hey

[Verse]
Last name Stoner, first name I'ma
Ain't nobody higher, sippin' on some Aunt Jemima
Champagne, campaign, bubbly for the hoes
So, fill up ya glass, everybody, make a toast
It's a new day, fresh start like it's toothpaste
Take ya head off, you a toupee, I'm servin' bars like a soufflé
Rappers like to hate 'cause I'm chillin' and I'm gettin' all my tunes played
I do me though, kick a Ronaldinho
Mean flow, wear my jeans low, see my cheeks, ho
Long journey to the top of the ski slope
I keep away from all these haters and these mean hoes
She rock a pea coat to cover up them cheap clothes
Never knew that they would bite her in the ass
Late start and I need to catch a flight, so hail a cab
If I miss my plane, Benjy gonna come and kick my ass
This and that, snapbacks from a fitted cap
Baggy clothes, ratty hoes gettin' rid of that
I'm so on point, you could play me out
DJBooth.net, go and put it out
You like to party? Well, I like to work
It's paper over pussy 'cause the money like to flirt
And I'm 'bout it, 'bout to hand the checks to my accountant
On my official shit, no, not on my whistle shit
Day job to me is like a book to those illiterate
I'm a kid, but you the one who throwin' hissy fits
You the one that never seem to feel me spittin'
Now I'm limited edition and you pussy like a clitoris
Most Dope syndicate, my people stand together
Through the rain, sleet, snow, any weather, it's whatever
I thought I told you that we won't stop
Got the crowd standin' up like they seat so hot
Got 'em like, "Yo, Mac, when the beat gon' drop?"
Here, now pay attention 'cause believe this 

[?]
So I can preheat the 

[?] to eat up clock
D-J-B, double O-T-H, then dot
Net

[Outro]
Ooh, that spelling shit was kinda cool
Haha!
What the fuck are you lookin' at, dude?

[Verse 1]
If I ain't got nothing, I got you
If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn
'Cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra, but I know 1+1 equals 2
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through

[Chorus 1]
'Cause baby, we ain't got nothing without love
Darling, you got enough for the both of us
So come on, baby, make love to me

[Post-Chorus 1]
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go, make love to me
So when the world's at war, let our love heal us all
Right now, baby, make love to me
We, me, me, me
Oh, make love to me

[Verse 2]
Hey, I don't know much about guns, but I
I've been shot by you, hey
And I don't know when I'm gon' die, but I hope
That I'm gon' die by you, hey
And I don't know much about fighting, but I
I know I will fight for you, hey
Just when I ball up my fist, I realize
That I'm laying right next to you

[Chorus 2]
Baby, we ain't got nothing but love
And darling, you got enough for the both of us
Ooh, make love to me

[Post-Chorus 2]
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go, make love to me
So when the world's at war, let our love heal us all
Help me let down my guard
Make love to me, me, me, me, me
Oh, oh, make love to me, me, me, me, me

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now you're thinkin' 'bout it
Girl you're thinkin' 'bout it
What we got here
How we fuckin' got here
They recognized
They just recognize
I'm in a life without a home so this recognition's not enough
I don't care about nobody else
Cause I've been on these streets way too long, too long, too long
Baby, I've been on this too long

[Verse 2]
'Cause getting faded too long
Got me on this rolling stone
So I take another hit
Kill another serotonin
With a hand full of beans
And a chest full of weed
Got me singing 'bout a bitch
While I'm blowing out my steam
Yeah, I know I got my issues
Why you think I fuckin' flow?
And I'ma keep on smoking 'til I can't hit another note

[Chorus]
Ooh, but until then
I got you, ooh
Baby, I got you, ooh
Until you're used to my face
And my mystery fades
I got you, ooh

[Verse 3]
So, baby, love me, oh
Before they all love me
Until you won't love me, oh
Because they'll all love me, ooh
I'll be different, oh
I think I'll be different, ooh
I hope I'm not different, oh
And I hope you'll still listen

[Chorus]
But until then
Baby, I got you, ooh
I got you, oh, ohh
Girl, I still got you, oh-ohh
And I got you, ooh, woah

[Intro]
Damn, you hungry
I mean, its cool, want some more?

[Verse 1]
I built us a little gingerbread house
You said you loved it, I baked you a little
Gingerbread Benz, and you said you dug it
I make stacks and stacks of cake in the bank, bank
You ate through 'em, you ate through 'em
You ate through 'em, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me how does that taste
Tell me how does that taste, oh
Must have been good, got you coming back
When I'm running out, you keep your bags packed
All the newest shit, and the Benz I baked you
Tell me something baby

[Chorus:]
Baby, I can't blame you
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy
But sweety, you tell me now that your craving
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby

[Verse 2]
We took chartered flights
All around to taste those malls that
You like most, said the jefe food taste like pink raspberry
Good credit, A1, just like that sauce
Said you liked Ruth's Chris way better
Lean back my seat, watch your head go down

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me how does that taste
Tell me how does that taste, oh
Must have been good, got you coming back
When I'm running out, you keep your bags packed
All the newest shit, and the Benz I baked you
Tell me something baby

[Chorus:]
Baby, I can't blame you
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy
But sweety, you tell me now that your craving
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby

[Bridge:]
I know that your going to
Love me as long as you're fed, you said it
But I like you around
Just want to keep you here
I got enough, girl, I ain't running out
I ain't running out

[Chorus:]
Baby, I can't blame you
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy
But sweetie, you tell me now that your craving
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing

[Outro]
Hey baby I- noticed you eat your jewellery for break-
Hey baby I- notice you eat your jewellery for break-
Hey baby I- notice you eat your jewellery for breakfast
I swear, its crazy

[Hook: Eminem]
Now, I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You're starin' straight into a barrel of hate, terrible fate
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed – wait, Sarah, you're late
Your train left, mascara and eggs smeared on your face
Night's over, goodbye, ho, I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothin' to cry over
Never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib must want me to mess with her mind
Hold up, she mistook me for some high roller
Well, I won't buy her soda unless it's Rock & Rye Cola
(Faygo's cheaper) Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fuckin' chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya
Tryin' to pull five bucks from me is like tryin' to pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swoll up
I'm on my straight grizzly, so why would I buy you a gay-ass teddy bear? Bitch, you're already bi-polar

[Hook: Eminem]
Now, I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[Verse 2: Eminem]
TIP told me on this ho tip, best tip I could give you to hip you
Is never to let these tricks trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love you slut, shit
Dig you, ho? Take a shovel and dig you some dignity, bitch!
Shit, you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone, tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick, it's you, but fuck ‘em, TIP, it's cool
I'm chillin' like a villain
Like the penguin in its fuckin' igloo eating fudgesicles
I’d rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
Before I tie the fuckin' knot I’d tie you in one, bitch
You think this is some Nintendo game, how fuckin' dumb is you?
I’ll give you some lumps before I split some lump sums with you
So here’s a penny for your thoughts
But it won’t buy you a cheeseburger
But a nickel might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, it's official, so blow the whistle, I got a trust issue
There's a bombshell: Scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fuckin' cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was a motherfuckin' stud, slut, this'll
Teach you not to come drunk stumbling my way, for shizzle
I still live like I budget a Gilbert's Lodge check stub, bizzle
So fuck Sizzler! These checkers are bust like a blood blister

[Hook: Eminem]
Now, I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, I guess life is a bitch – ain’t it, TIP?
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I’m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I’m sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't, I’ll stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker; that clock, I'm racin' it
Double timin' it, but I still spit triple the amount of insults
In a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks
To catch on; while you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man, I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it, dog
And they say McDonalds isn’t a restaurant, well, I guess I’m wrong
But if you gonna tell me that A&W ain't the spot
For the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg

[Hook: Eminem]
Now, I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[Outro: T.I.]
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said it's over and that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Yeah, goodnight, it’s over
And that's all she wrote

[Intro]
Cut the music up
A little louder, yeah

[Chorus]
You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1]
When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love

[Verse 2]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook

[Chorus]
You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

[Bridge]
See, I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

[Chorus]
You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love, yeah
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

M-M-Maybach Music

[Intro]
Can't say her name, but we were two
I grabbed her waist, and we would move
And then one day, we were through
And by the way, I must be true

[Hook]
Cause all I ever wanted was to act on my attraction
I never meant to hurt you, that's just my natural reaction
Life's just like a roller coaster, just like a roller
Cause life's just like a roller coaster, just like a roller

[Verse 1]
Okay okay okay okay I know, I know
You ain't seen me in a while and you're tryin' to figure out
Just where the hell did I go?
Well, I liked you, I ain't just want sex
Well I ain't even gon' flex
First time you walked by, everybody scream Ham Squad on deck
But you still was cool, but I'mma get real with you
Between B.o.B and Bobby Ray, which one appealed to you?
But I ain't too mad
Cause at the end of the night you still let me drill you, boo
But this the least I can do, so this right here's for you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
C'mon don't act like that
Cussin' me out like I'mma call you back
You the one at the bar in the back
Tryin' to figure out where all the ballers at
And all that ass got you caught up fast
And you came back with us and we all got smashed
It's funny how an autograph turned into all of that
But just call me the bedroom bandit
Cause after one night stands I vanish
And no I just can't understand it
I don't think one man on this planet does
I'm just sayin' that even though we lookin' for panties
We still want a girl at home who can fix up a good 'ole sandwich

[Hook]
Ass shake, ass shake
Yeah, I like that ass shake
Y'all bitches gon' show me love
I know ya'll hoes ain't that fake
A real G, believe that
Feelin' like Outkast
I'm already big, now I'm finna be on 3 stacks
She on that superman, blue and red cop car
Can't sing a lick, now she finna be a pop star, pop off
And I can't feel shit but my dick in your bitch
So guess what, there's only one thing left to pop off
Feelin' like a vegetable, with sexy hoes and sexy clothes
They best dressed, yeah I guess they recognize who they dressin' for
She step in the hall to call her man and say she just at home
But my hotel is Valentines, all you see is X and O's
And I can't feel my cardio
Motha fuckas walkin' in with shrooms, now I'm finna feel like Mario
Man I'm livin' with these niggas, fantasizin' life
And I'm prayin' that I make it through the night
Cause a nigga straight rollin'
Hell yeah, nigga, rollin'
Finally famous, niggas, rollin'
(Rollin', rollin', rollin', we ain't slept in weeks)
(Rollin', rollin', rollin', we ain't slept in weeks)

[Intro: Mike Epps]
All these little young kids ain't got no direction
Shit, these lil' kids is on everything

[Chorus: Mike Epps]
Syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka, hah-hah-huh, hah-hah
(I'm on everything, I'm on everything
I'm on everything, I'm on everything)
I'm on; syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka, hah-hah-huh, hah-hah
(I'm on everything, I'm on everything
I'm on everything, I'm on everything)

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
I’m on syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Henny-Henny, sober don't interest me, I'm on everything
'Bout to sniff the liquor like it's 'caine
That's how high I am, I'm blowed
I take painkillers to ease the pain, though I ain't in pain
No, we ain’t the same – you drunk, I’m on everything
Sick when I kick it, gout, me, soberin' up? Ha! ALF
Cash rules everything, acid tab, hash, 'shrooms
I done woke up with a fuckin' tiger in my bathroom
I am fuckin' (high... high... high... high)
Menace to society, I feel sorry for your mother
Me and Vishis on 'shrooms, call us the Mario Brothers
Back down, we never back down
Never laid out, can't put my back down

[Chorus: Mike Epps]
I'm on; syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka, hah-hah-huh, hah-hah
(I'm on everything, I'm on everything
I'm on everything, I'm on everything)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Painkillers, I call 'em cane pillars, 'cause to hold me up
When I take 'em, I need a cane and pillars, I'm on everything
Sick when I kick it – barf!
Me, sobering up? (fart noise) Fart!
I'll crush your brain like a pill crusher, let's crush a pill, yeah
Fuck, I think I just crushed my last Tylenol 3 up
Grab the key up off the counter to the camper, left the crib
Man, who'da knew that three in the morning I'd still be up?
Could barely see up over the steering wheel, crashed the whip
Tore a tree up, on my way to the dealer’s, tryna re-up
Call me Brett Favre, spell it F-A-V-R-E, yup
It’s wrong, other words, I just fucked my RV up!
Bitch, it’s on again, yeah, break that Klonopin in half
While I smoke some chronic in the cab with Donovan McNabb
And I dye my hair back blonde again and laugh
I’m the real macaroni, you cheesy bitch
I’m demonic with the Kraft
There’s a devil in my noodle, you – angel hair pasta
Flow's dreaded like some fuckin' tangled hair Rasta-farian Jamaican, relax, man, I’ll send a fuckin' axe at you
If you insist on a fuckin' accent
Bad and Evil is back with an epidural, check ya girl
'Cause after we prop you up, we're proppin' her up
So, baby, come put ya feet up in these stirrups
Your boyfriend better find another fuckin' hornets' nest to stir up
We rap like we’re on

[Chorus: Mike Epps]
I'm on; syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka, hah-hah-huh, hah-hah
(I'm on everything, I'm on everything
I'm on everything, I'm on everything)
I'm on; syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka, hah-hah-huh, hah-hah
(I'm on everything, I'm on everything
I'm on everything, I'm on everything)

[Interlude: Royce Da 5’9”]
I’m on syrup, painkillers, cigarette, speed
Henny – heh, classic!

[Verse 3: Royce da 5’9”]
"It’s Eminem and him again," my sentiments exactly
I told that bitch to get at me, then the bitch attacked me
Kid you not, I’m lit up as fuck
Tablecloth tucked in my pants 'til I'm hearing dishes drop
As I walk away from my dinner with schmucks

[Verse 4: Eminem and Royce da 5’9”]
Then I enter the front of the K-Mart shopping center
With a coupon book and a hundred and ten bucks
And a bunch of change, and a wife beater with a mustard stain
I’ll crush your brain like I’m crushin' pills
What the fuck’s the mothafuckin' deal?
This shit’s making me feel like
I’m tryna do a mothafuckin' cartwheel up a hill
How many bars? How many tabs of A-C-I-D? Y-E-S
'Cause I'm sniffin' M-Y E-X, F-U-C-K'd up, and it’s obvious
Smoke and Henny in my chest, I’m B-A-N-A-N-A-S
I’m a C-O-C-O-N-U-T, put this CD in, then you’ll see
The sequel to "Scary Movie"
Bad is to Evil, a roofie to Roethlisberger
You don't wanna wind up six feet deep under that shit's creek
So I hope that you bought preservers
You could put a turd on the plate
Silverware and a tablecloth to serve us
You don’t bring shit to the table
I'm in your grill like a Seville when the moth gets murdered
You're pushin' the envelope
When I’m shovin’ that whole post office further
Right off the surface of this earth
Into the darkest and the farthest corners

[Verse 5: Royce da 5’9” & Eminem]
How many bars? How many bars? Maui Wowie, Sour Diesel
How many jars to all my people I’ll be to Mars, mommy, come on
She can actually wrap my nutsack
'Round the back of her neck in a bathroom stall
Or she could just puke from sippin' this piss
From my 24-inch catheter cord
I’m the type that’ll take a bath with a whore
Drown her, bang her head on the passenger door
While I’m stashing her in the back, smacking her forehead
On the dash 'til it's accidentally blowin', the Benz Jeep horn
My friends be knowin' that when I’m on a binge, I’m stingy
Even when I’m ten deep in a room at the MGM
With Lindsay Lohan and she on

[Outro: Mike Epps]
Syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka

[Skit: Woman and Frank Ocean]
Stop! Stop! Stooooop! Let me do it!
(Fine)
No you always play what you want to play. I want to play
You don't got no Jodeci or something?
All you bitches want is Jodeci, what the fuck?
What is a Radiohead anyway?
Whatever

[Verse 1]
Flies are buzzing 'round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
The big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem, give me some

[Chorus]
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

[Verse 2]
This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one drops a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on an animal farm

[Chorus]
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

[Bridge]
I'd really like to help you, man
I'd really like to help you, man
Nervous messed up marionette
Float around on a prison ship

[Chorus]
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
Dinosaurs roaming the earth
Dinosaurs roaming the earth
Dinosaurs roaming the earth

[Intro: Geoff Emerick & John Lennon]
Take two
Okay

[Verse 1]
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all wanna change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all wanna change the world

[Pre-Chorus]
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out, in

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right

[Verse 2]
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
Well, all I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right

[Verse 3]
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right

[Outro]
All, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right

[Verse 1]
All she cares about is money
And the city where she's from
Her intention is the paper
She don't need no fucking love
She spilling all this liquor
Trying to pass me all these cups
Well, babygirl, I'm zoning
Somebody should've told her

[Hook]
I popped one
Fuck it, I popped one
Oh girl, I'm on one
Fuck it, I popped one
I popped one

[Verse 2]
Girl, I'm lying, I'm on a few

I'm on eviction number 2
'Cause I popped one, oh
Fuck it, I popped one
Oh yeah

[Hook]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Trust issues
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh woah

[Verse 3]
Do you know what's going on over here?
(I do, I do, I do)
Have you even bothered to look?
(I did, oh, I did)
Well, if you know, then let me know
We don't gotta be running in these circles
In these circles, no more

[Hook]
Trust issues
Trust issues

Oh yeah (Trust issues)
Trust issues, no more (Trust issues)

Wanna scream it from the mountains like a gay prophet

Damn it feels good to be (No homo)

[Verse 1]
Niggas wishing I fail
They got a better chance with quarters in wishing wells
Brains refused 'em, but still wishing 'em well
Elevated thoughts, but you can see from the smells
Fast living and ash flicking
Parties with bad women fashion and big cash spending
I'm passing 'em, car with no gas in it
Bitches falling love over night they passionate, pass the shit
Nothing but big kush joints love me
Cause I'm rose bushings lyrics got a good point
Rap it how I live it, live it how I'm rapping
Promised last year I'd dent it now it's cracking
Making shit happen, little nigga big dreams
Take the game double player like I got split screens
Smoke big trees and count big cheese
Hands to the hair line salute the whole team, yeah

[Interlude: Tyler the Creator]
Told y'all niggas y'all wasn't ready, nigga. Domo Genesis is killing all you niggas. Niggas, Rolling Papers in this mothafucka. Smoking weed, fucking bitches and eating cereal, nigga. Domo, hit these niggas off

[Verse 2]
Lips wait sealed with a born rich
Hit 'em in they head with shots come like porn flick
Horse flick like boards went, liquors get portioned
Louis Vuitton checkers printed, on some board shit
Cords get plugged in in the rush, no endorphins
Blazing 'til it's done, bring some more in
Steady getting blown, bitches, no maticon
Light skin, long hair, board and abort 'em
Sicker than St. Jude's, chemo get spit at
Got good ways with cuss words and Syntax
Big stack, shitted on, no elax
Thirst that bitches want watered down for relax
This where your bitches will be at
Hand on hairline, make sure them niggas see that
This where your bitches will be at
Hand on hairline, make sure them niggas see that

Back in that ass

Your mom says hi, jinx!

[Bridge: Andy Samberg & Justin Timberlake]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
A-y-y-yeah, a-y-y-yeah
A-y-y-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Jam!

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, & Both]
Summertime in the city
And everybody's having sex
You know, I just got a page from a girl
That I met last week at the Payless (ShoeSource)
I also have a cutie to call
Who loves the way I knock on her boots
Well, it's time to mack, let's handle that
In two to six hours, we'll meet back and regroup
Now, let's shoop
Roll up to her crib with some Bartles and James
Hop off the bus with the Alizé
Now hold up, playa, what you diggity-doin' here?
I should diggity-ask you the same
Then she sang

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga, Andy Samberg & Justin Timberlake]
Hey, boys, I want you both
I hope that you think that's cool (Say word?)
I know most guys won't freak together
But she forgot about the golden rule
Ah-ah-ah!

[Chorus: Andy Samberg & Justin Timberlake]
It's okay when it's in a 3-way
It's not gay when it's in a 3-way
With a honey in the middle, there's some leeway
The area's grey in a 1-2-3-way

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, Andy & Justin, & (All)]
Normally, I don't get down with dudes
But tonight is a special exception (Great!)
See, you're my best friend through thick and thin
(Now it's time to make a triple connection)
Lights off!

[Verse 4: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, & Andy & Justin]
Here in the dark (Here in the dark)
It's hard to tell (So hard to tell)
Where her body ends (La la)
And my homie's begins (Ooh-wee)
This rule dates back (The golden rule)
To Ancient Greece (Talking about Caesar)
We're two Jack Trippers and a Chrissy
The new Three's Company!

[Chorus: Andy Samberg & Justin Timberlake & Lady Gaga]
It's okay when it's in a 3-way
It's not gay when it's in a 3-way
With a honey in the middle there's some leeway
The area's grey in a 1-2-3-way

[Bridge: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, & Lady Gaga]
Fellas, get ready
To impress a chick: helicopter dick, go!
Helicopter dick (Uh!), helicopter dick (Alright!)
To impress a chick, do the helicopter dick (Wow!)

[Chorus: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, & Lady Gaga]
And all of that was okay, 'cause it was in a 3-way
It's quite clear when you see the instant replay
Maybe two is enough, that's what they'll say
But we'll say "Hell no," 1-2-3 way

[Outro: All & Andy Samberg]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The Golden Rule

[Intro]
What's love
Got to do, got to do with it? (Yeah)
I get a lil taste then I’m through with it
Then I send her right back to you with it (Ha ha), hey, how high?
(Hey) What's love (How high?)
Got to do, got to do with it? (How high?)
I get a lil taste then I’m through with it (How high?)
Yeah, I send her right back to you with it

[Verse 1]
Visionary, play your position, no missionary
But yet I pack Gospel in the quotes I spoke
You listening to the most high like the Pope on dope
Now picture that, my poetry’s deep, now fish for that
Only real niggas catch something, phoney niggas fail
Shit you gotta feel like it’s only read in braille
Both did the crime but his homie didn’t tell
So he fucking bitches while he sitting lonely in a cell
Thinking, "Well, what the hell I been on
They gave a nigga five then they threw another ten on
By the time I’m back in the streets like a bachelor
I gotta play the clubs with the old ass women"
Life is a movie, pick your own role
Climb your own ladder or you dig your own hole
You sit around crying, that's like sitting round dying
You wanna touch the sky? Bitch, you figure out flying

[Chorus]
Nigga, how high? So high that I could touch the sky
How sick? So sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees
How high? So high that I could touch the sky
How sick? So sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees

[Verse 2]
Hey, as the troubles of the world unfurl
My niggas hit the trees like squirrels
Tryna get a nut with your girl, think I need to quit tryin'
‘Fore some nigga out there try to hit mine
Karma for the Kama Sutra
A lot calmer when the ganja’s through ya
You need ya armour cause them niggas out here tryna shoot ya
Kinda crucial, police piranha, gon snatch you out that Honda
For stashing that marijuana
Yes, ya honour, I feel ashamed
I broke the law but look I’ll never smoke or steal again
In your courtroom wylin’, I don’t mean to keep smiling
But right now I’m high enough to probably steal a plane
Man, just look at me, what if I couldn’t read?
Would you throw the book at me?
What if I’m feeling sad, am I supposed to look happy?
It’s been a long time coming
Tell my nigga roll me up something

[Chorus]
Nigga how high? so high that I could touch the sky
How sick? so sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees

[Bridge]
No I dont smoke, maybe once in a blue
When the tension gets thick then there’s nothing to do
Through the windows of my soul, open the blind
My eyes get shut but I open my mind

How high? la la la la
How high? hey hey hey
How high? yeah yeah yeah yeah
How high? la la la la

[Verse 3]
Is that a shot that you threw little man?
I understand, you frustrated career ain't going how you planned
Make it worse, your friends, now when they talk rap
All you hear is “J Cole this” and “J Cole that”
It must be hard for your pride just to take all that
I know your weak heart gotta break off that
Boy, look, Cole World this is your worst fear
I’m burning you niggas and I’m only in first gear
I’m serving you niggas this is only the first beer
12 months from now, you’ll be having the worst year
No tears for the haters, I’m still counting money
Cole ain't dropping, thats real fucking funny
Grade A dummy, sleeping on a nigga raps
Something like a mummy
But I’mma wake yo’ ass up
Something like your mommy on school day
I smoke two l’s with ya girl this is Cool J

[Outro]
How high?
How high?
How high? yeah
How high? yeah

Whats love got to do, got to do with it
I get a little taste then I’m through with it
Yeah I send it right back to you with it

[Hook]
They call me the candyman, candyman, candyman
Skittle bags, Skittle bags..

Pull ups in the air
What they talking about?
?
I'm a syr-syrup sipper
I'mma ?
Grab the ? and then dip her
Hit the coke, hit the coke everywhere
Why I be ashamed ho? I'm a fucking
Millionaire! But right now
I need to calm it all down
Popped me a Klonopin, slowed my ass down
Got great directions like a gray Greyhound
? me I'm going down
Take me a Percocet, crush it all down
Hit it up, hit it up, hit it up..

[Hook]
They call me the candyman, candyman, candyman
Skittle bags, Skittle bags..

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
Might be so Icey
I'm blinking like a muthafucker
Like me
Big Gucci higher than I ever was

[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out

[Pre-Chorus]
Shame on me
To need release
Un-un-uncontrollably

[Chorus]
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt
I got running through my mind, woah
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt
I got running through my mind, woah

[Verse 2]
Lately, people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told just what to do with it
To keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out

[Pre-Chorus]
Shame on me
To need release
Un-un-uncontrollably

[Chorus]
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt
I got running through my mind, woah
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt
I got running through my mind, woah

[Bridge]
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame on me (Shame on me)
To need release (To need release)
Un-un-un-uncontrollably (Uncontrollably, -lably, -lably, -lably...)

[Chorus]
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh (I wanna go...) all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow (I wanna show...) all the di-i-irt
I got running through my mind
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt
I got running through my mind, woah

Top, top top, top of the world!

Uh!
I'm on top of the world (Yeah) and I can't get no higher (Uh uh)

[A.L.]
Uh!
First off, uh, rest in peace Track Willie
Ridin' with me cus, back then nobody pulled for me (Whoo!)
Now I sit back reclined and shine it's all fine
Cus the flow merit status was before my time
I remember daydreamin' when I bust like the semen
Of a heater, said the truth and nobody believed him (Uh uh)
Now the story's fabricated, the public is elated
That somebody from the west considered the next greatest (Who's next)
The Prince (haha), and don't get it twisted (Uh huh)
I spit from the soul but the steez is just gifted
I lived it, talked about him (yeah), ridin' now, we'll walk about it (yeah)
Death of Cornballs like chalk, put the line around it (Haha)
On some D.O.A. shit
No gangsta reality's as real as it gets (Fo' real)
I remember writin' rhymes in the halfway house (Uh huh)
Now I'm sittin' at the top, there's somethin' to talk about
I'm on top of the world (Yeah) and I can't get no higher (Uh uh)
And if I fall, waitin' on me it's a fire (Yeah)
But in the meantime I get whatever I desire (So)
So if I told you that I'd stop, I'd be a liar (Ok)
And nah, I ain't worried 'bout the things I do (Uh uh)
It might be more than a plane's eye view
But uh (but uh), ma I'm on top of the world (Uh uh)

[J. Cole]
Uh!
These words go together like a verbal collage
It's murder how the words'll collide
And bring you further from where murderers lie
And maybe you could see a mill, no not no burgers or fries
But give you food for thought, my nigga this is Gerber with rhymes
Servin' up lines for your child like mine, nigga this live
So you think you seen a style like mine, it's a mirage
But I, I'll be obliged like Mary J
Then show you how to strive, when it die like everyday
And nigga stay in court like Perry Mason or Gary Payton
New shoes up on his feet like every week, his mom's interogatin'
Like where you been? Who you been with?
Scared he runnin the streets with them freak and them nitwits
Look up in his face, she see the fatherly resemblence
Read him more than a book
Scared he inherited way more than just looks
But uh, mama I'm on top of the world
Uh! I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world (Yeah) and I can't get no higher (Uh uh)
And if I fall, waitin' on me it's a fire (Yeah)
But in the meantime I get whatever I desire (So)
So if I told you that I'd stop, I'd be a liar (Ok)
And nah, I ain't worried 'bout the things I do (Uh uh)
It might be more than a plane's eye view
But uh (but uh), ma I'm on top of the world (Uh uh)

[Chorus]
Turtleneck n' chain
Turtleneck n' chain
Turtleneck n' chain
(Sipping on a light beer)
Turtleneck n' chain
Turtleneck n' chain
Turtleneck n' chain
(Sipping on a light beer)

[Verse 1: Andy, Akiva & Jorma]
My turtleneck fat and my chain so thin
And I'm sipping light beer, and my crew right here
Chain razor thin light beer in my cup
And my sweater on turtle with the neck on puff
Huge turtleneck and my chain so skinny
Beer light all night, stand up get dizzy
Light cup, beer drink, thin so chain, neck turtle fat
Man I won't say it again

[Chorus]
Turtleneck n' chain
Turtleneck n' chain
Turtleneck n' chain
(Sipping on a light beer)
Turtleneck n' chain
Turtleneck n' chain
Turtleneck n' chain
(Sipping on a light beer)

[Verse 2: Andy, Akiva & Jorma]
Turtleneck (Check) with another on deck
In case I spill something on it (Like some light beer?), yes!
We be bragging about who's chain be the thinnest
Turtleneck thicker than Delta Burke swimmin' in a Guiness
(Now bear witness)
But they can't see my chain
Metal so thin it dissolves when it rains
Got more chains than the snow patrol
Everyone razor thin like an insect stripper pole

[Chorus]
Turtleneck n' chain
Turtleneck n' chain
Turtleneck n' chain
(Sipping on a light beer)

[Verse 3: Andy, Akiva & Jorma]
Chain so light when a breeze roll by, man, it float, oh man, it float
And my beer so light you could see right through it, like a ghost
And I also wear turtlenecks
Sweaters swallowing my chain like it's stuck in the couch
Looking like cookie monster flossing his mouth
Find me cooling on the corner sipping light beer foam
You can tell by my turtleneck and chain that I bone
Turtleneck, light beer and a thin ass chain, and that's it
Turtleneck, light beer and a thin ass chain, and that's it

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
The rabbit kicked the bucket, dog said fuck it
Get my 2 step on, with my turtleneck on
Thin ass chain, light beer in my glass
Mackin' at the bitches, the ones with the ass
Girl, you know it's true, tell me what it do
Oh, you like my style? Say you like my crew
Say you wanna be under my chest
This turtleneck is like one of my best
Say you wanna be under my chest
This turtleneck is like one of my best
So I guess your dress, no stress
Staying fresh is my vendetta
I'm a crook, so my look, I'm a game go getta
The fatter, the puffier, the fluffier, the bigger the turtleneck
The more gangster it is

[Chorus]
Turtleneck n' chain
Turtleneck n' chain
Turtleneck n' chain
(Sipping on a light beer)
Turtleneck n' chain
Turtleneck n' chain
Turtleneck n' chain
(Sipping on a light beer)

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
My name's Bambino, I'm always in trouble
I do stupid shit on a dare like double
Think your games tight, I'ma bust your bubble
I shop at Gucci and Barneys like rubble
Scope like Hubble, quick like chunnel
I leave MC's in the dark like tunnel
Men do huddles, girlfriends cuddle
Eh heh, alright

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie, my my my hoodie on glow
My hoodie, my my my hoodie on glow

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
My hoodie so dope, my hoodie so tight
My hoodie in school cause my hoodie so bright
Welcome, my nigga, to color, Crayola
Got the bright purple, like a grape soda
Nigga I told you, my hoodie no joker
Walk up in the hoodie to a party like toga
Breathe like yoga, get off my scrotum
The color of my hoodie like a Lisa Frank folder
Im at the Kid Robot, my wallet done shown up
They had five hoodies, but this shit done sold out
Spent too much, I know a bad habit
My hoodie look like a shit from a Trix rabbit

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie, my my my hoodie on glow
My hoodie, my my my hoodie on glow

[Verse 3: Chaz Kangas]
Y'all know I'm a hoodie all pro
Find me in my hoodie like a hoodie Waldo
Rocking Amadeus like a hoodie falco
Staying self-absorbed like I'm Frida Kahlo
From the playground, with the sports team on it
To the old folks home, put some morphine on it
I rock my hoodie whether rain or shine
Over-priced in a Sam Goody frame of mind
Got a pouch in the front that holds my CDs
And warms my hands when it's too breezy
Believe me, the quickest way to get hurt
Is if I catch you calling it a hooded sweatshirt

[Chorus: Childish Gambino & Chaz Kangas]
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie, my my my hoodie on glow
My hoodie, my my my hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie, my my my hoodie on glow
My hoodie, my my my hoodie on glow
I told my city I'll be back, but for now
I'm leaving, tell em I'm leaving
Promise I'll be back though, at least once a season
Tell em I'mma get it, I'm who they can believe in
I'mma bring it back like I kept all the receipts and
My hood show me love, I'm there to receive it
I know I run my city because I'm there to see it
It's hard being a citizen settling up in Michigan
I'm trying to make a name like a fucking birth certificate
Aww! Now a nigga on
And the DJ playing my song
And she wanna drink a little Dom Perignon
With Sean!

I pray that it ain't temporary
I've seen it in my dreams though
Mr. Visionary and I told them what it is though
Mr. Dictionary - they fuckin regular, I call em
Missionary like

[Hook]
Aww! Can't wait til I get back home
And I'mma put all my niggas on
And we gonna be the ones on TV, everybody
Gonna see me, you'll see man, Aww!
Can't wait til I get back home
And I'mma put all my niggas on

[Verse 2]
I walk up in this bitch like
Do I need an introduction?
When you living out your dreams
Sleep's an interruption. Man, I made
It out the city of corruption
With no concussion or a toolie tucked in
Yeah, we paid or we laid, no
Minimum wages. Yeah, what else can I say?
We ain't no bed or a lie but we made up
While they was all sleeping and laid up we stayed up
With drapes up like, Aww!
And I'mma be home soon as I get the crown and throne
And the name across it is my own
Who would've known that we'd be paid off
This musical grind. Unusual I, me
And my beautiful mind, that's why my niggas
High-class like a school in the sky. I spit
The heat, you might see a mirage but no facade

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
My pillows ain't giving no comfort
And the fan is blowing way too loud
Even my heartbeat wakes me up
And I can't drown it out

[Pre-Hook]
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count

[Hook 1]
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

[Verse 2]
I never really liked this apartment, no
There's not enough windows
That ain't the reason you left
I did that by myself
But I wish you'd come back before the sun comes up again

[Pre-Hook]
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count

[Hook 1]
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

[Hook 2]
You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story oh

[Bridge]
Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I-I'm thinking of you
Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I-I'm thinking of you

[Hook 1]
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

[Hook 2]
You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story oh

I love you, I love you
Its just the talk of the town
Coming from the mouth of the hood
The Jaws of Life
I bare arms
Crack my paws and write
Laws an rights
Rules an regulations
Tubes and medication
Fools who speculating
Did he leave it in his car?
Little did you know
You've been bleeding from the start
I ain't waiting on the shots
I'm leaving on ya mark
Get ready
5th steady
96 heavy
Wait (weight) nigga
Waste (waist) bigger
Aids slicker
Sharp niggas get head shots
Make flippers
Great whipper
Bavarian Motorola
My voice streams
Lakes, rivers
Constant
Keep spitting on the solders
If non sense is ya conscience
Your sitting on your shoulders
Wether Gucci loafing
Or walking on air
Sitting on mines or talking about theres
Verse two

I'm just playing my part
Life is a chick
Run my fingers through her hair
While she play in my part
And IM never ending
Cause I'm staying at start
Plus I need a vehicle to be conveying my thoughts

I am a purveyor of talk
Seller of words
Merchant of speak
Saying of thoughts
Player of soughts
But I can't walk you
Nor will I cross you
Never been a player of sports
You gota be upright to walk
Upnights to work
Down right to worship
Sunlights to dark
Down right converse
And they wonder what keeps me going
Like perpetual motion
Its just incredible devotion
And they telling you promotion
If you dont know what to say in flow
Just dont make a sound like the K in known/no
Listen to the hustler babble
Little dudes wanna tie me down like gulliver's travels
I got it mummified
They unraveled
Paper towels
Just thumb tacks and a run flat
I will not go down
Maintain my speed
Can not slow down
Stay in my seat like Rosa parks
He came back busing now ain't that something now
Ya wanna sit where he sit
But ya folding chairs that boy is ski lift
Ever since I crawled on the block
I been up there had to fall to the top
This my say in a cold baray
All a dude got like Jay cosea?
And im not letting it Go I mastered this
And gota keep spelling it out for yall like FABOLOUS

[Intro]
(Noise)

[Verse 1]
Here's your special cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Watch me throw it in the air

Waist, waist, waist, waist, waist, waist, waist (Ohh)
On my Superman shit
X-ray visions while you shakin' those hips (Shakin' that shit)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Girl, take off your outfit, call my place a dressing room

My stride Martin Luther with the brain like Luthor
Kryptonite in my pants, so her head go super
Ya man do you wrong, like he printed out a typo
Your body so crack should be whiter than albino
Your body so crack got me horny like a rhino
Shit, I know you seen wood like pine glow
Trust me when I say I'll keep you sacred like Chi Lo
Trust me when I say I'll satisfy you till the night go
Girl, you already know the best damn part is
Get you on your back wax you like Kelly Clarkson
Officers, bad girl, you're so wanted
To be honest, got a rocket in my pocket
Won't you want it baby, I just want you on it, babe, oh whoa

[Chorus]
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don’t wanna see you, baby, in those draws (Take it all off)

[Intro]
Kim, Glasgow
Uh

[Verse 1]
Going back in time when I feel her
She touching me, it's too familiar
The way she doing the thang
She does exactly the way you used to, you used to
Let me take a break, I need a breather
The way she moving, I can't believe how
She does exactly the same, I must be going insane, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Am I going crazy?
Do I need some therapy to get shorty out of my mind?
Girl, my head is racing
Heard shorty's been needing the rest of my mind

[Hook]
Am I making love to you through her?
Am I making love to you through her?
Am I making love to you through her?
Love through her, love through her

[Verse 2]
Thought I left that part of life behind me
It's back to haunt every girl that loves me
Why can't she leave me alone?
Can't believe every girl that I hold
I see you, I see you
The greatest times we had the best of
Push back rewind but I can't delete her
Move forward into my life, I had a place and a time to apologize, to apologize

[Bridge]
Am I going crazy?
Do I need some therapy to get shorty out of my mind?
Girl, my head is racing
Heard shorty's been needing the rest of my mind

[Hook]
Am I making love to you through her?
Am I making love to you through her?
Am I making love to you through her?
Love through her, love through her

[Instrumental solo]

[Chorus]
Am I making love to you through her?
Am I making love to you through her?
Am I making love to you through her?
Love through her, love through her
Am I making love to you through her?
Am I making love to you through her?
Am I making love to you through her?
Love through her, love through her
The Television Will Not Be Revolutionized

Idiot boxes of the world unite! To fight off the effects of intelligence, replace smart quotes with fart jokes, substitute sense with scenes from Martin, let the baby’s bathe in that glow and learn all manner of things they don’t really need to know!

The Television Will Not Be Revolutionized!

Channel the content of some rambling nonsense deep into the annals of yo’ subconscious, deprogram and depress chasing some televised success
Be them, that, they and those be everything but in control

The Television Will Not Be Revolutionized!

Small claims Court drama, teenage baby mamas, Osama watching Osama, Celebrity Endorsed indoor saunas, the perfectly cooked piraña and other cannonfodder for you to ponder, all at the speed of imitations of life while the smoke of war gets inhaled thru the peace pipes, be still my beating heart and scare my brain from thinking thoughts as I sit intoxicated by the delights, sarcasm and 3 strikes thrown by my favorite pitcher in a sound surrounded, 3 dimensional, high death, full color mixture, wholly unsocializing and completely uncensored

The Television Will Not Be Revolutionized!

By this one-eyed monster most of the world was raised, and by this hero most of the world was saved, and to this master most of the world is slaves, it factors your fears with actors and cheers from a live studio audience pushing you to engage in a heroic act of thoughtlessness for the grand prize of a little bread, fleeting fame in the circus and every thought in yo head

The Television Will Not Be Revolutionized!

“Ain’t no changing me” said my flat screen TV, No More Che’s to the rescue, or Black Panthers to correct you, just coaxial cables and satellite signals to connect you to a world that doesn’t really look like it does on TV, where everything is much shorter, fatter, uglier and in disorder, where u have to do it now because there are no digital recorders where if the present gets boring you can just fast forward
The Television Will Not Be Revolutionized!

So there will be no revolution, or paradoxically ironic televised public execution of the entire worldwide televising institution, there won't even be a celebritized, televised trial of old baby blue, cuz you see my dear friends the television will not be revolutionized but what about the revolution that should taking place inside………………….of you?

[Hook: Usher]
It's your chance take her hand to the floor
Fellas just the moment you've been waiting for
Girl if you see something you like then let them know
Ladies I know you’re ready
Because you only got one chance, yeah yeah
For your first dance, you never forget about your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam
Tell them J.B., yeah, man

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
When I close my eyes, I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long for this day to come
Now that it's here, let's make it special
I can't deny, there's so many thoughts in my mind
The D.J.'s playing my favorite song, ain't no chaperones
This could be the night of your dreams

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor
I can't deny, there's so many thoughts in my mind
The D.J.'s playing my favorite song, now we're all alone
Here's the opportunity

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Everybody says that we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

[Hook: Usher]
It's your chance take her hand to the floor, to the floor
Girl, if you see something you like then let them know
Because you only got one chance, for your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam, yeah man

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

It's way up there, I look down on you
(Ayy) Gucci bandana, Gucci, Gucci bandana

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Everything I'm having
No, they ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grinding
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them hoes, don't love them hoes
The code in which I roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam, but I can't forget that tree

[Verse 1 - Kid Cudi]
I got fam, dogg, I got my niggas
Got a little money y'all, and I ain't trippin
Most things are faded, feeling x-rated
Steady want them freaky hoes, then I want a lady
Holding the fam down, and my close homies
The peoples that were there
While some suckers left me lonely, phoney
When you see a nigga, don't approach me
Made it to the top, baby, it's all me
Cats trying to claim that they made me
However you feel, I know the real fugazi
I keep it hundred, never frontin', no need be
When I'm in the zone, no place for pussy, my nigga
Conyo to haters who don't know
Loco, how a nigga like the postal
The ones fans love, who was always approachable, yo
And I rep the double O's, double O's..

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Everything I'm having
No, they ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grinding
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them hoes, don't love them hoes
The code in which I roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam, but I can't forget that tree

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
Thousand pounds of weed
Driving in my car so fast I won't turn down the speed
Them hoes don't use their feet
They break down to their knees
And suck me like a king. Rosé in my champagne glass
And diamonds in my ring
Roll something
That's your bitch on my dick?
Well, I'mma let her hold something
You niggas smokin' seven I'mma need a whole onion. Woah youngin'!
Same ones that hate same ones that tag along
Them black dreads that make them lame niggas call my phone
Call me "World Wide Wiz" cause I'm never home
Ever leave me 'round your bitch, I'mma get her stoned
And you know that I rock camos and brought fros back
And go download some of my old tracks
And go play somewhere songs at
Fuckin high, fuckin high, fuckin high

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Everything I'm having
No, they ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grinding
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them hoes, don't love them hoes
The code in which I roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam, but I can't forget that tree

I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun? ’cause Ima need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring you to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I’m blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?

[Tyga]
Probably one of my realest loves ever
Four page letters, and time is all better
‘Cause time heal whatever
Ima need a moment ’cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, Females are on a regular
What’s the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
I’d rather stay friend with benefits till we ready
Now ready, Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like “one more chance”, more problems no biggie ah
It’s all good don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or give eachother space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that (all that)
Tell your friends they can fall back
Ain’t even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?

[Drake]
I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun? ’cause Ima need a cab just to get me home

You want that feeling back?
Well you should know

And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know

[Tyga]
Uh, ain’t no, ain’t nobody like you
Heard you gotta ballplayer, but he don’t excite you
I ain’t the one you gotta lie to
Lay down, relax, climax, let me bite you
Uh, still a, still a superfreak
You know how it be when I’m rolling in the sheets
Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Genuine, ’cause I’m the same O G
We was young, full of insecurities
Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies
Arguing in Barney’s, fly shit, too much pride to say sorry
Problems ruined like half the day
Number 24, let it fade away
She gotta leave, but she wanna stay
She like, how you feeling babe?
Like, like, shit

[Drake]
I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun? ’cause Ima need a cab just to get me home

[Hook]
Jeans fitting right, hair did, shawty you the best
Light skinned, dark skinned, bottom right, top heavy
Jeans fitting right, hair did, shawty you the best

You the one girl, you the one girl
Something bout them jeans that you wearing
Something bout them jeans that you wearing
Yeah you got that body of a goddess
You got no competition you got it
You make me wanna say oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
I got one in Miami, she mean with a mouth piece
She like LeBron, I’m taking my talents down the South Beach
Pineapple to chase it, go on girl just chase it
All we drink is my shit, coco loso wasted
Love that lil waist shit, damn them hips just sit out
Now I see who all these hating girls be talkin’ shit bout
From the front looking like she got some ass probably
They say that’s a sign girl: ass-trology
Tight denim with them little rips in ‘em
“Wait in line” jeans, take a minute to get in ‘em
BBD say you poison well I want some of that venom girl, girl

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
Ooooh, girl your ass is superthick
Lotta chicks off in this club and you the baddest in this bitch
Ooooh, look at what you wearing girl
The club owner should pay you whenever you make an appearance
And you got me hooked, I might try not to look but I keep staring
Come out to my city see, I run that bitch like errands oooh
Grown as hell I don’t care to choose
Who’s coming, you, her and you
Roll this up, after you hit this once, you’ll need a parachute
To tell the truth I’mma tear the roof
Out that muthafucker nail it too
Loud pipes, hear the coupe, vroom, got stripes like a general
You know I’m tryna get into you

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Roscoe Dash]
Now you the baddest that I’ve seen in the club all night
Girl, your booty had me stuck like a drug all night
Damn, girl I really wanna put it on you like a coaster
Love how you moving over there but I really want you closer
Let get drunk off this Moscato, do it like there’s no tomorrow
Wake up and if it’s up we’ll do it like theres no tomorrow
Jump on it, I want it, he on it, bone it
Whenever she want it
R-O-S-C-O-E Dash dismantling every component
Girl you the one, too bad I’m not a jumper?
She love the way the rapper tastes, too bad I’m not a sucker
She call me when she need it
And I’mma come running to feed that appetite I do it anyway she want

[Verse 1]
Here I lie
In a lost and lonely part of town
Held in time
In a world of tears I slowly drown
Goin' home
I just can't make it all alone
I really should be holding you
Holding you
Loving you, loving you

[Chorus]
Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're
Goin' nowhere
Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're
Goin' nowhere

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
Night and day
There's a burning down inside of me
Burning love
With a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go
And I just can't take it all alone
I really should be holding you
Holding you
Loving you, loving you

[Chorus]
Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're
Goin' nowhere
Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're
Goin' nowhere
Oooohh

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're
Goin' nowhere
Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and your heart just died
It's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're
Goin' nowhere
Aaahhhh

[Chorus]
Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're
Goin' nowhere
Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and your heart just died
It's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're
Goin' nowhere
Aaahhhh

[Outro]
Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're
Goin' nowhere
Tragedy

Shot gun when my bitch sit

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Verse 1: Eminem]
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
Had a dream, I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip "dick," you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause "cock" backwards is still "cock," you pricks!
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
‘Cause it wasn’t that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster ‘cause he couldn’t cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
‘Cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzzer
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it ‘cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What’s it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain’t
Some bullshit; people don’t usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage!
And let it be known from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, ‘cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, ‘cause I came with 5'9", but I feel like I’m 6'8"

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
By the time you hear this, I’ll prolly already be outtie
I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin’
Four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: "Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!"
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
‘Cause what goes up must come down
You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oow, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
‘Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On a radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, 'cause—

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Verse 1]
I know people that try, people that don't
People that fly through the air, just float like smoke
I know people that joke, know people that's rich, know people that's broke
Know people that love, people that hate
Some tell you that you good, some say you doin' great
Hey, I know people can't wait
They wanna hear every single thing I gotta say
Some people act cool, some act phony
People are your friends, but they never be your homies
I know people think they know me
Like there's a lame, untalented old me
Girls wanna own me, labels wanna clone me
Haters wanna choke me, stoners wanna smoke weed
People never gonna change
'Cause no two people are the same, hey

[Chorus]
We, we are just two people
What more can we do?
Give me one more day
I'ma spend it with you, with you

[Verse 2]
I can't complain that people know my name
And when I come back home, not a damn thing change
I bet people can't believe
Some after the money
Some want a degree
If you showin' love, then you cool with me
I'm the same old dude before the jewelry
And everything kinda new to me
Things ain't nothin' like they used to be
People thought I wouldn't
Some people probably thought I could
Some people think the boy turned to Hollywood
Livin' up, every day worthwhile
Dudes run away when they see the girl smile
I'm glad I get to call her mine
This the type of thing so hard to find
You can't tell a star to shine or a carpet fly
Shit's gonna happen, it's just all in time

[Chorus]
We, we are just two people
What more can we do?
Give me one more day
I'ma spend it with you, with you

[Bridge]
I'm dealin' with somebody, and I don’t know what to do
They may not understand you 'cause they see you on the move
Girl, this dinner's over, I'm tryna get you to my room
'Cause I've been goin' crazy, baby, you don't got a clue

[Chorus]
We, we are just two people
What more can we do?
Give me one more day
I'ma spend it with you, with you

[Intro]
J. Cole
Haha uh
Yeah, uh
Yeah, Yo
Bear with a nigga man
Gotta a little head cold, ya know?
I'll still kill it nigga
Show y'all niggas how it do
Real Quick

[Verse 1]
Uh You know what they say;
The window to the soul is in the eyes
So disrespect a nigga, I will close a nigga blinds
Yeah who can hold us? Super focused
Shoot them hoes with the Super Soakers
I got 'em so wet
Fuck that Moet, I'm Hennessy drinking
Wonder what my enemies' thinking
Nervous? nigga, please
I'm finna be caking with dough-
So much bread, its like a nigga be baking
Watch so cold, it's like the shit will need blankets
Money coming soon, tell my niggas be patient
We gonna replace those whips with some sicker ones
We gonna erase them chicks for some thicker ones
Hit and run, bigger funds
But still can't forget to pour liquor
As I reminisce on them niggas that couldn't come
Rest in peace, can't control another man's destiny
So I do what's best for me
I know you fake niggas well, ain't no test to me
On my plate is a meal, ain't no recipe for that
So nigga chill or the tec will speak, "Blaaat!"
Them niggas will put you chest to feet
I'm talking reckless
What you expect nigga, I'm flexing
Y'all dyslexic, got a nigga twisted
Never shot a nigga, I don't gotta get convicted
'Cause if I say the word, your whole squad is getting lifted
What up then? Niggas ain't saying nothing? Shut up then!
Wouldn't last a minute in the city I grew up in
Where I got my swag, cool as the breeze is
Chip on my shoulder, I walk like I'm Jesus
About that paper, we could give a fuck if you believe us
Looking for model divas that barely speak English
Fuck 'em while we rich, 'cause when we broke, they gonna leave us
We earn stripes, looking like zebras
Y'all looking like Adidas
We do it for the streets, cuz they need us
Got beef? Come meet us
Ok I thought so
Y'all niggas are so mad cuz I floss so bad on bitches
And with this stroke, I'm Picasso
Make her stomach feel the fossil
Now she yelling out God so much thought I had her singing gospel
Shit, shout out to my apostles
Ya know me
Nicest nigga in the south
Yea you can quote me!

[Outro]
Wooo Shit!
Haha
Ooooh Shit, mother fucker!
Hahaha
Oohh Shit
And I'm sick bitch, holla at me!
You know!
Fuck boy!!

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
The fans takin pictures of me
Can't keep these bitches off me
Police up and down the street
But I'm still spliffin homie
Breeze keep a Glicker on him; do a nigga wrong, boy
Niggas want my head now that my money gettin long boy
More than just a song boy
Thinkin I'm just rappin to you
Niggas keep they ratchet
This is real shit
That can happen to you
Come out here and ask em do you
Know about the nigga Wiz?
Ever heard of Rostrum Records?
Know who Kev the Hustla is?
Well bitch, act like ya know me
A young'n, bro
But my dough
Stack'd like I'm grown'n
I'm the black Steve Austin
I pull up and I stunna
And do just what I wanna
Drunk and full of marijuana
Your shine low
I'm somethin like a high beam
Gotta be as high as me
To see things how I see
I don't even drive no more
I let the Ho's ride me
After I see ID
Ain't gon Kelly rob me
I'm just bein honest
Bein modest
I done tried bein
But niggas hated so I throw it in they faces
Let em get outta line, we goin show em to they places
These shots ain't straight up, they come with a couple chasers
And the baddest hoes chase us
I'm runnin to the money
In the back
Dime bitch up in my lap
Gettin blunted
Ya dugg?

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
The work raw so I'm coppin now for old money
Hustlin since I was born and think you gettin old money
Look dummy, see I'm all
About a meal to gain
Young'n off the porch for that young money like Lil Wayne
And all this smoke got my eyes on Yao Ming
Street pharmaceutical, damn shoot it and shoulder lean
I'm only bout that green; weed, and currency
Ignorant flow, no I never
Show em courtesy
Cause I'm a star too, doin what the stars do, roll em back to back and then I climb to the stars woo!
Yeah you
Thought the boy was slippin but I wasn't
I connect like the movies get it cheaper by the dozen
Gotta freak with some cousins
They be always on call
Like the WNBS them ho's love balls
I got em trained like 1, 2 suck and blow
Ice box cold wrist, Wiz roll another 0!

[Intro]
This, this, this
Should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential

Life’s a bitch, life’s a bitch
But I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
My dick hard, her pussy wet

[Verse 1 - Kendrick Lamar]
And I’m born with my dick in the earth
You can tell me how much am I worth
I’mma die with my heart on my sleeve
Many die on their hands and their knees
And I’m takin’ whatever I need
And I’m raping the government fees
And you’re wasting your time
And I’m speaking my mind on whatever I think
And I think that I’m Richard Pryor
With priors of 32 fiends
And that means that I hear for higher
Tell me why are you starin’ at me?
Matta fact, man, your eyes is wired
You inspired by Kendrick the king
Maybe it’s ’cause I’m living my dream
Man, I sing what I’m living about
And the words that come out of my mouth
They requires a random routine
Of being organic granite
Then my access is granted
To represent the shit that I conceive
And I guarantee that I’mma bring
My mind, body, soul
And I sold all these records off bein’ myself
And I wish you can do the same thing, man
It’s easier than a stripper
Or tyin’ a baby shoestring, you stringing along
And really why you writing a song?
Your passion for music is never in sync
No secret societies guided me to the world of unseen
And they tell me life is a bitch, who gives a shit?
You'll get relief
I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
My dick hard, her pussy wet
I'mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)

(Hi, ho!) I came
(Bye, ho!) I went
(Hi, ho!) I came
(Bye, ho!) I went
(Hi, ho!) I came
(Bye, ho!) I went
(Bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch)

[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar]
And I see that you envy of me
Enemigos don’t prosper
Better yet, they do die eventually
If I’m at the event you will leave
‘Cause you know and I know that
I go ham even if Muslims is seen
In my rearview I’m near you
But I don’t hear you, can you at least breathe?
With an oxygen mask, and
The masses keep saying I’m speaking for them
And if you can imagine my madness
Then you can see where I’ve been
And the places the Louis has been
And I swear I been doing this when
You was in pajamas, watching B-Barney and Friends
And you couldn’t harm me even with ten
Weapons of your choice riding in
Army tanks, you shot blanks
And I shot back, make your duplex bend
What the fuck you think? If I don’t think
Then I’m right back where the city sin
What the fuck you drink?
Thinking I can’t write these raps in the Lions’ Den
When I hear that you lyin’, then?
It’s murder she wrote, ain’t no hope
You go downhill, man, where’s your slope?
Get thrown downhill tied to a rope
Tell the world to put intervals
Man, I swear this the anecdote
And they tell me that life is a bitch
Who gives a shit when you know?

[Hook]

And I see that you envy of me
Don’t prosper, better yet, they do die eventually
Cause you know and I know that I go ham even if Muslims is seen
In my rearview I’m near you
But I don't hear you, can you at least breathe?

(Hi, ho!)
(Bye, ho!)

[Verse 1:]
Now I've done had lots of relationships
Ain't none of them ever added up to shit
My folks they always told me what you wish
Be careful cause that one thing you could get
So I prayed to the Lord to send me love
Send me something like an angel from up above
But instead I got a chick who played on my heart
She had me feeling good then tore me apart

[Hook:]
Love ain't supposed to feel this way
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain
Love ain't supposed to make me cry
But now I'm trying to wipe my eyes
Love ain't supposed to feel this way
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain
Love ain't supposed to make me cry
But now I'm trying to wipe my eyes

[Verse 2:]
She was like the devil in disguise
Spending time with me and thinking of other guys
And even though I tried my best
I can't describe the way she made me feel
All over a girl, who never gave her all
Never gave me much, when it came to love
I dont know why I spent so much time
On a love that wasn't mine
And the pain is so unkind

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Now it ain't even worth my time
Love ain't supposed to feel like I'm losing my mind
I once was blind but now I see
The girl was playing games she ain't the one for me
I'm trying to told ya
If you find a love, just dont close your eyes, you might go blind
Got to keep it smart, give it all your heart, if you fall to far in love you'll find the hard way

[Hook]

[Hook x2]
Benzo, batman, thick ho, lap dance
Ass so fat need a lap dance
Ass so fat I need a lap dance

[Tyga - Verse 1]
She a straight killer, Max Payne, Travis Porter, make it rain
Young Money gang, put you on the team
All my bitches fly, put you on a plane
Hundreds in your face, why you broke boy?
Not from Chi City but I make the Illinois
Let your pride gone walk it out
In the bank and I’m only cashing large amounts

One, two, bitch what it do?
Three, four, drop it to the floor
Five, six, rub on her tits
Seven, eight, make that ass shake uhh!

[Hook]

[Tyga - Verse 2]
It’s raining ass and titties, yeah, ass and titties
If you ain’t throwing money, mind your fucking business
Floss like a dentist, Dennis the menace
Room of crazy niggas, probably get a life sentence
Sharper than a tac, attack and bite you bitches
Swagga jack and biting on like you niggas
Like conscious rappers, mad cause we winning
Snug long nose call it Scottie Pippen
Ahh, got like 200k large, in the back seat of my car
Like Cialis I go hard, motherfucker

One, two, bitch what it do?
Three, four, drop it to the floor
Five, six, rub on her tits
Seven, eight, make that ass shake

[Hook]

Make it, make it, make it clap
Make it, make it, make it clap
Make it, make it, make it clap
Make it, make it, make it clap

One, two, bitch what it do?
Three, four, drop it to the floor
Five, six, rub on her tits
Seven, eight, make that ass shake uhh!

[Hook]

[Intro]
“Loud noises!”

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Life handed me lemons, I jumped back in the public eye
And squirted lemon juice in it, by now, you just wish I’d fuckin’ die
But I electrify, get electrocuted, executed by the execution
Of my flow, too quick for the human eye to detect zoomin’ by
Choom chigga choom choom choom choom waa
Yep, yep—guess who, what’s happenin’, guy?
They told me to shit, I fell off that pot
Hopped right back on that crapper and I
Said, “Fuck it,” with a capital I, look who’s back to antag-g-onize
You don’t like it? You can eat shit, fuck off, little faggot, and die
You right back like a magnet on my dick grabbin’ at my
Shit, better get to the back of the line
If you wanna get your shot at me, what kinda crap is that battle?
What kind of rapper would I be
'Fore I let another rapper think he’s hot?
I'll bury my face in his stinky twat and go... (Licking noises)
Girl, my head space is limited
Ain’t even room in the back of my mind
That’s why I ain’t thinking about you, I don’t got time
I done told you a thousand times
So how can I find the time to put
An alkaline battery in Royce’s back
And at the same time put juice in mine?
Goddammit, Slaughterhouse is signed!

[Refrain: Crooked I]
Slaughterhouse!

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
I’m a menace villain, my pen is sick and spillin’, my lyrics killin’
Then I let you witness shit when it hit the ceilin’
A nigga’s willin’ to give the listeners the sickest feelin’
Like mixin’ some Benadryl and penicillin, then I’m fillin’ the clip
With a written (Pow!), can you picture my pistol drillin’?
A million women and children when I’m illin’ but it isn’t real
It’s a rap, on the real, it’s a wrap, how could you possibly
Stop the Apocalypse when I’m atomic bombin’ the populace?
Shock the metropolis, hostile as a kid
Poppin’ the Glock at his mom’s and his pop’s
Then he hops in his drop with his iPod
Rockin’ his slaughter-ish documentation of lyrics
I write with confidence, write like a columnist-slash-novelist
I’m in this game to demolish it
Establish my dominance over prominent rappers
You poppin’ shit ’til ya opposite, I can spit ominous so spit politics
Now I’m Haile Selassie, Gandhi and Pac
Of this hip hop genre, bitch!

[Refrain: Crooked I]
Slaughterhouse!

[Verse 3: Royce da 5’9”]
Lyrically, I’m a cocaine Altoid (Dope)
Ability so brain, it’s a no brain bow, boy (Fresh)
Physically, I’m literally a cocaine cowboy
Wait-wait, did I just go almost four bars
Without talking about my big dick?
The other day me and your thick bitch
Had a great date and we ate cake
And then we walked and then she tried to jack me off but she lost
’Cause she couldn’t handle my Shake Weight
I swear, the irony of Ryan is I am bipolar while I’m rhyming
Standing beside a big ol’, (Big ol’) white bear
Neither one of us fight fair
You are literally looking at Woody and Wesley
In a movie where the white boy ain’t got to jump
Nowhere ’cause I’m here
Nigga I’m on fire, yeah and I’m every bitch’s dream
One, two I’m coming for you, I’m a big ol’, (Big ol’) nightmare
Nigga, this the slaughter, step it up
I’ll pretty much slap your ass and tell you to shut the fuck up

After that, I’ll slap your ass again
And tell you to shut the fuck up shutting up
And that’s how you body a fucking beat (Goodbye)

[Refrain: Crooked I]
Slaughterhouse!

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Uh, I should be the one that goes slow
Nah, get a stopwatch, clock my flow, hit the button on top
Watch your jaw drop, oh-oh, dot-dot, oh, Yaowa
When I drop, I go outer space
Blackout like Darth Vader’s face placed in a molten shower
Say something and get done proper
Mama, Poppa pouring out vodka, mama mia
Em, pass me the scissors
There’s visitors in the Slaughterhouse casa
Better jet, boy, go home, better jet, boy, G4 Chrome
Better jet, boy, Mark Sanchez, Santonio Holmes
I’m not your any old homeboy
Sitting in the lab picking up a pad, I be spitting bad
I’mma get you mad with this gift I have
Little ducks sufferin’ succotash when the trigger blast
I’ma put your beak on your fitted hat
Where the liquor at? Sip a yac bad bitch and a vicious track
I relididax slide Pro-Dools to both
So smooth I coast to the West like where Crooked living at?
New York, here’s a piggy back ride
To the motherland, hold on, brother man
On the other hand, get down, I’m gutter, fam
Gun butt you with the Eagle handle Cunningham
I don’t wanna talk, I just wanna beef, I don’t want a piece
I want it all, baby boy, I don’t wanna eat, I wanna feast
Stuff my cheeks with rough beats and shit
You done, weak, I’m the one, capisce?

[Refrain: Crooked I]
Slaughterhouse!

[Verse 5: Joe Budden]
Uh, insane what they call us, how you married to the game
But you probably shouldn’t have came to the altar
Every bar like propane for the sawed-off
You shoulda hang and they’ll fault ya
Eminem, Mr. Porter, slaughter my sentiments, eminent torture
All of you feminine marauders
They’re swimming that water, men will assault ya
Tommy’s and bats to resemble Lasorda
Kidnap your trembling daughter
At least a quarter, I’m a menacing supporter
It’s got an aura more like Sodom and Gomorrah
Normally, something’s wrong with me
Blame it on quantity of the porn I see on the pawns to me
When I fix the game, y’all think shit came with a warranty
How the fuck are they gonna stop what I was born to be?
Corner me, shit belong to me
Two choices, you can get along with me
Or sit your faggot ass right there in dormancy
Wait, all he missing is heels to be RuPaul
Ain’t nobody that’s real ever knew y’all
And I’m second to none and I’m dealing with bums
Whose time'll never come, now deal with the blue balls
You ain’t gotta fear me but you respect me
Niggas who never met me threaten me, want to Gillette me
Comin’ to a sword fight against a machete
Swinging sp
