dy know
I'll fix your plumbing when your toilets overflow
I'm so handy, I'll bring you up to code
When your dishwasher's about to explode

[Verse 2]
Now you say that your furnace is needing some service
I'm fully bonded, no need to be nervous
Perhaps you would like a new counter Formica
Maybe I'll hook up this here combo washer-dryer
But all your pipes are antique
Your water pressure's too weak
You got an attic full of dry rot
Because your roof sprung a leak
Your fridge is starting to reek
Your hardwood floors really squeak
But don't you worry I'll just show you my amazing technique
Now let me glue that, glue that and screw that, screw that
Any random chore you got, well I can do that, do that
Or maybe I'll just rewire your house for fun
I got 99 problems but a switch ain't one

[Chorus]
I'm so handy, everyone said so
I'll grout your bathroom, resurface your patio
I'm so handy, I'm the guy to know
When your leaf blower doesn't blow-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Patch the drywall, clean your gutters and mow the lawn
Make that phone call, I'll install anything you want
Yeah, check my big staple gun, my socket wrenches are second to none
I won't quit 'til I'm done, don't even care if I hammer my thumb (OW!)

[Verse 3]
Still rocking my screwdriver
Got the whole world thinking I'm MacGyver
Your heating bills are shocking
I can solve that with some duct tape and some caulking
Your house is a disaster, huh?
Need a guy who's a master with the plaster, huh?
Let me be your stripper
Taking off lacquer, no one does it quicker

[Chorus]
I'm so handy, you already know
I'll beat all price quotes, my hourly rates are low
I'm so handy, you should call this pro
I'm in the phone book and se habla español

[Part 1 - "Wrecking Ball" by Miley Cyrus]
We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me

[Part 2 -"Pumped Up Kicks" by Foster the People]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet

[Part 3 - "Best Song Ever" by One Direction]
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
I think it went ooh eh ooh
I think it went oohla eh ooh
I think it goes eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

[Part 4 - "Gangnam Style" by PSY]
Eh, sexy lady
Po, po, po, po
Polka Gangnam Style
Eh, sexy lady
Po, po, po, po
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

[Part 5 - "Call Me Maybe" by Carly Rae Jepsen]
Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe
And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe

[Part 6 - "Scream & Shout" by will.i.am]
I wanna scream and shout (hey!)
And let it all out
And scream and shout (hey!)
And let it out
We sayin', "Ohh, wee ohh, wee oh wee oh"
We sayin', "Ohh, wee ohh, wee oh wee oh wee ohh, wee oh wee oh”

[Part 7 - "Somebody That I Used to Know" by Gotye]
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Part 8 - "Timber" by Pitbull]
It's going down (hey!), I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget
(Timber! Timber!)

[Part 9 - "Sexy and I Know It" by LMFAO]
I’m sexy and I know it
Girl look at that body
(He’s sexy and he knows it)

[Part 10 - "Thrift Shop" by Macklemore]
I wear your grandad’s clothes
I look incredible
I’m in this big old coat
From that thrift shop down the road
(He’s wears your grandad’s clothes) That’s right!
(He looks incredible) I do!
(He’s in that big old coat) It’s large! Hey, lets go!
(From that thrift shop down the road)
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm hunting, looking for a come-up
This is super awesome

[Part 11 - "Get Lucky" by Daft Punk]
She's up all night til the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
Up all night to get lucky
Yes, we’re up all night to get
Can get lucky, we’re gonna get lucky, let’s all get lucky
We’re up all night to get lucky! (Hey!)

[Verse 1]
I'm waking up, in Cheeto dust
My belly's covered with pizza crust
I'm using my inhaler now (Wheezes)
I'm out of shape, fattening up
I'm sipping Coke from a Solo Cup
Donut crumbs are upon my lips, whoa

[Chorus]
The TV's on, I really hate this show
I can't reach my remote control
Welcome to my new place, to my new place
Sorry it's a cramped space, but it's my place
Whoa oh, whoa I'm, really inactive, I'm so inactive
Whoa oh, whoa I'm, really inactive, highly inactive

[Verse 2]
My muscle's gone, I'm atrophied
Always lose my fight with gravity
I rest my bones, and just chillax, whoa
My NordicTrack's collecting dust
And my StairMaster's a pile of rust
This is it, The Inertia

[Chorus]
I can't get up, this couch is part of me
I'm growing cobwebs on my knee
Pretty sad for my age, sad for my age
I could break my rib cage, here is my age
Whoa oh, whoa I'm, really inactive, yes, quite inactive
Whoa oh, whoa I'm, really inactive, not very active

[Bridge]
Near comatose, no exercise
Don't tag my toe, I'm still alive

[Chorus]
I'm giving up, my energy is shot
I'm never moving from this spot
Never move from this place, move from this place
I'll stay here in this place, right in this place
Whoa oh, whoa I'm, really inactive, just so inactive
Whoa oh, whoa I'm, really inactive, not so attractive

[Verse 1]
It might seem crazy, wearing stripes with plaid
I Instagram every meal I've had
All my used liquor bottles are on display
We can go to see a show, but I'll make you pay

[Chorus]
(Because I'm tacky)
Wear my belt with suspenders and sandals with my socks
(Because I'm tacky)
Got some new glitter Uggs and lovely pink sequined Crocs
(Because I'm tacky)
Never let you forget some favor I did for you
(Because I'm tacky)
If you're okay with that, you might just be tacky, too

[Verse 2]
I meet some chick, ask her this and that (Yeah)
Like, "Are you pregnant, girl, or just really fat?" (What?) (Yeah)
Well, now I'm dropping names almost constantly (Yeah)
That's what Kanye West keeps telling me, here's why

[Chorus]
(Because I'm tacky)
Wear my Ed Hardy shirt with fluorescent orange pants
(Because I'm tacky)
Got my new resume—it's printed in Comic Sans
(Because I'm tacky)
Think it's fun threatening waiters with a bad Yelp review
(Because I'm tacky)
If you think that's just fine, then you're probably tacky, too
Hey, come on, ah

[Bridge]
Bring me shame, can't nothing (Tacky)
Bring me shame, can never know why (Tacky)
Bring me shame, can't nothing (Tacky)
Bring me shame, I said (Tacky)
Bring me shame, can't nothing (Tacky)
Bring me shame, it's pointless to try (Tacky)
Bring me shame, can't nothing (Tacky)
Bring me shame, I said (Tacky)

[Chorus]
(Because I'm tacky)
43 bumper stickers and a "YOLO" license plate
(Because I'm tacky)
Bring along my coupon book whenever I'm on a date
(Because I'm tacky)
Practice my twerking moves in line at the DMV
(Because I'm tacky)
Took the whole bowl of restaurant mints, hey, it said they're free
(Because I'm tacky)
I get drunk at the bank and take off my shirt, at least
(Because I'm tacky)
I would live-tweet a funeral, take selfies with the deceased
(Because I'm tacky)
If I'm bitten by a zombie, I'm probably not telling you
(Because I'm tacky)
If you don't think that's bad, guess what, then you're tacky, too

[Outro]
Hey, come on!

[Verse 1]
One time I was in the checkout line
Behind Steven Seagal
Once I'm pretty sure Mr. Jonah Hill
Was in the very next bathroom stall
My best friend's brother
Well, he was an extra in Wayne's World 2
My neighbor's babysitter
Dated three of the guys in Motley Crüe
I swear Jack Nicholson
Looked right at me at a Lakers game

[Hook]
I got a lame
Lame claim to fame
Ooh wee!

[Verse 2]
Check it out
I bought a secondhand toaster
From a guy who says he knows Brad Pitt
I got me an e-mail from the prince of Nigeria
Well, he sure sounded legit
My sister used to take piano lessons
From the second cousin of Ralph Nader
Last year I threw up in an elevator
Next to Christian Slater
Well, guess what? My birthday and Kim Kardashian's
Are exactly the same

[Hook]
I got a lame
Lame claim to fame
A really lame
Lame claim to fame

[Bridge]
Once at a party, my dentist accidentally sneezed on Russell Crowe
I posted "First!" in the comments on a YouTube video
I tried to sit by Steve Buscemi, but he told me "This seat's taken"
I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy
Who knows a guy who knows Kevin Bacon
Ooh wee!

[Verse 3]
I had a car that used to belong
To Cuba Gooding Jr.'s uncle
A friend of mine in high school
Had jury duty with Art Garfunkel
One time I was staying in the same hotel
As Zooey Deschanel
I used the same napkin dispenser as Steve Carell
At a Taco Bell
Well, I don't mean to brag but Paul Giamatti's plumber knows me by name

[Hook]
I got a lame
Lame claim to fame
A really lame
Lame claim to fame
That's right, I'm talkin' lame
Lame claim to fame
A really, really, really lame
Lame claim to fame
Ow, let's get lame, boys!

[Verse 1]
Your sports team is vastly inferior
That simple fact is plainly obvious to see
We’re gonna kick your collective posterior
Of course you realize we’re speaking figuratively
Our stats are thoroughly impressive
Our coach really has the Midas touch
Our players are fast and strong and brave
And your guys, eh, not so much

[Verse 2]
In fact we’ve played teams across the nation
And you’re the worst one we’ve come across
Try to assimilate that information
And it just might help you cope with your impending loss
Oh, and if somehow we are still failing
To effectively articulate the points at hand
Allow us now to summarize them in a manner
That your feeble brains can understand

We’re great (We’re great)
And you suck (You suck)
We’re great (We’re great)
And you suck (You suck)
We’re great (We’re great)
And you suck (You suck)
You see there’s us (We’re great)
And then there’s you (You suck)
We’re really, really great (Really great)
In contrast, you really suck (Really suck)
Okay, full disclosure, we’re not that great
But nevertheless, you suck

[Verse 3]
Your sports team will soon suffer swift defeat
That theory’s backed by empirical evidence
We’re gonna grind up your guys into burger meat
Again, of course, we’re speaking in the figurative sense
What’s the use of even going through the motions
When you know that you’re gonna lose anyhow
So why don’t you save us all some time
And give up now (You suck!)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Dirty money new work
Smell it on my new shirt
Lying make these niggas feel good but truth hurt
Dirty money new work
Smell it on my new shirt
Lying make these niggas feel good but truth hurt
Dirty money new work
Smell it on my new shirt
Lying make these niggas feel good but truth hurt
A lot of niggas do dirt, get it in return
But enough of dirt doing have you sitting with the worms
Bloods dripping tissue burn
Bullets rip your soul up
Hollow tips fucking up your head like a bowl cut
When my niggas roll up they be like hold up
But I be like fuck that cause I do enough rap
Rather make them pussies bow down like a touchback
I ain't with the talking tell 'em spark 'em like a blunt wrap
Twist them like a Backwood, black laid black hood
Dicked down ski'd up
Hoes down G's up
I couldn't get no Gucci, but I could get an Oozie
Spray up your hood and hit your neighbors just for being nosy
Truthfully, I don't be up on that gun shit
I be on some Puerto Rico chilling with a young bitch
You niggas on that dumb shit, bum shit
My niggas got them birds and come and get a drumstick
I am cooked crack to the oiles
All this rapping got me shining like aluminum foil
These niggas ain't loyal
Money, envy, and greed will destroy you
All over a dollar sign
Meek Milly I am Columbine
And I'm hotter than you niggas like a thousand times

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'm killing 'em, call a coroner
Look at my pockets bitch, check out the Audemar
Perfect timing, I'm shining
Like a diamond, but nevermind it
I'm killing 'em, I'm killing 'em
I'm killing 'em, call a coroner
I'm killing 'em, I'm killing 'em
I'm killing 'em, call a coroner

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
These niggas saying "Doodoo" see me scream uh-oh
I'm bout with uh-oh what the fuck is up cuzo
My dogs off the muzzle
My president is black
The Lac, mac, and everything is black
I'm back for the stacks ho nigga call a coroner
On the e way I got the body in the 

[?]
My niggas is riders, we the frequent flyers
Why you think the cars ain't got no mahfucking mileage
Shake down violent, serve it to them raw
Like I took off the Trojan middle finger to the law
Ya I'm killing them set it off stealing them
Run up on them strapped with the goons Meek Mill and them
If it pop off in the club my niggas started it
Crime rate go up my stacks be a part of it
I'm a rock star you can call me Sonny Bono
I'm a cowboy you can call me Tony Romo

[Hook]
I'm killing 'em, call a coroner
Look at my pockets bitch, check out the Audemar
Perfect timing, I'm shining
Like a diamond, but nevermind it
I'm killing 'em, I'm killing 'em
I'm killing 'em, call a coroner
I'm killing 'em, I'm killing 'em
I'm killing 'em, call a coroner

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Green light, red light
Shining like a headlight
Shwaty got her head right
I be there every night
But fuck that, I be stuck in the trap like I'm a dead mice
Watching for them fed lights, trying to get my bread right
I'm like "Stroke em'" if you know me
Grey and black spur on dubs call it Ginobili
You niggas like 40, can't stick me to hold me
I'll kill you if you think about telling like Boldy
Cause all that snitching shit we don't play that
That K will spin a nigga wheel Pat Sajak
Abandoned houses, where the tape at
Poolstick all in his ass tell him take that
I need a Maybach better yet a Phantom
If you killing these niggas out there this the anthem
I ain't a pretty nigga, I ain't handsome
I'm just grimy, with a mac 90
I'm from north side but south side where you find me
In the trenches where ninety percent of niggas grimy
And they dirty, clips whole thirty
On the block with that Yao Ming, you heard me
My north niggas they'll kill you for a point
They kidnap your mom and rape your sister for a joint
Shot your daddy in the head
All over that money they'll carry you to bed, yea

[Hook]
I'm killing 'em, call a coroner
Look at my pockets bitch, check out the Audemar
Perfect timing, I'm shining
Like a diamond, but nevermind it
I'm killing 'em, I'm killing 'em
I'm killing 'em, call a coroner
I'm killing 'em, I'm killing 'em
I'm killing 'em, call a coroner

[Intro: DJ Drama]
Matter fact let me say it one more time
And like that we gone
No really, like we really gone
Like gone like we too high for your niggas

[Verse 1: Young Steff]
I'm fresh, step up in the spot no jewels v-neck

I worked that's just how I got here
I'm a young boss I worked for this spot here
But enough of that stuff, girl let's crank this bitch up

[Hook: Young Steff]

He said he balling I could put you on another team
Make you my star player (and we taking off later)

[Hook]

Let's jump into it
We ain't gon' do no more talking
Cause they can't wait

[Verse 1]
Tuesday morning, 8:15
I was riding to work on the
Jackson Park Express
Seemed like any other day
Then my whole world changed
In a way I never could have guessed
Cause she walked in
Took the seat right across the aisle
I knew we had a special connection
The second I saw her smile

She smiled as if to say
"Hello, Haven't seen you on this bus before"
I gave her a look that said
"Huh, Life is funny, you never know what's in store
By the way, your hair is beautiful
I bet it smells like raisins"

She looked at me in a way that asked
"Did you have a nose job or something?
I'm only asking, cause your nose looks slightly better
Than the rest of your face"
I arched my eyebrow, ever so slightly
Which was my way of asking
"Do you want my old Hewlett-Packard printer?
It still works, Kinda
And I got a bunch of ink cartridges left"
Then, she let out a long sigh
Which, I took to mean, "Uh
Mama, What is that deodorant you're wearing?
It's intoxicating
Why don't we drive out to the country sometime?
And collect deer ticks in a zip-lock baggie", Oh yeah

I gave her a penetrating stare
Which could only mean
"You are my answer, my answer to everything
Which is why, I'll probably do very poorly
On the written part of my driver's test"

[Chorus]
Yes, It all happened
On the Jackson Park Express
On the Jackson Park Express
On the Jackson Park Express
On the Jackson Park Express

[Verse 2]
I knew she was starting to fall for me
Cause she crinkled her nose, which unmistakably meant
"Baby, lets wear each other's clothes
And speak in a thick German accent
And, maybe someday we can own and operate
Our own mobile pet-grooming service"
I couldn't hold back my feelings
I gave her a look, that said
"I would make any sacrifice for your love
Goat, chicken, whatever
I could never hold you close enough
Let's have our bodies surgically grafted together
Oh, surgically grafted together"
She picked up her newspaper, and started reading to herself
Which I'm sure, was a way of telling me
"When you're cold, I will warm you
When you're shivering, I will hold you
When you're nauseous, I will give you Pepto-Bismol every hour
For as long as the symptoms persist
Oh, I, I never, ever want to see you cry
So, please let me cauterize your tear ducts with an arc welder"
Then, I glanced down, at her shirt, for a second
In a way that clearly implied
"I like your boobs"

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I cleared my throat quietly, and then, I looked away
And I'm sure it was obvious to her, just what I was trying to say
I was trying to say, "Hey
I'd like to make a wall-sized mural out of all the dead skin cells
That you slough off while you sleep at night"
Whoa-o-Oh, "I'd like to rip you wide open
And french-kiss every single one of your internal organs
Oh, I'd like to remove all your skin, and wear your skin, over my own skin
But not in a creepy way"

Then, I'm pretty sure, she looked at me, out of the corner of her good eye
And, though, she never spoke a word, this is exactly what I heard
She was saying, "Oh!
I wanna make out with you, in an abandoned toll-booth, in the middle of a monsoon
I wanna ride dolphins with you, in the moonlight
Until the staff at Sea World kicks us out
I want you inside me, oh, like a tapeworm"
I pointed to the side of my mouth, as a way of indicating
"Hey, I think you got something on the side of your mouth"
She licked the corner of her lips, as if to say
"Here?", I nodded, implying, "Yeah, you got it"

And, then the bus stopped, at 53rd Street, and she got up suddenly
"Where are you going?", pleaded my eyes, "Baby, don't you do this to me
Think of the beautiful children we could have someday
We could school them at home, Raise them up the right way
And protect them from the evils of the world
Like Trigonometry and Prime Numbers, oh no
Baby, please don't go"

She brushed my leg, as she left the bus
I'm sure that was her way of saying
"I'm sorry this just isn't working out
You're suffocating me
I need some space to find out what life's all about
So, goodbye forever, my love"

And deep inside, I knew she was right
It was time for us both to move on
And though, I never got her number, oh no no
She never bothered to leave her address, oh
But, as long as I live, I'll never forget
Those precious moments we shared together

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt (Sly Tendencies)]
Okay, let's be honest, truthfully
At the rate I'm moving you gone' have to get used to me
The sauce is the weakest, tang in my three-step
Often rejected cause I reject the reject
Garage Band flow needs no reason
And ya'll niggas taste less beef, no seasonin'
See foods eatin' them, proceed to the exit
Ends with an L-Y starts with an S, yes
Him without a win is Clark Kent without a cleft chin
Superman reference (Ahaha) keep steppin'
Yeah, I go harder than standardized testin'
Bars on lock my development's arrested
I'm the bestest, on a bad day I spit asbestos
Yeah it’s impressive ya’ll steady coming in second
Fuck V-necks, I'm the rapper to invest in
My flow ends recessions fresh as Crest breath is

[Interlude: Earl Sweatshirt (Sly Tendencies)]
Yeah, vibe with it
Uh, yeah (it feels good)
Gimme some time, gimme some time
Uh, yeah, verse 2
Here we go, here we go
Yeah, uh

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt (Sly Tendencies)]
The revolution, I am Sly: kid ruthless
The booth's no spoofing, I spit it like I'm toothless
Food for the youth while the rest stay fruit
When lies become truth I drop shit like pollution
Stop the fools quick, no problem no solution
Ya' crew could sleep in the freezer an' still wouldn't be cool kids
Cruisin' in the music with the attitude of two kids
Hammerin' these babblin' niggas, respect my two cents
I could give two shits, let alone a dollar
My flows make bros go: "Whoa! Ho, say holla!"
Whack niggas say na'da, the best I'm a synonym
Still my pockets slim like the Olsen Twins
An' I'm mister quick, digits, and Miss dis-mis
And I'm quickenin' my sentences, Oliver Twist
Like Charles Dickens, Death Wishin' competition
But listen, the plot thickens, I'm a stand up guy
Well hell why am I sittin'?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Baby dope

[Hook]
They told me that 26's couldn't fit on it
Smoking Oreo cookie in the Cockpit
50 thousand dollars cause it got a body kit
Big chip shawty charger with the big lip
Remember they said 26's couldn't  fit on it
So I went & spent another 150 on it
Dont pull that bullshit up to mine because ill shit on it
People starting to be like how you get them 6's on it

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
That bitch is so fucking high they think I got switches on it
But only thing that Ima do is try to switch opponents
They say I spent 150 out for the moment
If I was you man tell the truth man I wouldn't run up on me
I'm swerving out I hit the gas that fucker catching up
I'm mounted up but catching rubber man Im smashing gas
200 pounds of sway so Im gone have to do the dash
And my main bitch so fucking bad I didn't even mean to brag

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I swear they don't want me to succeed
But I'm not letting them leave until I stop em from breathing

Don't let 'em get you down
Man, it will make a nigga really wanna act up
Cause I'm a do what I'm a do, in my new Cadillac truck
What about you? But I ain't fucking 'round
Don't let 'em get you down

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got killers on my payroll, moving when I say so
These hoes don't really love me, they just love I got a bank roll
My plug he just keep sending blow
He ain't never said no
He mixing on the hat they broke
And I can't understand folk
I'm talkin to you, pussy ass nigga – you'd better listen
Stepped, is that so hard? With that pistol he paid attention
Jump out with them K's, start hittin' cause they were snitchin
Tell the ambulance hey no need to rush cause shorty twistin'

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I swear they don't want me to succeed
But I'm not letting them leave until I stop em from breathing

Cause I'm a do what I'm a do, in my new Cadillac truck

How I came and took the game for the past seven summers
Now yo' woman wanna get it from the front (From the front), from the back (From the back)
And if she with it I'ma hit it from the side
Give her what she want (What she want), in the 'Lac (in the 'Lac)
She a freak and I can see it in her eyes
She can go tit (Go tit), for tat (For tat), it's so good that I made her wanna cry
A little bit of this (Little this), a little that for a two piece biscuit and some fries
Straight from Church's, ya boyfriend's worthless
'Cause Luda' go deep while he barely scratch the surface
She itching for a scratch like she DJ JC
If you looking for ya match, bitch, come and find me
I be in the A town, I ain't that hard to find
Put ya legs up in the air and see the DTP sign
If ya wanna meet my mama, that's a thing I won't do
You say muthafuck me, nah, muthafuck you, kno' why?

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
She's a very freaky girl (Yeah)
Don't bring her to mama (Yeah)
First you get her name (Yeah)
Then you get her number

I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots

[Verse 1]
I pull up in that Spyder, strapped up like McGyver
Should have brought my Phantom, na, but I'm mad at my driver
He so fuckin' turned up, ridin' on auto pilot, smokin' kush and smilin'
He drinkin' while he drivin'
Gucci please excuse me, hu, all my goons got jewelry on 'em
All my niggas booked up, paper they get it on their own
I don't think you know me, homie, I suggest you leave me alone
I got so much jewelry on, that I think I need a clone
I pull up to the traffic light, icy as a blood light
Shinin' like a flash light, I might damage ya eye sight
Gucci got that real ice, don't it look real nice
I don't want your girlfriend, homie but my bitch might

[Hook 2x]
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots

[Verse 2]
Shops at the Chanel shop, that's how she shop
500 for the flip flops cause they ain't Reebok
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots
Gotta spot in the hood, no sofa just pot
I'm hot, so hot stand next, get shocked
I got Caucasian neighbors that's just how I rock
If you talkin' to me, all the questions that I wanna know
If she ain't got no money, know you gotta have some dough
Then she ask me for a drank so I bought a bottle
She was flexin' really hard, now she flexin' harder
You a benchwarmer bitch, I only fuck with starters
So if you ain't a dime piece, ain't no need to bother

[Hook 2x]

I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots

[Verse 3]
I want the money, I smell like a pocket full of hundreds
A whole bag full of kush, I been buckin' since a youngin'
I know you need a man right now because you strugglin'
So if he isn't helpin' then there's no need for discussion
In Houston Texas I can spend fifty thousand on a Monday
I got fifty woman with me, fifty more that ain't comin'
My pocket do the conversation, make all the decisions
I only fuck with bad bitches cause I'm very picky
He can't buy a drink so he don't deserve ya digits
I'm polar bear laflare, wrist and ear is very frigid
My charm big as a midget, I give yo' ass the business
So if you got yo' swag right you know that you can get it

[Hook 2x]
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots

[Verse 1]
I am bossin', proceed with caution cause I be flossin'
I didn't do that feature with you cause you not important
Major corporation, I am the most wanted person
While you niggas getting extorted, I ride by fast put on the gas
Don't make me li-zate, these brizacks stashed in my jizeans look likes some thighpads
It's funny, just like a dummy without no eyelash
I have yo car, I fuck with his O's, fuck with my kizad
Run up on me son, you'll run up on the wrong one
Keep a shooter with a gun to empty the whole drum
My niggas rushing at you like a cornerback blitz, bitch
Nigga that's what you get for talking at that shit, Gucci

[Hook]
Well, Gucci like to drank, Gucci like to smoke
Well Gucci on the rise while you niggas going broke, (3x)

Well Gucci Mane's a G, tell me something I don't know

[Verse 2]
Word to the wise, Gucci Mane's a wise guy, to all those who despise
Shoot you 25 times, my session yesterday recorded 25 lines
Haters fuck with other niggas shit but they don't fuck with mine
You a lie, low down, freakin' lie, that is not the truth
Boy you know I keep it trill and real in and out the booth
On that Goose and Cranberry Juice, droptop that Cranberry Coupe'
Gucci is alotta things but fasho' I'm not scared of you
Swaggerific, catastrophic, tatted down, them niggas get it
But stop with all of that bullshitin', you know you ain't fucking with me
Deeper than just rappin', yo bitch diggin' me, she bought a shovel
Yo boyfriends the basement, I'm the roof we on two different levels

[Hook]

[Ouro]
Holiday Season!

[I-20]
All black gloves, black mask, here we go again
The traps goin' slow, so I'm kickin' niggas doors again
Them pussy niggas soft, so the dealers goin' hard for it
I'm off in the truck, call up Buck, he got the hard for it
I got scopes on the AR, make it easy to just pop at you
The first talkin' dope boy, then we hit to rob at you
Won't hesitate to pull it out, empty out a clip
Heard your partner got the cannons, so I'm tryin' to hit a lick
I ain't got to contemplate it, see I'm down to demonstrate it
I'm a DTP nigga, G-Unit affiliated
Got a clique full of street niggas, ready for the shit
And a crib full of thick hoes, down for the joint
Tell them pretty niggas, here we come
Lay it down, G it up
Extra clips, extra round, pick a clown, hit 'em Buck
Hit 'em with that semi, or bust with that revolver
How the hell you robbers, gonna rob a robber?

[Hook]
How the hell you robbers gonna rob a robber?

[Young Buck]
Snatch niggas out their Chevies in traffic, I'm a savage
The devil made me do it nigga, I gotta have it
I'm hoppin' out this Escalade, chopper in my hand
I catch the ones that I can, and start poppin' at they man
They say the hood wanna kill me, the police want me locked up
So I just take their jewelry, every time I pop up
My album went platinum, and yeah, the nigga still jackin'
I ain't lyin' or actin', it's just that I love it with a passion
You should these niggas faces with the .40's on they shorties
Have they ass breakin' up like this dope game ain't for me (oh)
So, come on pussy nigga, bring it if you that hard
And watch when you come home, I'll be layin' in your backyard
Niggas turn to trackstars, runnin' when we comin'
See, them beepers see me do it, but they don't know who done it
Ay 20, make sure you tell that nigga Luda, I'm a shoota'
So if he got a problem with them cowards, bring me through there

[Hook]
How the hell you robbers gonna rob a robber?
How the hell you robbers gonna rob a robber?

[Ludacris]
.45 in the crevice of the 'Lac seat, hummin, comin' right at ya
These hollows will make you think you at a track meet
Boys hit the back street
I'm ridin shotgun, with a shotgun, pussy niggas hit the back seat
Chickens wanna act sweet 'cause of my candy-coated paint
And size 24 shoes, I call 'em Shaq's feet, rollin' 20 Lacs deep
Whoever want it, we done it at 2100 Jack-U street
So hide-ya hide-ya wallet-wallet, tuck-ya tuck-ya chain-chain
I don't wanna, cock-it cock-it, chicka-chicka bang-bang
Ain't no way to try to stop it, or numb the pain-pain
Cause this ain't no muthafuckin video game-game
But I can empty the cartridge, while you bitchin' and fussin'
Grab the sticks of extra clips and press the reset button
Put you on the front page of you the latest edition
Tell the robbers I'm the greatest addition
Motherfucker!

[Hook]
How the hell you robbers gonna rob a robber?
How the hell you robbers gonna rob a robber?
How the hell you robbers gonna rob a robber?
How the hell you robbers gonna rob a robber?
How the hell you robbers gonna rob a robber?
How the hell you robbers gonna rob a robber?
How the hell you robbers gonna rob a robber?
How the hell you robbers gonna rob a robber?

[?]
But I just bought a mac call it 

[?]

What's in my pocket dawg? all dirty money
Ladders on deck come and take it from me
Niggas looking at me like they fucking hungry
But they get fucking buried trying to run up on me
Yes sir, cause I'mma let my toolie clap
How you gon' rob me, nigga where they do that at
Not around here, around there neither
This 40 ought to hit your ass just like Derek Jeter
Dude a baseballer, I'm an eight baller
I'm a straight baller, batter whip a cake holler
We just get the money we don't take offers
I'm so motherfucking fly I'm about to take off of
Chilling with this Rollie on my arm
What I paid for it could of went and bought a car
I could take my show money blow it at the mall
I could hit the jewelry store and throw it on an Audemar
(Blow it on an Audemar?)
Ya bitch I said it
Believe it if I said, I meant it
2010 I'm trying to go flying spur on them, tinted
Riding low through the city blowing on spinach
Get it I'm a h-u-s-t-l to the er
We are, all getting to the money nigga flee off
Keep on, I love it when they hate that's what I feed off
Catch you we gone throw shit everywhere like its a free for all
Get money fuck more bitches
And kill more snitches
I'm like Shakur with it
Small fee I'll have my youngin at the door with it
Playing ding dong dixie, mask on long semi
Talking money I get plenty of it
Doing my thing I push that point just like when Penny was it
Why they hating, cause I'm getting plenty money
They want to take it tell them get it from me

[Hook]

Choppers are dusty, he know not to touch me

[?]gambino

Positiong myself and cusion my wealth
Hating on me that's bad for your health
F on my rims and F on my shoes
FNH on me and F on my belt
Niggas they envy, Gangstas pretend to be
Glasses are Fendi and bitches are friendly
Asses are sexy and titties are pretty
Niggas are ho type and bitches are silly
Watches are quarter my chain is a milly
I can't lie all my hoes are so deadly
So I'm up on occasion than you think I was Diddi
Cases and cases and cases of blunts
Smoke like a hippie, drink like Britney
Walking in the club ten hoes with me
Harder they try they can't get rid me
Looking like I'm dreaming someone pinch me
Two shooters right by, they're my henchmen
Gucci then came all same songs keep them
Flash back heard my beeper vibrating
And the pay phone in the hood keep on ringing
That lil chick that I met last weekend
Laughing and leaving I'm walking in Neimus
Swag so sick I could check on the season
Freshen' the club making bitch stop breathing

[Hook]
All my get money bitches stand up
All my trap niggas put your hands up

[Verse 1]
So many people want to find it (find it)
Crossing our hearts wishing and hoping
That we see the light without being blinded
So we can discover the missing pieces

[Pre-Chorus]
And when it's all said and done we will know who to love
But for now I'm waiting for you now

[Chorus]
So I stand forever
Waiting for something better
While running from the best looking for the better half
Now and ever
Thinking about now or never
So I take another leap just to meet my better half
I've been waiting, waiting
To run into you
To run to you

[Verse 2]
Lay down your arm and don't try to fight it
We can't let this love keep us divided
’Cause it's too many reasons why we all need it
So when it knocks on our door, just know it's invited

[Pre-Chorus & Chorus]

[Chorus]
Have you ever seen some VVS's

You got one chance, run it up nigga
Run it up nigga

[Verse 1]

But you know I'm muddy, your boyfriend my buddy

And I whispered in her ear and said "Yeah, yeah"

Woo, woo, woo, ya bitch
I'm Snoop, Peewee Longway, Uncle Luke
Redbone ridin' round with me, I call her soup
Gold chain on me like I cut it out a flute
I just juuged a 100 and I gave it to my homies
I can't cry, if it ain't with it, it ain't on me
60-inch plasmas on all my home man
I'm riding on that Campbell like Naomi

[Chorus]
Have you ever seen some VVS's
Have you ever felt like Houston Texas

Have you ever pulled up in there flexin'
Run it up nigga

This encounter's a trap, and I don't even know where it's at
I've seen self-sabotage one thousand times before
Do you want me to go? Do you want me to go?
Cause you keep calling back
And I still have to bend the truth; it's not worth upsetting you
I've learned to be a shameless liar

Such forceful accusations and violent conversations
Help create a war that we keep fighting, cause we're soldiers in disguise
We're in disguise
Adored by superficial Hollywood
Natural feelings don't feel like they should
A rotten punchline when the joke's no good

And just when things start looking better
I like to kick them to the side
They say the grass is always greener
Until I spray the pesticide

So dysfunctional
Do you want me to go? Do you want me to go?
You keep coming back
We're done!
I still have to bend the truth
I'm sure it's upsetting you
We breed a bunch of little liars

She craves the contents of my loaded gun, (Oh, Syrah)
Squeeze out a round onto your eager tongue. (Yeah!)
A gorgeous girl embracing womanhood
I'm on a date with instant gratitude
A good hard fuck should fix your attitude

Caught in a romantic war, we keep on fighting
Cause we're soldiers, yeah
Big bad soldiers, yeah
Fucking soldiers, soldiers in disguise
We're in disguise
Adored by superficial Hollywood
Natural feelings don't feel like they should
A rotten punchline when the joke's no good

And just when things start looking better
I like to kick you to the side
They say the grass is always greener
Until I spray the pesticide
Syrah! Syrah! Syrah! Syrah! Syrah! Syrah! Syrah!
You're always looking back!
Hunting is in our blood
Hunting is in our blood
I'm not yet a father
I'm not yet a father
Watch out, Demoiselle

So intrigued, I'm watching hormones at their finest
And he's desperate to fuck
Eat it up, he's saying anything it takes to be inside her
Lies are used so that she'll lose her clothes
She'll just blush
Baited with liquor, hook line and sinker

Now he's got her
(Slayin') someone's daughter
They might insist that they're different from the rest
This is a tactic used often by the lady-killer

But first
Calculate timing, orchestrate touching
Arranging all the little tricks to play
In his bed, willingly spread by two
Baited with liquor, hook line and sinker
Hook line and sinker!
Girl, you're still alone, but you're never home
Does he get you off? Do I get you off?
Do I? Do I? Do I?

Now he's got her
(Slayin') someone's daughter
They might insist that they're different from the rest
This is a tactic used often...
Stop, close your fucking legs
This is all they crave

Hunting is in our...
Hunting is in our...
BLOOD!
I'm not yet a father
I'm not yet a father

Watch out, Demoiselle (Watch out, Demoiselle)
At the bar, the hopeful hunters roam
Finding prey, they drink, then stumble home
Altered judgement helps them make the kill
Once inside, he knows he's sealed the deal
The deal

We all try just a little bit
But there's some who go further
They're so wrong
He's so wrong to be deceitful
Do you believe it?
Why can't you see it?
Do I? Do I? Do I?
I don't know why, but sometimes I wonder deeply
What I would do if you passed away
I think of words, words that I wish I'd told you by the end:
Dead messages I can still say to you
Why should I sit with fear? We all know that tragedies are never fair

Wait, do I have an issue?
Dreaming you're gone just to see if I'd miss you
No, no it hurts to imagine
Letting go and wearing black the day we know you're never coming home
Who decides it's our turn to go?
Who decides?

Live, because you're dying. (quickly)
I'm still trying. (we don't really know)
No, life is a show, and tragedies are never fair
We're all given a script that's been written
(Blindly, blindly) unaware of who will be
Who will be cast? Who will be cast to come home?

Time can be unforgiving...
Status quo on the living...
(Unknown) What will I (second home) most remember
(Buried) from our time (unexposed) spent together?
When am I to go? Who'll be there to notice?
Will I go alone? Who'll be there?
Who'll write my obituary once I find the cemetery?
Live, because you're dying. (quickly)
I'm still trying. (we don't really know)
No, life is a show, and tragedies are never fair
We're all given a script that's been written
(Blindly, blindly) unaware of who will be
Who will be cast? Who will be cast out?

I don't know why, but sometimes I wonder deeply
What you would do if I passed away

[Verse 1]
When we were young
Our hearts were strong
And they beat as one
’Til the day had come
When I thought that you were gone

[Chorus]
And then the sun rose
Our bodies unfroze
And it turned us both gold
Your diamond eyes glowed

[Verse 2]
When we were young
Our love was strong
We beat as one
’Til the day had come
And I thought that you were gone

[Chorus]
And then the sun rose
Our bodies unfroze
And it turned us both gold
Your diamond eyes glowed

[Bridge]
I would search near and far
Drag the seas and mind the dark
Search through every place I think you are
I would search near and far
Drag the seas and mind the dark
And never losing hope that you'd be found

[Chorus]
And then the sun rose
Our bodies unfroze
And it turned us both gold
Your diamond eyes glowed
Will they blame me if you go disappearing?

I sometimes wonder what it'd be like to be out of my mind
It's such a good excuse to commit such heinous crimes
That in mind, I'd go find that pathetic little prick
He'd be crying by the time that his head met with a brick
Dropped in a canyon, help has now arrived
Just two of us, but I'm the one alive

To pay your debts you owe your life!
To pay your debts you gotta die!

Will they blame me if you go disappearing?

That selfish pig deserves the chair
And I would love to help him get there
And I would love to help him get there
And I would love to help him get there

Regretful rivers flow aplenty in his mind
The tributaries are the choices he declined
Dropped in a canyon, that's where you'll reside
Just two of us, but I'm the one alive
That fucking pig deserves to die
And I would love to show him why!
Is there any kill that's worth the bust?
Switching roles with God
Deciding what to do's a dirty job
Screaming why, screaming why!
Repenting monster!
Switching roles with God
It seems to me you fucking understand!

Screaming why with shame shoved through your eyes
Dropped in a canyon, help has now arrived
Just two of us, but I'm the one, I'm the one alive
Can I rearrange your veins?
Is there any kill that's worth the bust?
Is there any kill that's worth the bust?
Is there any kill that's worth the bust?
Is there any kill that's worth the bust?
Fictional physician!

I get a large euphoria from such a small formula, yeah, yeah
A little paper on the side will be my ticket to ride, yeah, yeah
Heavy feeling, refill my way to the sky
Happy feeling, replacing doubt in my mind
Doctor's orders: take some more; I'm hearing knocks at the door
Meddling family, go home; I feel much less than before
So what? (Because it)
Now what? (Is an axe)
Meddling family stay away!
Meddling family go, go, go-
Doctor, your patients are here

Hey, across the counter:
You'll quiet down as I slowly get louder!
Cancer, coma, panic, pills; it just doesn't matter!
I swallow blackouts
Formula helping us formulate!

I still picture all of what happened the day I got locked in my head
(Soma)
(Soma) Just get a script!
(Someone) Needs medicine!
(Silenced) Up 'til the end!
(Soma) Just get a script!
(Someone) Needs medicine!
(Silenced) Up 'til the end
(So long)

And I'm losing my patients!
I'm losing my patients!
I'm losing my patients!
I'm losing my, I'm losing my...
Now I've lost all my patience
I've lost all my patience
I've lost all my patience
I'm losing my, I'm losing my...

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'm yelling free my nigga TIP
Brought him from Atlanta to Philly, Mike Vick
Fighting charges lawyers say that they might stick
I was praying to God, man don't do me like this
The girls fucking niggas with the bricks
Now they popping me I laugh dirty bitch

Dirty money new work
Smell it on my new shirt
Lying make these suckas feel good but truth hurt
A lot of niggas do dirt, get it in return
But enough of dirt doing have you sitting with the worms
Bloods dripping tissue burn
Bullets rip your soul up
Hollow tips fucking up your head like a bowl cut
When my hommies roll up they be like hold up
But I be like fuck that cause I do enough rap
I ain't with the talking tell 'em spark 'em like a blunt wrap
Rather make these suckas bow down like a blunt
Twist them like a Backwood, black laid black hood
Dicked down ski'd up
Hoes down G's up
I couldn't get no Gucci, but I could get an Oozie
Spray up your hood and hit your neighbors just for being nosy
Truthfully, I don't be all on that gun shit
I be on some Puerto Rico chilling with a young chick
You niggas on that dumb shit
My niggas got them birds and come and get a drumstick
I am cooked crack to the 

[?]
All this rapping got me shining like aluminum foil
Your niggas ain't loyal
Money, envy, and greed will destroy you
All over a dollar sign
Meek Milly I am Columbine
And I'm hotter than these suckers like a thousand times

[Intro: Meek Mill]
I ain't turning back niggas
Let's get it

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Point of no return
No turning back its all or nothing
I seen them niggas that used to be this shit all for nothing
I can't fall for nothing
So ain't no turning back
Fuck that, I watched all of their mistakes and learned from that
So go ahead nigga hate on me and watch me earn from that
Try to kill me I go out busting like I'm Bernie Mac
Cause I'm a warrior, real two-storier
Million dollar plan I keep a secret like Victoria
Niggas want to see me fall like September
Trying to stomp my flame out and watch me ember and catch again
Had to kick the door down they wouldn't let me in
I take these niggas on a level they ain't' ever been
Terminator dedicated, focus like I'm meditating
Keep it real ain't ever faking
Y'all pussies forever hating
A lot of niggas had a chance but they ain't ever take it
I do it for the hood my niggas that ain't ever make it

It's a quarter after one

So, so what, I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

[Part 8 - I Kissed a Girl by Katy Perry]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick

I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Part 9 - Fireflies by Owl City]
And I like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake
When I'm asleep
Because everything is never as it seems

[Part 10 - Blame It by Jamie Foxx]
Blame it on the goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on the Tron

Blame it on the blue-tap
Got you feeling dizzy

Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

[Intro]
I saw a baby drive a truck
I saw a junkie eat a tuba
I saw a stripper kiss a duck
Behind a dumpster in Aruba

[Verse 1]
I saw this fat, psychotic guy
His underwear was made of crickets
He pawned a skeleton to buy
Some old expired lotto tickets

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I saw a naked vagrant giving
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to his cat
I probably could have gone my whole life
Without seeing that

[Chorus]
With My Own Eyes
I see things that'd drive a normal man insane
Wish I could disconnect my brain
From My Own Eyes

[Verse 2]
I saw a mime get hacked to death
With an imaginary cleaver
I saw an old man's final breath
I watched him die from Bieber Fever
I saw these diabetic chicks
In an abandoned 7-Eleven
I watched them snorting pixie sticks
While they were belching Stairway To Heaven

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I saw two drag queens trying to see how many crackers
They could shove up each other's nose
I'd like to erase my mind completely but I suppose
That's just the way it goes

[Chorus 2]
With My Own Eyes
I see things that'd drive a normal man insane
Wish I could disconnect my brain
From My Own Eyes (My Own Eyes)
Those visions haunt my memory
Oh, there's so much I wish I could unsee
With My Own Eyes

[Verse 3]
Some priest got drunk and stole a circus zebra
And he trained it to massage his back
My guinea pig committed hara-kiri
So we used him to play hacky-sack
My neighbor's kids sold weapons-grade plutonium
And frosty ice-cold lemonade
They took MasterCard and sometimes
Human organs in trade, that's how we paid
I have to say that it was really darn good lemonade

[Outro]
With My Own Eyes
I've seen thing that'd drive a normal man insane
Wish I could disconnect my brain
From My Own Eyes (My Own Eyes)
Those visions haunt my memory
Oh, there's so much I wish I could unsee
With My Own Eyes 

[repeating]

[Verse 1]
We must all efficiently
Operationalize our strategies
Invest in world-class technology
And leverage our core competencies
In order to holistically administrate
Exceptional synergy
We'll set a brand trajectory
Using management philosophy
Advance our market share vis-à-vis
Our proven methodology
With strong commitment to quality
Effectively enhancing corporate synergy
Transitioning our company
By awareness of functionality
Promoting viability
Providing our supply chain with diversity (-versity, ooooh)
We will distill our identity
Through client-centric solutions
And synergy (Oooooh oooh oooh)
(Ahhhhhh)

[Bridge]
At the end of the day (At the end of the day)
We must monetize our assets
The fundamentals have changed
Can you visualize a value-added experience?
That will grow the business infrastructure and
Monetize our assets
Monetize our assets
Monetize our assets

[Verse 2]
Bringing to the table
Our capitalized reputation
Proactively overseeing
Day-to-day operations
Services and deliverables
With cross-platform innovation
Networking, soon will bring, seamless integration
Robust and scalable, bleeding-edge and next-generation
Best of breed
We'll succeed
In achieving globalization

[Outro]
And gaining traction with our resources in the marketplace
It's mission-critical to stay incentivized
Our business plan will foster flexible solutions for our customer base
If you can't think outside the box
You'll be downsized
It's a paradigm shift! (Hey, Hey! Look out!)
Well, it's a paradigm shift, now!
(Here it come, here it come, here it come, here it come, ha!)

[Verse 1]
My maid is cleaning the bathroom, so I can't take a shower
When I do, the water starts getting cold after an hour
I couldn't order off the breakfast menu, 'cause I slept in 'til two
Then I filled up on bread, didn't leave any room for tiramisu
Oh no, there's a pixel out in the corner of my laptop screen
I don't have any bills in my wallet small enough for the vending machine
Some idiot just called me up on the phone. What!? Don't they know how to text? OMG!
I got

[Chorus]
First world, first world problems
(First world problems)
First world, first world problems
(First world problems)
First world, first world problems

[Verse 2]
I bought too many groceries for my refrigerator
Forgot my gardener's name, I'll have to ask him later
Tried to fast forward commercials. Can't, I'm watching live TV
I'm pretty sure the cookies in this airport lounge ain't gluten free
My barista didn't even bother to make a design in the foam on the top of my vanilla latte!

[Chorus]
First world, first world problems
(First world problems)
First world, first world problems
(First world problems)
First world, first world problems

[Verse 3]
Can't remember which car I drove to the mall
My Sonicare won't recharge, now I gotta brush my teeth like a Neanderthal!

The thread count on these cotton sheets has got me itchin'
My house is so big I can't get WiFi in the kitchen
Uh, I had to buy something I didn't even need just so I could qualify for free shipping on Amazon!

[Chorus]
First world, first world problems
(First world problems)
First world, first world problems
(First world problems)
First world, first world problems

First world, first world problems
(First world problems)
First world, first world problems
(First world problems)
First world, first world problems

[Outro]
(Laughing)

[Verse 1]
Can anybody help me? I'm outta plans
Guess I left my world in somebody's hands
I don't like to hurt but, but everyone gets weak
Someone to rely on, that's what I really need

[Pre-Chorus]
Now here we stay, it's all that we're worth
I've been through the pain and been dragged through the dirt
Whatever they tell you, we're bigger than words
I've been where you're standing, I know how it hurts
Let this be a song now and this be a day
And we stand together, we'll be okay
'Cause we're survivors, we're making it work
Expecting the best when they hope for the worst

[Chorus]
One love, this is the way we found
One love, even though they'll let you down
One love, nobody's perfect now
One love, don't let that hold you down
One love, let's stick together now
One love, we've got to stand our ground
One love, it's easy to believe in
One love, believe in you and me
One love

[Verse 2]
Now I could try and fix this all by myself
But I know it'd turn out better if u help
No one likes to hurt but, but everyone gets weak
Someone to rely on that's what everybody needs

[Pre-Chorus]
Now here we stay, it's all that we're worth
I've been through the pain and been dragged through the dirt
Whatever they tell you, we're bigger than words
I've been where you're standing, I know how it hurts
Let this be a song now and this be a day
And we stand together, we'll be okay
'Cause we're survivors, we're making it work
Expecting the best when they hope for the worst

[Chorus]
One love, this is the way we found
One love, even though they'll let you down
One love, nobody's perfect now
One love, don't let that hold you down
One love, let's stick together now
One love, we've got to stand our ground
One love, it's easy to believe in
One love, believe in you and me
One love, it's one love

[Outro]
O-N-E L-O-V-E
I'm here to tell you it's one love, oh
One love, said it's one love
Sing with me, one love
One love to be, oh, one love
That's all we need
One love

[Lyrics from Snippet]

Come through, take a bit more
Aren't you glad i'm destroyed
I have nothing left for you to rape
Don't think much of myself
I just love your hell
Still just your speed dial whore

Tell me who you want me to be
Gave you the best of me
Still want the rest of me

I wanna be involved in all your dirt
And I wanna burst
Inside your veins and rain like
Blood all over your face
Like
Cum all over your face
I wanna feel for you

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
(Hey) No flex zone, (hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (hey) they know better

I treat these hoes special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
Hell no, you can't use my lip gloss
Pop a Perc', now I'm on lift off
Ass still fat, it's on Rick Ross
You bitches make a nigga dick soft
Bitch, ball like I'm at tip off
Get it, get it wet, then I rub the tip on
Rag and Bone jeans, I can slip off
Bitch, I've been hot since flip phones
Running this game for five years, guess that's why my feet hurt
Wonder when they bite me, do these bitches' teeth hurt?
Yes, I am an icon, that's me on your T-shirt
Thought you knew better, do your fucking research
You ain’t know, this the no rip zone
This the you can't beat Nic zone
Madison Square when the Knicks home
I live next door to Brad Pitt’s home
I like bad bitches, 'cause they like bad bitches too
I like hood niggas, with a bad attitude
They could never reach Young Nick' magnitude
Even if they had a longitude, latitude
Listen up, ho, this is my territory
You are my son, like an episode of Maury
Like an episode of ER, bitch, I’m hotter than the D.R
When it comes to rap skills, nobody wan' see her
Muhfuckas flexin', muhfuckas actin'
Bitches is my sons and they causin' contractions
Ain’t pushing out, I'ma give them to the clinic
Cah wait, we nuh rate dem gyal and dem gimmick

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Whack sauce, I can hear it in your tone
This nigga keep staring at my phone
But if you’re ugly, it’s a no text zone
It’s a no sex zone, it’s a no flex zone
Whack sauce, I can hear it in your tone
This nigga keep staring at my phone
But if you’re ugly, it’s a no text zone
It’s a no sex zone, it’s a no flex zone

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
(Hey) No flex zone, (Hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (Hey) they know better
(Hey) No flex zone, (Hey) no flex zone

KRS-One interview:
{If hip-hop has the ability to corrupt young minds, it also has the ability to uplift them}

Intro:
Cause I'm seein' bright visions of how we should be livin'
Unified, strong, makin' our own decisions

Verse 1:
Hip-hop city, higher minds will listen
Some won't get it and find time for dissin'
But I always been ahead of the preservation mission
So I alway's been a head of the preservation mission
And what one sure way to preserve, what we spittin', reserve what we've written
Reserve how we wigglin', preserve how we mix it, our raw sound
It's the finally established of small hip-hop resort town
A place for artist's from all over the earth
Could come and find peace, could come and spit they verse
Could find support of all sorts for arts done for fun
To achieve this, hip-hop we must become one

Hook:
(KRS-One sample saying, "One", repeatedly in the background throughout)
We must become one, you know
Hip-hop is one
(KRS-One sample saying, "One", repeatedly in the background)
KRS Interview:
{So if we come with a balance and play everything, we will find ourselves not reflecting just product and markets, but life itself}

Verse 2:
My style of raps hard to find, I believe that every rapper has a larger mind
But they spit the sex, spit the murder, spit the crime
Cause they told if they do it they'll be livin' fine
People know it's only music, y'all don't mind
But every now-and-then I question what these rappers say and rhyme
Take yo time, I send this out to every rapper sayin rhymes, and every DJ out there playin mine
You know I don't live for the prime time
But out of all these rap names, young people should be able to find mine
Knowledge Reigning Supreme, I shine, shine like the sun
It's time for hip-hop to become one

Hook:
(KRS-One sample saying, "One", repeatedly in the background throughout)
Woooh
Yup, come on, we must become one
UNITY! That's what it's about
Hip-Hop is one
Yo, yeah, come on, we must become one
(KRS-One sample saying, "One", repeatedly in the background)

KRS Interview:
{Im crying out for balance along with a whole bunch of family around the world, they wanna to see balance.}
Verse 3:
So what I'm talkin' bout, I'm talkin' bout a plan fast
We're the richest hip-hopper's, we buy a land mass
Put out a call to see the skill that every man has
I put this on the love, that every fam has
Exodus, over da sea, we can pass
Into our own hip-hop city, turn over the sand glass
This sounds as if we just found our gift
A hip-hop town is bound to uplift
Our town has, no controls, the cops you gotta ring em up
Moms is safe, kid's you can bring em up
Just streets are patrolled by doctors and lawyers
Because you don't need law if you already have order
We are one

Hook:
(KRS-One sample saying, "One", repeatedly in the background throughout)
We must become one, you know
Hip-hop is one, woooh, hip-hop is one
Yup, come on, we must become one
UNITY! That's what it's about
Hip-hop is one
Yo, yeah, come on, we must become one
(KRS-One sample saying, "One", repeatedly in the background)
"GRIOT"S LAMENT" applies Michael Jackson's lyrics to the artists' ongoing exploration of metamorphosis as a threshold of change, and as medium for identifying political and social injustices . " An innocent black man was killed, and we are that injustice" sang Michael alongside his sister Janet in the song SCREAM. I use "recontexualization" of these lyrics to revisit the killings of Trayvon Martin, Oscar Grant, and the countless number of innocent youths that have fallen prey to violence in Southwest Chicago. "They don't care about us" was shouted as a veiled response to the Rodney King beating , but could it have also been a foretelling or foreshadowing of the tragic humanitarian failures incurred during Hurricane Katrina? One violent scene in the film will be staged to replicate the horrific Rodney King beating. The film asks the question, as Michael did repeatedly via his music: How culpable are WE... when society cannot fully function in the realm of justice? The character "Griot" is the conduit for Michael's often overlooked and under recognized political orientation, a perspective that is often over shadowed by the glow and power of his popular music and larger than life persona. "Griot", pictured here and played by actor Brandon Hirsch, is a one man Greek chorus; "A broken ear witness to unspeakable crimes ". I am blessed and grateful to have an amazing crew and unbelievably talented cast whose creative currency will super charge every pixel of every single frame. As a team of artists, we are especially excited about hiring (with the help of our partners) local youth from Inglewood and South Central Los Angeles to work on the film, so that they can benefit from the experience of participating in a local professional film production.  Formerly incarcerated Youth from my non profit  FYI FILMS  Films by Youth Inside,  which empowers incarcerated youth via story telling  and digital film making worked as both talent and crew on this GL! ! Lastly, I'm grateful to have the support of  Black Hollywood Education Resource Center. I began writing Griot's Lament the night that Michael left us. In my heart , it is my sincere hope that Griot's Lament is a fitting tribute to the King of Pop, whose music is the soundtrack to much of my life.

Mini Review of Griots Lament by Akello Stone

"These days we are bombarded with lots of visual media, stories and messages in the forms of videos. Most of it is completely unimaginative but Griot's Lament is much different It truly is a short-form "theatrical experience on the small screen" that evokes thoughts with the kind of intellectual depth, auditory stimulation and cadence, and visual creativity that many of us so desire. It truly captures the wonder, the suspense, the social commentary that can draw you in and leave you sitting - wanting more." Bravo!

Trayvon Martin Revisited Via Michael Jackson’s Lyrics in “Griot’s Lament”
JULY 16, 2014 • ENTERTAINMENT, FEATURED • VIEWS: 221

There’s a new trend in entertainment, repurposing the lyrics of artists like Tupac (Holler If Ya’ Hear Me on Broadway) and now, a new web series, Griot’s Lament does the same with the King of Pop’s lyrics.  It is excellently done and one of the most innovative web series that I’ve seen in a long time and it comes from director, Aleks Munoz.

Here is what the Director had to say about his latest effort, “My next film “GRIOT”S LAMENT” applies Michael Jackson’s lyrics to the artists’ ongoing exploration of metamorphosis as a threshold of change, and as medium for identifying political and social injustices .”

An innocent black man was killed, and we are that injustice” sang Michael alongside his sister Janet in the song SCREAM. I use “recontexualization” of these lyrics to revisit the killings of Trayvon Martin, Oscar Grant, and the countless number of innocent youths that have fallen prey to violence in Southwest Chicago.


“They don’t care about us” was shouted as a veiled response to the Rodney King beating , but could it have also been a foretelling or foreshadowing of the tragic humanitarian failures incurred during Hurricane Katrina? One violent scene in the film is staged to replicate the horrific Rodney King beating. The film asks the question, as Michael did repeatedly via his music: How culpable are WE… when society cannot fully function in the realm of justice?

The character “Griot” is the conduit for Michael’s often overlooked and under recognized political orientation, a perspective that is often over shadowed by the glow and power of his popular music and larger than life persona.  I began writing Griot’s Lament the night that Michael left us. In my heart , it is my sincere hope that Griot’s Lament is a fitting tribute to the King of Pop, whose music is the soundtrack to much of my life.”

The film uses formerly incarcerated youth, as both talent and crew  from Munoz’s FYI FILMS by Youth Inside, which empowers incarcerated youth via story telling and digital film making.

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
I can see it in their face that they want me to fall
Cause all the little bad bitches I be fucking them all
I want this shit forever
Haters tried to take my life and stop my heart but I'm too clever
Kill me never
Haters trying to prosper
They just want to be me but couldn't see me with binoculars
Rapping ass niggas built for T.V. need an Oscar
I'm not talking De La Hoya but if I was then I'd be Hopkins
First name strongest, last name stronger
Flow so cold listen to it catch Pneumonia
Diesel in the air we don't touch the Arizona
Diamond studded yellow Breitling
Looking like Corona, or Homer
The face blue and yellow like Melo
And my chain multi-colors looking like its frozen jello
Hello, steady eating money for a meal
Drinking Rosé for a beverage
Let me get some leverage
When I was locked down I was million dollar schemin'
Rolls Royce dreaming
Microphone fiending, I mean it
Hungry like its Ramadan I'm dining
And I ain't mug-meanin' but God keep me breathing
Nineteen years old in the hole
Watching my dreams shatter and praying that all of my goals
Don't fade away like fourth quarter pass to 23
I go hard like I took Viagra before I got the beat

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Rob me I get them gunned down
Choppa style goons lurking when the sun down
Haters throwing bullets trying to get a touchdown
You catch them like Fitzgerald hommie when that clip spill
I've seen people go upstate with wills
Beat their appeal make it home then get killed
Cause shit real nigga up in Philadel
I wet you and leave a hole in your head like killer whale
Free Willy and Meek Milly
He really bout that ask a nigga vouch that
Pussy nigga softer than a pillow top mattress
Rappers actors like Samuel L. Jackson
You throwing money, you ain't even own a crib yet
You ain't even buy that Playstation for your kids yet
You ain't send no money to your man doing bid yet
But you making it rain you a fucking lame
Y'all lames man

I'm in the SRT with an ACP
My sneaks ACG put out an APB
I make my bars go together like the ABC
I'm the club throwing dubs sipping A-C-E, spado
Ain't talking Tony when we say that yayo
In the kitchen we Miracle Whipping like its mayo
We hit the block and hit the rock like Ay-o
On the grizzy my shooters with me call them O.J. Mayo, woah!

[Verse 1]
Way back when I was just a little bitty boy
Living in a box under the stairs in the corner of the basement of the house
Half a block down the street from Jerry's Bait Shop
(You know the place)
Well, anyway, back then life was going swell and everything was just peachy!

Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning
My mother would make me a big ol' bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast

Aw, big bowl of sauerkraut!
Every single mornin'!
It was driving me crazy

I said to my mom
I said, "Hey, mom, what's up with all the sauerkraut?"
And my dear, sweet mother
She just looked at me like a cow looks at an oncoming train
And she leaned right down next to me
And she said, "It's good for you!"
And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth
And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old
That's when I swore that someday
Someday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away place
Where the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beer
And the towels are oh so fluffy
Where the shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long
And anyone on the street will gladly shave your back for a nickel

Wacka wacka doodoo yeah!

Well, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true
Because the very next day, a local radio station had this contest
To see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in Leonard Nimoy's butt
I was off by three, but I still won the grand prize
That's right, a first class one-way ticket

[Chorus]
To Albuquerque!
Albuquerque!

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah
You know, I'd never been on a real airplane before
And I gotta tell ya, it was really great
Except that I had to sit between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor
And the little kid in back of me kept throwin' up the whole time
The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts
And the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore
And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out
And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died
Except for me
You know why?
'Cause I had my tray table up
And my seat back in the full upright position
Had my tray table up
And my seat back in the full upright position
Had my tray table up
And my seat back in the full upright position

Ah ha ha ha
Ah ha ha
Ah

So I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage
I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days
Draggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag
And my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball
And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel
But finally I arrived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn
Where the towels are oh so fluffy
And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna
It's okay, they're clean!

Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C
And I turned on the SpectraVision
And I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow
That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door
Well now, who could that be?
I say, "Who is it?"
No answer
"Who is it?"
There's no answer
"Who is it?"
They're not sayin' anything

So, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected
It's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock of Seagulls haircut and only one nostril
Oh man, I hate it when I'm right
So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel
And I'm like, "Hey, you can't have that!
That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me!"
And he's like, "Tough."
And I'm like, "Give it!"
And he's like, "Make me."
And I'm like, "'kay!"
So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus
And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows
And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation
Yes, indeed, you better believe it
And somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook
And twenty seconds later, I heard a familiar voice
And you know what it said?
I'll tell you what it said

It said
"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again;
"If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator
"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again;
"If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator."

[Chorus]
In Albuquerque
Albuquerque

[Verse 3]
Well, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkel
But I made a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest
I would not sleep for an instant until the one-nostrilled man was brought to justice
But first, I decided to buy some donuts

So I got in my car and I drove over to the donut shop
And I walked on up to the guy behind the counter
And he says, "Yeah, what do ya want?"
I said, "You got any glazed donuts?"
He said, "No, we're outta glazed donuts."
I said, "You got any jelly donuts?"
He said, "No, we're outta jelly donuts."
I said, "You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?"
He said, "No, we're outta Bavarian cream-filled donuts."
I said, "You got any cinnamon rolls?"
He said, "No, we're outta cinnamon rolls."
I said, "You got any apple fritters?"
He said, "No, we're outta apple fritters."
I said, "You got any bear claws?"
He said, "Wait a minute, I'll go check

"No, we're outta bear claws."
I said, "Well, in that case - in that case, what do you have?"
He says, "All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels"
I said, "Okay, I'll take that."

So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out
And they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over
Oh man, they were just going nuts
They were tearin' me apart
You know, I think it was just about that time that a little ditty started goin' through my head
I believe it went a little something like this...

Doh!
Get 'em off me!
Get 'em off me!
No, get 'em off, get 'em off!
Oh, oh God, oh God!
Oh, get 'em off me!
Oh, oh God!

I ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my face
Wavin' my arms all around and just runnin', runnin', runnin'
Like a constipated wiener dog
And as luck would have it, that's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams
Her name was Zelda
She was a calligraphy enthusiast with a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peaches
I'll never forget the first thing she said to me
She said, "Hey, you've got weasels on your face."

That's when I knew it was true love
We were inseparable after that
Aw, we ate together, we bathed together
We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss
The world was our burrito
So we got married and we bought us a house
And had two beautiful children - Nathaniel and Superfly
Oh, we were so very very very happy, aw yeah

But then one fateful night, Zelda said to me
She said, "Sweetie pumpkin? Do you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?"
I said, "Whoa, hold on now, baby, I'm just not ready for that kind of a commitment!"
So we broke up and I never saw her again
But that's just the way things go

[Chorus]
In Albuquerque
Albuquerque

[Verse 4]
Anyway, things really started lookin' up for me
Because about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream
That's right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler!
I even made employee of the month after I put out that grease fire with my face
Aw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after that
I was gettin' a lot of attitude

OK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot
Tryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil
When I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself
So I, I say to him, I say, "Hey, you want me to help you with that?"
And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes
"No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw."

So I did

And then he gets all indignant on me
He's like, "Hey man, I was just being sarcastic!"
Well, that's just great
How was I supposed to know that?
I'm not a mind reader for cryin' out loud
Besides, now he's got a really cute nickname: "Torso-Boy"!
So what's he complaining about?

Say, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote
This guy comes up to me on the street and says he hasn't had a bite in three days
Well, I knew what he meant
But just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein
And he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over
And I'm like, "Hey, come on, don'tcha get it?"
But he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming
You know, just completely missing the irony of the whole situation
Man, some people just can't take a joke, you know?

Anyway, um, um, where was I?
Kinda lost my train of thought

Uh, well, uh, okay
Anyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it
But I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is:

I
Hate
Sauerkraut!

That's all I'm really tryin' to say
And, by the way, if one day you happen to wake up
And find yourself in an existential quandary​
Full of loathing and self-doubt
And wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence
At least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that
Somewhere out there in this crazy old mixed-up universe of ours
There's still a little place called

[Outro]
Albuquerque
Albuquerque
Albuquerque, Albuquerque
Albuquerque, Albuquerque
Albuquerque, Albuquerque
Albuquerque, Albuquerque

I said, "A" (A)
"L" (L)
"B" (B)
"U" (U)
"...Querque!" (Querque!)

Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque

Albuquerque

[Verse 1]
I'm your shelter from the storm
You know I'll always have your back
I'll even let you warm
Your freezing hands inside my butt crack

I never get out
My leaf blower when Oprah is on
When you're telling me about your feelings
I try not to yawn

[Pre-Chorus]
And when we're at parties
I don't talk about your spastic bladder
When you're cleaning the gutters on the roof
I'll hold the ladder

[Chorus]
And if that isn't love
If that isn't love
If that isn't love
I don't know what love is
Oh I guess I don't know
Ooh... listen now...

[Verse 2]
There's a microscopic bit of milk left
In the refrigerator
I could have finished it off but I quit in case you
Wanna tiny little sip later

And if you cut the cheese then maybe
I'll wink and say, "The dogs to blame!"
And I make sure to call you "Baby"
Every time I forget your name

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll even tell you, girl
When you start looking fat
Cause all your so-called friends
Will probably neglect to mention that

[Chorus]
And if that isn't love
If that isn't love
If that isn't love
I don't know what love is
Well then I don't know
Ohh no...

[Bridge]
Even though you make me sit through Mamma Mia!
But I still adore you
I'll kiss you if you've even had omelette for breakfast
And I can’t stand omelettes
And after I take a bath, if it's still warm
I'll leave the water in there for you
I give you my word
You're so beautiful
You make a glorious sunset
Look like a big fat turd, yeah

[Verse 3]
Every time I see you trying
To lift some really heavy thing
You can always count on me to help
By saying something encouraging
If you get drunk and pass out
I never Sharpie on your face
And I don't wipe my nose on your couch
Even though that's a super convenient place

[Pre-Chorus]
I totally support
Every idiotic thing you do
And I almost never pretend you're someone else
When I'm making out with you

[Chorus 2]
And if that isn't love
If that isn't love
If that isn't love
I don't know what love is
No I don't know what love is
Well I don't know what love is
I don't know what love is

[Intro]
You know what I'm saying
Then a mahfucker get mad about these little niggas coming into the game
Not knowing what the fuck to do, have a fucking clue
Heard a couple of rap songs and seen a fucking couple of movies
And they think this is what the game is about
You know what I'm saying
So they give the game a black eye

I done taught you everything else you know about this shit right
Just be quiet for one time and listen

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Niggas snitching on their hommies getting them life
Still walking around like that shit is alright
But this is the life
Ya, what part of the game is that
Tell me what part of the game is that
Same niggas that rode for risking your life
Soon as you go upstate nigga hitting your wife
But this is the life
Ya, what part of the game is that
Tell me what part of the game is that

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
They say loyalty brings forth royalty
The main reason y'all niggas is broke
The main reason when it go down you niggas will choke
That's why I leave my circle tight and keep my family close
It be the niggas that you trust though, cutthroat
Do you dirty and won't give a fuck though
Your luck though, same one's you ride for and die for
Stab you in your back you got your eyes closed
Thinking that its all love
All dabs, all hugs
They don't want to see you eat
They'd rather see all blood
Opening up all cuts
You was in the light
They was in the left lane and you was in the right
The difference is you say a nigga riding cause he down to pull a trigger
But a say a nigga riding when he down he send you pictures
Show you love dropping money on your kids
Now a days you go to jail they acting like you dead

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
You used to be a boss got indicted started snitching
All that money you was getting got a nerve to start bitching
Wasn't saying that when you was Louis luggage tripping
You and your chick styling spending thousands in the islands
But now you in a jam you couldn't ride with being silent
So you'd rather rat your hommie out coward
Got his baby mom stressing, kids growing up with out a father
Be the main niggas talking like they riding, selfish
Wouldn't bust a grape not if you hired them a Welch's
The type to leave a nigga in the fire watch him melting
I say what part of the game is that
Niggas telling on all their hommies how lame is that
Weak ass niggas gon' let the game collapse
That's why I'm spitting pain so I can help the game get back
And these niggas I ain't got nothing for them
Cause I'm real and I remember every nigga ain't loyal

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
Starting something (x4)
Yeah yeah (x7)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I like the way I spit the game I ain't talking
Rather pull up in the Bent moon walking
Biddies checking out my swag when I walk in
Cause I'm fresh to death like a nigga in the coffin
I'm screaming rest in peace to Mike
When I step up out the booth they should've rest in peace the mic
Cause a lot of niggas spit they'll never be this nice
If they try to take them left they'll never be this right, no
Keep it real too hot
I'm like a little Biggie mixed with 2Pac
I'm like a little Nas mixed with a Jay-Z
I'm spitting like a Mac mixed with a K
Cook crack bring it back like that
Tell Rugg stop the beat like it had a heart attack
I go into cardiac with a flow like woah
And I'm still young like Chris, Jeezy, Dro
Let Wheezy know, I ain't dead I'm alive
And I'm in the lead too
He be Jordan I'm Lebron
I be on it all the time niggas off like a light switch
Hop up on the track going wild like a white bitch
I just beat the beat like a copper with a nice stick
Know it always got to be a hater,"I don't like this"
Nigga you know you don't like shit
I got the game on lock like a vice grip
People say I'm doing good I just tell them that I'm trying
Cross me leave a nigga mom frying
Lot of rappers they really be lying
And I'm the truth, tell 'em Mike

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Wrist looking like Mike Jack jacket
VVS is like lights camera action
Real talk, wasn't for the rapping
I be in the hood having birdies with a ratchet
Whole strip got money like parkway
And the boardwalk 

[?]
School of hard knocks I was in the hallways
Getting to the money like everyday all day
I ain't do my homework had my own work
My nigga 

[?] show me how the 

[?] work
One-two-three shit I was in the zone first
Any chick I ever touch gave me dome first
Believe that, give me feedback
Fresh 

[?] my nigga be back
Tell 'em we back where the keys at
In the hood flipping like a dirty kid with three 

[?]
People say I'm getting money I just tell them that I'm trying
I should bring a bitch hard have her 

[?]
Have her knocking at my door spying
Tell 'em Mike

[Hook]

[Interlude]
You're A Vegetable, You're A Vegetable
Still They Hate You, You're A Vegetable
You're Just A Buffet, You're A Vegetable
They Eat Off Of You, You're A Vegetable

[Outro]
We had the Rosé with the Nuvo (x4)
If you a hustler throw some money up
If you a hustler (x2)
Now ladies if you getting money
Let me see you drop down, drop down (x2)
All my hustlers throw your bankrolls up
All my ladies put your Louis bags up (x2)
Put your Louis bags up (x2)
Right now right now
All my hustler put your bankrolls up
Right now right now
Tell security they better fall back (x4)
What you looking at what you hating for (x4)

[Verse 1]
You chill everything that you see
You chilled the nerves that live in me
With your eyes, they never lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Deep as the ocean, cold like the sea
I’m lost and you're stoned
You poured it out on me
With your eyes, they never lie

[Chorus]
Oh she's never coming back
To me
She’s never coming back
To me

[Verse 2]
I see her in my hands
I know she’s in my soul
But she left me here trailing
In the cold December snow
Oh her smile, Oh her smile

[Pre-Chorus]
Deep as the ocean, cold like the sea
I’m lost in your storm
You poured it out on me
With your eyes they never lie

[Chorus]
Oh she's never coming back
To me
She’s never coming back
To me
Oh, she’s never coming back
To me
Oh, she’s never coming back
To me
Oh, she’s never coming back
To me

[Non-lyrical Vocals Outro]
Connor Shell:

You’re so vocal about how much you care about your hometown of Toronto and how much your friends and crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city. Can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like LeBron to make that decision, and that ultimate responsibility?

Drake:

Yeah, I mean, I think that for the last week and a half I’ve probably been bothering LeBron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be. I think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life he’s in. I don’t think that there’s a better way to deal with it than how he just did. I think if we can give out an award at the ESPYS for incredible essay writing, I would definitely love to present that to him because I think what he just did was patriotic in its own way, was courageous and was just, to me, I think it’s going to be one of the most historic things of our generation.

I’m just honored to know him and glad that I’ve gotten to, no pun intended, witness this moment for sure. I think it’s an incredible thing.  I actually woke up kind of late today, so I’m just catching on. It’s a great feeling for me. I can’t wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud I am because he’s been a friend of mine for a long time.

Shell:

Obviously, you’ve joined Saturday Night Live and we’ve had Justin Timberlake host the show. Are you going to take a more musical approach to the ESPYS than what we’ve seen in the past?

Drake:

I think obviously one of the talents that I’m able to bring to the ESPYS is music, but I’m just going to get up there and I want to just prepare a great night for people. I think we have prepared an incredible night for people. I definitely want to incorporate music, but I’m not there to put on a strictly music‑based show. Yeah, we definitely have some incredible pre‑tapes. Yeah, I think it’s just going to be a great night overall. I’m there to deliver a great hosting job.

Shell:

What makes the perfect ESPYS host? We’ve seen some amazing people like Justin Timberlake and John Hamm and even LeBron James. What strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer?
Drake:

Well, I think what makes a perfect ESPYS host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats. But I think most importantly what I bring is the fact that I feel that I know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys I have personal relationships with. I think I’m going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that I don’t know.

To me, it’s just about knowing the room that you’re in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve.

Shell:

Hosting a sports awards show, what do you feel is music’s role in sports?

Drake:

Well I said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go. I think that when I speak to any of my friends that play sports they’re always super into music, whether it be rap or other genres. My dream in life or my other dream in life that I’ll obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league, so I think they’re synonymous in that way. We inspire each other, and I think that’s what really ties music and sports together.

Shell:

This is a question for the producer, and if possible I have a follow‑up for Drake. With the LeBron news and the decision that was so successful for ESPN, was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the ESPYS? Did anybody reach out? Were you close?

Maura Mandt:

No, there was not an attempt to have that be there. And with the decision, it wasn’t something we were looking to have that announcement be on the ESPYS. Certainly if LeBron wanted to announce on the ESPYS, I would have happily had him there. I think what the ESPYS is about is the sports world plays out over the year, and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective, and that’s what you look for the host for.

We’re going to be reflecting on the year, and LeBron is something that happened, so it will definitely be something that we’ll address in the show. But just like in sports, we don’t try to make that news happen. It unfolds.

Shell:
Drake, in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance, and a lot of times in hip‑hop that’s kind of also a part of rap music and it’s always been. Do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage, whether it be metaphorically or outright in hip‑hop?

Drake:

I think that’s a funny question. I think it’s a good fit. I definitely think that hip‑hop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for. I think we’re not trying to end people’s careers or make people feel bad in any way, and that’s kind of most of the time what problems in hip‑hop are about. So our night, like I said, is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports.

So, yeah, I think there is definitely a difference. Though being clever with words is being clever with words, so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has. But I think the end goals are a bit different.

Shell:

You’re also being aware of public perception. For instance, you Instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer, right, and you so like you definitely have, I don’t know how to put it, maybe a love triangle thing going on with Skylar and she’ll probably be there. Can we expect a joke or where you’ll mention it like you did with SNL when you did the whole dated Rihanna thing? Everyone loved it, so can we expect that now that you’ll be hosting the ESPYS?

Drake:

Well, I obviously don’t want to give away the material. But I do have a growing affection for Skylar, and I’m not sure she’ll be able to make it, but I’m sure I’ll give you a treat if you enjoy my past references. I’m sure, if I haven’t done it already, now that I know you’re looking for it, I might stick one in there, for sure. You never know.

Shell:

One of the things about ESPN and the ESPYS is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the build‑up.  Today, I don’t know if you realize this, but you’ve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that Chris Brown posted up. I just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means?

Drake:

Well, as far as the latter end of the question, I’d rather not comment on it, but I know that our goal is obviously the night of the ESPYS to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards. I think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet. That’s why I’m excited.

We’ve been working hard, like I said, on the pre‑tapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night, which I can 100% guarantee it will.
Shell:

Is Cleveland your new favorite sports city? How are you going to incorporate A. Wiggins, Manziel, and LB James into your ESPY segment?

Drake:

First of all, I’d like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks, I do not team jump. I’ve been ‑‑ in the past, I’ve always supported the player and not the institution unless it’s the Kentucky Wildcats or the Toronto Raptors. Those are two teams that I will never stray from. But what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer, whether it comes to football or obviously basketball, I have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams.

So it’s not that I’m team jumping, I’m just a supportive friend. With the recent news, of course I’m going to go ‑‑ of course I’m going to go watch games in Cleveland. If not for LeBron, who like I said has been a brother to me for years, I mean, we’ve got three kids from Toronto on one team, plus we have Manziel who, again, is part of our family and like a brother.

So I definitely have to look into some real estate in Cleveland and maybe make some trips this year. I might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best.

But, yeah, like I said, my teams will always forever be who they are, but, yes, I will support the group that has shifted to Cleveland. I think that for Cleveland, a place that I’ve been time and time again touring, I just think it’s going to be greet. I really would love to see that city grow because they’re just a supportive group of people, and it is a great place, so I’m really excited.

Shell:

So the ESPYS is your second host gig this year. SNL was amazing by the way. So is hosting something that you’re trying to do more of or are you just working on more music? You have a lot to write about now that you’re a bachelor again.

Drake:

Well, actually, my status hasn’t changed, just to clear that up. I’ve always been out here coasting. But aside from that, the ESPYS is my main focus like SNL. When I commit to something, I don’t let my focus stray.

So for Maura to give me this opportunity to host, I don’t take it lightly. I put everything on hold to be ‑‑ to give the best performance that I possibly can at this awards show, and then from there, I have things coming up, whether it’s the OVO Fest or the tour with Lil Wayne, which is a real thing, which a lot of people don’t know if it’s a real thing or not, but it’s very real and it’s going to be very competitive. And then from there, I’ll figure out the next steps for me.

I’m always working on new music, but the ESPYS is the main focus right now, and we’ll figure out what’s next afterwards.

Shell:

One thing we learned about you after hosting SNL is you’re a tremendous impressionist. I personally loved the Katt Williams and Lil Wayne.  With having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience, can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show?


Drake:

Yeah, I’m actually excited to say that I definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance, and that is something that I actually pride in that I studied for. I love finding a character and getting into that character, especially if I know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms. So, yes, I will be doing impressions during the ESPYS, and they’re good. I’m excited.  They’re great.

Shell:

Are you bringing your lint roller?

Drake:

Oh, yes. I think I’ll probably have it somewhere around. Maybe I should. I should bring it out on stage. You shouldn’t have said it on the call. You should have anonymously sent that tip in, maybe we would have used the joke. No, I think I’ll be lint‑free that night. I’ll have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit.

Shell:

So we know that you wore some custom Calvin Klein outfits for your tour. Are you planning on the same fashion wearing any Calvin Klein suits, and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what they’re going to wear?

Drake:

I’m not exactly sure what brands I’m going to be wearing. Right now I’m sort of still, like I said, very focused on the show. I’ll figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers I’ll be wearing. But I’m more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that I’ll be draped in for you all to admire. So that’s really what my main focus is, but I’ll get my suits together.
I’m also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself. I might just cut to somebody and I won’t have to say anything.

Shell:

You have so many relationships with a lot of athletes. Is there anyone in particular that you haven’t met yet that you’re looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that you’re with already given you any advice about hosting?

Drake:

Well, I mean, I’ve gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends. You know, one of my mentors who is not an athlete, but obviously Jamie Foxx, a previous host and a big reason why I asked to be a part of this, just because that performance that he gave, I believe he hosted twice or three times, oh, twice, right. It was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music, but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was. So his mentorship and advice has been great to me. Is there anybody that I’m looking forward to meeting?
I mean, yeah, I was going to say, I’ve never met Skylar. I’m sure it will be extremely awkward when I do. But I guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up, which she probably won’t. Her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something. But, yeah, if I ever get to meet her I probably owe her an apology right off the bat. It’s been all in good spirits. But, yeah, that is the one person I’d like to meet.

Just for that last person, I also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music. I want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down. Yeah, Nick whatever his name is, because he didn’t win, so that’s how he’s going to be remembered. Nick whatever his name is.

Shell:

Can you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you, and how many are coming from the writing staff? Also, if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song?

Drake:

Oh, very good double question. Well, for the first part, the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible. We have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady Maura all the way down to the writers and everybody that’s involved. Everyone involved has been incredible to work with. We’ve been at it now for three months, I think, just on and off, meeting and talking and brain storming. As far as ideas being mine, I am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that I submitted are what I’m going to be performing or delivering on Wednesday night. Whether it be music, jokes and pre‑taped pieces, I was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it.

Is writing a joke harder than writing a song? I think that because of the way I write songs which is very honest, raw emotion about my life, I think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because it’s just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding Drake song as the public would deem it.

But, yeah, I mean, all my music is so honest, that sometimes it’s hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself. When you’re able to be lighthearted and joke around, I enjoy it. It comes a little quicker than songs do.

Mandt:

I’d like to make a comment on the collaboration process. Having worked on the show a number of years, one of the things that really resonates in the content is when it’s authentic from the person delivering it. Being able to have the access we’ve had to Drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on what’s coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life, it really elevates it, so it’s definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved.

We had a shoot the other day from one of the skits, and on set he was coming up with stuff, and you guys will see it and know what I’m talking about when you see the show. But there was no script in certain areas of it. It was really like an improv session, and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see. I’m really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show.

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]

Fuck it, let’s skip all the arguin'
Harvestin' shit into somethin' that benefis
All of my bitches that wanna get mine
Better stay with me on the low
I need a comfort that I am not talkin'
To one that sit back at the bed when I sleep on the road
I been keepin' all the secrets
I know you know that I got women I keep on the low
You know we move through the city like general pimpin'
While women just creep on the low
Me? I’m just rollin', I’m hopin' my soon to be finished
Relationship turned into somethin' that grow
Coulda been makin' this somethin'
I coulda been fussin' about makin' us lovers
But fuck it, I’m back on this playin' shit, though
I made mistakes and made that shit
You say you love me, save that shit
Don’t say that shit

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't love me, you just say that shit
You just say that shit to fuck with me
Unlucky me, I listened girl
Damn, I really wish you wouldn't say that shit
'Cause I swear every time you say that shit
Swear the room move in slow motion, I don't know how to control it
When you say that shit, yeah, I can't figure if you love me or it's nothin'
Let me know because

[Chorus]
It's all how you say that shit

[Verse 1: Drake]
Side pieces
I know that you're watching this from home
I can't wait to see you on the road
Cheering from the shadows I hear you calling out
Wifey sees a text and asks what's this all about
I tell her you're just a friend
A lot of these guys are dying for this song to end
I'm asking would you be mine
Would you get on this flight to Cleveland, Ohio at 2:45
I had a rough game I took two shots I was 0 for 2
Tough day I need that one thing only you can do
Skylar this is the one thing that I'd be for you
This goes out to all my side pieces
Side pieces, side pieces
This goes out to all my side pieces
You know that you'll never be the main one
City to city I see you we're in the same one
Side pieces, side
Los Angeles I want you to make some noise for the real king of side pieces Brian McKnight one time

[Verse 2: Brian McKnight]
This is dedicated to all of the side pieces
I know you'll never be more
And you'll always be less
But there's comfort in knowing that you're okay being second best
I already got a starter but I'm looking for the rest of my team
Side pieces in training go on and wave your hands for Drake and me
(Don't be embarrassed)
Side pieces where you at?
(Probably in the top balcony)
I know you're not down here in front of us you got to be way back in the back
(They can't even see us)
Side pieces go on and be, side pieces yeah
Side pieces

[Verse 1]
KD, I know you're here, I know you understand me
Real talent doesn't always win championships
Like real music doesn't always win Grammy's
But we're okay...
Honorable mention works for me and you
Honorable mention, hey, hey
You're lucky that LeBron finally had to lose
He gets an honorable mention, hey
It ain't so bad being number two
Yeah, season's over, just hold on you're going home
Can't deal with life's hurdles like you're Lolo Jones
Series over, feel the sorrow, drink it down
Bartender I think I'll have a Triple Crown
And I'm the only one, I think I'll be the only one

[Verse 3]
You ready
Iggy Azalea and Swaggy P
I love you both, you're like a poor man's Jay and Bey
You know what I'm saying?
Collin Kaepernick you know I love to see you flexing
It's just a damn shame that Michael Crabtree can't catch it
Danica you don't always come in first place we know
But somehow in Nascar you're the only face we know

[Verse 4]
Honorable mention
Honorable mention
Didn't win didn't lose
Just got a honor mention
And now the whole the whole U.S of A are soccer fans too
They get an honorable mention
But even in Brazil inspirational dreams don't always
Come true

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'm screaming free my nigga TIP
Brought him from Atlanta to Philly like Mike Vick
Fighting charges lawyers say that they might stick
I was praying to God, man don't do me like this
The hoes fucking niggas with the bricks
Now they fucking me I laugh dirty bitch
Stay humble even though I know I'm the shit
But if rap don't work out then I'mma get me thirty-six
Or better seventy-two, or better 144
That's four of them you ain't know it
I break it down into O's
And I make it do what it do
That's dirty money get low
And the feds they gon' have to catch me
Or money, power, respect me
Haters used to neglect me
But now they just accept me
Failure is what they expect
The success they see in my necklace
And glory all in my story
A lot of niggas they bore me
It used to ain't matter much, but I hustle like Robert Horry
And know I'm balling like Kobe
Shit change Lebron James
And now I'm getting this money and killing them John Wayne
Now children, my time came up here as fast as a leer
I dare without a fear, they try to box me out square
I ran circles around them and now look at them here
They cheer that I'm on top (Go), busting like I'm a Glock
We busting right out the box
We bust them right out the pot
And went to the jewelry and watch them busting all out the watch
Me perform like a GT trick bike
Say a word I could pull your bitch like
I know sign language, we call it shine language
Let the swag talk, she say it's the swag fault

[Hook: JI]

Pull up in the 550 looking like a wagon

Now I'm back up on that G shit
Filling up like three clip

You highness, I'm as hot as a volcano
Give your bitch pipe work like drain though
Aye ho, I roll in then roll out

Pow! Talk that shit, nigga, now
Get your ass gunned down, nigga, this my town, I run it
Sucka nigga know he don't want it

Pray to God, may I die, let 'em fly on my opponent
Hol' up, we will roll up, hop out of that Corolla

Beat the pussy nigga with the baseball bat
Pull up with them F&Ns comin' out the hatch
Pussy mothafucka scared to say it to my front
So I'm blowin' out his back
Point it at his liver, make the nigga reconsider
Bands in my pants got me lookin' a little bigger
Red just like Elmo but I never fuckin' giggle
You can suck my pickle for a nickel

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Eww, eww, eww
Eww, eww, eww, eww

[Verse 3: Zuse]
Catch a motherfucker at the stop light
Point, point, point, hold the Glock tight

Niggas want beef, where my hot fries?
Cross me, nigga, get baptized
Yes, motherfucker, I'm the bad guy
Blow you away like a landmine - dead, flatline
I'm a God and I put that on mankind, huh
Bullet turn you into stop sign, huh
Swat a pussy nigga if he that fly
Light a nigga up, me no talk and beg
Crack a nigga up like the yolk out a egg
Smoke a nigga out like an ounce from a dread
These niggas straight pussy, ain't vouchin' for them
Ice cold nigga like a motherfuckin' gem
Branch out, nigga, like a motherfuckin' stem
Cut a nigga off, ain't tied up for them
Tell a bitch nigga I'm fire with the pen
Lay a nigga down, watch him die at the end
Four-five nigga, it's a nine, that's a ten
Pussy on my dick, you and I and my friend
Which one of ya'll wanna try this again?
Which one of ya'll wanna try me again?
Big body six, I'm high in the Benz
Flippin' the flow, on timin' again
Riggidy ruggidy rhymin' again
Pussy nigga, it's applying to him
V-I-P, ain't no line in for him
Fuck around, nigga, your chances are slim
Flexin' on 'em, exercise in the gym
Ballin' on 'em, got my hand in the rim

Light skinned 32, that’s my old school chick
Why you hating, the money that I’m making?

Going hard for the money, like what I wouldn’t do
The shit all on these rappers like a fucking number 2
I say I be coming through, Rolex be summer blue
Fresher than Will B, my homies be stunting too
And I brought the mac with me, and I ain’t talking Charlie
Harley, them shells smoke you, Bob Marley
Gnarly, I’m cooler than that white boy, surfing
If you throw your chick at me Imma catch em

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
We get money ball hard
Get money ball hard
Get it, get it
As I was riding through the city in my S550
Bad bitch nice titties ass fat like really
Quiet chilly cause I ball Audemar like 20
And the diamonds on my neck be dancing on her get silly
Get with me, this Philly at its fineness I'm you highness
I'm a plus but you're a minus
Shorty blush but never mind her
Cause my mind be on the money and there's money on my mind
And I be in the mix like water
Not at all could you find it
But you see I be VIP
Hit the club don't need I.D
We stepped in when we leave like three
She came with you but leave with me
She ain't go to know the alphabet to know the CMG
We pull up in the GMC
Me lil' Dolla T.I.P
Aye, so get them the baddest bitches with them
I just bag them then I hit them
Check and add them to my list
And I don't love them I don't cuff them
Fuck them pass them to my nigga
And the newest Prada kicks 

[?]

[Hook: Meek Mill] (x2)
We get money, ball hard
Big business, all large
So when them haters hating tell them hate some more
We balling on them suckers popping on that Ace and more

[Verse 2: Dolla]
Fly guy grab a ho to a wing
Have a one night fling

[?]
Standing tall like Kareem

Fifteen years, gun hold never scary
Next time you see him he'll be in the obituary
Shorter that February, valentine ass nigga
If I got a CAT scan see dollar signs nigga
Money on my mental, Bently continental
She say she want my big money, dolla dick what I give her
Y'all niggas catch up the Chevy look like mustard
Inside mayonnaise get lettuce I'm a hustler
Toaster turn you into cold meat have a burger

Fucking thick high yellow bitches somewhere out here foreign soil

[Hook: Meek Mill] (x2)

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I said I pull up to the scene so fresh so clean
That 7 4 pound with the window rolled down
Like 50 on my neck feel like the king no crown
I be Pradad down to death and all my gear be low down
Red horse, red strip, red Porshe, red lights
Tell me stop cause I'm killing them
Got change like a chameleon
And them lames they not feeling them but tell them keep hating
Praying on my down fall tell them keep waiting
I be here I be there
With the rocks don't ride no where
I'm so fly when I go leer
Why would I lie no I don't care
I ride that five without no fear
Keep that chopper on deck
If a nigga run up on me hit him up with no rap
We get money and ball hard

[?] be all raw

And we take it to the block bring it back and its all ours

[Hook: Meek Mill] (x2)

[Hook: Meek Mill] (x2)
No we don't play that, no we don't no we don't play that
We creep low on these haters we see them its homicide
That chopper get to rocking approach them the hollows fly

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Death to all Po
Green grass roses, from where the summer nights can get the coldest
When them goons come out you pussies getting nervous
But they know somebody about to get murdered, you heard me
All black mini mac whole fifty
Four pound spin a nigga around like he dizzy
I look a nigga square in his eye see if he strizzy
If he ain't walk up on him snatch his life like gimme
Its going to be a murder if I get the word of
Niggas talking reckless about me
I show up to your crib Glock Rugar 

[?]
Niggas aiming at your head trying to catch a first degree
Blat!

[Hook: Meek Mill] (x2)

[Verse 2: Chinko]
I don' even have to trap I shoot the dice off
Day a nigga ask get cracked that's a fact
I keep this forty under the bed one in the head
Ready to go letting them know don't bring it here
You got a problem with ok we can handle that
Never been scared I've been prepared for the combat
Let them attack watch them counter react
Like an animal ain't too many niggas that can handle you
They thinking that its bullet proof but I don't think they bullet proof
Let's see how bullet proof you are when I put this bullet through your roof
Cal 40 barking like a Rottweil
Howling at the moon I'm a goon I be outside

[Hook: Meek Mill] (x2)

[Outro: Meek Mill]
Y'all ready
This it we rolling
You know what I mean
About to get the fuck out of here man
Had to do a little damage
Hold y'all down to Flamers 3
I know I came a little late
But this just the warm up
You know what I mean
You know how the basketball players come out and they just shooting around
Dunking and shit
Doing layups, this the warm up
Get ready for Flamers 3 nigga
October 20th
Is you niggas hating cause you mad or is you mad cause you hating
Flamers!

[Verse]
Yo it's the Lake Shore Drive
Keep it live, tight, raw
You better hurry up, they can't keep it in the store
To be the format, your whole style on one beat
Insert the disk, watch a nigga press delete
Tryna flex your technique
You gettin' blasted with a TEC, that shit is mad ironic
Like Alanis Morisette, you try but can't jet
Bunch of airline lyrics, rhymes for low fare
Flyin' out of O'Hare
While these no-name ass niggas wanna go there, nobodies
Livin' three blocks from nowhere, down the street from nothin'
Let me show these niggas somethin', visual aid, the page
And the nigga who fronted, word to God, they don't want it
But they wanna play the role, actin' hardcore
Watch the whole career, flow, my style is too cold
Always, forever like Luther, but it ain't original
Because I stole it from the future, now I'm wanted in three centuries
The verbal killin', ask me where I got the style
Told 'em from my grandchildren, put it on files
Document it in the books
You niggas can't see me so cease the hard looks
I'll rather it get took
Live and die for rhymes, dedicated to hip-hop
Shit don't stop
Niggas they wanna know what and who's next
And you roll up in a Lex
That's the train stop, my brain drop mad lyrics
I rhyme with the spirit off the top, I drop nonstop
Verbally killin', my style is ready to willin'
Y'all niggas stay back chillin'
Like EPMD y'all niggas ain't seein' me, what
We're enormous, nah, do or die
I got the rhymes on the brain
They tried to bomb me on the plane so I rode the train
Before I got here, spawned here
I'm 'bout to save this shit, yo it's my year, what!?
Bring it on, pass it to my man Tariq
Rock the mic all week

[Intro]
No more pain though
No more motherfucking pain bro, no more motherfucking pain bro

[Hook]
No more pain bro, no more pain sis

[Verse 1]
If you not from Haiti don't go there
If you not from Bleveland don't go there
Yes I still got boots, what size you wear?
You can be a stranger and still get a pair
We don't grab on 'em, we got halves on us, we got math on us
And that jewlery super water, we got baths on us
When I pull from out of school we got staffs on us
We got math on us, You know we up, I ain't talking bout no Folgers
We get 10,000 pounds of midget
The way she walked up on the plug I really thought that baby knowed us
But she just wanna fuck them digits
She know exactly when to start and when to finish
She know how to get that dick back hard within a minute
I try to play hard, she see right through me just like lenses
She tell Young Thugger to put it up cause she got plenty

[Hook]
No more pain bro, no more pain sis
They just lame bruh, make your lane sir
I got my money right cause I was sick and tired of it
I'm standing in the rain, I know you feel my pain through my veins
Oh yeah, I'm like oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm like oh yeah
Baby I'm like Ooooh yeah, oooh yeah
Ooooh yeah, oooh yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm gon keep racing to the top of the mountain
These niggas knocking me down but when I get there I mount
Enjoy your visit, this my decision
You know my brodies right behind me and they with it
I miss Unfoonk he just waiting on my visit
I'm scared to go down there, them folk might just railroad the cheeks
I know he not a white line, but I had to take him off the street
I miss my brother Unfoonk, he can't do nothing but sit and eat
You know I miss him, that shit happen way too fast I wanna kiss him
Every time I talk to him I wish I had a missile
Just sitting back thinking like what'd he be like on them crystals
That nigga a fool with it
He got a big ol' bank roll and a tool with it
You run up on me bruh the wrong way and he gon' use and abuse
But he might got 2, he gon' use, April Fools
Then sit back and watch the ambulance clean up you

[Hook]
No more pain bro, no more pain sis
They just lame bruh, make your lane sir
I got my money right cause I was sick and tired of it
I'm standing in the rain, I know you feel my pain through my veins
Oh yeah, I'm like oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm like oh yeah
Baby I'm like Ooooh yeah, oooh yeah
Ooooh yeah, oooh yeah

[Intro/Interlude]
Could it be it's just that simple now? (x2)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, we want that monotone, monotone
And that's why we all paid this hard-earned money to get packed up in this Thunderdome
I'm like "What is wrong? For Pneumonia?" cause, man, I spent my whole check
To hear you talk about yo' life and how you got my check round yo' neck
We want that monotone, monotone, yeah, yo' album live and all
To be honest, I ain't think that you were performing live at all
And God forbid you do it right or how it ought to be sung, nah, nah, nah
(I'mma need you to do that shit at the top of yo' lungs)
But I guess, if yo' shit was gonna be monotone, I coulda just
Saved my check and listen to yo' songs at home cause let's be honest
I could throw my iPod on and the place'll go stupid
And I'm lookin' at you, kid, like "I wouldn't let you on for nothing with that bullshit you just did"

[Bridge]
But you just laugh, throw money, watch the bitches scatter
Cause it worked before so why not follow the initial pattern?
So, while you on vacation, I'll be at home, alone
In my mirror with a brush and a comb
Singing that ol' independent song like
Man, man, man, I wish I was you
Or at least on yo' level, man, I'd diss the shit outta you
I don't know if you work tonight, shit, that ain't my business
But I swear I'm gon' make it, I got God as my witness

[Hook] (x2)
I'm gon' see you on my way up and see you on yo' way down
Cause right now, I'm just another nigga in a hype crowd
And you don't even know that I been plannin' yo' demise
So I'll advise you keep yo' eyes on the prize cause I'm on the rise

[Interlude/Intro]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we want that monotone, monotone
Oh, you better than the peons? And at the end of the night
You gon' find a bitch with a switch you can pee on
Oh, you one of them niggas, huh? You laugh cause it's funny
And I'm one of them niggas like (They should've never gave you niggas money)
But I done it, made it to the front row and you don't wanna look at a nigga
I'm making eye contact like a nigga got on five contacts, I want my $99.95 back
You hide in the back cause you tired, out of breath and shit
You better be glad I paid money, I woulda been left this shit
Motherfucker, you got fans and we got out motherfucking hands up for everything that you sayin'
And we wanna be appreciated, I borrowed 20 bucks, I'mma eat the aided
So you can at least say "Hey, shit", I'm tryna be like you for my three lil' babies
Jerome and Tanik' and Casey but you looking at me like I need to face it

[Bridge]
Fuck my situation cause you just laugh
Throw money, watch the bitches scatter
Cause it worked before so why not follow the initial pattern?
So, while you on vacation, I'll be at home, alone
In my mirror with a brush and a comb
Singing that ol' independent song for what?
Man, man, man, I wish I was you
Or at least on yo' level, man, I'd diss the shit outta you
I don't know if you work tonight, shit, that ain't my business
But I swear I'm gon' make it, I got God as my witness

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Walking between the microphones
Is really awkward

[Song cuts off]
Tell me about it!

[Skit 1]
WOMEN ARE STUPID!
...Shut up!
You know it, I know it, that they're the weaker, dumber sex. I can prove it to you
I like to practice safe sex, why?
Because I'm a guy, and I'm smarter, obviously
What do women say, with their small brains, every time I put on a condom? What do they say, every time?
"Why are you wearing a condom when I'm fucking you with a strap on?"
"To be safe, bitch!"
Right? They're the- They're the stupid ones
I think it's time for a story, let's do a story

[Verse 2]
It's time for a story, it's time for a story
A very special story especially for you
It's time for a story, it's time for a story!
Sit down and listen, now don't be a Jew

[Skit 2]
This story...
It was a glitch, you can be Jewish
This story is called "Andy the Frog", featuring long and convoluted similes. Now I’ll warn you when one of those long and convoluted similes rears its old figurative head. So here we go
Once upon a time, there was a frog named Andy
Andy lived at the Patten Park Pond and had never hopped anywhere else his entire frog life
He had 3 best friends
Millie- who never left her lily pad
Billie- who was always hopping mad
And Roger- who was arrested for possession of tadpole porn
So one day, Andy saw something hop across the grass on the other side of the pond!
"Millie, Billie, Roger, look!" said Andy
Across the pond stood the most beautiful frog that Andy had ever seen
"She's gorgeous!" said Millie
"She's beautiful!" said Billie
"BIT OLD FOR MY TASTE." said Roger
(Classic Roger.)
And then she was gone
"I need to go find her," said Andy, "I need to follow my little frog heart."
So Andy followed the beautiful frogs footsteps into the forest
He then came across a turtle
"You can't pass!" said the turtle
"Please?" said Andy
"NO." said the turtle
(and uh, this is the first long, convoluted simile.)
Then, there was a rustling in the bushes, and like a man who had been shot in the chest with a rifle, the turtle was shot in the chest with a rifle
Andy kept moving, but at this point, like the doctor of a Kenyan track team, his patience ran thin
Andy kept moving
He then came across a giant crocodile, and the crocodile began to chant:
"I woke up this morning and I sat on a log, I opened up the menu and the menu said frog!"
Andy said, "NO! No, please let go of me, I can feel myself dying, you're ripping up my insides, I'm never gonna find her am I, there's no god is there, fuck, fuck!"
The End
(If you're curious the moral of that story is irrelevant because we're humans, and it was about a.. why would it apply to us?)

[Verse 1]
I got a killer pack of ganja screamin out cowabunga
Ferrari boy baby yo nigga still drive a Honda

A granny I'd like to fuck, ooh
Come use my cane

Now come and drink it up
Doo-doo in that diaper
Girl you stink it up
Hit it from the back

Don't make me soft
Our age difference
A big deal, but if
You let me eat your ass
Then you can suck my dick
Stop playing girl
And come here cause
I'm already hard

[Hook]
Girl, I know you wanna
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck me

Come through take a bit boy
Aren't you glad I'm destroyed

Don't think much of myself

Still just your speed dial whore
Tell me who you want me to be
Gave you the best of me
Still want the rest of me


I wanna be involved in all your dirt
And I wanna burst
Inside your veins and rain like
Blood all over your face
Like
Cum all over your face
I wanna feel for you

Got yo bitch inside the office
She ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
And we show out in the club
You know they lettin' us, lettin' us, lettin' us

[Verse 1]
I'm on a Harley David, I got a choppa on my seat

I feel like Tom Brady
I got them nines on my feet, nigga shut up
Young Thug on a high-speed chase
I'm not gon' let up, let up, let up
Take the penitentiary chances
Tryna run up on my funds
Young Thugga pimping, bitch
Feel like fucking Don Jon
I know plug talk language, Thugger Casciano lingo
I got my Trayvon hoodie on
She still see me, she no bingo
I feel just like Birdman
Put my steering wheel in middle
D Kizzle got my spot fizzle with bizzles, can you dizzle?
Yeah, Dk got my spot filled with bitches, can you dizl?
You talk a million dollars, where your paper and yo pencil?

[Chorus]
Fish scale? Oh, yeah
They sell? I bet
Got Boy? Retail
Mexico, next to go
Whenever God give me my moment
I ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
Hundred bands inside my coffin
I ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
Got yo bitch inside the office
She ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
And we show out in the club
You know they lettin' us, lettin' us, lettin' us

[Verse 2]
I feel like Tarzan
Might spot filled up with trees
I got a newer plan
Motherfuck the streets, take over the beach
And this is fuck insane
I build a kinsel and a man
Bitch ain't got no class
You know we call her truancy
All the flesh be like "B-L-A-T-T"
You know my jewelry, ice and water like the AC&T
My bitch bad but I'm the bomb, I'm like TNT
You wanna race? When they say "start" I'm at the END
She need a trophy 'cause I nut on her just like Milla Vanilla
I drink that Actavis, yo Sprite look like it got Starbursts and Skittles
I got a big mink on, I'm a walking gorilla
And we takin' all these bitches, man these niggas gon' kill us (Ha)

[Chorus]
Fish scale? Oh, yeah
They sell? I bet
Got Boy? Retail
Mexico, next to go
Whenever God give me my moment
I ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
Hundred bands inside my coffin
I ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
Got yo bitch inside the office
She ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
And we show out in the club
You know they lettin' us, lettin' us, lettin' us

[Verse]
The blonde in the bleachers, she flips her hair for you
Above the loudspeakers, you start to fall
She follows you home but you miss living alone
You can still hear sweet mysteries calling you
The bands and the roadies lovin' 'em and leavin' 'em
It's pleasure to try 'em, it's trouble to keep 'em

[Chorus]
'Cause it seems like you've gotta give up
Such a piece of your soul when you give up the chase
Feeling it hot and cold, you're in rock 'n' roll
It's the nature of the race
It's the unknown child, so sweet and wild
It's youth, it's too good to waste

[Outro]
She tapes her regrets to the microphone stand
She says, "You can't hold the hand of a rock 'n' roll man very long
Or count on your plans with a rock 'n' roll man very long
Compete with the fans for your rock 'n' roll man for very long
The girls and the bands and the rock 'n' roll man"

[Intro]
Emelline
Emelline? Emelline, haha
Emelline...

[Chorus]
Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)
Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)

[Verse 1]
Get tipsy, tricksy, Dixie
Burning colors in your brain
Emelline just ruled the world, and it won't be the same
Unknot your lips, embrace the trips
And tend after your tails
Or tie me to the kitchen chair if all else fails
Acoustic treats, sadistic beats
Get your shoes, move your feet
Emelline, you're running out of time to impress
Take off your dress and let them look at the scars
From when you met the stars in the backseat of your car

[Chorus]
Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)
Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)

[Verse 2]
I know you lie, Emelline, with your lips
Standing like a dollar glass around your neck
Just cover it up
Put on your spectacles and be a good girl like mommy said
Don't let the pills affect your head
Keep your eyes wide and secretly smile
And everybody will try to connect with you and adapt to you
They'll want to dance with you
They'll have to crawl across the room just to get to you, wow!

[Chorus]
Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)
Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)

[Bridge]
Emelline
Emelline, Emelline
Emelline... Emelline (woo!)
You've got your Emelline
I've got an Emelline
You've got your Emelline
I want you, Emelline

[Chorus]
Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)
Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)

[Outro]
Emelline, haha uh

[Verse 1]
The preacher talked with me and he smiled
Said "Come and walk with me, come and walk one more mile
Now for once in your life you're alone
But you ain't got a dime, there's no time for the phone"

[Chorus]
I've just gotta get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on

[Verse 2]
I told him I'm in no hurry
But if I broke her heart, then won't you tell her I'm sorry
And for once in my life, I'm alone
And I gotta let her know just in time before I go

[Chorus]
I've just gotta get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on

[Verse 3]
Well I laughed, but that didn't hurt
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
Now I'm crying, but deep down inside
Well I did it to him, now it's my turn to die

[Chorus]
I've just gotta get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on

[Outro]
I've just gotta get a message to her
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on
I've just gotta get a message to her
Hold on, hold on

[Pre-Chorus]
Blow, weed, coke, pop X
Speedin' up the heartbeat bangin' in my chest
When you put it on me you relieve my stress
You got me so high, takin' deep, deep breaths

[Chorus]
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high

[Post-Chorus]
You get me so high, you get me so high

[Verse]
You got me so turnt up

Just spark that let's get burnt, uh
Then we'll roll up

You got me so high, takin' deep, deep breaths

[Chorus]
You get me so high, you get me so high

Six hits, ten pounds, gone off Patrón
Six hits, ten pounds, gone off Patrón
Six hits, ten pounds, gone off Patrón
Gone off Patrón, gone off Patrón
To my beloved fans, it truly breaks my heart that I won't be able to perform as planned at Wireless and Roskilde this weekend. I got sick a few days ago and although I am on my way to bouncing back, my doctors have made it clear that I am not physically fit to fly or deliver the performance my fans expect and deserve from me. I will be focused on resting for a quick recovery. I have the best fans in the world and I can't wait to come back to make more incredible memories together

[Verse 1]
I'm Addy'd up, add it up, I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous (oh!)
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dyin'
Shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private (oh!)
My flight too private, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet

[Chorus]
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like

[Verse 2]
Don't be mad, let her get hers
Don't be mad, let her get hers
She made her own luck, she don't give a fuck
She's tryna have fun, take a break from the love
Man, your girl so bad, let me get her
Your girl so bad, let me get her
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
On call till the fall, he can like it or not, nigga, back the fuck up
If you ain’t with me, motherfucker, you against me
If you ain’t complimentin' nigga, you offendin'
I've been out here last year wasting hella time
XO is the only time invested
Them Fall shows every year like a birthday
And I'ma do it every year in my birthplace
And I ain’t been this gone since Thursday
I never said that I’d be sober in the first place

[Chorus]
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like

[Post-Hook]
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like, mm

[Verse 3]
I just passed that "nigga fell off" stage
Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now that word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be soundin' like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all love now
Shout my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow

[Outro]
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, I make all of them swallow
All of, all of, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, I make all of them swallow

[Verse 1]
Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing the national anthem
Buy a white sweater for the last white day of the summer
Buy my purple wig for my mermaid video
Walk back to where I live in my motel on Neptune (Avenue) Avenue

[Chorus]
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say, "Take it off, take it off"
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say, "Take it off, take it off"

[Verse 2]
(Maybe we could go to) Suede, Tokyo
Or see Van Halen at their reunion show
Heavy metal hour on TV
Diamond Dave and Ray Lee
And you salute me, Miss America
Because I am, I am

[Chorus]
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say, "Take it off, take it off"
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say, "Take it off, take it off"

[Verse 3]
Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing you to sleep
God bless the universe, God bless the ocean
God bless you, and God bless me
God bless you, and God bless me

[Chorus]
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say, "Take it off, t-take it off"
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say, "Take it off"

[Verse 1]
Hello, my name is Mark
I play gentlemen's games
And I just slip through and creep in
Through the night's parade
I shake a hand or two
I tip my hat to you
I'm always runnin' and a-jumpin'
Like a fool who would do
On through the wild, I see her
She sees me, we could be
Something, it's exciting
Wanna run away
But I don't move, I stay
I talk to her, I say
Y-y-y-you were meant for me
Oh, I can't speak, I think I'm falling in love

[Chorus]
Love, love, love
It could be a wonderful thing
Love, love
It could make you crazy

[Verse 2]
Sarah, she's a cougar
Got moves like barracudas
On the hunt for the runts
That look under twenty-two years
Got her head up high
High heels that match her thighs
And she be spending lots of money
Her friends think she's real funny
She says, "Hey, look at me
You will see that I'm a queen
Got experience to give
Of a life you never lived"
But all the boys just run
She never has her fun
Oh yeah, but Sarah, she don't care
She keeps looking 'cause she's hoping for love

[Chorus]
Love, love, love
It could be a wonderful thing
Love, love
It could make you crazy
Love, love, love
It could be an incredible thing
Love, love
And if you have it, it's amazing

[Bridge]
Ooh
Yeah, yeah
Ooh
Yeah, yeah
I got the fever, got the fever, got the fever, I said
She's got the fever, got the fever, yeah, I'm falling in love
He's got the fever, got the fever, got the fever, I see it
They've got the fever, got the fever, yeah, I'm falling in love

[Chorus]
Love, love, love
It could be a wonderful thing
Love, love
It could make you crazy
Love, love, love
It could be an incredible thing
Love, love
And if you have it, it's amazing, yeah

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I got all these J’s rolled up

You and your friends
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends, woah

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
You and your friends, up in my car
Rolling up J’s, flying with the stars
Don’t gotta ask the price ‘cause you already know
Watch full of ice, no light it still glow
It's you and your friends, me and my dogs
Left your nigga to be with my squad
He talk a lot of shit, but he ain’t really on
He hit it too soft, but me I go hard, like
Oohy baby, when you with me you go crazy
I want you to be my lady
Girl you could bring your girlfriends, I ain’t hating

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I got all these J’s rolled up

You and your friends, woah

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I’m parked outfront in a Range Rover
Coke white, so tight, game over
Coupe to the block, bop to the bang
Car full of girls in a blue Mustang
Four y’all, more y’all, caravan
V.I.P model in hand, bottle in hand
Wobble again
I make it crack in the back a Benz while cracking the frame
On the highway, just me and Wiz
With a dirty dozen, about to handle this
Was they cousins or was they twins?
I love it when they both go all in
Like that, this one and that one
See he wants the cute one, I want the fat one
Does she pay what she weigh?
I’m looking for a Jennifer Holiday in my way

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I got all these J’s rolled up
And I got all these drinks poured up
I bought all these bottles up in this club
Came here with all of my dogs
But I’m tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends, woah
I got all these J’s rolled up
And I got all these drinks poured up

Came here with all of my dogs
But I’m tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends, woah

[Intro]
Yeaaaah bitch
Wolf Gang
Sweatshirt, uh
Ho

[Verse]
Ninety-four rap music, beat a preacher's ass to it
Pigeon blood will leave the stool wall shitted up
Shit talk myrtle fuck, get your sister fucked
Shit, i hit the stripper up then go and pick a stick inside the fucking pots where we brew them bitches up
Rip your writtens while my niggas splitting, splitting blunts
Eyes hazed with my middle finger up a stripper's cunt
Lights down, lit her up, sherm in my sippy cup
Ice picking cripples till I get my pickle rub
Catch me popping pimples, telling bitches triple 6s
Stab 'em with pencils in their temples till my dick erupts
It's really fucking simple, slut
Wolf Gang, get with us
Either that or grab a full fist of nuts and lick 'em up
Turn it up, fisticuffs, give them bitches dick to suck
Let them drink the cum out of fucking paper cup
Pours wider than the horse that I'm sniffing up
Leave now if you ain't tryna get 'em titties touched

[Intro]
I welcome y'all to boot camp
Training Day
Fasten your seatbelts

[Verse]
Who shot ya, I don't know but you're best to call a doctor
Make sure them rookie medical surgeons can oper-rate on you
Pistol whip break the face on you, shit I does it my way like Sinatra
Let them infrared's Dalmatian dot ya
Scope'll spot ya, move wrong and I got ya
Through my vision like perennial
Creepin' to your house, you hear footsteps slowly as I tippy-toe
The tip I owe is through your window pane, I'm insane
One shot could leave 'em senseless, Marlon Wayans
Psychiatrist can't restrain the mind of a sick patient
Spray everything, not a single bullet wasted
Be patient, you gon' be meeting mad links
Put 'em in the basement
BET, I'm strapped with TNT
Follow rules every morning, this bitch coming with me, ooh
That's what they say when they see me in your coupe
Sunroof, rims spinning like a fucking hoola-hoop
You tried to play big and say "gimmie the loot"
Tables turned, now the people saying "please don't shoot"
Get out the way, lady, and try to make it to safety
Cause I doubt that my shit is on safety
Spray niggas, no ifs, ands, buts, or maybes
Ride shotgun, 745 Maybe
That's Maybach for you dumb motherfuckers
I'm wise like my pops but I'm young, motherfucker
I'm the one, motherfucker, bust around hustlers
You want it? They could serve you, butler
Excuse me Ma, I ain't going for your lover
So when I fuck you, the same time I'm like "fuck you"
You're better off looking for your next sucker
Money talks, I thought you heard Chris Tucker
I ball as if I play for the Rucker
Black Widow, keep something under my pillow to buck ya
He talk about it and when the fifth touch ya, no confession, no Usher, for real
Your whole spot is a movie like Blockbuster
If I want you imma bring it to your block, busta
And make it clap, no I'm not spliff star and busta
In fact, my niggas is linemen the way they rush ya
I keep it street from Compton to Russia
Rhyme technique is something like none other
It's warfare, choke if you scared, go buy a flashlight and pray under your covers
I slaughter niggas, one hand bang, Vince Carter niggas
Young boy I'm a father figure to kids who's minds is bigger
And they pops still sprung off the hardest liquor, I'm young
Please move in orderly fashion
For the love of money and crime I got a passion
Blow your body and spine whenever I'm blastin'
Makeover your whole face, you look like a Jackson
Any one, pick one

[Outro]
Aye
I told you we gonna send you niggas to boot camp
Training Day
Fasten your seatbelts
The ride is rough
Lace your boots too
This is practice right here, we do this shit in our sleep
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You are an art bitch
But I like it
Yeah, I like it
You use your camera as an eye
Taking photographs of everything you see
Making the pain look better
You wear glitter on your face, look like a mess
Back-combed hair all over the place
Out in the fields drinking JD and Coke from plastic bottles
And I admire your individuality
MySpace, PhotoShop
Interesting captions that captivate me every time

[Chorus]
You are an art bitch at heart
But it's wonderful, so beautiful, so amazingly lovely
And I love the way you hate love
It's so refreshingly nice to see it in your eyes
That you mean exactly what you say

[Verse 2]
You are an art bitch
With your plastic bees and your floral pattern dresses
You use your needle and a string to sew up your dreams
Of going to France or New York, or wherever it is
You're gonna get there one day
You hate big-brand fashion, think it's shit
Like charity better, it's much more purer and original
Like your handwriting, which is backwards
And I admire your individuality
Strange kinda dancing like a rock-n-roll Najinksy
Bossa nova be pop like, like 10 years ago

[Chorus]
You are an art bitch at heart
But it's wonderful, so beautiful, so amazingly lovely
And I love the way you hate love
It's so refreshingly nice to see it in your eyes
That you mean exactly what you say

[Bridge]
They love you in your photographs
They love you in your photographs
They love you in your photographs
They love you in your photographs
They love you in your photographs
They love you in your photographs
They love you, they love you in your photographs

[Chorus]
You are an art bitch at heart
But it's wonderful, so beautiful, so amazingly lovely
And I love the way you hate love
It's so refreshingly nice to see it in your eyes
That you mean exactly what you say
(feat. Vonda Shepard)

The time has come
For closing BOOKS, and long last looks must end
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong
That's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I, would rather let me give my heart
To you, with love

Those schoolgirl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone, yeah
But in my MIND
I know that they live on and on and on and on
But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
WELL it's not easy
But I'll try
If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To you, with love
Those awkward years have hurried by
Why did they fly, fly away
Why is it Sir children, grow up to be people one day?
What takes the place of climbing tres and dirty knees in the world outside?
What, what is there that I can buy?

If you wanted the world
I'd surround it with a wall I'd scrawl
These words withe letters ten feet tall
To you, With love

[Ricky]
Hey Lucy, I'm home

[Lucy]
Oh Ricky, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind
Hey Ricky, hey Ricky

[Ricky]
Oh Lucy, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind
Hey Lucy, hey Lucy

[Lucy]
Oh Ricky, you're so fine
You play your bongos all the time
Hey Ricky, hey Ricky

[Ricky]
Oh Lucy, you're so fine
How I love to hear you whine
Hey Lucy

[Lucy]
Hey Ricky
You always play your conga drums, you think you got the right
You wake up little Ricky in the middle of the night
Stop shakin' your maracas now and just turn out the light Ricky

[Ricky]
I'm sick of Fred and Ethel always coming over here
Cause Fred eats all our pretzel sticks and then he spills his beer
Why don't you serve your casserole and make them disappear Lucy

[Lucy]
Oh Ricky, what's a girl like me supposed to do
You really drive me wild when you sing your babalu

[Ricky]
Oh Lucy, you're so dizzy, don't you have a clue
Well, here's to you Lucy
I love you too Lucy, too Lucy, let's babalu Lucy

[Lucy]
Hey Ricky
You're always playing at the Club, you never let me go
I'm begging and I'm pleading but you always tell me no
Oh, please honey please, let me be in your show Ricky...wah!

[Ricky]
You always burn the roast and you drop the dishes too
You iron my new shirt and you burn a hole right through
You're such a crazy redhead I just don't know what to do Lucy

[Lucy]
Oh Ricky
What a pity, don't you understand
That every day's a rerun and the laughter's always canned

[Ricky]
Oh Lucy
I'm the Latin leader of the band
So here's to you Lucy
Let's babalu Lucy, too Lucy
Everybody rumba!

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[Verse 1]
Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling
All day long my heart was beating
Searching for the meaning

[Pre-Chorus]
Hazel eyes, I was so colorblind
We were just wasting time, oh oh
For my whole life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind, but now I realize

[Chorus]
It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now, I know it was always you, always you

[Verse 2]
All my hidden desires
Finally came alive, oh
No, I never told a lie
To you, so why would I start tonight?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hazel eyes, I was so colorblind
We were just wasting time, oh oh
For my whole life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind, but now I realize

[Chorus]
It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now, I know it was always you, always you

[Bridge]
Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling

[Chorus]
It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now, I know it was always you, always you

[Verse 1]
Blewell jeans, Moby Dick stitching
Trigger finger itching
To trouble one of you niggas
I'm daring one of you niggas to jump
I'ma snatch you out pistol whip you
Then put you back in the trunk
Shit, I'm back in the front
The front page of the newspaper
They say I'm seeing more paper... true
But only if you knew that
I was in your house right now taking the  paper from you
Where ya safe at?
Chick is swinging on the dick like a fucking bat
And catch it all like an umpire
I'ma go hard, rims bigger than the fucking car
Baby girl say why the fuck you even got tires?
I don't know, just get inside
And never question my shit again ho
I fold dough like a notebook
I see money, you pass it up like Magic Johnson no look
Who the fuck taught you niggas how to cook
That's what I'm hearing up in your song
Beat said if you're cooking up the product and your wrist don't hurt when you do it then you're doing it wrong (fucking bidness)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Aye, I wonder would it matter much
If I never fucked and I just fell in love
Or maybe if I never fell in love and I just fucked
I swear, man, shit was simpler when I was sellin' drugs
You ain't know me then though, ain't that what ya think
You was in the bed, I was trafficking the thing
Man after everything we will never be the same
Man I'm tired of tellin' lies, know you sick of playin' games
I remember you got a tattoo, put my name on it
Put you in a wedding dress with a train on it
I went and spent a whole mil just to go chill
In Miami, and I be damned if she don't know my love real
How dare you compare me to dude, girl chill
My piece so close up on it, you don't see what it is
Shawty, I die, kill for you if you keep it real

Girl, together or apart
But you be forever in my heart, I swear
And even if we end up here, I know it hard
I never love that way again, I swear to God
I be breaking down, you be playing hard
She chose to bid it all, watch how you play your cards
Now you runnin' 'round town with education hatin' broads
Going at me, got me hot, but hold up, how is they involved?
And you can't say that I ain't changed
Your whole life since we met that day
And when we get it right, God bless that day
But until then, shawty, I just pray and I just say

[Hook: Victoria Monet + (T.I.)]

[Hook]
I had so much champagne up in the club
And ain’t come up here tonight looking for love
I’mma leave all my problems out on the floor
I’mma drink so much that I can’t make it home
So would you take me home? (Yeah)
I had so much champagne up in the club
And ain’t come up here tonight looking for love
I’mma leave all my problems out on the floor
I’mma drink so much that I can’t make it home
So would you take me home? (Yeah)

[Refrain]
Now we rollin’ up, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Getting drunk, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Crashing a party, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Getting this money, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night

[Verse 1]
Leaving all my problems at the door
Pouring up, soon as you think it’s enough they bringin’ more
Hanging onto what niggas told me “get your paper up”
You work hard for what you got, they could never take it from you
All you need is a little patience, let me demonstrate
All my niggas in the game, we talkin’ ‘cause we been through it
Rolling weed in raw papers, taking shots, gin got me faded
If I get back to your spot, won’t know how I made it
Now I made my way in the game
So much money, don’t know how a nigga stayin’ the same
I’m too straight, I get high all day, I take it straight to the brain
I stay fly all week, like seven days on a plane
Came here to spend it not leave with it
Got KK rolled up, let my team hit it
Some Bombay, let’s sip ‘til it’s mayday
That fuck shit don’t play
(Laughs)

[Hook]
I had so much champagne up in the club
And ain’t come up here tonight looking for love

I’mma drink so much that I can’t make it home
So would you take me home? (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, keep the good times rollin’ and the champagne pourin’
On the plane and I don’t know where I’m goin’
Make sure my team keep ballin’ and the hoes keep callin’
And the money keep fallin’ on the floor
Where you tryna go, only care about what’s in your drink
You tryna go hard, don’t think about tomorrow
Don’t care about what people think
You don’t care about waitin’ outside
You be with everybody up in the front
You yellin’ “face down, ass up” up in the club
And now we all turning up (let’s party)
I’m in the club rolling weed like I’m Marley
Smoking dearly departed
That’s kill, too real, come to me get it started
And The bottles be poppin’ like its 4th of July
We just pourin’ them shots, back shooting corks in the sky
Pouring some for the girls, and pouring more for my guys
Cause we made it my niggas, I just wanna thank my niggas
Hear them niggas talking shit, but they ain’t my niggas

[Refrain]
Now we rollin’ up, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Getting drunk, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Crashing a party, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Getting this money, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night

[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three, four, ow!

[Verse 1: Eddie, Dennis]
People movin' out, people movin' in
Why? Because of the color of their skin
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and I'll set you free
Rap on, brother, rap on
Well, the only person talkin' 'bout "Love thy brother"
Is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learnin'
But the teacher

[Pre-Chorus: Dennis]
Segregation, determination, demonstration, integration Aggravation, humiliation, obligation to our nation

[Chorus]
Ball of confusion
Oh, yeah
That's what the world is today
Woo, hey, hey

[Verse 2: Paul, Dennis, Melvin]
The sale of pills are at an all-time high
Young folks walkin' 'round with their heads in the sky
Cities aflame in the summertime
And oh, the beat goes on
Evolution, revolution, gun control, the sound of soul
Shooting rockets to the moon, kids growin' up too soon
Politicians say more taxes will solve everything
And the band played on

[Pre-Chorus]
So 'round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, said, nobody knows

[Chorus]
Oh, Great Googa Mooga
Can't you hear me talking to you?
Just a ball of confusion
Oh yeah, that's what the world is today
Woo, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
Fear in the air, tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles' new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live is on an Indian reservation
And the band played on
Eve of destruction, tax deduction
City inspectors, bill collectors
Mod clothes in demand, population out of hand
Suicide, too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting, "End the war"
And the band played on

[Chorus]
Great Googa Mooga
Can't you hear me talking to you?
It's a ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey, hey
Let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya
Sayin', ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey, hey (Let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya)
Sayin', ball of confusion
That's what the world is today

[Intro]
It's K. Dot, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, I said Philly
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Who say West Coast niggas don't know anything about real hip-hop?
I'm 'bout to give you a prime example

[Verse 1]
Where my gangstas at? Where my dimes at?
Where my nickels and dimes at?
.45's Mac 10's and nines at?
9 times out of 10 half of y'all will die in this combat
If its 12 of you, shells bubble like Alka-Seltzer
You wanna die? I can help you
Put the rap beef aside and 

[?] the content of the street shit to the block, parental advised
I'm feeling like Muhammad Ali in his prime
Mike Jordan in his heyday
Call me Jeff Gordon in that hard top swerving in between the lines
I'm tryna see a better way, I still feel hatred
Uncle Bobby's still incarcerated, Grandma died in Vegas
Grandpa moved to Mississippi
I really can't tell if dude missed me
Probably stretched out on the floor, with an empty bottle of whiskey next to his earlobe
More reason why my heart cold
Prior to a lot of hatin' going, Feds raided the studio
We tryna do songs, but they ain't listen
They just kick down the door as if they have permission
Why you had to do that for?
I wish Pro Tools was on record
Wish I was sitting in the booth doing the chorus or something
No assumptions, I know I'm nice
I know I'm walking the path of greatness, no compass
Not Atheist, but the bars reside with Satan
Chokin' the mic, releasing my frustration
Rather do that before I catch court cases
Locked up by Caucasians, claustrophobic
Boxed in like a new Porsche rollin'
Stones on my wrist, iceberg, Titanic frozen
K. Dot's in my colon
That nigga, Colon Powell
Modern day war victim
Oh, I'm foul, come join my coalition
No snitch nigga, go join the co-defendant
Feel relentless, new apprentice
King of, comprehension
No competition
Compton's back, pump your fist like this and that
No sumbliminals, I'm listenin', face the facts
You're a disgrace to this rap business
Just a one-man office, you need assistance
Gun tucked, walk in the club, set off sensors
I am a senseless thug, with book smarts
And anybody wanna go at rap legends, without theirself to question
We gave you the self-motivation to be in this profession
Gave you the rhyme scheme before your English education
Exclamation, put it in quotes
I say I'm better than most that say they're the ones that gave 'em swag
The flow, the artist development
Am I who gave you the growth?
You didn't bloom by yourself, somebody had to plant the seed
The sun shine, and now king me
The rapper's rapper, the MC's MC
Kodak moment that's been captured, cheese
I said cheese

[Verse 1]
This is for my mothafucking Compton babies
And all the wild blocks that drove us crazy
Dominguez Hospital born
Niggas dying fast no life insurance
Black ski mask green leaf body bag liquor poured
So much 40 oz poured it's like the curb's made of gold on the ave
Bullets got no names on it so if a girl get hit the response of it was like our bad

[Verse 2]
That's the mind of state, rap niggas meet your fate
Say hello to the hip hop's Norman Bates
I ain't even burn 'em yet
Dave Chapelle these niggas are half baked
Well done when the second first come
I have an acquired taste
I will not let not one MC go to waste
I will eat all day
I will not, cannot lose, comfortable at the top
I'm sittin' down my legs  are crossed like i had (?) shoes

[Verse 3]
I tell dude, i ain't worried about these rap dudes
They're not in my league, the West coast is me
I'm, sub-zero, I put your career on freeze
I put it on Hov like I had (Calvin Jeans)?
I'm nightmare on Elm Street, come right through your dreams and
Delete you like an unwanted movie scene
Say hello to the team, ain't ya?
You're scared ain't ya?
The world is anxious for my LP
Get pop grades, i get an A-plus, you get a D
Fucking failure!

[Verse 1]
Everytime you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out
Everytime you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something that I've been witholding
I'm not like every other girl

[Chorus]
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for

[Verse 2]
So if you begin to think that
My light might be supernatural
I'd have to say you're right
"You're right, mon cher, it is"
I came from a place that your mind can not even imagine
We say "Maha, mahaha, mahaha, maha"
And we sing

[Chorus]
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for

[Outro]
I need your love babe
I need your loving
I need your love babe
I need your loving

[Instrumental]

[Intro: Pitbull]
Mr. Worldwide to infinity
You know the roof on fire
We gon' boogie oogie oggie, jiggle, wiggle and dance
Like the roof on fire
We gon' drink, drink and take shots until we fall out
Like the roof on fire
Now baby give a booty naked, take off all your clothes, and light the roof on fire
Tell her, tell her baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

I tell her baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fireball
Fireball

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I saw, I came, I conquered
Or should I say, "I saw, I conquered, I came"
They say the chico on fire and he no liar
While y'all slippin’ he runnin’ the game
Now big bang boogie
Get that kitty little noogie
In a nice, nice little shade

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said “Walk this way”

[Chorus: John Ryan]
I was born in a flame
Momma said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best, (That's right) you've ever had (That's right)
If you think I'm burning out, I never am (Yeah)
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Fireball
Fireball

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I don’t care what y’all say
'Cause as the world turns, y’all boys gonna learn
That chico right here don’t play, aha
That boy’s from the bottom, bottom of the map
M.I.A U.S.A

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said
“Walk this way”

[Chorus: John Ryan]
I was born in a flame
Momma said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best (That's right) you've ever had (That's right)
If you think I'm burning out, I never am
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Fireball

[Bridge: Pitbull]
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
Now, we're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
Fireball

[Outro]
Fireball
I tell her, tell her baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fire
I tell her baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fireball

[Verse 1]
It's Christmas at ground zero
There's music in the air
The sleigh bells are ringing, and the carolers are singing
While the air-raid sirens blare

[Verse 2]
It's Christmas at ground zero
The button has been pressed
The radio just let us know
That this is not a test

[Chorus 1]
Everywhere the atom bombs are dropping
It's the end of all humanity
No more time for last-minute shopping
It's time to face your final destiny

[Verse 3]
'Cause it's Christmas at ground zero
There's panic in the crowd
We can dodge debris while we trim the tree
Underneath the mushroom cloud

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus 2]
You might hear some reindeer on your rooftop
Or Jack Frost on your windowsill
But if someone's climbing down your chimney
You better load your gun and shoot to kill

[Verse 4]
Oh, it's Christmas at ground zero
And if the radiation level's okay
I'll go out with you and see all the new
Mutations on New Year's Day

[Verse 5]
It's Christmas at ground zero
Just seconds left to go
I'll duck and cover with my Yuletide lover
Underneath the mistletoe

[Verse 6]
It's Christmas at ground zero
Now the missiles are on their way
What a crazy fluke, we're gonna get nuked
On this jolly holiday
What a crazy fluke, we're gonna get nuked
On this jolly holiday

[Intro: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

[Post-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Look at her butt, look at, look at, look at, look at her butt

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Thi-this dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
Di-dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it 'cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun...

[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

[Post-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt (I-ohhaha)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Look at her butt, look at, look at, look at, look at her butt

[Breakdown: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
Little in the middle but she got much back

[Verse 1]
Praise the lord, I was born to drive boat
Feeling like Slash in front of the chapel
I'm leaned back with the Les Paul
Shit I smoke is like cholesterol
Spilled dressin' on the vest at the festival
The best of all, had a midget Puerto Rican at my beck and call
Best believe that there was neck involved
Fucked around and almost wrecked the Saab
Uh, we took acid for ten days straight up in the mountains
Started running with the stallions
Playing frisbee in the West Indies, did the tango with my kidneys
Eyes open, now I know just who my kids need
Rockin' very loose pants, yeah
Rockin' very loose pants, yeah
Buried a million in the sand, by the clock tower
Before I die, take a hot shower

[Hook 1]
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset

[Verse 2]
By chance I seen her in the lobby of the Ritz
With her man, the one that swings a hockey stick
I was wearing all white, and my hair was looking precious
Shit, I might cop a chest and a dresser
A little machine to make espresso
I heard your bitch still wears Ecko
Hide drugs behind the box of De Cecco
Live from the Expo, it's me
I wear the wolf in the winter, steer the coupe from the center
Who gives a fuck, I'm a sinner
I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans
Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin
Bite the eel by the dozen (Got to take it for the team)
Bite the eel by the dozen

[Verse 3]
Pump the bass in the trunk, shit rattled like a baby hand
Except this toy cost 80 grand
And I'm crazy tan, from all the places that I've been
Just from writing words with a pen
Tell the pilot "Land the plane," on Roosevelt and Main
Put a jacuzzi on the seven train
And lay John Coltrane play with that cocaine face
I know your crabs from that Old Bay taste
The brass band was seven pieces, my bitch's name is Peaches
We got twin MAC-11s with the features
Shit you barely got sneaker money
So much dick in their mouths, that's why these motherfuckers speaking funny
You need to speak clearer dear, 'cause I can't hear ya
(I can't hear ya)
You need to speak clearer dear, 'cause I can't hear ya

[Verse 4]
The Magic Johnson of the game
These lames don't want to play with me
Smile on your face, but I really know you hatin' me
I know you mad, cause I'm sick, and it's plain to see
It's me

[Hook 2]
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset

Living on the edge, out of control
And the world just won't let me slow down
But in my biggest picture
Was a photo of you and me
Girl, you know I tried
I work hard to provide all the material things
That I thought would make you happy
I'm confused, can you make me understand?
'Cause I'm trying to give you the best of me
I thought we were cool, maybe I was blind
But never took time to see

[Chorus]
Can you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you wanna leave
Baby, help me
Without you, my whole world is falling apart
And I'm going crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone

[Break]
(Ooh, girl, I love you)
I need you to come back home (you know I need you)
I don't wanna be alone
Why?

[Verse 2]
Girl, I put your love up on a shelf
And I guess I just left it to die
Now we're not together
'Cause I hurt you too many times
And now you're not around
I wish for every moment of time that got wasted
We used it to make sweet love
Baby, be my guide, please take my hand
Want you to know that I got you if you need it
Don't wanna be on the outside looking in
I gotta have you girl, can't you see

[Chorus]
Will you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you want to leave
Baby, help me
'Cause without you, my whole world is falling apart
And without you, I think I'll go crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone

[Break]
(Ooh, girl, I love you)
I need you to come back home (you know I need you)
I don't wanna be alone

[Bridge]
Please stay, don't go
I don't want it to be over
Give me another chance, I wanna be your man
Girl, you got me down here on my knees
Crying, begging, pleading, I'll do anything for your love

[Chorus]
Would you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you want to leave (I don't understand, girl, I'm just a man)
Baby, help me
Without you, my whole world is falling apart
And without you, girl, I'm going crazy
Life's a prison without your love
Can you help me?
Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Can you help me?
Girl, I'll never stop 'cause you're all I got, baby (please stay, don't go, don't wanna be alone)
Can you help me?
Help me understand, I can be your man
It's driving me crazy (crazy, crazy, crazy)
Oh, baby

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Drama be the DJ

Bunch of Philly killers with me they all look like Freeway
I know what we do is wrong
You can catch me in the hood probably somewhere don't belong
I keep with my tre pound long
And Omelly keep his glit
His clip hold like 33 that's three circles from a brick
On some shit, that's your bitch
No it ain't cause she ours
Pull up to the club we be on Banshees and CRs
Ask about us who we are
I'm a young king I'm wassup
I ain't asking for no ride I made it here all by myself
Come for the belt ya for the ring
Ask your ho I do my thing
I was locked up in the pen but still I shine like I was bling
On the block with that Yao Ming
Tryna move that China white
Ya I grind like I ain't even about to blow like dynamite
I'm that Bull just call me Mike
I change hoes just like they're clothes

Nigga run his mouth then then nigga lose his cap
West Philly back block that's where you find me at
State they got my nigga Dean

Show you how we walk them down
No time with them triple beams
I get a jawn break it down let my youngins grind
You see them tres of the meter, and they done with dime
You had your work all week shit I hustle mine

I just hit a lick, all white bricks
Fuck the drought we be flipping like a light switch
Ask my nigga 

[?] he got a 

[?]

I can do it right or I can do it wrong
You buy it soft, try to cook it you be losing homes
Neef Buck told me get them where I fit in
The mac look great but its gorgeous with the clip in
And when it start to ripping, niggas start to scraping
And dipping, hoping they don't catch it in their biscuit
West side of Philly nigga that be me
Disrespect and we check 'em like an ACG
They say your green not fire
Your white not oil
You niggas at loyal when you shining like foil
I got this pretty brown queen, her kid's addicted to chicken nuggets
Used to play college ball, but I'm just trying to ball
I'm trying to sit on leather 'til my time is called
When it is, fuck it, it's been a wild ride
Since '95 with the jean sets
Beamers that lean left, back on the scene fresh
Fuck, I'm on the roof doing squats, ain't no boots in the box
Just some dead white man and his Glock
The Saab is cock-eyed, doing 360s in front of Popeye's
Nobody could control me, Allah tried
But then I ate ribs, fuck, I hate myself, that shit is banging though
Shoot the pistol, bite the mango, alpha tango
Bravo

My mother's fist look like it's coughing, it's costly
Hide the dope inside the four-seat
Hit me on the jet before 3:00, I'm back at 5:00 like basketball team

Window shopping, wiling out in Holland lately
Name embroidered on the napkins and the pillow cases
5th floor view, stare into the square
Ton of flare, fly jackets, rock the Mother Bear
Priceless shit, sharpshooter, precise intent
Pineapple, fried rice, and fish
Carve my niche, movement on the arms are Swiss
I charm your bitch, hit the dealer for the jar to twist
Jogging lightly in an Alfred Dunner, I'm on my second plate
Seedless grapes, Freyja with the Swedish face
My style is dope like a fiend with the 

[?] in his arm
Send the cut chops right from the farm
Sauce complexion like a mirror, fortified with wine
Alfa Romeo Romanos are getting imported by design
Shawty speaking Dutch to me, then pass the dutch to me
So many sons, I should file for fucking custody
Queens

[Hook]
Im working my wrist and Im working my wrist and im working and working my wrist (My wrist)

My ambition as a rider
Yeah, it's my ambition as a rider
Yeah, it's my ambition as a rider
Hey, it's my ambition as a rider

[Verse 1]
Rolling, joking, smoking, thinking how I got here
Loccin', loading toasters, pussy you was not there
Holding, never folding, we was on the top tier
Shackled to our ankles it was like a nightmare
You ever wash out your drawers on the same water you shit?
Doing your push ups right on the floor where you piss?
Cellies with niggas that went to war with the strip?
You got to rumble from night time down to the morning and shit
I'm tryna tell them, forever label me felon
Clutchin' that pistol, God made me rebellious
Fuck with them niggas, teach you a lesson
Fingers on triggers, meet Smith and Wesson
I seen pussy niggas turn on me
Throw the money let it burn on 'em
If I feel like he a threat I put a bird on him
And my young hittas will swerve on him

[Chorus]
My ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, my ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, my ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, its my ambition as a rider

[Verse 2]
Money the root of evil, wait 'til them shooters see you
Lurkin in Grand Marquises, scopin' on you, your people
Made a movie with niggas, murder and you the sequel
Bullets gon' riddle you, they gon' use tubes to feed you
Momma gonna pull the plug
Head big as Hey Arnold's is, full of blood
Smell the death in the air when we pullin' up
Bullets go B-B-BRRRR, fill 'em up
Bloody murder hollow tips out the clip
I repent when I murder opposites
Pick and roll, stop and pick
I reload, spin the corner, drop the shit
And we leave no evidence for residents to grieve 'bout
Them sluggies hit you nigga, breathe out
And keep your eyes open 'til you start to wheeze out
We wipe your mothafuckin' team out

[Chorus]
My ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, my ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, my ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, its my ambition as a rider

Drop this when the sunlight gone
Better run right home when the sky turn black
Screaming fuck five-o til' my line go flat
& That ash gray bimmer
People will be calling at the pigeon coop
Jack knife bitches to they couches in they living room
Ask who the best & I doubt that they picking you
Back like Caillou & the style, I invented you
Act like you don't know the name
Only time I ain't mute
When the choke just stanky
Listening to Pre getting dome while I lane switch
Bitches by the three licking coke off the pavement
Poster child you 'posed to hate me
Bold & wild you broke & angry my nigga'
Name gettin' bigger than the nigga' from 

[?]
Niggas is fake I limit the features I give em'
SWEAT (SWEAT!) SHIRT (SHIRT!)
You know you famous when the niggas that surround you switch
And If they hatin' then they'll pass the titts
Now they houndin' dick & You ain't ask for this
Now you surrounded with a gaggle of a hundred fucking thousand kids
Who you can't be mad when they want a pound or pic
Cause they the reason that the paper in your trousers thick
And They the reason that the paper in your trousers thick
I said, SWEAT (SWEAT!) SHIRT (SHIRT!)
You can tell the reaper I'ma meet him when he send for me
With a cleaver and a thirty & Some twisted weed
I'm thick blooded, let the crimson leak nigga'

[Verse 2]
You used to say you liked violins
And your lifestyle depends on me
And I know it's night time when you get lonely
And tell all your little friends how that bitch stole me
And despite all of the facts that you got phony
You gon' tell em' bout' the night that you exposed me
For the bastard I was & how I probably smashed every bitch
That I passed in the club in the last couple months
Was it worse cause I smashed all the trust
That I earned in the past couple months
That we had as a couple
My absence of fuss was a problem
That we ain't never really get to solve
We just smashed then we scuffled
Try and keep it calm but I snap at you
Now you taking all your property back
And It's obvious that apart from the fact
That we fuck and it’s bomb, man I hate when you home, Man, I hate when you home
And when I'm gone I don't call cause you nag
Man I'm going through the shit & I bought you some shit
What you offering here?

[Chorus]
I decided to stay home tonight
I decided I'ma treat you right
I decided to be there for you
Decided to be on my P's and Q's
I decided to give up my friends
Decided I'ma take you out weekends
Decided to give you a reason to trust
These are decisions that I made for love

[Verse 1]
Enough is enough no more running around
(Searching for what's right here at home)
Because my luck is 'bout to turn around
(And I just can't keep doing you wrong)
Girl, I take it for granted that you will be here always
(Tired of this ego trip)
'Cause soon you'll be searching for another man
And I just can't have that happen to me

[Chorus]
I decided to stay home tonight (woo! Oh)
I decided I'ma treat you right (oh)
I decided to be there for you (there for you)
Decided to be on my P's and Q's (Q's, I decided)
I decided to give up my friends (oh yeah)
Decided I'ma take you out weekends (on the weekends, yeah)
Decided to give you a reason to trust (ooh)
These are decisions that I made for love

[Verse 2]
Now I've had about all that I can stand, no more
(I'm turning in my playa's card)
See I'm retiring from the secret life I chose
('Cause I just can't keep breaking your heart)
It was silly of me to be the way that I was
(First was blind, but now I see)
Baby, soon you'll be saying I'm falling out of love
And I just can't let it happen whoa, whoa I

[Chorus]
I decided to stay home tonight (I decided)
I decided I'ma treat you right (treat you right)
I decided to be there for you (right there)
Decided to be on my P's and Q's (giving up my friends, yeah)
I decided to give up my friends (I've decided)
Decided I'ma take you out weekends
(Decided to give you a reason, yeah)
Decided to give you a reason to trust
These are decisions that I made for love

[Bridge]
(When the morning comes, yeah)
When the morning comes
You see the sun will shine on you and me
(I was on my way)
Was on my way to losing you, (until) until I found reality
(So cast away, oh)
So cast away your doubts and fears
(Doubts and fears)
'Cause from now on I'll be right here, for always
(Gonna be right here)
For always, forever more, I decided

[Chorus]
I decided to stay home tonight (to stay home tonight)
I decided I'ma treat you right (I'm gonna treat you right)
I decided to be there for you (there for you)
Decided to be on my P's and Q's
(Girl, I'm gonna dump my friends, yes I will, truly I will)
I decided to give up my friends
Decided I'ma take you out weekends
(And we're going to be together on the weekend, whoa, whoa)
Decided to give you a reason to trust
These are decisions that I made for love
(See these are the decisions I made because of love, for the two of us)
I decided to stay home tonight
(Get up from this bull and rebuild your trust)
I decided I'ma treat you right
I decided to be there for you
(Yeah, yeah, oh no, whoa)
Decided to be on my P's and Q's
(There will be, no more cheating)
I decided to give up my friends
(No more creeping, no more fucking, no more sneaking)
Decided I'ma take you out weekends
(No no, no no, no no, no no)
Decided to give you a reason to trust
(No no, no no, no no, no no)
These are decisions that I made for love

I'm so nasty how I did them Carmelo Anthony's with the jewelry to match it...
Look like a mural on my chest
Two or three chains I plural the best
Yes...and fresh is how I'm dressed
Floss on a rack, Lacoste on my set
The easy pair of Pradas, the mean three quarters
You know the ankle lengths, no socks wit them...
Aye Stunna, them niggas better pack up
Tell em that your son be out front with backup
Bitch back up

{Verse 2}
And I am, feeling like a million dollars
No, really like a billion dollars
Curt Schilling how I pitch the powder, in a mist of riders
Still sending kites to lifers
I feel like my ice the brightest
Why I feel like my Nikes the whitest?
Young nigga tuned up like Midas
I'm ill like hepatitis, we appeal when they extradite us
Take death to fighters
And even that won't bite us nigga that don't move us
Our backs is glued up we too stuck
And you ask why my bitch stuck up?
Blood, she got crack up her butt
I back up the truck like Sonny in Bronx Tale
Or Gotti in Southside, highly intoxide, That high
Ridin on the Wildside, our side
Tell the law that I'm in a 300 Thou ride
Fuck around and my seats be cow-hide
I'm so country, my flow husky
Repo Man, faget you owe something
He must not know the repocussions
We so struggling like we po'
Cause ain't enough dough to get us equal with the white people

[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
Cops tripping on a nigga cause they know I'm a black man
The flow dirty like a real stinky trash can
Niggas don't really want no problems, I got guns, I solve em
These bitch niggas know I sell crack like concrete
And if you don't believe me, you can find me in the streets
My niggas be listening to fucking N Sync
Mike, Doms The real shit, nigga in pink
Y'all niggas don't got problems ok niggas don't talk none of that stuff
Get muffed, give a fuck

Pussy motherfuckers you need to shut the fuck up
You niggas need to learn me and Lionel in a fucking G rolling on sherm
Smoking PCP bath salt nigga

Muhfucka, what you know bout Weezy huh? Holla at me dawg
I got it, it's right here, listen

[Verse 1]
Holla
I'm off the rocks squat the box don't rock the spot
The Sqad pop 'em I'ma fuck with the hottest
Diamonds droppin’ temperature, bitch I'm one of the finest
And to be honest, I got all these hoes stocked up like sinus, now who you fuckin'?
Ice shining colorful, like a sack of fruit or something
With no heart for bitches like ??? or something
I be the true to nothing thorough nigga, young, raw, and famous
Get money 'til I'm dead or 'til the day of my arraigning
Spittin' game through the platinum smile
You can see the fuck I be saying from half a mile
How I hop out of the colossal Tahoe filled up with models
Poppin' bottles with pussy poppers that gobble until they swallow
See I'm a pimp Playboy when it come to these hoes
Cause all I give is cum to these hoes and run from these hoes
I comfortably roll in the latest sleepy eye Mercedes
Heat up for the haters speed up for the ladies
Miss, so watch your back, and watch your mouth cat
Weezy shit, this our click
You 'bout that? I send my Sqad to where your house at
All of a sudden niggas gs, why the fuck is you trippin'?
I cock and shoot up one of your knees, why the fuck is you trippin'?
You listening? I'm official pimpin'
Be lowkey dippin', Range Ro' be twistin' on blades
I'm O. J. Simpson, pretty limpin'
Big fucking cannon, holding me back
With some shit from off the Discovery Channel on my back
My niggas drowned in smoke, underground, pound daily
My hoes like Nelly cause they go "Down, down baby"
I used to dog chickens, cluck 'em, fuck 'em, and duck 'em
But now I'm more mature, I fuck 'em, fuck 'em, and fuck 'em
Stuck inside of the game for damn near two decades
And I'ma make you see the insides like a x-ray
Aww fuck...
Huh? Drunk off Cris', mami on e
Weezy on e, mami cummin' on me
The diamond long links sparkle, tough in the light
You do a lil' something tonight, I buy you something with ice
And I ain't stunting a price, shawty I can afford it
I been had dough before I was recorded
Started to order you a Mercedes C 240
But I thought it would be more nice for you in a Ferrari, peep me

[Interlude]
It's whatever, holla
I ain't stopping, I ain't stopping
Check it, check it

[Verse 2]
Muhfucka bet' not fuck with this nigga
I'm itching, clutching the trigger
Muhfucka you can end up in a river, shit
I'm like a tornado I’m twisted off of shit
And my pistols off my hip but I give a shit about who I hit, fuck
I'm fucked up, I'll fuck you up for fucking up
Guns up like "What's up?", get your fucking guts cut
Tough luck bruh
Wonder why your bitch act stuck up?
Cause the slut got Weezy nuts stuck up in her fucking butt
Yung mack flip crack quicker than acrobats, get at me man
Look call me Wayne a. k. a. Big Daddy Kane
Nigga can't tell me nothing 'bout the game
Been in that deep shit, every year I'm M. V. P
It's just in me
Rims on the 'Lac like 22 inches
Play with me, I open up your back like 22 inches
Guerrilla pimpin'
And it really isn't wise for niggas to start poppin'
At any given time them niggas could start droppin', peep it
I'm off the strip muhfucka what you want?
This a freestyle coming from off the top out the trunk
Niggas be like Mase and go to Church
But I go to the trunk and then I go to your shirt
Holla at me, I'm the don bitch
Look we can get it on bitch
Gotta get another rap to flow on bitch...
Hold up, aight, aight, aight
Listen, playa, all I do is get bread, I'ma head to them cowards
And if they ever try me, I'll bring y'all the head of them cowards
This big spending, see the heads on them dollars
It's big pimpin', you see your bitch lipstick red on my boxers
Choppers pop at any time for any given reason
Leave 'em not breathing under cement for one disagreement
Freedom, we ride on them bitches, rollin' through sittin' high on them inches
My mission's to make sure Squad get expensive
And if anyone of you niggas better get defensive, your care will get intensive
Shot put humps on top of your head like Bart Simpson
I spark instant, now who want it? I'll light your set
Cause I'm all about money cocksucker, my life a check
I'm spectacular, I let the Tec tackle ya
I spit 16 after ya like I rap with y
Put your chest in the back of ya
You would think a truck hit 'em, it's Weezy, don't fuck with him
Better lock me up or get me to the graveyard quick
Come and get me I spray, spark, spit, it's straight war bitch
Niggas is hoes, like they take long dick
I wave chrome shit at home, shit, make domes split
And may I say these fake niggas on some Ray Charles shit, blind to the fact
9 to ya cap, blat, put your mind in your lap
I ride with the gat for hard times, crimes, and rats
It’s rhymes of the crack, my Sqad, I'll die for that
I climb in the 'Lac, drunk off 190 ?
Don't try me cat, I take this shit beyond the rap
And this Ecstasy is why my eyes are black
Don't like baby moms but the X make her thighs look fat
But fuck the bullshit I grind for scratch, I scrape and scruff, bake and cut
You hatin' us? We tape you up
I spin ya corner make you duck from blazin’ bucks
Bandanas, braids, and cuts, I'm gangsta'd up
Muhfucka

[Interlude]
Oh, oh shit, oh shit
What they want?
I dont think they want Weezy. Do you think they want Weezy?
Check it, check it

[Verse 3]
Lil' nigga pass slow in a S 430, ya ho be like "That's so purty"
Fuck with me I'll show your chest no mercy
Sqad get so dirty, but still we do it clean
Bring action to these fake ass niggas like movie scenes
I pop so much X man I feel like Wolverine
Wake up in the morning, lips burning, can't move my spleen
See this lil' dude is mean, strapped up with tools and things
I'll get you different drugs mixed up like Smoothie King
The heavy platinum jewelry bling over the white tee
Watch your wifey, she's mostly likely to blow me pipey
I'm so exciting
Money, murder, steal, kill, rape
You should do like the Internet and start to Bill Gates
This whole world gon' end up with some bad fucking tumors, listening to these Cash Money rumors
I'll blast, bust, and shoot you, hit your block without the mask, fucking screw you
Treat you like a bitch, bitch look at me while I do you

[Interlude]
Ok, ok, homie, ok
Peep it out, Squiddad
Let me catch my breath, let the Danger track roll
And let me holla at you, now let me holla at you, check it out
S-Q-A-D

[Verse 4]
Don't fool with any niggas like me
We pull triggers like weeds
Swigger off the Piña Colada
Dreams of having cream and the power
You need a problem? I'm the meanest to start with
And got grams the size of the head of Gina on Martin
For any discomfort the Ninas is sparking
Be in your apartment, many assault men and semi-revolvers
Keep it clean, I'm a young Sqad street teen, only into green
If you intervene I'll leave your ass colder than Winter
And y'all just look like bitches
You get fucked then I nut up
And just like bitches, I leave you face down and butt up
Nigga what up? I just bought a record to say fuck Hip-Hop
I spit it for them niggas who grip Glocks
Dip cops, flip rocks, and when the bricks drop
We fix blocks, suddenly watch the income
Fuck with me, watch the outcome
Niggas don't wanna hear the Glock rung

[Interlude]
That's that real shit, that's-
K, ok, ok
Yea, holla at me, holla at me
This for all these niggas, you know me
Listen, let me tell you who the Sqiddad 7 is, bring it
It's Weezy Wee, Lil' Jay, Lil' Tez, Lil' Fee Fee, Lil' Yo, Lil' Sammie, T-Redd
Holla at us, holla at us, holla at us
Can't forget Bidd-Ugg-G, don't forget it
Check it, check it

[Verse 5]
Playboy I pimp huge
See the whip cruise on big shoes
Slide out the shit, cool, frostbit jewels like igloos
See Weezy gets loot, that be why your bitch choose
But dude, I ain't got nothing for her but some dick juice
I stick tools in the pocket of the S. Q. leather
They gon' have to rescue this fella if he stress my pleasure
I tells you once, I'm the don, you can trust my word
I say with a Herpes dick, nigga fuck the world
I be with niggas that could get me years
I be with hoes and bitches that favor Britney Spears
Listen here, you see the Sqad Minked up, Platinum S. Q. linked up
With a freak that drink nut ‘til my dick shrink up
You think it's soft? Let the thing bust 'til I'm seeing pink guts
Niggas watch them pigs come, they trying to sink us
You know who I be, Weezy Wee muhfucka
I ain't gon' stop the flow until the end
K we got a new game, I'm running, punting, I ain't passing the ball
You other niggas just be crashing the boards
With a team full of great players, but I'm a veteran, all-star
And let's be real man, I'm better than all y'all
I'm the truth, I'm the reason, I'm the meaning, I'm the shit
I'm the alleged convict in any Sqad incident
Last name Carter like Vince and shit
But I don't slam balls and goals, my life's money, cars, and hoes
Cadillac white walls and 'Bauds, pimpin' partna
Plus I can get more work out than a fitness doctor
Let's get this partna, I'm the young don these niggas honor
And those of you who ain't cheap can't buy a vowel
It's cause the child's mom will eat me up like Jeffery Dahmer
Libel to find my condom inside of dry vagina
I'm kinda calm, drama goes with my persona
A minor with intentions to harm ya, holla

[Interlude]
Ok, ok
Switch it up right here, switch it up, switch it up
Listen, listen, take this money, make this money, get this money
Puff holla at me

[Verse 6]
Homeboy it's Sqad shit
It's gon' be Sqad shit, swallow it
He who disrespect, hollows follow him
Flash the pistol, watch 'em stop and pose like they modeling
Blast 'em, watch em stop, drop, and roll like they firemen
Seriously man, I got enough money to buy ya men
Turn 'em against you and make 'em kill ya mom and them, don't fuck with me
Buck 50 on the dash of the box but that's only approximately cause it really do like two ?, blue fire
Wrist looking like blue fire
Piña Colada got me spiked like barb wire, Weezy Wee, Sqad rider
Holla at me, you know you know me
Got out the streets and start hustlin', there's still some fiends who owe me
Blow me some dro, nah I ain't smoking I stopped that
My niggas still get puffed out, I catch the contact
I'm kinda fucked up, fuck with me and I ain't gonna leave you kinda fucked up
I leave you fucked up, believe this stuff bruh, it's Sqad shit, bitch

[Interlude]
Oh shit, I ain't finished
Oh shit, I ain't finished
I ain't finished Duke
Check it, listen

[Verse 7]
I come up from a shit deep town, where you hear sounds like "Click", "Squeak", "Pow"
Get down or you dying, niggas tote iron
Got that coke flying like birds, not the ones with feathers, I'm talkin' weight like birds
And you might get served if it’s proper enough
Or find your nerves on the curb if you a cop or something
A baller blocker or something, I'll send your noggin a hundred
Have the whole block sprinting, dashing, jogging, and running
Type of life I live, Gotti would love it
Sqad property buddy, some young niggas with a mafia budget
Can't nobody put nobody above it
And if they do, they find they body with your body above it
Fuck it, let's take it public, nah leave it the gutter
Fuck it, let's go and dump 'em, nah leave 'em in the gutter
Hustler, keep it thuggin', why the fuck you niggas buggin'?
The hot 9 slug it, dug inside of your fucking jucket (jacket)
Call me Weezy you bitch

[Interlude]
Ok, ok
The d. j. just informed me that I got 20 more minutes to rap

[Verse 8]
Listen, I keep the pistol hidden in the big pockets, hear shit cockin'
Better get flocking or get gotten
Dawg I speak with the gun, nigga's holla in the street like "What's up?"
I tell 'em "Chika buck buck chika, get the fuck"
The droughts come bring the pots out, let's do what we do
You fuck with me I send more shots out than D. J. Clue
Now who seeing me? Not a person
Got a personal grudge with these commercial thugs
No studio with me, true
I shine hard and I be flossin' very sweet
But I'm like Iverson dawg, I be ballin' but very street
Keep my name out your yapper, or you gon' have to try to keep my flame out your cappa
I ride around with like two bodies framed on the clapper
The tool cocked for he, do pop for beef, move out for chiefs
Supply two blocks a piece two blocks a piece
My crew watch for cheese and I do stock my cheese

[Interlude]
Dude, dude, who you know fucking with me man?
Check it, check it

[Verse 9]
What up world? This here your people Weezy, holla at the don
Real nigga dude, I promise that to God
When I swallow half the Dom I go loco, stressed, hoping I'm not cursed
Walk around with TECs poking out my shirt
Niggas show off for them hoes, try play hard, with they chest poking out they shirt
Try me and I send shots, leave they chest poking out they shirt
Yes, expect the worst when you fuck with the Squad right
Pull you out your car at a stoplight
Catch you in the waist, make you my height
This shit's not nice, I'll have you chopped twice for a hot price
Or I can take off my ice and hit your block and stop life
Can you see that?
Properly under my seat is where the heat at
Directly in your head is where the bullets meet at
I be that cat who make sure my Sqad ball gracious, 'til the Lord take us
We gon' all get paper, just stay faithful
Cross the gate bitch and we rape you
Ain't nothing sugar nigga we all salt
Fuck y'all and that's y'all fault

Homie I speak for the streets, scream for the ghetto, and holla for my folk
Die for my Sqad, kill for my dough
My attitude is fuck bitches, fuck haters, fuck cops
My real father is a ho, my attitude is fuck pops
I'm living it up in a nice home, riding in trucks, tough drops
And I'm a young nigga, I don't even know how to do the bus stop
But I got my money right
When I hit the club, make it a sunny night
See the fake flossers, bum ballers, is a funny sight
Watching dudes front for these hoes in they Chevy right?
Pull up next to 'em in a 500 bumpin' Betty Wright
Keep my shit spaghetti tight
Playboy put the hood on that
We buy sports cars and put the fuckin' hood on that
My bank got too hot to sit on so I stood on that
Any place, you be careful cause I could own that
Moët and E, I'm good on that
Your bitch looking at me, I should bone that
Y'all niggas know where the fucking don at, holla

[Interlude]
Holla at me, Weezy Wee, holla at me, Weezy Wee

But I'ma switch it up to '99, 2000, 2001

You know the motherfucking whip be cruising on shit, 22's
And hoes be losing they mind, boy

[Interlude]
It's about to come, it's about to come
What y'all want? What y'all want?
Check it, check it
Fee Fee Favorite

[Verse 12]
Flippin' in a whippa
Peel the top back like a zipper
Skippin' on them chrome dip slippers
Rippin' on the lips of a stripper
If that's your bitch mister don't kiss her
If so you might as well kiss a pistol
Cause all I do is shoot off in her whistler
She finna get my name on her shitter
And I ain't even hit her
My nigga Fat did her, and slid her to the rest of the Squidda
Forget her, another bitch just paged in
Weezy blazing, come through in something amazing
I ball so good I need a sports agent
Look at me and squint your eyes like Asains, what's wrong?
My jewelry's like a white boy, always stoned
I got a big home but I'm always gone
That's why your bath towels is always gone
Hoes I meet nowadays panties always gone
And baby after I fuck I'm always gone

[Interlude]
I mean I got a wife at home, you know me, holla, ha, holla
Bitch I can't love you
Holla, hahaha
Listen

[Verse 13]
Homie I go hard, push a whip with no hair on its head
So all I'm feeling is air on my head
With some ho that you might know, she sucking all the air out my head
Meet you close to knock you square out your head
Sip the Cris’ to clear out my head and try to get my loot up
In Cuba with a translator ?? coke newer
Plus the prices is cooler
I come back through the hood with that dirty
And tell 'em I'm like Tiger Woods, all I got is birdies
Got bitches in they 30s calling Weezy poppa
But Weezy not daddy bitch, cause Weezy in and out ya
Weezy never spouse ya, Weezy give shit about ya
And Weezy don't Master Suite, Weezy living room couch ya
How about you be a good bitch, and take these pies I just cooked up
And tape 'em to the pelvis, arm or your thighs
I gets high 'til I can't focus
But a main focus to remain focused, they ain't focused, muhfucka

[Interlude]
Holla, shit, holla, oh shit, oh shit
Boy, boy, boy
Ok

[Verse 14]
I spit it for them niggas who run the corner, palm the revolver with honor
Any beefs involving homie, your momma
Homie we swarm out the Eddie Bauer, thoughts to devour
Spark and shower, we get more stupid than Austin Powers
Smell the aroma of marijuana, Coronas when upon us
We do just what the neighborhood have shown us
We murder opponents and don't think about it, forget about it
Niggas won't do shit about it
Wave the pistol, get the bitch up out 'em
I'm off the hinges, chicks on my dick, proper than Cindy Crawford
Any problems I pop the chopper and knock the appendix out him
Hit the block with bricks of powder
What you know 'bout doing that?
And splitting a key with flour, making it two in fact
Dawg I'm all street, if you want Hip-Hop, here's what I give you instead
I'll make you hip out when them fuckin' bullets dig in your leg
Positive niggas talking spooky, y'all ain't scaring nobody
Y'all love Mos Def, I love fucking John Gotti, holla

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Aight
Listen

[Verse 15]
I wish that there was no taxes, no cases, no police, and no racists
No rapists, wish they had a 700 Mercedes
Wish my Sqad live happy
I wish my kids grow stronger than me
I wish my momma live longer than me
I wish the cops stay off the corner this week
I wish the gutta, ghetto neighborhood hunger would cease
I wish them niggas who ain't got shit would stop hating on niggas who got shit
And you know I wish for Pun, Biggie, and Pac shit
I wish that I could get high but when I'm high I wish I wouldn't get high
Sometimes I wish I wasn't alive
I wish for Heaven gates to enter
Wish for Lakers' tickets at the Staples Center
My seats, floor me
Wish Chris Childs wouldn't of hit Kobe
When I see Lauren, I wish I knew why my heart burns
Wish 22 inch rims wouldn't rub on sharp turns
I wish these hoes stop lying
I wish these niggas stop lying
Wish dope heads stop using, as if they not dying

[Interlude]
Fuck it. That's just some shit I wish for, fuck it

I wish I ain't have to go on tour to sell records
I wish I ain't have to sell records
Fuck, I wish I ain't have a jail record
Wish every bitch gave head
I wish I could've saved Dad
I wish I make money 'til I'm a dead man
I wish my chain wasn't heavy around my neck
Wish hoes wouldn't suck dick and try to kiss down my neck
Wish I ain't have to get locked up for slapping her to the ground for that
Bitch I wish you wouldn't wanna be down for that
I wish there wasn’t no droughts
I wish there wasn’t no fucking coke ??

We bring it to your head and your -
Boy, boy, check it

[Verse 18]
Nigga we peel guns, and homie we fear none
Intentions to kill some, from bitches to children
For real we will come inside of your buildings
With Glocks and M-1s, and pop and then some

Guzzled Belvedere ever since we heard Jay
Be dying the worst way
Who want it? Your bitch, you
Sqad is the official shit
Pistols spit behind little shit
I get a bad bitch who lick
And keep her posted up on the low
She never cook pork but only cook coke
Die for respect and hope, look beyond I’m a celebrity
Hold minds for ransom, head sold separately
I’m a ape dawg
Trapped in the jungle, can’t escape dawg
But I bet you be the last man standing like a 8-ball
And I ain’t worrying ‘bout ballin’ no more, I’m past that stage
18 years old, I got cash that age

And so forever I’ll forever be thuggin’
And if there’s ever any trouble then the metals be bustin’
I swear to God, let ‘em be fuckin’ with me and see something
My Sqad ride, I bet we be up on the street to heat somethin’
We peace nothing cousin, this here is war and we battle
Big guns with deep barrels, bullets leap and leap at you nigga
Bricks go for 10 gs on street value
Patience is fragile, niggas be glad to come smash you
The S Class is casual for the summer
Let me re-deal, I bring out the 64 on three wheels

[Interlude]
Holla at me dawg, holla at me, holla at me

Fuck the laws and fuck peace

But in the meanwhile I’m wild going at it
Fuck it, tryna join my daddy
Automatic weapons, pow
You can call the paramedics now
And if any test the child he stepping on deadly grounds
I’m repping Hollygrove to my fucking grave woa’
And chase dough, slave hoes, and keep my head low
We can’t let the feds know nothing
We keep it quiet as kept
If someone frontin’ you find him dest

[Interlude]
I’m sorry
What the fuck is “find him dest”?
I meant, “If someone frontin’ you find his death”
Death
7, S. Q
Holla at us, check it

[Verse 22]
Pistols burning
Pop the barrel, turning
It got the faggots squirming
We closing any open shop we ain’t concerned in
Coke the size of Sherman Klump we flipped and doubled
And dropped the whip on dubs and dipped in Bubble
Get a bad bitch to hustle and move product
And split them niggas quick as fuck if them dudes try her
Not behind the ho, but only behind the dough
And behind the dough I kill whoever stand behind the door
You ain’t tryna go that route with the Sqad, it’s rough, I promise
We kidnap your mommas and sit our johnsons on her tonsils
We reside inside the S. Q. bombers
And we leave families emotional like Carl Thomas
So stay from ‘round us
And to be honest, ain’t nothing for me to do away with you
I be the same nigga that blow a Tre with you
Then let a K hit you
Fuck you nigga, I ain’t got no love for none of y’all
Make you my underdog, put you under dawg

[Interlude]
Oh, oh that my nigga Six Shot

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh

[Verse 24]
I do just what I motherfuckin’ want
I never live with regrets
I speak from the shit that bleed on the left side of my chest
Take heed to the shit that gleam on the left side of my waist
Or take three to the left side of your face
A multiplatinum artist still riding with TECs and 3-8s
A hustler, you can see the crack residue left on them plates
They fucking with me, I’m predicting death on them snakes
I ride in a frenzy
Ride in a Benzy
Fuck it, tryna fire my enemies
Fire a sack, recline back, and feel me
I spit that filthy shit
That gutta, guilty until proven guilty shit, get back at me
Let’s just spit rapidly at chests, you better fucking halt
Or the Glocks with the thunderbolts make you do somersaults

This is for my Sqad that I usually fools with
This is for Lil’ Jay, this is for Lil’ Yo
This is for Lil’ T-Redd, this is for Fee-Fee though
This is for my nigga Sam, all call him Supa
This is for my nigga Tez, stupid ass nigga

[Interlude]
Haha holla, holla
I was feeling that one, that was real nice
Was real nice
Ok, ok
Listen

[Verse 26]
We carry automatic machine objects in jean pockets
And clocks with beams cocked and fuck with me - seeing doctors
The Sqad be in monster trucks with screens and bobbers
Passing green and brown chocolate like John Stockton
Who stopping these lil’ niggas? Nobody, it’s impossible
Find me in a Benz – aqua blue
Rims colossal dude
And right under the seat’s a Glock or two
Don’t make me pop at you
And got two Hawaiian tropical bitches that will swallow you
People ask me “Weezy, why you do it so big?”
I pop my collar, drop the roof off the 6, then shoot up the bridge
Listen, I’ve had loot since a kid
I ain’t just start having dough
As a matter of fact, I started having dough
I’ma be fancy, send some warnings at folks
Be very cautious or them Glock 4s get pointed at throats
I bet he choke

Nigga fuck with me, get washed away
Glocks and revolvers spray
Cats get they corners blazed
Blast with enormous Ks
Understand Weezy be the don and ain’t no fading him
Play with him, shots turn him dome into a stadium
Beef with me and my gun immediately bust repeatedly
Unleash this pop one in your bitch Victoria Secre-
‘Atures creepin’ without the lights on
Doo rag, G Nikes on
Hope the choir sing your ass a nice song
Niggas ain’t tryna collide with the Squiddad
It is not wise
I’m robbing your block with Glock 9s
Pull out, cock, pop moms
Drop bombs
You niggas ?????????
Sqad bitch, ain’t no replacing me
Come to take shit
We be on some money make shit
Simply basic, you hate I put more designs in your head than Anthony Mason
Have you parents in the front emergency room pacing
Crying an waiting for the doctor to come out and say
“Miss your motherfuckin’ son didn’t make it”, holla
*Moans* all y’all better know no disrespecting Weez’
Come to your fucking street and kill families
Holla at this muhfuckin’ nigga

We on some mob shit
Some lil’ niggas who seem harmless, but nah bitch

Got a young pretty thing sitting beside me in the whip
With Limo tints to hide me in the whip
Told mami you can keep your clothes on, I wan’ see where your head at
In other words I don’t wanna fuck, I wan’ see where your head at
You can catch me laid back in the cut with ounces and bundles
Bouncing from hustles, doubt me I’ll fuck you, fuck it
Lounging in bubble

Fronting get your body found behind some mountains or sum’n
Aye, when you fuckin’ with me you fuckin’ with cheese
You fuckin’ with Streets, you fuckin’ with heat
You fuckin’ with Sqad, you fuckin’ for free
You touching your knees
And if you hate, you’ll be lucky to breathe
Now how you like lookin’?

Despite the business, fuck rap

But the Glock ain’t right for kidneys
I don’t like you bitches, I hate you hoes

Holla at me, I’m still not done
Holla at me, check it, I’m still not done
Nigga holla at me, holla at me
Listen, listen, listen

[Verse 32]
Don’t get it twisted ‘cause I’m younger than most
I come with the toast
Get it hot like summer was close
I’m hanging out the Hummer with Sos’
Exploding missile Glock ringing at the front of your door like Jehovah Witness’
Sober? Forget it
This C. M. B. thing, I’m over committed
The youngest soldier come with it
Cock back, guns put holes in your fitted
Nigga I told you to quit it
I load it with 50
I blow ‘til it’s empty
The dro and Henny got me lokin’ and limpin’
Ropin’ up when I drink ‘til I’m over the limit
Hoppin’ out the Rover with Semis
Wildin’ out, go straight to your momma’s house
With a rag on my face with more 9s than dialing out
Now who hating?
Niggas cheapskating, underestimating
The heat take him, put him under extra pavement
Some one week in Jamaica, come back with a accent like -

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Whoo, whoo, fuck it
That’s 10000 bars for y’all bitches
Holla at me
Weezy Wee, Raj Smoove
And that’s the end of that story
One
Shit
Man, man

Got your bitch trying to slide like she on "Soul Train" (Hoo!)
First pop bottles and then we pop models (Models)
Husky 550 black 'Lac with the goggles
Shit I got these bitches trying to hit me like the lotto
Cause they heard I'm throwing numbers
Tell me get them then I got them (I got 'em)
Got 'em, I'ma get 'em, my niggas gon' hit 'em
Change hoes like they clothes, then every day, I'ma switch 'em
Cole Hamels, I'ma pitch you, my niggas gon' home-run 'em (Run 'em)

Crib super big and the whip is super fast
I'm a super-duper star, I need a bitch, super bad
What it's hitting for? Shawty, what it's hitting for?
I could leave you wet like a mopped-up kitchen floor
Big money, big boys, all we like is big shit
Pockets full of Bisquick, wrist on some sick shit

Everything I touch turn gold—King Midas

West side' till I mothafuckin die
503, that's where I reside
I never do play, with the foreplay
I want the whole cake baby I don't want a slice
Fuck Jermaine
I'm so so Def
Bow "Wow"
Sounds of the bed
Italiano, sexycano
Elegant chick and she pop pelligrino
Thick thick hips up in NYC
She dip dip dip all up on me
European Chick with American Apparel
Use to have a Larry now she got herself a Darrell
Black dick all in ya spouse again
She with me homie 'cause you ain't in her lane
Look, I just wanna chill
And baby keep me curious and let me know what's real
Forreal

[Verse 2]
Polaroid pictures
Peace sign flicker's
Platforms and leather jacket with the zippers
Pharrell hats and  a leather pants
Chanel bags and ya dirty vans
Living so en vogue
Why do I care about what's in vogue?
Boujee ass hoes, man you know what I mean
Montreal bitches with a lot of self esteem
I'm a Rastafari, came to party
White chicks with me but I don't do molly
Wait, wait...
You don't do Molly?
But I don't know if you wanna come with me
Ho
Not at all
Do I do love?
Baby not at all
I'm 20 years young

Fuck a drummer, baby girl can a rapper get some?
Then I pop off ya blouse like a shotgun
Bitch nigga no baby girl I am not one
Press my buttons
Hol' up, caution
I'm the type of nigga that don't play around often
Hit me with a txt and I just might go ass so fat but I know its lypo
Greek chick so she wanna eat my gyro
School chick got me harder then a final
When it comes to the fads I always pass
That shit is for the moment and it never really lasts, yeah

We all en vogue

Got so much money that its coming out my pores
I'm hood rich, but got to have more
I want to make it rain money galore
Got money, got money galore
Got a milli, want a million more
Got money, got money galore
Got a milli, want a million more

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Pockets looking like they was fighting Mike Tyson
Ya I get that cake without the icing
Breitling, VVS in the bezel looking like a piece of lightning
I catch your shorty eye I like oh I think she like it
Puffing on that herbal color Minnesota Viking
Higher than the flight get, flyer than the pilot
I can make those bitches do what I say like Simon
Probably on an island shining like a diamond
Ball like AI, the bitches like I'm 

[?]
You catch me out in Hollywood with K.Dot
Ain't I fresher than I've ever been
Clean like it ain't no evidence
Soon as we step in the door we make that money hit the floor

[Hook]

[Verse 2: K. Smith]
I'm like first things first, I'm all about paper
Now you can call me K or Mr. cribgotacres
Will Smith numbers you ain't even making Jadas
Better yet Jay, little nigga stop playing
Swag like Jay I got a bop like Diddy
Money like 50 but I'm spending big Willies
When I go hard I make you dudes look silly
I got a mansion in LA when I don't want to be in Philly
You dudes look lame so I can see the hating
I'm usually overseas hit the states for vacation
Hot like blazing
And while you dudes got a pocket of cash
I got a credit card that could buy your block and a half

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Critical]
I'm getting money but it ain't from this rap shit
When I walk into my closet I do backflips
My girl like Gucci, Louis, and that Mac shit
So if I ain't getting paper she can't have shit
I take her to the store she like it she can grab it
"That's 25 Critty" fuck it I got plastic
Get what you want, I only spend that on a bad bitch
Treat me like a king cause she ain't ever had shit
Its pretty city let me get back to this cash shit
Pound of dro its wrapped up in the plastic
I'm in the V-twizzy see the cops I gas it
But I'm Frank Lucas got the shit up in the casket

[Hook]
Microphone check 12 or just 1-2
I am me who are fuck you
And I'm 1-2 high you should look up to me
My french girls love it when we smoke the ooey
On bellow fronts I do and we smoke the ooey
I do me she feels me cummin like new teeth
I got paper like loose leaf
Come over here and maybe you can get a few sheets
My bodies unique like the sisteen chapple
Fresh (fresh) 6 pineapples
I should cut myself to see if my bloods red
Baby I brainstorm call me flood head
Married to the money
And if she leaves me bury me money
And when your not good then your arrogance is funny
And when your really rich then asparagus is yummy

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
They used to think that I was dumber and dumber
I use to give a rubber, I'm from Australia like 5 Seconds of Summer
These niggas know what I be doing I run with, I run it
Niggas act like they stunting, niggas know that I'm stunning
I hip hop with that OK
Niggas know that I don't play
Niggas know that I come through
Niggas they be like "fuck you!"
Fuck you, I'm like "fuck me?"
Fuck ya girl, fuck ya bitch
Fuck ya girl, hold my dick
All I do is run that shit
Ah la la la I oh

I be surfing off the Gold Coast
Looking like the popo, niggas like a goal post
Making so much green, niggas calling me the

And all I do is sing
I got this million dollar bet, Steven, speak out the name

These bitches love me to death
You know that we fresh, I can't do culture, can't stop my ass
These niggas mad at

Spending a lot of green on bitches with these green eyes
You that I'm a dream guy, a dream girl

[?] me in dream car, dream house, dream money, dream sleep
Nah, I don't sleep never
My weed light like a fuckin' feather
And Sydney I know I had to
Come with my own shit, your shit don't smoke
I'm sorry, I'm keepin' it real
You know me I feel like I be doing what I do for deals
Royalty the shit put your hands up
If you that Gambino is the shit, put your hands up

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
You niggas think that I'mma ride
All I do is do it inside, keep it inside
I'm the best rapper, definitely top 5
If these other rappers think they boy they fuckin' not alive
I cut their head off, that's every rapper living
That's Kendrick, that's Drake, that's Schoolboy, that's everyone
I don't give a fuck, I'll fucking kill you niggas (I'll fucking kill you niggas)
These niggas think I'm bigger, uh
God damn, motherfucker, I'm ill
All I do is freestyle, take a fuckin' pill
'Cuz you about to be sick, nigga I'm so sick
I came in your girls face, she don't know what got hit
She gotta close her eyes, she gotta close her eyes
"Donald Glover, why you cum in my eye?"
I'm like "sorry boo, I gotta come up inside"
"And if you wanna feel that

Rolling joints like Ice Cube, living raw like dayday

I got a house like Scarface's, got a car that win races
Got some KK in the jar, know it's raw when you taste it
Eating sushi with my broad, order raw when you place it
Niggas say that they want war, I'm the wrong one to play with
Riding round, blowing pounds, so much loud
On a cloud, roll up now, throwing thou's
In your town, how it sound
Really do some for the game when they started stealing your style
Bring the kush, it's going down

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

Book a flight with Miley Cyrus, and we going to the stars
Got that ODB cuz they say they like it raw
I got a four fifty engine, in the hood of my car
It sound like a dinosaur, you should hear when it roar
I let Tuki hit the wax, he was sleeping on the floor
Hear a nigga talking shit when we creeping through your door
Her homegirl said she wanna leave with her best friend
She gon' suck it like a straw
I got dollars, i got diamonds, plus i blow it by the onion
I'ma give it to them raw

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 1]
Gump sat alone on a bench in the park
"My name is Forrest," he'd casually remark
Waiting for the bus with his hands in his pockets
He just kept saying life is like a box of chocolates

[Chorus]
He's Gump, He's Gump
What's in his head?
He's Gump, He's Gump, He's Gump
Is he inbred?

[Verse 2]
Gump was a big celebrity
He told JFK that he really had to pee
He never feels too dumb because
His mom always told him stupid is as stupid does

[Chorus]
He's Gump, He's Gump
He's kinda square
He's Gump, He's Gump, He's Gump
What's with that hair?
WOWWWWWWW!!!

[Bridge]
Run... run... run, run, now Forrest
Run... run... run like the wind now
Run... run... run, run, now Forrest
Run... stop!

[Verse 3]
His buddy Bubba was a shrimp-loving man
His friend with no legs he called Lieutenant Dan
His girlfriend Jenny was kind of a slut
He went to the White House, showed LBJ his butt

[Chorus]
He's Gump, He's Gump
He's not too bright
He's Gump, He's Gump, He's Gump
But he's alright

[Outro]
Is this Gump out of his head?
I think so
Is this Gump really brain dead?
I think so
Did this Gump make lots of bread?
I think so
And that's all I have to say about that

[Verse 1]
I feel my heartbeat
When you run your fingers through my hair
(Yeah) I can tell you
I can feel you by my side when you're not there
(Yeah) Just as my life fades to darkness
You you make me see the light
Show me that my search is over
I pay the price, I pay the price

[Chorus]
Tell you someday baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it always, brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun

[Verse 2]
The taste of love is sweet like honey on the vine
Like the wind that feeds the fire, two souls become entwined
Someday baby you and I should be one, one

[Verse 3]
So I'm standing 'round this corner
Tall enough to touch the New York sky, oh yes
My love is so blind
I just cannot hear or see the world go by, oh yes
Someone can love so completely
One kiss should break the seal
Truth can be stranger than fiction
This love is real
This love is real

[Chorus]
Tell you someday Baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it always, brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun

Ah we are one, we are one

[Verse 4]
I will follow
Count on me, I'll never let you down, oh yes
My devotion
If love is like an ocean I will surely drown, oh yes
You'll be my only possession
I'll be a slave to you
We hold the power together
Just me and you
Just me and you

[Chorus]
Tell you someday Baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it always, brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun
Tell you someday Baby, you and I should be one, one

(You know my life is in your hands
And every breath you take is planned
And all this love goes on forever)

[Outro]
Tell you someday Baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it someday Baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it someday Baby, you and I should be one, one

Tell you someday Baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it someday Baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it someday Baby, you and I should be one, one

[Verse 1]
There'll be one small light
All over the world tonight
The search go on for the one
It was love with no name
And we glowed in the sun
There was one small dream
Incredible highs and lows
What little we knew living ordinary lives
Made a dream for you, living ordinary lives

[Pre-Chorus, Spoken]
Ordinary people living ordinary lives
Ordinary people living ordinary lives

[Chorus]
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives

[Post-Chorus, Spoken]
The clock on the wall keeps moving, time stands still
No matter how the dice may fall, someone else always gets to call the number

[Verse 2]
Say goodbye, cruel world
No pity, no pain tonight
Whatever the cost, all is lost
And if it's love with no name, then it's all in the stars
Whether it's wrong or right
There's no one to blame, no lies
What else could we do living ordinary lives
Made a dream for you, living ordinary lives

[Chorus
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives

We were ordinary people, what else could we do
Living ordinary lives
Made a dream for you, living ordinary lives

[Outro]
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives

Mixing the white with the tan
Plenty pistols in my hand
Pocket rocket murk your man
Flying the dope to the pan
Ready they say I'm on fire, man
Slangin' the world like I'm Spider-Man
Smoking on kush, I get higher, man, I think I can't get no higher, man

[?]
Bluetooth, I can use no wire man
Riding the Forgiatos on my tyre man

[Hook]
I'm a bands
That's all I think about
That's all I think about
That's all I think about
Money!

That's all I think hell-a-bands!
That's all I think about
That's all I think about
That's all I think about

That's all I think about
That's all I think about, swag!

[Verse 1]
You're living your life
In somebody else's heart
My love is as strong
As oceans are far apart

[Pre-Chorus]
A summer song keeps playing in my brain
And I feel you, and I see your face again
There's no escape
I lost everything in losing you

[Chorus]
Ah I wish you were here
Drying these tears I cry
They were good times
And I wish you were here
And calling my name
But you're dealing with a man insane, the cost
How hopelessly I'm lost
I tried to throw our love away
And I can't let go

[Verse 2]
And so I awake
In somebody else's dream
(It's not what it seems)
It's only a lie
I've yet to decide who's real

[Pre-Chorus]
The blood red rose will never never die
It'll burn like a flame
In the dark of the night
I'm not afraid
I'd give everything
If you hear me there

[Chorus - Variation]
Ahh I wish you were here
Drying these tears I cry
They were good times
It's that time of year
For being alone
But you're dealing with a heart of stone
Try to kiss and say goodbye
Try to throw our love away
And that storm will blow
Wish you were here
Wish you were here
'Cause you're dealing with a heart of stone
Try to kiss and say goodbye
Try to throw our love away
And I can't let go

[Outro]
They were good times
And I wish you were here
Yes, I wish you were here

[Repeat to Fade]

[Chorus: Kokane]
You want a good look and grown, with your sexy skirt on
Let me take you home, let me take you home
I'll make you scream and moan, you know that it's on
I can be yo' best friend, let me stick it in

[Too $hort]
And not just the tip
I wanna give you all of it
She's a model, all tall and shit
I'm Too $hort, but I ain't got a small dick... just ask around
I fucked a lot of hoes in this town
I get down, I come long and wide
And when I pull it out they all wanna ride
The sun's comin up, we started at 4
I spit so much game it's hard to absorb
And everything you believe she hates
Like pimpin, she appreciates
Cause my women, knows to understand the game
It's all about the money, give a fuck about the fame
You never get a chance to go out with me
If you a broke bitch, and you not a real freak

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
You came with your friend but she fat as fuck
And nann one of my homies wanna fuck, and now she wanna front
From the get-go I figured this is how it gon' be
Tell that little punk bitch that you ride with me

Hollywood Hills back to Too $hort's spot
You wanna roll let's get ghost and jet
I wanna see if I can make you wet
Cause you need it, let me beat it
Your lil' fat friend, actin conceited
Sittin in the corner; leave her, the bitch is a loner
Dancin, givin me a boner (ooh)

You sit here, in the bed where
I need to just wanna put the head in, biatch!

[Chorus]

[Daz Dillinger]
She wanna be my B-F-F
I'm on a time limit, got no time left
See I'm a mathematician, you can add the bed
Subtract your clothes then divide your legs
When it all equals out you can moan in bed
She gave me the P, gave her the D instead
See you a hot mess with that booty and thang thang
Swangin in the club when you drinkin that drink drink
Smoke in the air, chillin all in the zone
Fuck me on the dance floor with my clothes on
Too $hort, Snoop Dogg! Uhh, imagine that
She threw me the pussy, I threw the dick right back
See I just wanna hit it and stick it in
Cause I don't wanna be yo' boyfriend
And you don't wanna be my girlfriend
I touch her once, so I'ma say it again

[Chorus]
Winners, everybody wants to be a winner

Recollect a stack while I check a checker flag

Are you feeling good about the album at this point?
Um, that's a tough question, man. For the most part, yeah. But I don't know if I ever feel totally great about a record when I put it out. With every record that I put out, someone has literally got to come pry it from me because when I listen to my own music, I just hear flaws in it. Like I hear 'Oh fuck! I could have done this better or that better!' And I'll work it to death. Obviously if I wasn't comfortable with it, I wouldn't put it out. But from the beginning, ever since my career started, I don't know if I've ever been totally like, this is completely it.

In this last crunch, what have you been working on?
I guess you would say last minute jitters of "Fuck! Are the vocals loud enough? Can you hear what I'm saying on this part? Is the beat right? Are the vocals too loud?'" If I could not have to mix any songs and just take the actual two tracks that I rapped over and put them out, I would do that. 'Cause nothing ever feels the way as when you first did it.

But you're not changing lyrics or anything like that? It's just all mix and sound stuff? It's just sonic shit that needs to be worked out for the most part, because when I decide to keep a song, that's pretty much it. Like, if it doesn't work, I pretty much know right away, right when I get it in the car and take it home.

Rolling Stone's Review of Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP 2

So why did you dye your hair blonde again?
Um, I'll say that one was 

[manager Paul Rosenberg's] idea. In the earlier stages of the record and developing this shit I had thought about it. And once the songs started to come together and the picture got a little more clear of what it was gonna be, he hit me with the idea and I was like "Yo, you know I thought about that, right?" And he was like, "Well you know, why not?" And I was like "I don't know how it's gonna look. I haven't had it in how many fucking years? Five, six years." I was like, "I'm so used to it being dark," you know. So I just tried it. And I was like "Fuck it."

Did physically looking like that help you get back in the mindset or change the way you were recording?
Not really, honestly. Because I already had most of the songs. And I don't know if I'm gonna keep it like this or how long I'm gonna keep it. But for right now it is what it is. And I feel like it may fit and maybe people will understand when they get the record.

For Recovery there was a lot of rejected stuff. You recorded 100 songs or something, or at least you had 100 beats. So was there a lot of stuff thrown in the garbage pile this time around?
I feel like right now I'm probably working harder than I've ever worked in my life. And I've probably worked harder on this record than any other record aside from maybe the time period during The Eminem Show, which is a little hazy 'cause just so much shit was going on at that time. Just being so busy with The Eminem Show and doing the 8 Mile movie, and the soundtrack and the score to the movie. This is probably the equivalent of that but all focused on the record mostly.

That's crazy.
Once I had the direction that I wanted to go, and you know calling it The Marshall Mathers LP 2, obviously I knew that there might be certain expectations. Like, I wouldn't want to just call it that just for the sake of calling it that. So I wanted to make sure that I had the right songs to be able to call it that. So, a lot of recording. A lot of songs that people probably will never hear. We hit a couple of road blocks. There were songs where the beat leaked or a producer sold the beat to someone else or whatever. And just when you think you got it or you got the right amount of songs you go back and you listen and you're like, "Fuck man! I feel like it needs this or this" to paint the whole picture.
A lot of people, maybe even you, think the original is your best album.
It's probably my favorite. I think some of them are my favorites for different reasons. Hate to even say that about my own record, but I mean the first three records, I think they may have captured a time period. And then I think I pretty much probably have publicly said, you know, Encore and Relapse wasn't – it was just a different time.

You've been hard on Relapse, but Tyler, the Creator says that it's his favorite hip-hop record in years. He loves that record.
Yeah, he tells me that every time I see him. I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, but at the same time find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like "Ha ha this is funny!" You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the ground. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.

On Recovery, obviously the world came to you on that one. How do you feel now about that record?
I feel like that record I finally got back to where I was at maybe during The Eminem Show. Like, creatively and songwriting, I guess. I mean obviously Recovery was the first time I had ever worked with that many producers outside of our camp. Aside from working with Dre, it was like I always wanted to produce my own records, because producing is fun to me too. One of the things that was cool for me about that record was getting beats that already had choruses on them. It's kind of like a challenge to myself to be able to hear somebody else's hook and kind of interpret the words. Because my own hooks, I already know what I mean when I write them. The way that I do music is, like, regardless of what the beat is and whatever kind of appeal it may or may not have, I always want to try to go as hard lyrically as I can. So regardless if the beat feels like "Wow maybe this could be played on the radio," I'm not like, "Maybe radio would play this so I'll just wing it." Like, I always have looked at it like I want to approach every record from an MCs' aspect.

So how did you come to decide to designate this the sequel to The Marshall Mathers LP? How did you decide to make your life miserable like that?
Well here's what it is: It's not necessarily a sequel.

Okay.
As much as it is a revisitation – like this is a different time period in my life. So there's not gonna be like, continuations of every song or anything like that. To me, it's more about the vibe and the nostalgia. One of my favorite new things to do is experiment with new, older breakbeats and sounds and shit like that. You know, retro shit, and try to make it current, like bring it up to date.

So did seeking out Rick Rubin come from that direction? You were like "Why don't I go back to the source?"
Paul had mentioned to me that he might be interested in doing it and he had been talking to him and I was like, "Fuck man." Another thing with this record is that I kind of got back into producing more. On Recovery, I wanted to focus more on writing, and not have to worry abut making the beats. On Relapse I think it was mostly all Dre. So I kind of started producing again a little bit. I was kind of in the middle of that when Paul had mentioned that, and was fucking around with those kind of sounds and I don't know if that's what made Paul reach out to Rick or if Rick reached out to him. But as soon as I heard he was interested I was like, "Yo, just let me finish this up and let's go see him."

You've called Rick "Yoda" – was there still stuff to be learned from him at this point in your career?

[Yoda voice] Learning I did. Um, yeah, I mean the best part about Rick's vibe is he's very Zen-like in the sense of just "Let it happen." The weird thing about it is nine times out 10, we would know instantly if something didn't work and it didn't feel right, you know. He's almost like a coach.

He's very psychological, right?
Yeah the guy's got his shoes off. 

[Laughs] Working with him is the most relaxed atmosphere. He's not afraid to try anything. I kind of felt in the same way I felt, and still feel to this day, as far as like wanting to impress Dre. We talked at his house and then I think we went straight to his studio from there and we started going through breakbeats. I told him that I had started experimenting with some more retro sounds. So we just sat down and started picking shit out and I would start writing to them and next time I'd get together with him we'd start adding shit to it. The dude's got so many ideas, man. One of the coolest things about the sound that he gives you is the Rick Rubin scratches. When he fucking scratches some shit, it's almost like this perfect slop that it has on it. Not that it's off-time or anything like that, but it's just like – it's fucking weird. I don't even know how to explain it. You just know that he scratched it. I don't know if that even makes sense or not. It's like a simple scratch, like a basic kind of thing, but it's so fucking dope when you hear it. It's just, it's vintage him. And plus he knows what a lot of those sounds came from and shit.

Did he have all the old drum machines sitting around the studio?
Oh, he's got some shit in the stash. Yeah. Definitely.
So much has changed in hip-hop since you started producing – did you find the beats you were making on your own were influenced by newer stuff?
Um, not necessarily, because like I feel like I just do whatever feels right. Obviously I pay attention to what's going on and what's out and keep my finger on that pulse. But I don't ever want to be like or do like what anyone else is doing. That's no offense to anyone else.

Basically, if there are outside influences that are current, you let that come in from the other producers, but your shit is your shit.
Yeah. That's exactly it. More current-sounding shit I leave to them. And not that I don't feel like my shit sounds current, but it's not the exact same thing. And I think I've updated as well.

On the new song "Legacy" you're talking about yourself in detail as a kid. What does it take to get back in that mindset at your age?
I always try to make my music relatable to the kid who people said, "He ain't shit" or bullied or whatever. It felt like one of them self-empowerment songs. Everybody, I believe, wants to show the world that, "One day I'm gonna be this. One day I'm gonna be that." Everybody has goals, aspirations or whatever, and everybody has been at a point in their life where nobody believed in them. Like, if you haven't been kicked or whatever, if you never went through. . .

Tribulations.
Tribulations and shit like that, then you're perfect and fuck you anyways. So everybody has been in that place where they just have been counted out or not even counted. Like, "You don't matter." "Oh yeah? I'm gonna show you." So it was about incorporating that idea into the idea of my legacy – into what I leave behind when I'm gone. And I always looked up to other rappers for the words that they gave me. There's many, many songs that got me through a lot of shit.

I just love that you rhyme "Onyx" with "comics" on that song.
I don't know if anyone will get this, like this is super-nerdy, but the rhyming words in that song never change. And that's just one of the things that I do to try to challenge myself. I wanted to try to make a whole song where the rhyming words never changed.

You've praised the Beastie Boys' evolution, but it doesn't seem like you're going to have a "the disrespect for women has got to be through" moment.
I mean, listen, my sense of humor has certainly not gone away. I realize that I'm an adult, a grown-ass man, and I don't know what I'll be doing a year from now, 10 years from now, but I don't think that my tongue-in-cheekness will ever go away. I guess it's just a part of my personality. I always want to keep some type of element of fun to the music as well. If one song is darker or talking about a sad subject, I don't want to make a whole album of that, of being a downer. I don't want to make a whole album of being too uppity. You gotta try and find that right balance, and that's one of the things that the creative process was on this record as far as just experimenting. In other words, recording till I get it. And if I record 100 fucking songs and I don't have what I feel like I need yet to make the body of work, then I'm gonna keep going and keep recording.

You've written a bunch of your own hooks, and even sing some of them. Where does your sense of melody come from?
That's a good question. I would want to say that it's stemming from early hip-hop. Rappers used to fuck around all the time with melodies, at least on the shit that I grew up on. I don't know keys on a keyboard or what note this is or that is. I can only hum something. But I think it just comes from all the data that I've collected in my years of listening to music. And you know, fuck man, I think that as hip-hop started evolving, there was more melody in it, people were starting to sing hooks. Even like, early Slick Rick – 

[sings] "Hey young world" – those kind of things. Maybe I took it somewhere different at times, I don't know.

Maybe it's just pure instinct.
Honestly, that's probably what it is. I don't want that to sound like arrogant or nothing but I just don't know where I get that sense from, you know what I'm saying? I'm not a singer singer. I just know what's in key and what's not.

Having Kendrick Lamar on your album, did you have any concern that he might go in and try to upstage you?
I completely respect what Kendrick does and the fact that he's in the same camp, that he's on Aftermath, only made sense to me. He came to Detroit, we kicked it for a few minutes, you know, and I felt the vibe of what he's like and everything, and you know, he's a super cool and super humble dude. When we did that record, I think that was actually a week or two before he did the verse to "Control."
Is there advice you would give him at this point?
I don't know if he needs advice. He seems like he's got a really good head on his shoulders, man. He's very smart and you can tell by the way he put his album together for one. He's like a hip-hop head, man, he just loves hip-hop. And obviously the way that he did the "Control" verse, it was almost like if you get mad at him, then you might look foolish. He set it up so that you can't really get mad at a lot of that shit he said because it was what every other MC is already thinking. Or you should be thinking.

Fundamentally, do you feel like a rap god or do you feel like an underdog?
I think everything switches back and forth from hour to hour, day by day with me. That whole "Rap God" record pretty much from top to bottom is tongue in cheek. So I mean, do I want to feel like that? Maybe sometimes. Again, it goes back to everybody who competitive raps and does this for just purely the sport of it wants to be the best. Again, that's why Kendrick's verse worked so well because he only said what every rapper's already thinking, If you don't want to be the best, then why are you rapping?

You bitches wanna fuck me, yes indeed
Water, water dancing, hundred bands inside my jeans
Kiss 'em one time then don't ever let 'em past yo knees (Boss)
YSL slime balls crooked like the dean
Suck me 'til I'm dead, get a pound red loafers
If she suck it good we may dill just like kosher
Everybody giving shit away like we know Oprah
And you know I'm 'bout that bread, DK run the toaster
Hunnids bands inside of my ears
Let yo bitch run me 'round like she a deer
Got a red backpack full of presents
When I text her back she smile ear to ear
Even though I killed a pussy nigga, I hope he go to heaven
Yo old lady is hot, she hot, she hot like the fuckin' 911

[Chorus]
Where you at blood? Let's go take it
One seven seven, watch me take it
Pull up on you with the shit, I ain't waving
Draw a nigga wit' a sack just to erase 'em
Let that chopper sing to 'em like Pandora
And I hope you got insurance on your daughter
I be turned up in the city, they want my lawyer
You know when everybody shine they want yo brothers

[Verse 2]
If I fall for her I spend bands on her wardrobe
Real big ol' blood, I won't 5 just like flakko
I don't give no fucks, she can pull up in your auto
She gon' suck and fuck, only thing I buy Moscato
Get lil' mama drunk she'll fuck a elephant trunk
She gon' suck him why she beat you
I just call lil' mama trunk
Got a bitch that look like new new
When she beat me we do oovoo
Snort that line on the table
I look crazy, I look cuckoo
You try to rob, boy, it's not going happen
I know bitches that were roots and they not' wit nappy
Smokin' fruit, Uncle Luke, what the fuck brackin'
Choppers ringing niggas be like what the fuck clapping (Me, bitch)

[Chorus]
Where you at blood? Let's go take it
One seven seven, watch me take it
Pull up on you with the shit, I ain't waving
Draw a nigga wit' a sack just to erase 'em
Let that chopper sing to 'em like Pandora
And I hope you got insurance on your daughter
I be turned up in the city, they want my lawyer
You know when everybody shine they want yo brothers

[Verse 1]
Take it on the base
Take it on the westbound line
Every time I love
I always seem to end up crying
So this is my goodbye
Wrote it on the way back home
You say you never loved me
I wish somehow I could have known

[Chorus]
One more tear to cry
Here come the lonely nights
One more tear to cry
Here come the lonely nights

[Verse 2]
Back in Massachusetts
Walking by the old high school
It's just the way I left it
Except this time it's without you
Sleeping under starlight
Just can't keep it from my dreams
My modus operandi is ripping right down, it seems

[Chorus]
One more tear to cry
Here come the lonely nights
One more tear to cry
Here come the lonely nights

[Outro]
One more tear to cry
Here come the lonely nights
One more tear to cry
Here come the lonely nights
One more tear to cry
Here come the lonely nights
One more tear to cry
Here come the lonely nights

Shootin' for it, gun, gunnin' for it
Guwop

[Verse 1:]
I'm so high that I could skydive
I ain't wore Levi’s since '89
My tree-house like it's teatime
But tea time is lean time
So I'm rich, kiss my behind
My verse so hard, make you rewind
Got 8 artists, but meantime
Matter fact, naw, it's Thug and PeeWee time
Watches on, it's freeze time
Going in like PE time
Sell seashell, I got C4 and if I see a hater, then it pulls out
Fuck a bird and a bitch, I need a bird in the hand
Turn your bitch to a camel, make her walk through the sand
Jump on the plane with 10000 grams
Cookin' up dope, 10000 hands
Cookin' up dope, 10000 pans
I just fucked my 10000th fan
Got 10000, 10000 bands
Got so much money that I'm hurting my hand
Cut 'em off, I don't need you man
How you bite that hand that feed you man?
Like I feed that nigga, I bleed that nigga
I don't need that nigga, I bleach that nigga

You can earn somethin', come duke out with me

Chalk ya 'for I talk ya

[Verse 1]
Up out of bed at three
And I feel like I'm dying
But if she's there next to me
Then there's no use in crying
Cause she's really all I need
It's true my heart is flying
Life can be such a breeze
As long as it's just her and me

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down, man
Wearing that frown, man, now
It's tryouts for my brain
Step into my frame now

[Verse 2]
I smell your arts degree
It's telling me I'm lazy
I'm working so I can eat
So keep that shit away from me
Cause she's really all I need
And up until I'm dying
Life will be such a breeze
As long as it's just her and me

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down, man
Wearing that frown, man, now
It's tryouts for my brain
Step into my frame now

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]

Nigga going so fast I can see him in the rear
Throw the pussy for the homie, no sweat, no tears

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I like to take their virginity then let them handle the bums
I like the fact that she young, I like to fuck her colon
She like to keep the cat warm, all her panties made of yarn
These niggas living like James, jiminiy hoes got a gun
I get my Active from shitty, that he get nothing pour with it
I don't know why, anything to get them digits
I shoot the cop, leave em frigid
I don't know why, running straight through the city
I don't know why, next thing you know no more whip
I don't know why, nigga get showed through the mother
East coast, west coast, through the mother
Nigga get high by the feds, living that YSL lifestyle
Every time she give me head, I swear she knock my little lights out
She like help me make the bed, girl I'm an entrepreneur
I look at it first, and then I pursue it, and then I do it
And I swear it feels amazing every single time
And I swear it feels amazing every single time
God, it feels amazing every single time

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
And I swear I do not know why
And I swear I do not know why
I really do not know why
In a recent sit-down with MTV News’ Tim Kash, 50 laughed off recent rumors that Em — who has all but disappeared from the public eye in recent years — has been packing on the pounds, and that as a result of his weight gain, has become a recluse, venturing out of his Detroit-area mansion only to gorge himself on meals from Taco Bell and Outback Steakhouse. The G-Unit captain insisted that fans are going to be seeing a slim-and-trim Eminem real soon.

“Em is in shape right now. He looks good. I seen him in Detroit. He’s gonna look real good when you see him return,” Fif laughed. “He’s in shape right now.”

The rapper has been on hiatus ever since releasing his official Shady Records mixtape, Eminem Presents the Re-Up, in December of 2006. In mid-2007, he called in to Angie Martinez’s show on New York radio station Hot 97 to say he was “in limbo” and “debating” whether to release another album . Then, in January of this year, news broke that he had been rushed to a Detroit-area hospital for complications related to pneumonia , and in at least one of those reports, sources were quoted as saying his weight had exceeded 200 lbs.

Those rumors — coupled with a National Enquirer story that quoted an “insider” as saying that the rapper “

[has] got a double chin, a potbelly and droopy man-breasts. And he’s living a reclusive lifestyle in an attempt to hide his new body” — had fans worried about Eminem. But 50, who in recent weeks has battled rumors about his own weight thanks to online photos that show him looking extra gaunt, said that those worries are unfounded. According to him, Em’s fine and in fighting shape (or at least, balling shape).

“The last time I seen him we played basketball together,” 50 said. “He had a knee injury, so we chilled for a little bit.”

[Verse 1]
Take a step to the left and you're alright
Got the snake skins on
Another step to the right in the moonlight
Shake it all night long

[Chorus]
You really gotta let it all hang loose
When you're moving like Mike
You really gotta let me shake my boots
When you're moving like Mike
So come on baby, let it all hang out
When you're moving like Mike

When you're moving like Mike

Only you can treat me like you do

My hands hurt, I think I'll go lay down
'Cause I'm done crying over her

[Verse 2]
Here I am, brand new day
Now there's you, let me show you, boo

Only she chose me when I'm green

My hands hurt, I think I'll go lay down

Long as she's loving me
Mine and me we'll be unified

[Chorus]
Me, me, me and mine

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci got it, Gucci got it
But you know nothing about it
You still stuck in the projects with no money in yo pocket
I seen you at the party, you still ain't got no car yet?
You passenger seat of your homeboy car, boy that's his main bitch
Man that's some deep shit, some will say weak shit
Yo bitch pussy so deep, it make a nigga seasick
Larty's on fugates, lowy's on the mazze

72 cutlass 350 rocket, so much money wish I had 50 pockets
72 cutlass 350 rocket, so many pockets, so many gualas gualas

[Verse 1]
I dim all the lights and I sink in my chair
The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air
The walls of my room fade away in the blue
And I'm deep in a dream of you

[Verse 2]
The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end
For we love a new just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you

[Bridge]
Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing
We glide through a lover's refrain
You're so appealing that I'm soon revealing
My love for you over again

[Verse 3]
My cigarette burns me, I wake with a start
My hand isn't hurt, but there's pain in my heart
Awake or asleep, every memory I'll keep
Deep in a dream of you

[Verse]
With the hunger of Chris Wallace back in '94
I like to welcome y'all to rock with Peachie's youngest boy
From the bottom of the pot, yeah the Pitts of the Burgh
With kids on the curb, and small time, is pitching the herb
I'm back, and for those who previously didn't know what I'm crack
To the people, I'm legalized the lethal
We all got problems involving the root of evil
But they caught me non-dodging, long arming the people, yup!
And for the record, I ain't no half stepper
I rose from the city of steel, the streets greedy for real
Cats chasing their paper, that's basic
Mathematics, hate to run the streets but took a staff at it
As I look back at hard it seems
I remember when this music thing was all but a dream
But I'm here for my city
And can't name no one that's near fucking with me
I'm 'bout to make history

[Chorus: Soulja Boy Tell'em]
I'm in that Bugatti fuckin' up my wrist
Standin' in the trap tryna whip a brick
Catch me in that Gatti tryna whip my wrist
360 whip my wrist, whip my wrist
Ice on my neck, Ice on my wrist
Ridin' in that Gatti fuckin' up my wrist
Ridin' in that Gatti and I broke my wrist
I done sold everything from that to this

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy Tell 'Em]
Standing on the block, tryna make it flip
In that Bugatti fuckin' up my wrist
Standing in the kitchen wit' a triple beam
Young Nigga flexin' with this rich team
Rich Gang pull up in that fire flame
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds in my chain
You know what I do
I fuck up a check
Whippin' and Flippin' a chicken
I finesse

[Chorus: Soulja Boy Tell'em]
I'm in that Bugatti fuckin' up my wrist
Standin' in the trap tryna whip a brick
Catch me in that Gatti tryna whip my wrist
360 whip my wrist, whip my wrist
Ice on my neck, Ice on my wrist
Ridin' in that Gatti fuckin' up my wrist
Ridin' in that Gatti and I broke my wrist
I done sold everything from that to this

[Verse 2: Rich the Kid]
Rich nigga Pull up Bugatti, switch to the Rari
Scuse me pardon me sorry
Soulja Boy having a party, hoes in the lobby
She give me sloppy toppy
Whippin' I'm breaking my wrist
QC the label the shit
Rich Niggas still hittin' licks
I'm the dropping the top while she suckin' the dick
Back then she ain't like me now I'm rich now
In the kitchen water whippin' break a brick down
Ridin' in that Rari to the trap

Playing with the water on that stove I need more fishscale
They mad cause I made it
You can have crack like the 80's
I got the killers in Haiti

[Chorus: Soulja Boy Tell'em]
I'm in that Bugatti fuckin' up my wrist
Standin' in the trap tryna whip a brick
Catch me in that Gatti tryna whip my wrist

[Hook x2]
Niggas don't want no problems

So stop your mouth I'm talking
And start your feet and walking

[Verse 1]
I sit down in this motherfucker
Burn a pound in this motherfucker
Shake the ground off this motherfucker
With concrete beats, Mobbing these streets
My whole team getting me all in this deep, so lets get it popping

And blood bath I put the nail in the coffin, I'm availing with bosses
Niggas down with Uzi's

I ain't tripping, I'm whipping
Getting a lift from a pigeon
See with us there's a difference, you'd be simping I'm pimping
You just play a position, I'm just the bricks in the kitchen
And my age range doggy I'm the sickest just living
Fuck it life of deceased, I'm a beast fresh off the leash
Its too late to run if you scared
So take a glass and put a blunt in the air

[Bridge]
You see I'm tired of playing with y'all
In case if you didn't know by now
Can't stoop we all act a fool
There's no use to try to calm us down
It's too late

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I'm the motherfucking champion, I can't do it
Then it can't be done, your times up should have 

[?]
And now back the meanest broad, chickens know that I'm picky
Pockets full of dope, eyes a little low from the sticky
Had a toe I'd be ticky, fitted 10's I'm tims
Even jeans with some dickeys, cuz my cheques make my slicky
And mommy's all over the kid, didn't walk me before but now that everybody know who he is
You wonder how bitch
Ye I'm rap's fourth some Child
Been waiting for my chance to the tip top
So hats off to this prince of hip hop
I speak flame so tell lames to kick rocks
They do the same they keep the same their wig pops
Biotch

[Bridge]

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Now the rooms all full and we all packed In
Somebody might get their jaw cracked in
Cuz for your jaw jacking
I'm trying to find a little something to slide with
Jumping or ride with
But niggas keep hating cuz they chick keep smirking
If this cat keep looking I'ma hurt me a person
But I'm chill see I only let the team work em
Stomp a nigga out til the feet start hurting
You ain't nothing but a vexed up clown
With a style that'll get shut down
It's too late to try catch up now
I'm on my A game, Morgan in the fast lane
Cruising up the past lane, fucked up since the cash game
So for you jokers I'm a bad thang
Fake eyes ye I'm like a snake eyes in the crack game

[?]

[Bridge]

[Hook x2]

[Verse One: Nature]
One's for the money
Two's for the weed spot
Undercover cops follow me though they need not
It's like I'm Rick James
Caught in the mix rocking thick chains
From hood to hood ain't shit changed
Supplying hits
They type of cat that holds iron dick
Tricking the type of loot some cats will try and flip
Wire Tim to overthrow the livest clique
Firm, knowing you'll burn soon as the fire's lit

[Dr. Dre]
Yeah, Action's Affirmative
Ears open, eyes observing, the number one spot is mine
Permanent
Predict a hit before it drop
It's fire when the 

[?] is locked
Sync a beat and keep the streets hot
Seven digits clock mandatory
The most wanted, blunted, low key in a 600
Niggas debate what I roll with

[?] or presidential, my living standards never fell below

[Hook: Nature (Dr. Dre)]
I got a fist full of dollars
(Just for talking that shit)
Rich rap scholars
(Cause we talking that shit)
While we plan to live forever
(Always talking that shit)
You need to get your shit together
(And stop talking that shit)
It's the top of the division
(When we talking that shit)
Knock 'em out position
(If you talking that shit)
Ayo anything can happen
(Just for talking that shit)
Now watch us go platinum
(And keep talking that shit)

[Verse Two: Nature]
By the time it sets in I be a veteran
Setting the whole rap game aflame
Twisting up your misconceptions
Trick questions for game shows
They call me arrogant
Too thugged out, who do you blame though?
Dre know
The whole clique salute the rich
Move it out of the hood
Kids play where we used to piss
Niggas is humorous
It's Nature, who dis?
Claiming Desperato, aim, shoot and they miss

[Dr. Dre]
Secure the zone
Rattle your bones like Roy Jones
Dr. Frankenrhyme, sparking your mind with microphones
Life with no emotions
Just balance the fake
Keep my poker face, draw quick and shoot from the waist
Make it hot
Put a Boot through your Camp like Buckshot
Coming straight from the bottom of Compton niggas
About to snap like a Vietnam vet in your building
Major flashbacks, finding hard to be civilian

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Nature]
The fact is rich cats give back to The Bridge
From the athletes to the hoes and blow traffickers
I'll do anything to be the man
From competing with fam', hold guns squeeze with either hand
It's like I'm ambidextrous
Somehow stress this
Talk about blowing and knowing the family's restless
How many ways can you correct this?
So at that I exit, I guess it's left to the expert

[Dr. Dre]
Besides a mansion is no option
Built a plan since the days of Compton
Kept the plaques from my first apartment
Now I play chess with men that stack capital

[?] Avenue, rich friends that cage animals
Handle biz with a cool mentality
Pop shit about a war, my account will never see a casualty
Bet your salary it won't stop
Every year I'm on top
Rolling something exotic off the lot

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress, kill them in that
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful
See you in that powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress, kill them in that
Powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress, kill them in that

[Verse 1]
Hey, Nayima, 'sup Sabrina
Hey, Naomi, love your features
With a little bit of rouge on the cheek
Bronze little bombshells cruise by the beach
Louis on the clutch, 'Boutin on the feets
I'm doing too much with your dude in the sheets
N-n-n-n-now you soft like 300 count
Little rubber band tuckin' 300 thou'
Throw it on the floor, make 300 bounce
Can you make a 16 come out 300 mouths?
(I might, I might, I might just have a)
'Cause I might have a check in the mail
I might get 'em wetter like I'm underneath the sail
Hungry little bunny I am coming for your kale
So I can keep my mommy up and spend a hundred on the nails

[Bridge]
As usual I'm suitable
Cute from the cooch to my cuticles
And boo, you should know I'm so doable
It's quite provable that we beautiful
That we beautiful

[Chorus]
Powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress, kill them in that
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful
See you in that powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress, kill them in that
Powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress, kill them in that

[Verse 2]
Yeah, and it ain't about being good lookin'
It's your brains, how they working
Get that good sookie-sookie
I'm sorry if your man can't stop lookie-lookin'
Mistook me for a ho', and ain't nobody playing hookie
And you ain't found your girl on Tinder yet
The cookie like a temple, you could call it gingerbread
Be a good example at least on the internet
Shorty posting all them selfies, help me, is you single yet?
Tell me, is you into head?
'Cause maybe we can intersect
'Cause sexually you interest
Boy, visually you is a yes
(No respect)
And you dudes don't do your duty
Can't see me shake my head at you, too focused on the booty
You bastard bachelors is really acting like you're Clooney
Y'all truly won't be players 'til you learn to see the beauty
(Male groupies)
Can't say I blame you, if I was you I would do me
I'm a cutie-patootie but don't mistake that for hoochie
'Cause even if you think you knew me
A woman changes with the seasons
And I'm breathing out the new me

[Refrain]
Powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress, kill them in that
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful

[Verse 1]
I know it's alright here
But follow your heart, dear
I know your dreams are clear
Don't you know we all fit in
Don't be afraid of who you want to be
Remember I'm here, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
So m-m m-m-m-m maybe you should
Take the first step
And the rest will follow

[Chorus]
It will follow
It will follow
It will follow

[Verse 2]
I know you feel good here
In the space of your own
But time should make you realise
There's more than this
Remove the labels that you were assigned
Forget the limits that they taught you

[Pre-Chorus]
So m-m m-m-m-m maybe you should
Take the first step
And the rest will follow

[Chorus]
It will follow
It will follow
It will follow

[Verse 1]
There once was a kid by the name of Dave
Who stayed in the mix and never ever obeyed
He paid no attention to the shit that was taught to him
Always stay strapped for the shit that was brought to him
This nigga was a motherfuckin’ fool
Only 13, fuckin’ bitches in high school
Laid back, his game was trump tight
He was chillin’ in the day time, clockin’ at night
Makes me wanna holla cause the dollar he kept
As he grows in his game, going step by step
To the status of an Al Capone, Mr. Big 6 in the game of bones
But you know what they say. What goes up must come down
So just peep what I speak as you focus to the sound

[Hook 1]
A little bitty nigga by the name of Dave
Who was known through the hood cuz he misbehaved
But when the cavi got plucked it was time to get paid
Sack his shit out in dumps, now he’s on his way

[Verse 2]
Mischievous and devious, that’s how his life was
Puttin' they swerve down a cavi just to keep the pluck of bud
Some of the money making motherfuckers from the other side
Was thinking ‘bout a jack move tryna hoo ride
Gettin' jealous cuz my nigga got the dope game sewn up
Them niggas tried to trip, biddy biddy back, they got blown up
Blown up a lot, you could still get shot
You don't never play a motherfucker out for his knot
Rule number 1 pay attention to the shit
Don't be fuckin’ with them little niggas, they ain’t to be fucked with
Kept getting it on to the break of dawn
Now he’s known for serving more than I own
He’s got a 187 on his motherfuckin’ chest
A strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest
Lookin’ for the niggas from the night before
So he can blast they ass but he don’t know they at his back door

[Hook 2]
Dave on a mission out to set trip
But one of his homies is a motherfuckin’ snitch
Some nigga named Mick from around the way
They said we’ll give you 20 G’s if you show us where he stay

[Verse 3]
A dude named Dave caught up in the drive-by
Tears from his mother, watchin’ her son die
Set trippin, somebody slippin’, bullets zippin’
Dave gone for good, now his moms is flippin’
No need for crying nor dying Dave is dead
Point blank, he took a 9 slug to the head
Davey, the wannabe gangsta from the hood
He wasn’t that bad and he wasn’t that good
All he understood was get crazy blitz
So he bought some of that to get some of this
This got him back but that went to them
Them being they who made his head lay
He didn’t obey he said he made this cash
Crash from the gun, Dave lies in ash
Smash, it hits the front page quick
Now business is conducted by that fool named Mick
Mick, fell for the trick and he’ll be dyin’ and his moms will be cryin’

[Intro]
Aw, yeah yeah, uh huh

[Intro]
Ayy man, it's The Oddfather
Not The Godfather
A.K.A. The Trap Father
Trap God 3 on the way
Guwop vs. Gucci on the way
I'm the only nigga can make 5 mil' sitting down
20 mil' on the first month I get back
100 mil' 'fore I get out this shit
It's Guwop, 1017 Bricksquad, the Oddfather, enjoy

[Verse]
Father status, La Cosa Nostra mentality
Last night I plead insanity, in court screaming profanity
Free my nigga Chapo Guzmán
R.I.P. to Griselda
Feel like we the Felix brothers, Mexican Mafia Records
I might buy a laundry mat just to clean the monefa
I done let Keyshia see too much, so now it's cheaper to keep her
Got so many enemies, can fill the field of Serena
And I hunt like an hyena play, with racks like Serena
I was born broke in Alabama, man my family was poor
A young snotty nose sleeping on my granddaddy floor
Is this a crack house, 'cause junkies keep walking through the door
Plus my stomach having chest problems for going to steal out the store
And if my school lunch wasn't free I wouldn't have nothing to eat
So many cousins at my house, I didn't have nowhere to sleep
Didn't notice I was poor till I walked down the street
Rather have holes in my shoes than have no shoes on my feet
My family tree filled of alcoholics, nigga, gangstas and theives
Had to learn how to fight before you learn how to read
Wish my grandma was still living, miss my sister Charlese
'Cause she the only one I know kept it realer than me
Wop!

[Intro]
DJ Chapman, what's happenening? Oh, yeah!
(Commissioner! Terry Urban..)
This motherfucker on?

[Verse 1]
Okay, I think I wanna tell ya'll a little story..
About a young boy, a very young boy
Always playing games, but he never had a toy
Making A's in school? (Psh) He couldn't do it
A crazy motherfucker, yes, everybody knew it
Long story short, that nigga was me
That nigga is B., destined to be
A failure, but I still made it out - hell yeah!
I was stubborn, couldn't nobody tell me nothing
Walk around smokin' like I live in Amsterdam
Middle finger to the sky, like I don't give a god damn
But rebellion is just a side effect
Homicidal? Maybe, Suicidal? Yes

[Interlude]
Boy, I tell you, niggas be like:

["Niggas":] "Why in the hell you so quiet, nigga, you sick?"

[B.o.B:] "Haha, hell yeah I'm sick nigga look at me, you can't tell? What you think going on with my head? I don't even know, I need God to tell me."
But anyway, let's get back to the story, enough of this shit talking now

[Verse 2]
My daddy from the Barn, and my momma from the gutter
So I guess that makes me a country motherfucker
Anyway, in school, your boy was a huslter
I had everything on deck to get that butter
But I was headed down the wrong path - smoking weed, selling weed, failing out of class
But I was like, "Fuck what the 'Po think, I'm a let the 

[?] stain"
But I ain't fuck with crack, ya'll can have that
But on top of that, I thought I got a bitch pregnant
For 7 damn months I thought she was expecting
Then I found out it wasn't mine, but that was only half the issues that was off my mind

[Interlude]
And then, my parents was telling me "You need to go to college, and you need to do this.."
And I was like, "No sir. I'm straight on it."
I ain't trying to spend 40 thousand, just to be 50 thousand in debt when I graduate
And a scholarship? What the fuck is a scholarship?
My G.P.A started with a damn decimal, you know what I'm saying?
But anyways, let's go

[Verse 3]
Back to the saga, I'm dealing with these problems
I'm back to graduating, I ain't finna to go to college
So I gotta figure out how I'm gonna make some dollars
But I ain't in the streets, so I gotta slang beats
Then I sold my first beat, got a couple stacks
And just like a nigga, I spent it like that
Got a couple diamonds, got a couple hats
And filled up my closet with some shoes and some slacks
Now I'm back to square one, where I'm at now
Rapping in this booth, in this basement of a house
Being honest man, I'm just trying to make it out
But fuck it man, I'm out

[Outro]
Yeah.. And that's this typical story of a young black male, living in Decatur, off Cantler Road
But you know what, though? This just ain't your typical story, you know what I'm saying?
But y'all watch out though, y'all gon' see.. Aha!
I ain't really got shit else to say, I just want to hear myself talk
And I know y'all want to hear me talk, cause y'all still listening
My voice sound sexy, don't it? Aha! I'm just fucking with y'all, I'm

You ain’t got love for me, my nigga?
You ain’t got love for me, my nigga?
(We the best music)

Ever since your chick hit the top
Know your bitch is mad, Remy out the box
(They don’t love you no more)
You don’t love me no more?
She the best
(DJ Khaled)

[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
When y’all was on the TV I was with the PV’s
I listened to your CD, damn, you really wanna be me
Don't care if your name buzzin’, you know who the queen be
Dello Russo did you lasik, bitches still can’t see me
These rap chicks try to stay away from me
Maybe ‘cause I caught that case, they afraid of me
Rem got that flow, spit it crazily
And it’s a fact I’m everything they portray to be
Nevermind  how long been down, y’all know how I give it up
Fuckin’ a player in Milwaukee, y'all know I keep it a buck
Probably should have been a nun, y’all know I don’t give a fuck
My lips ain't big for nothing , on the right night might could get it sucked
Give it to her in the tummy, y’all know that I keep it tucked
Claim she fly and got a bill, to me that sound like she a duck
I’mma take these bitches job and get them worked like Loaded Lux
On my Cali swag, black Raiders cap and a pair of Chucks
Bad bitches rolling with me and a couple model mutts
Used to have some flab on ‘em, but they put it in they butts
Yeah they call me Scarface, a bitch still cute as fuck
Some call me dollface, some niggas wanna kiss my crotch

[Hook: French Montana (Remy Ma)]
Ever since a nigga hit the top (yeah)
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box
They don't love you no more (y’all don’t love me no more?)
They don't love you no more, yeah
Troops gotta cock (uh huh) coupe's gotta drop (yeah)
Shit starting to change so you starting to change, ah
They don't love you no more (they don’t love me no more?)
They don't love you no more (they don’t love me no more?
Should be your favorite, now you're just hatin'
Shit starting to change, you want me to change, nah
They don't love you no more (they don't love me no more?)
They don't love you no more, nah (they don’t love me no more?)

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
Okay, I’ve been gone for over half a decade
Don’t tell me all y’all done fell for these hoes facade
I mean façade, they garbage, discard them
These hoes is pussy, I discharge ‘em
They don’t even get my dick hardened
I heat a bitch up, Miami, Chris Bosh ‘em
Microwave ‘em, see all my fans waving
The flow water juice drippin’, the girl so wavy
They say the girl crazy, really can’t blame ‘em
They blow dick, I blow torch, just flame ‘em
Hoes so lame and ain’t no taming Rem
I flip quick, no gymnasium
You don’t got no balls, just a big cranium
Shoot me down, I won’t fall, iron titanium
I’m telling chicks ain’t no touching me
I’m celibate, nobody can't fuck with me
Some say she nice, but Reminisce nicer
I can feel the tension, please don't hype her
Tell her stay in her lane before I side swipe her
Droppin’ that bird shit ,I'd hate to windshield wiper
Been violating before I land on Rikers
Ain’t shit change like a baby dirty diaper
I don’t love these hoes, never even liked her
Remy Makavelli, send shots through bellies
Come through in a pair of Breds and a peanut butter Pelle
These fucking fruits is sweeter than grape jelly
Softer than R&B, ma’, you aren’t me
You pop like coochie, I really R-A-P

[Outro]
You ain’t got love for me my nigga?
You ain’t got love for me nigga?
Yo, Khaled

Dum-da-de-da
Do, do, do, do, do, do
(Coming down, dripping candy on the ground)

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
It's that Yoncé, your Yoncé
In that lingerie, on that chardonnay
Scoring touchdowns on your runway
I'm Texas forever, like Bun B
And I'm Ramboing these hoes
I'm really rit' like Donjae
I'm camo-ing these hoes
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake
Boy, you know I look good as fuck
Wish I was your baby momma
Want me to come around and give you good karma
But no, we escalating, up in this bitch, like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha-ha! God damn, God damn, God damn!!!

[Bridge 1: Beyoncé]
Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You wake up, flawless, post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless, flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless, my diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless, my Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn, God damn

[Bridge 2: Beyoncé]
I wake up looking this good
(God damn, God damn, God damn)
And I wouldn't change it if I could
(If I if I, if I, if I)
And you can say what you want, I'm the shit
(What you want I'm the shit, I'm the shit)
I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit
I want everyone to feel like this tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn!

But tell 'em winning is my motherfuckin' protocol
'Cause I score before I ever throw the ball
These bitches washed up and ain't no fuckin' soap involved, uh
This every hood nigga dream, fantasizin' 'bout Nicki and B
Curvalicious, pussy served delicious
Mayday, mayday, Earth to bitches
Slap these hoes on they ass, like we birthing bitches
Uh, The Queen of Rap, slayin' with Queen B
If you ain't on the team, you playin' for team D
'Cause we A-listers, we paid sisters
This watch right here, done phased blizzards
I confess, I woke up like this
All this drank in my cup like this
All this ass on that flawless dick
Instagram, another flawless pic
Flawless city, with these flawless titties
I got all these hundreds, you got all them fifties
I'm with some flawless bitches, 'cause they more than pretty
'Cause niggas love bad bitches that be on they grizzly
Throw that ass back, I be on my frisbee
Princess-cut diamonds, on my Disney
He want "Monster Nicki", in Sri Lanka
I told him, "Meet me at the Trump, Ivanka"
I said "Come here, let me show you, how this cookie taste"
This that, "Yeah nigga, eat the cookie" face

[Outro]
(Right, right, right)

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I've broken every law
All the words come out my broken jaw
I don't know anything
But then I act like I know everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't want to talk about it
What do you see when you dream about it?
I had been broke down from my enemies
I'm drifting further from my memories
And then you take it away

[Chorus]
Every day, I'm fighting 'cause I can't read you
Lost in the moment, then I come back down
Lost in the sight, I try to reach out
Just a little bit closer, then I come back down

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
You tell me, "What's my name?"
I'm the same, I've just been rearranged
Smile through a joke inside
Yeah, I've been hiding with nothing to hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't want to talk about it
What do you see when you dream about it?
Well, I had been broke down from my enemies
Just holding a piece of what's been left of me
And then you take it away

[Chorus]
Every day, I'm fighting 'cause I can't read you
Lost in the moment, then I come back down
Lost in the sight, I try to reach out
Just a little bit closer, then I come back down
Yeah, you're pushing me, pushing me, I can feel it, yeah
Just a little bit higher, then I come back down
Climbing over people 'cause I've been blinded
I'm waiting, I'm waiting around

[Verse 3]
Sometimes you find yourself waiting
Waiting for someone to come around
And it's hopeless, hoping to be found
Then it arrives and says, "You're perfect, my love"
And I, I know why
I know why, I know why

[Bridge]
But you said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know, you don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know, you don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know, you don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"

[Outro]
Just take it away, yeah
When you find and heal my broken jaw, yeah
Lyin' near where I slayed my hero, yeah, yeah
What you need is higher than your shame
I tell em, I say
One yourself when 2 niggas run up with 3 gats
A four, five, six shots, seven like eight claps
Da nine milli throw ten shots where ya face at
And the MAC 11 tucked in where da 12 gauge at
When I was 13 had 14 grams of ajax
Turned 15 start spitting 16s of straight crack
By 17, 18th street where I played that
19 niggas on the corner with 20s and they strapped
Playin with my money like playin with my emotions
Floatin off that water like I'm layin in da ocean
Roastin, I make you disappear, hocus-pocus
We leave these suckas like they Jerry Rice, wide open
In da field to get real, ya block slow-motion
And the bills rollin in just like a coasta
Gotta catch a nigga sleepin late night, stick em with the toaster
Make him put it all in like he was playin poker
Cause I remember days, nights, I couldn't even think right
Niggas gettin murked out I'm clutchin on that thing tight
I wouldn't even blink like
Blink once, blink twice
Cause that'd get ya life snatched
Faster than a Tyson match
Pull up to the scene
So fresh, so clean
In a 7-4 pound, with the windows rolled down
Like 20 on my neck, feel like the king, no crown
I be Prada down enough and all my year be low down
Red horse, red stripes
Red porshe, red lights
Tell me stop cause I'm killin em
Got chains like a millions
Lames they not feelin em, but tell em keep hatin
Praying on my downfall, tell em keep waitin
I be here, I be there
Wear them rocks on rocawear
I'm so fly without no leer
Why would I lie? No I don't care
I ride that fire without no fear, keep that choppa on deck
If a hater run up on me hit him up with no rat
It's big business, big bills, and big choppas
Cherry red Challenger, lookin like a lobster
All blacks D's on it, hoes holla
Slidin through your area
Why is they comparin us?
Serious, numbers on my check look like a serial
And I still got the block jumpin, Shawn Marion
I said a hater disrespect me then I'm airin em
He don't dig me where I from we just bury em
We count money, fuck bitches, go super hard
Maybach, layed back, looking like a super star
Diamonds on my neck, shining on em like a shooting star
30 in the clip it's got me feeling like a shooting guard
Stop me, small but I'm cocky
2 40s give a sucka 80 like Shockey
Pull up in the hood 4 door Mazeradi
Jewels on flashy like a paparazzi
Copy, I be probably in the hills out in Cali
In the million dollar crib eatin on shrimp and brocolli
Watch me, Pilladels Flyer, no hockey
Tell your chick to google me, she can dot com me
She ain't gotta chase me, just tell her myspace me
And maybe she can find me, so I can get behind it
Heard I got a deal so now she joe me like sloppy
Got the goons on deck, they ride hard like Kowazakis
They ride hard, I said they ride hard
I say we be the freshest
Jury be VVSes
Kated by DTSes
Like Khalid shit we the best and
I tell em hoes I don't wanna talk, just leave a message
Automatic stash boxes so they can see the weapons
But I be DC reppin, Grand Hustle the muscle
No me don't love these girls, I just love when I fuck em
I just ah, no me don't love these girls, I just love when I fuck em
Let me keep it clean, holdup what I say?
I said, I said, said
I got money on my mind, change on my membrane
Insane, in the kitchen with it got the whip game
Similar to Gordon, throw it in the pyrex
Like can I get your order? Ounces to the quarter
Omelly pushed the rock, I pushed the haze power forward
20s have a niggas floatin like he in the water
Sure ya, we got bundles for a Goya
A bean my nigga, if you need I get it for ya
This sawyer on my hip, tinted in the rora
Bad lil chick with me, looking like Kimora
Lead that's me in the pocketbook to yora
Long pretty hair ass juicy and Coutura
20s, 50s, hundreds, nigga that's all up in my money grip
We chewin like it's double mint
That 40 got a double clip
Automatic magnum like a condom with a rubber grip
And these suckas step up out of line and we gon fuck em up
I hug that strip, on the block, with that Yao Ming
Those oh-yous put them on a higher plain like Al Green
Now I mean, ay ay, they hear when I talk
Got that white girl and that green lady like Fairmount park
And this nigga think he G, I bet he fear when I spark
Put some hot shit in his tea, he be layin out, chalk
Where he at? There he go
Pull up on that nigga slow
Got that ruga clip like rula shootin like a video
And we be ridin, ridin, slippin, slidin
All through the city with that semi right beside him
Ballin like Jimmy, and that nigga try and try him
We catch em when they slippin, homicide em
I said now they start and stop and frisk us, niggas gettin childish
But really they ain't stoppin shit, that's just gon get a cop in here
We're competent, common sense, cause niggas, they rock this shit
From where they forever hate,you'll never get a compliment
I'd rather do a 5 to 10, nigga fore I lose my life
Go out in a blaze of glory, squezing with my trigga tight
Young loke, and gun smoke, and done choke, and nigga
Raised by the rat's roaches, real youngen holdin coke
State they gave my man life, Feds they gave my man 10
Messin with this dirty game feel like I'm on a dead end
Like damn where my nigga Rick
Damn where my nigga Brick
As time flies I think about you, know you tired and sick of it
Then they said my nigga snitched, I could neva see that
Talkin that they got statements on him, hold let me read that
Believe that
Was gettin high off of life, about to relapse
Gud gang, aka them Ladder boys, we back
We back
I ain't playin

I said
I don't make it rain, I ain't rich
I ain't got a milli, I ain't trynna chase a bitch
Yeah I got signed, but I ain't got them bricks
And I still step up in the club feelin like I'm Mitt
We got Squally in the building, he be there strapped
Omelly outside and he let out with the Mac
Me I'm in the crowd, just chillin fallin back
Peepin out the scene, I see a hater I react
Like you don't want no problems
We come with them choppas
They call us the Ladder Boys cause we get it poppin
We don't do no robbin, all we do is grind
Hustle from the muscle nigga, save up every dime
Everybody know I'm bout to blow like a bomb, boom
Pull up in the '96 Impala, vroom
Hammers in the stash box dirty, broom
The holster in the passenger, gansta, goon
Yeah I do my thang
Uh, I said, I said
Yeah I be on some shit, yeah I do my thang

I ain't gon give em that, Imma let Raw give em that man
I do my thang man, shout out to my boy Oskee
My boy Oskee, my boy Oskee
Hold on, hold up
I said, they gave my nigga 20 years, man that wasn't even right
Got him in the Hell hole, livin at the speed of light
Prayin that the time fly by so he can see the light
See his kids meet a wife, all over a key of white
But why you think they take that time from you, cause you need it right?
And you can't get it back, so how they givin people life?
Like you gon live again, grow up be a kid again
That's why I never waste time, I cherish every minute in
Pray that God faithful though
Man half that shit I make, I blow
I don't even take it slow
Cause any given day could go
And I could see my death date, feel my last breath take
That's why I go and get it now
I be like shit wait
Die young, and the bag don't even last that
Where the young niggas 16 and over die fast at
I was made there, raised there but moved past that
Livin at the speed of light, it looked like a flash back
I don got money, went broke then got the cash back
Had it I was cool though, lost it I got laughed at
That's why I never ever cherish nothin I can have back
Thankful for my life though, I wish I could stash that
Shit I'm just livin at the speed of light
Ballin hard to see the light
Be here today, to cease tonight
I just hope when God come arrest me that he read my rights, read my wrongs, ah

Rest in peace to Shotty too man.  Rest in peace all my boys man
Free the whole State Road.  Man, when you get out here man, all my boys that's booked, man when you get out here do

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I get high, high, high, high
Word

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I do this when I wanna, mama
I hustle when it;s hotter, money, gun, weed, and a water bottle
I'm the coolest in the sauna mama
I ain't sweating it, I'm betting it, I'll make it back tomorrow, Mama
I got corner honor, ain't been to court since 2004
Looks like I got it going, your honor
I'm a lone rider, grind for my own dollars
They was in front, but I'm blowing by 'em, 

[?]
I'm on hoes like cornrows, open toes
Fake titties, yes, I bought both of those
Hold your nose, I'm the shit, can't be flushed
I got the toilet stopped up, call the plumber up
My stomach stuffed—that's right, I'm eating
I smoke the best weed, look like I'm sleeping
Cook it by this evening, off it by the morning
Professional dope boy, my office is The Carter

[Sample]
You don't know what you're doing

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yes, I do, and I do it better than most
My competitive drive knock a nigga off the road, yeah
Lock and load, pull the triggers and roll, yeah
The bigger your mouth, the bigger the hole, yeah
We figured 'em out, them niggas is hoes
Yeah, they lawn chairs, baby, quicker to fold
But me—I'm quick on my toes, I remember the code
You need a pass for the hood, watch me get through the tolls, shit
I been through the cold, I shot through the fire
Still rock too much ice, should've got you a visor
I pull up, the bitches flock and admire
Fresh, like I just stepped out of a dryer
Yes! No fret, I got the lock of a lion
It's Eagle Street, ho, the whole block is behind me, yeah
Stay low, the cops is spying
But they could never figure out the rocket science
No pocket knife, no pocket iron, yeah
Pots and pans make the pockets wider
Dig 'em a hole, let the property hide 'em
Build a house and throw a party over your dead body
Never said I'll never fail, but never dropped an assignment
Gotta finish what you start or the cops'll find it
Dinner in the park, yeah, may seem cool
But me—I'd rather not let them see my food
I'm staying strapped like Fila shoes
Bet I bust the motherfucker 'til the enemy move, c'mon!
It's my game, nigga, get in and lose
Y'all niggas never do what I do, I do me!

[Sample]
You don't know what you're doing

[Verse]
Whipping the Lamb, whipping and gripping the Lamb
Niggas like “Bino the man” I was like “damn”
I was allergic to not making money
The timing was perfect
They used to not pay me no nevermind
Niggas these numbers don’t ever lie
Fuck with your boy like a pedophile
Damn I’m fly, I’m so high I might need a spaceship
I’m on acid, this bitch is basic
We the niggas y’all love to hate on
But when they see us, y’all never say shit
Conversation, I’m in that, top 5, I’m in rap
Pussy niggas y’all say shit and don’t do shit
I flew your girl to Saint Lucia
Aww these niggas are not from Atlanta
These niggas are not from Atlanta
‘Cause I’m from Atlanta and we would just handle it
Struggle rap, Canibus
Amethyst, my weed purple
Rap game, I’m Steve Urkel
Ur-kel, they want some chicks I’m like “oh well”
You better Google search
Money rule my universe
Nigga we made it
We had the beat and then we heard the verse and said “Nigga, we hate it”
Living my life like I’m Jaden, Tesla the color of Satan
I understand why you hate us
Because I’m fuckin the best right now muthafucka, I’ll see you niggas later
Intro:
Yeah Baby
Young money, Cash Money
Get my EA sports on, ya know wat I'm talking bout?
Yea

Verse 1:
I got a bus like John Madden baby
We can go all around the world
I never talked to them boys that sat on them benches
I was in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
And I'ma leave them boys at the line of scrimmage
Yeah I see these boys all behind me winless
I ain't Mario Williams but I'm not defenseless
Wide receiver catching Hail Mary's I'm Christian
5 and out hydraul yes we stick shift
Coming with the quick hits, fast with instincts
Cornerbacks, safeties, I burn 'em like incense
On the field I'm daddy and the ball is my infant
I don't need too much support but I'm in love with the pigskin
All I really know how to do is win
Super bowl champ, Disney World, let the kids in
Hall of fame Wayne, I'm putting my dibs in
Catch me in the game on fourth and inches
Chorus:
I don't talk to 'em, I don't talk to 'em, I don't talk to 'em
I don't, I don't talk to them boys that sat on them benches
I was in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
Put me in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
And I'ma leave them boys at the line of scrimmage

Verse 2:
Uhh I am a New Orleans Saint, and to the Houston Texans I'd like to say thanks
Reggie Bush baby! Reggie Bush baby!
Drew Brees, Marques Colston, Sean Peyton
I'm relentless, I'm offensive, I'm expensive, like Tom Benson
Super dome it's going down it's high time boys
We second lining on the fifty yard line boys
Hey quarterback I'm gonna bust through your line boy
Your jersey says your last name, but you mine boy
I'm so fast before I leave I been gone
Okay you in the zone, I'm in the end zone
Where is your chinstrap? Why isn't it on?
'Cause if I hit you you gone have to strap yo chin on
See the score on the goal line, it's on
Fourth and inches as the crowd chants this song

Chorus:
I don't talk to 'em, I don't talk to 'em, I don't talk to 'em
I don't, I don't talk to them boys that sat on them benches
I was in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
Put me in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
And I'ma leave them boys at the line of scrimmage

[Verse 1]
Say baby, I'ma wait up for you
I'ma have my way with your body
And when I’m done touching you
I bet you won’t wanna
Give yourself to nobody
Baby when the lights go out
It’s like we’re the only ones
And I already feel it now
It’s like you’re the only one
Only one who knows just how
How to make the time stand still
We’re caught in the moment

[Hook]
So don’t let me down
You made those promises
Don’t take em back now
Don’t let me down
Do all the things you said that had me going
Let’s get caught in the moment
Let’s get caught in the moment

[Verse 2]
Smoking one and rolling one
I come and break you down for fun
You love it when I get up in it
Kiss your body when I’m finished
My drop crotch is by Knomadik
My drop top is automatic
Put you in it, now you tweaking
I kidnap you for the weekend
Rolling up and going up
I’m smoking weed and pouring up
I take that money, hold it up
I take your legs and fold em up
I take my time, I break it down
I tell you not to make a sound
I take that KK, pass it round
Your clothes keep dropping to the ground

[Hook]
So don’t let me down
You made those promises
Don’t take em back now
Don’t let me down
Do all the things you said that had me going
Let’s get caught in the moment
Let’s get caught in the moment
Uh
Yeah
Kendrick Lamar
Uh
Yeah I can reconcile being depressed real bad
I'm  a thinker not a drinker but still I Hennessey drag;
Alcohol numbs the pain like where Novocaine stabs
In your arteries, pardon me but my city go mad
Via Compton California, corners with coroners and karma on em
Colours corresponding to gangs upon us
Common corrupted Crips and Pirus cripple the city
Triple the crime, Bible nor the Quran can save;
Welcome, don't be afraid, your city similar right?
Where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights;
Stare at the sky, wonder will you live to see twenty-five?
I'm twenty-two, at twenty I knew I was against the odds;
This kid named Jonathan was monitoring
His momma and sister, his older cousin, he honoured him;
Anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishing
To Johnny, he might've been
A modern day rider then
He walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member
Pull out a MAC-11 now his eyes is big
Fascinated by mayhem, what's his cousin to say now?
He wanna be from the hood that he's from and that's one
More gangster under the family tree, took 'em under his wings like KFC
Crip crazy, rocking matching T-shirts that says "The hood made me"
No love, just spread slugs, that's the policy, the leader and the prodigy;
Now shorty doo-wop, holding a oowop, hanging with rah-rahs
With blah-blahs that sit on the block catching fades hittin’ licks
Going on missions with lunatics, a ninth-grade menace
Thugging for six months, smoking like six blunts an hour;
The power of banging, he was walking from...(gunshots)
Little Johnny

[Outro: Voice of Malcolm X and (Kendrick Lamar)]

I think you'll find, sir, that there will come a time
When black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough
To think for themselves as other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
Then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
And this new thinking and feeling will cause black people to stick together
And then at that point you will have a situation
Where when you attack one black man, you are attacking all black men
And this type of black thinking will cause all black people to stick together
And this type of thinking also will bring an end to the brutality inflicted upon black people by (black people)
And it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
No federal court, state court or city court will bring an end to it
It's something that the black man has to bring an end to

[Verse 1]
First thing uh huh, wake up out a dream uh huh
Grab a lighter uh huh, something I can steam uh huh

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I stay on Ice like my name was Disney
Naw, I'm ok but my drink is tipsy
Nigga i'm hungry, I rap in my sleep
I eat MCs with a side of beats
My flow ain't cold, but my neck all froze
Call me homies cause the nasty clothes
Christian Dior. Man I made it
The flow so juice like concentrated
Ballin' on a budget 'til my ship came in
Now i'm always on the water like a dorsal fin
Gangsta boo boo, you know the hustler
Adida

[s] and diesel's favorite customer
"boy stop", you know it's paper
I got an upgrade, like basic cable
My words all slurred cause my head unstable
Drugs can't do like Cain and Abel

[Intro]
If you have any checked bags, they will be brought to the front of the station
To get to the front, walk down to the south end of the platform and cross left at the crosswalk
That'll put you right in front of the depot
Look for a sign that says "baggage claim"
You should have your claim check handy to show the clerk
Give them a few minutes to get your bags to the front
If anyone is in need of a ride to the front of the station
Red Cap service will be provided on the platform
We do have one group that is going to go first
If you do need Red Cap service to arrive at the front
They will come back and pick you up on the platform and take you to the front of the station
Taxi cabs are located on the center boulevard in front of the depot

[Verse]
California
Oh, ocean now, I come again before you
Rode along with you
In the slipping of the sun
Sun on dreamers
Repeat the faithful once again
Like water on the mountains, that
It's the slipping of the sun

[Interlude]
Money is blank
Three days to go
This autumn begins to focus
North claims the imperial throne totem
Fantastic
Dreams, lakes
Mountains
Fantastic

[Announcement]
Every dead body that is not exterminated becomes one of them. It gets up and kills! The people it kills get up and kill!

[Sample from "Dawn of the Dead"]
"Why is it?"

"Because they still believe there´s respect."

"Hello Captain."

[Simultaneously with Verse 1]
"The normal question, the first question is always; are these cannibals? No, they are not cannibals. Cannibalism in the true sense of the word implies an interspecies activity. These creatures cannot be considered human. They prey on humans. They do not prey on each other! That's the difference. They attack and they feed only on warm human flesh."

[Verse 1: 2D]
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
I-I-I was born
A zombie
From mercury
I just sleep

I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
I-I-I was born
A zombie
From mercury
I just sleep...

"You got an alternative?"

"Yeah yeah, I got an alternative! Let´s get in that old whirlybird here, find us an island someplace, get in there, and spend what time we got left soaking up some sunshine
How´s that?"

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I ain't gotta wear 2-3, to ball like 2-3
I'm in the zone dog, uh 2-3
Pour the vodka, roll the oolie
I'm always with women, about 2 or 3
All of 'em bad, never ugly
Rest of 'em are me and Uly
My flow fire, call a uzi
Now I sell records not o.z.'s
I'm on foo, ya'll are on E
I'm so fool, that's the streets
I'm so cool with no ice
Words of advice, watch your wifey

[Pre-Hook: Pitbull & Honorebel]
I'm on that vodka

Now you see it, now you don't

[Hook]

[Honorebel]
Honorebel, Pitbull, Jump Smokers
To the world

[Interlude: Jump Smokers]
It's that Jump Smokers sound
To make the girls get down
It's Mr. 305 hooking up with guys out of Chi-town
Latinas all around
DJ's spin this record round
Let 'em shake their ass out on the floor
Then do that Doo Doo Brown

[Verse 2: Honorebel]
All these girls on my planet
Orbit shake it and drop it
Love when you wine upon it
Black, white girls and Hispanic
Ladies you look exotic
In this club causing traffic
Work that pole like hydraulics
Me know you're supersonic
I make your pretty more than a montella
Hot nuff more game then carmella
This one a million seller
Honorebel, Pitbull are not a girls umbrella

[Break]

[Hook x2]

[Outro: Pitbull (scratched) x2]
Now you see it
Now you don't

[Verse 1]
I don't subscribe to the rules of life
Who penned them, was it man or God?
Oh I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
Oh I don't care, I don't care, I don't care

[Chorus]
Forget the rules of your life
And kiss me one last time
Forget the rules of your life
And touch me one last time

[Verse 2]
We both know we died long ago
Choked to death on chicks and lies
We both know what’s at your core
There's nothing really anymore

But I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
Oh I don't care, I don't care, I don't care

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We built it
Together
Destroyed it
Together
We built it
Together
Will I ever feel joy again?

[Chorus]

And touch me one last time
And touch me one last time

[Outro] 

[x4]
Will I ever feel joy?
Will I ever feel joy?
Will I ever feel joy?
Will I ever feel joy?
Will I ever feel joy?
Will I ever feel joy?
Will I ever feel joy?
Will I ever feel joy?
(And touch me one last time)

[Hook: Jeezy]

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
Snow can eyeball a seven, yeah you best believe without the scale

You can call me postman, don't go somewhere without some mail
In and out in 20 minutes, you best believe I'm makin' bail
Put you on designer watches, put you on designer frames
Had you cashin' out, payin' for, you can't pronounce the name
Had that Murcielago, it was green like margaritas
Sold yayo, I sold albums, might as well sell some tequila
Dropped so many Lambos, thought I was a Lam ambassador
Dropped so many Rollies, niggas thought I owned the Rollie store
Snow it's been a while, yeah you know them streets missed you
I don't eat, sleep, or shit without my mothafuckin' pistol

[Hook: Jeezy]

[Verse 1]
When i'm fish-tailin out of Magic City
In a car that cost a half a millie
Turn the corner too quick
Then spilled drink on my Dickie
Bad bitch, on my right side, she filthy
Damn you got some pretty titties
And I love when she call Guwop big poppa
Cause we fucking all night like Kim and Peggy
Double cup of that candy
Got a quarter pound of that cookie
Poured a quarter pint on her pussy
And now her pussy sticky
We just came back from Italy
And the feds said they want to come get me
But I'm feelin just like big Meechy
Cause i'm still gone plead not guilty
See my girl shoes keep two c's on it
Her dollar card got two b's on it
Plus all my cars got F's on em
But my lil boy's car got e's on it
Your cd ain't got nothing on it
Bought your cd, just to roll weed on it
My girl told me they ain't got nothing on me
Fuck her 20 minutes now she nuttin on me

[Hook]

We turn off the phone, I'm in autopilot
Make that disappear Mr. Copperfield
When we ride, he bust them tricks, I lean and pop a wheel
Watching Brandy, sippin' brandy
Panties on the marble floor, guess my pants is fancy
Bitches acting catty on the set
Make your man tatt me on his neck
Or tap me on your back

Like floating on cotton candy clouds
Shirt and panties on the ground
This kitty's hot, fan it down
Make moves on me, papi, don't stand around
One for you, one for me, when we break a half
Your gentle touch on my naked ass
These summer nights, when that AC blast
Them bars put ease to your crazy past so
Baby if you need it come and get it
Just can't hold this back from you

[Verse 1]
They wanted
To kill
Us

If you don't wanna die, then don't drop your sword

[Chorus]
Inside our magic mountain, we don't have to be with them
Inside our magic mountain, oh-oh-oh-ohhh
Inside our magic mountain, we don't have to be with them
Inside our magic mountain, oh-oh-oh-ohhh

[Verse 2]
They'll never
Get to
Us

And if they get too close, I'll chop off their hands

[Chorus]
Inside our magic mountain, we don't have to be with them
Inside our magic mountain, oh-oh-oh-ohhh
Inside our magic mountain, we don't have to be with them
Inside our magic mountain, oh-oh-oh-ohhh

[King Krule]
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can lay inside

Can't you bare just one more night?
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bare just one more night?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be used
Can't you bare just one more night?
I can lay inside
You know I'll hold you tight
Can't you bare just one more night?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be used

[Verse 1: Wiki]
19 still gettin' kicked out the crib
Ripped off my bib, spit out my food, hiccup and piss
Urine burnin', I can smell the liquor in this
Cats always tryna pick up the fists
Duff? this dude out
Grab a stoop just to get me grip
Now I gotta bruised face, loose walk
Too sauced, distraught thoughts of my faults on the asphalt
Back when I'd slack off
Wipe my slacks off, my ass half off
Every time I rap I blast off
Back when I'd catch court
I always had Sports
Dippin' on cops in my track shorts
So to my mom I gotta make it right
I lie every night about the lye I light
So I can lie at night
And to my pops I gotta take advice
Keep my head screwed on tight, abuse these mics
See, me I'm the contusion type
Of cat to smack the mic against my fuckin' head when I'm losin' hype

[Verse 2: Lucki Eck$]
Use me like I'm the drug
I just sold you, got it free
But nothin' worth more than love
I still owe you
Sproutin' quick don't need nothin' to grow
Don't need soil, huh, shit
I leave for you
If life is a different answer test I still would cheat for ya
After all that is son and done, you still won't be loyal
But when I'm high, so are my hopes
It's like brain rob van dam
Hop off the ropes
But a girl and a boy mind work way different
Know mines slam right off the pass like Blake Griffin
Enjoy it, you playin' off of the greatest like Scotty Pippen
See look, you got me slippin' they off talkin' the new shit
Cause usually my walk pimpin', I'm awful dealin' with your shit
You got my walk limpin'

[Hook]
Oh, brother, brother, brother
I know you've been laying back a long time
But I love you like no other
Oh, brother, brother, brother

[Verse 1]
I've been watching everything you do
And I've been wishing only good for you
All you've got to do is just want it to
And it's gonna come to you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You have always been so good to me
And though you didn't always talk to me
There wasn't much my loving eyes could not see
And I don't believe you need all your misery

[Hook]

[Intro]
Hello, It's Me
Hello, It's Me
Hello, It's Me
Hello, It's Me

[Verse 1]
You wander into the bedroom
You're drunk, we've done this before
You stumble over like 3 seconds later
And kick your boots on to the floor
I can hardly see your eyes
You forgot to put your hair up
I can see you've learned some tricks
From those boys over in Europe
But still, it kinda makes me glad
To see how quick we fall into those old rhythms and patterns

[Chorus]
If you want it, you got it
You only want it when you're drunk
My friends say you're obnoxious
You're not so bad when we're alone

[Verse 2]
Morning comes
I know how the next part goes
One last dance
Then you delete me off your phone
In the hallway
Your eyes stay on the ground
Doesn't bother me because when the weekend rolls around

[Chorus]
You'll want it, and you'll get it
You only want it when your friends have all been bedded
You'll be outside smoking on the porch
"Come in", I'll say, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

[Action Bronson]

[Verse 1]
I might be chubby but I'm gorgeous in the face
Things are going well hope I don't catch that fucking case
I could get on some other shit and send you to that place
50 for the shooter, 100 for my steak
Your life ain't worth a steak. I keep the rifle in the cape
To be on top with the title be my fate
Don't make no mistakes
Mami, you see me - everything's a movie
I jump in the jacuzzi with that green Coogi
The plane lift up, just like that batty boy chain lift up
Crimes committed with no hiccups. (AHHH)
That thing-thing shred your stomach like sit-ups
You'll never sit up or shit from your butt
They say I'm crazy and deranged but, fuck, I can handle that
I crack the whip right from the camel's back
My head is wrapped like Yasser Arafat
And I don't sleep no more, it's only fucking power naps

[Verse 2: Acapella]
It's so easy to just be looked over
I never look sober
Look through the eyes of a soldier
I look fly in the rover
Lions and cobras
Keep the iron in the toga
Send a message - leave you lyin' over
Bitches crushin' on the kid so now they flyin' over-
Half of the world to get wrapped in pearls-
Just like the Queen of England
I stay wavy
Mercedes color - Wayne Brady
It's me baby
Please baby
Ain't nobody takin' my spot, that's on my mother's kid
Cross my heart and hope to die, that's on some other shit
This motherfuckin' kid be coveted
Different types of silks is what I'm covered with
Baby I'm lovin' it
Your boy is hotter than an oven mitt
If I was broke then you'd be running your shit
Poke your kidney with the knife I cut the onion with
And poach your kidneys with some onions and shit
It's me
(Ayo I never been the plaintiff. Ever. What what what. Hahaha. I dont fuck with this I'm done.)

[Verse 3: Acapella]
My lawyer tackled the case like he played for the Ravens
So I stuff him with cheese like a Danish
Damn, I crave paper
Catch me later at the Laker game, I bet a grip on the Knicks
Carmello sweatin' on my kicks, cause I'm courtside-
This time the good way
I'm a free man, that's what I should say
Nobody holdin' me back except myself, that's what I feel like
Peelin' the 5, now I'm feelin' the vibe
Hand on the wheel, drugs in my eyes, money in my mind
I think about it all the time
Cause there was a time I never had shit
Now I got shit, it's like magic
All these cars in front of the crib look like a Porsche pageant

[Verse 1]
(Fuck, ah)
Yeah, I might be chubby but I'm gorgeous in the face
Things are going well, hope I don't catch that fuckin' case
I could get on some other shit and send you to that place
Fifty for the shooter, a hundred for my steak
Your life ain't worth a steak, I keep the rifle in the cape
To be on top with the title will be my fate, don't make no mistakes
Mommy, you see me? Everything's a movie, I jump in the jacuzzi with that green Coogi
The plane lift up, it's like that body, boy, chain lift up
Crimes committed with no hiccups
Ah! That thing thing, shred your stomach like sit-ups
You'll never sit up or shit from your butt
They say I'm crazy and deranged, but fuck, I can handle that
I crack the whip right from the camels back
My head is wrapped like Yasser Arafat
And I don't sleep no more, it's only fuckin' power naps

[verse 2: Acapella]
It's so easy to be looked over, I never look sober
Look through the eyes of a soldier, I look fly in a Rover
Lions and cobras, keep the iron in the toga

Bitches crushing on the kid so now they flying over
Half of the world to get wrapped up in pearls
Just like the Queen of England, I stay wavy

It's me

[Verse 3]
Left, right, ayo I've never been a plaintiff, ever
What, what, what...I don't fuck with this I'm done

[Acapella]
My lawyer tackle the case like he play for the Ravens
So I stuff 'em with cheese like a Danish
Damn I crave paper, catch me later at the Laker game, I bet a grip
On the Knicks, Carmelo sweating on my kicks cause I'm court side
This time the good way, "I'm a free man" that's what I should say
Nobody holding me back except myself, that's what I feel like
Peeling a five, now I'm feeling the vibe, hand on the wheel, drugs in my eyes
Money in my mind, I think about it all the time
Cause there was a time I never had shit, now I got shit
It's like magic, all these cars in front of the crib look like a Porsche pageant

Beat her like a dog (Huh), then pass her to my dogs (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
See my knot very dumb and my girlfriend twenty-one
And I know that's kinda young and I only feed her crumbs
My Jacob watch is short bus, man, it's special ed
'Cause these girls be droolin every time they see the VVS
Got a drop top Vette and the thang so stupid
The rims are off the set, girls be jumping in my bed
I'm a dog, a St. Bernard, and that dick get hard as hell
We can leave the bed made up, I can fuck you on the chair
A boss run with dogs, man, I don't fuck hoes with fleas
Hundred fifty thousand dollar dog collars for the team
I'm a boss, run with dogs, man and I don't fuck hoes with fleas
Hundred fifty thousand dollar dog collars for the team (So Icey)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog

[Verse 2: DG Yola]
I got every kind of bitches droolin' on a nigga style
'Cause my pockets fat, I smoke the 'thrax while they blow Black & Milds
I hit the club with Zay, we in the front, all these niggas' bitches choosin'
Gucci got 'em rollin', so I know they down to shoot a movie
Niggas baller-blockin', hatin' on a killa movement
Out the bed to grits and eggs, head and sum booty
I'm young doing numbers and all the women love me
Just because I'm gutter, Black, got a bank and I'm thuggin'
I never love a broad 'cause I'm a motherfuckin' dog
You can ask a couple about me, bet they tell you I'm off the wall
I got doctors, lawyers, dealers, even strippers on my team
And I never show favoritism, everyone's treated the same
I'm a boss of all bitches, so they never complainin'
They respect this gangsta shit, 'cause I got so much game
You ain't gotta ask about me, nigga, you know who I be
I'm a motherfuckin' dog, can you understand me?

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
I'ma treat her like a dog (Huh?), feed her like a dog (Huh)
Beat her like a dog (Yeah), then pass her to my dogs (Yeah)
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
Treat her like a dog (Yeah), feed her like a dog (Yeah)
Beat her like a dog (Huh), then pass her to my dogs (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Chasin' cats, chasin' rats, Gucci got them power packs
Got 'em, them straight from the 6, East Atlanta, proud of that
This fine broads looking at me, damn, I see a puddy cat
And I like them freaky girls, they know how to throw it back
Put up your shot, I'll throw it back, Throw Back, please roll up the 'thrax
Throw Back get sum jaw while I'm killin' this bitch from the back
Put up your shot, I'll throw it back, Throw Back, please roll up the 'thrax
Shawtie get sum jaw while we killin' this ho from the back

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
I'ma treat her like a dog (Huh?), feed her like a dog (Huh)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Tre pound, crack crown
Meek Milly, Bloodhound
Grimy, thirsty, 'bout it you heard me
Glizzy on de-deck
Clip whole thirty
Looking for these fuck boys to do these niggas dirty
Ya play tough I dare you
My goons, they balloon shit air you
Nah nigga I ain't trying to hear you
And I don't need no four pound cause I ain't trying to scare you
I just take the nina raw, get up on you near you
Action 40 lightning bloody near you, tear you
My niggas be riding low
Tinted with them choppers though
We spin yo block my Mr. Softee, spot you like a domino
Simon say he want you dead, I say that you got to go
So we gone drop some shit on you Geronimo, asap
Make that nigga Diddy bop take that, take that
Send him on a trip without a space pack, bow
My hood like goons gone wild
Where Ernie said he don't want no beef he want a cow
A fool with them tools we don't even let him touch them
Get freaky with them heaters he be trying to finger fuck them
Niggas creeping in my main yard, peeking through the window
Bird hunting like the gun game on Nintendo
Wish that I was there I probably would've let them in though
And stretch one of them nigga like a limo
Trying score a touchdown, nigga fuck around and catch an INO
Cause I ain't never go to sleep n-o, nizzaw
Can't get behind me cause my back to the wizal
Gat in my drizzaws, ready to clap izzoff
They gon' murder me so I got to murder them first
And I gon' kill his brother cousin, him first
Give them niggas brim work, chest work
They say that that's the best work
So I'm gon' gun them down like an expert, tise
Aiming at chu and my mac gon' sneeze
My refrigerator put you on freeze
Fuck out of here
We do them niggas right and get up out of there
Same place you put your hat my niggas throwing hollows there

[Verse 2: AR-AB]
I'm loading up the oo-wop
Listening to 2Pac
I'm a dope boy so the money in the shoe box
A hundred grand large, all off of hard
I don't fuck with rappers all y'all frauds
Calling all cars, AR-AB got a gun
Crack in the bag cause AR-AB got a son
And he got to eat, by any means
I got two fiends, fuck a hoop dream
Make it to the NBA that's a pipe dream
They end up smoking rock out of pipe screen
I play the night scene, hard rock pitching
Forty-four with the long nose Scott Pippen
I put it on the line, I put it on my mom
I've been shooting niggas since they put it in my palm
Put it in my hands, them cooked up grams
Where I'm from all the drug dealers was the man
So fuck a rap buzz, I got a rap sheet
I'm a legend in jail, and trap streets

[Cass and Swizz] like AR-AB just chill
You just beat a body and you still trying to kill
They talking to a deaf man, forty in my left hand
Give a nigga wig shots then look for the next man
I shoot 'til the tec jam, then pass 

[?]
A lord take my soul if AR-AB 

[?]
Trying to rob AR-AB niggas asking to die
Last nigga tried I was booking that five
Years in the cell, I called my little brother
He hit both witness, then I got acquitted
I wave one hand and my niggas tilt heads
I tell them break a leg I ain't talking show biz
I talking your kids, I make them show ribs
My gun so big it take his whole head

[Intro]
Man: What are you doing?
Woman: Working
Tory: Lil' Fargo
Man: Why so late?
Woman: I'll be lucky if I'm finished by sun-up
Uh
Lord bless the umbrella boys
You know, sometimes I wanna argue with these niggas
Then I call my bank teller and she say the balance
It's over

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm talkin' 40 days, 40 nights
All a nigga got is God up on these hopeless nights
14 and homeless, tryna find an open bite
Scopin' out the open public, rollin' with this open stomach
Fiends on the work phone, ex on my other jack
Said come home, but she don't know I need this hundred stack
I ain't even comin' back, I'ma be here all night
Son up in her stomach, I'm like it's gon' be a long night
I remember dark nights, hallways and hard white
Schemin' like, "Might get that Rari with the fog lights"
I'ma be a don, black statues on the lawn
Used to stress when I was sleepin' on a mattress at my mom's
Momma died and now I'm sleepin' on a mattress all alone
In the O's with three niggas, I ain't barely even know 'em
When I had my coldest winters, it was barely even snowin'
OGs tell me chill, they don't barely even know 'em
First D.D. got locked and Shoakes got locked
Mo and Brooks tried to flee but they both got knocked
Shit was real on the field, I was sayin' through the grape vine
Pour a fifth of Henny for my niggas doin' state time
Niggas tryna keep the shine from me, I'ma take mine
Been the underdog, so I'm doin' over state grind
I pray to Lord I never drop dead
If I show up in that drophead
Foreign with the doors pointed at the top ledge, I'm a boss
Lil' nigga, big body, hoppin' out the Porsche
Now in Neiman Marcus, we ain't gotta shop at Ross
Feds for the bottles, how we came and copped the charge
Whoa, look, hype change, dice games
She just snap a photo for that light fame
And I was sellin' quarters for that ice chain
'Til I found God and my life changed

[Pre-Chorus]
Sittin' on the block right now, I was tryna get change
A nigga need God right now, way more than ever
Smokin' on strong I been goin' hard all day long
Sippin' on Henny, I don't even know where the day gone

[Chorus]
I'm feelin' like I'm the realest nigga out in the 6
I'm feelin' like I'm the realest nigga out in the 6
T4 scams for my bitches out there in the finish
More money, more problems, we don't believe in that shit
40 days, 40 nights, I've been goin' hard
40 days, 40 nights, I go
40 days, 40 nights, I've been goin' hard
40 days, 40 nights, I go

[Intro: Meek Mill]

Biddies they like how you been, thought you had a five to ten

Cause I'm a big dog Glen Robinson
Don't worry about what I be in
Flow so dominate play with birds like I'm Donovan
Mcnabb, quick fast you'll get your shit tagged
Think I caught a stomach shot cause I be in my shit bag
Shitting on niggas just dipping on niggas
Getting money over here
Hating ass niggas looking bummy over there
But they don't want it over here
Cause I got forty on my hip, thirty in the clip
I throw like twenty in your wheel, the other ten to twist your shit

[Hook: Meek Mill]
We getting money over got my block wide open
Throw a stack up in the air if you the trapper of the year

[Verse 2: Bump J]
I'm 'bout my money, I-I'm 'bout my money
You'll see that forty if you try and take it from me
Now Bumpy I was raised on the block
I keep them birds flying every hour it don't stop

Chopping up them pelicans
Hustle 'til them put me in that box or in that cell again
Ya I got it tell a friend, numbers on the low
Throw me one the hommie cop it now that hommie got to go
I get that money on the O, these niggas trying to count it
They swimming in the ocean fuck it I got to drown them
Loso say 

[?], Chops we 'gon get them
That forty get to rocking 'til the cops come fit them
I'm trapper of the year I stack it when I make it
And when a nigga spend it these niggas can't take it
Them YSL sneakers I got G's on the brim
Twenty grand in the chain
Make them thieves look at him

[Hook: Meek Mill]
We getting money over got my block wide open
Throw a stack up in the air if you the trapper of the year
We getting money (you dig)
Money (you dig), money (you dig), money
We getting money over got my block wide open

[Verse 3: Gillie Da Kid]
I'm getting money over here I get money over there
I'm a hustle it see baby I get money anywhere
Trapper of the year I get stacks up out my rear
Man that's money out the ass and it came from selling 

[?]
Hold up, I know you wish I tell y'all niggas
So then you get me locked up and I have to mail my niggas
Got the city in a headlock, hood in a frenzy
Block wide open so them cops eyes open
Nigga violate me and my Glock hot smoking
Somebody go tell the hustlers Popeye's open
They don't see no money they vision too bleak
While I'm laughing in the Aston with the air conditioned seats
They want to lock me down like they trying to do Meek
But they came paid bail and I was home in a week
Look at them hater looking funny over there
While we hustling hard get money over here

[Hook: Meek Mill]
We getting money over got my block wide open
Throw a stack up in the air if you the trapper of the year
We getting money (you dig)
Money (you dig), money (you dig), money
We getting money over got my block wide open
Throw a stack up in the air if you the trapper of the year
We getting money (you dig)
Money (you dig), money (you dig), money

[Intro: KRS-One]
You know it's Kris!

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
It ain't the same now (it ain't the same)
They switched the game now (they switched up on us)
They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)
I know the way how (I know)
Bring it back to one, it's supposed to be

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
This is the way it's supposed to be
It's supposed to be like you more close to me
It's supposed to be about our families
It's supposed to be about avoiding catastrophe
But it's all about salary and flattery
Distrust, lust, hate and tragedy
It's supposed to be about you and me on the same route
Were you there in eighty-six when I first came out?
And you know about how they running this game out
It's supposed to be about fun and getting' the pain out
But it's all about clout and popping them chains out
Instead of forgiveness, we popping they brains out
It's supposed to be about seeking in the seek out
You witnessing injustice, you got to speak out
If you claiming you love this, you got to release doubt
Knowledge is what I'm all about

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
It ain't the same now (it ain't the same)
They switched the game now (they switched up on us)
They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)
I know the way how (I know)
Bring it back to one, it's supposed to be

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Well it's supposed to be sunlight over me
Light over you, not you running over me
It's supposed to be a two dollar royalty minimum
A hip-hop guild we got to begin building 'em
It's supposed to be no police brutality
And the fact that we tolerate that crap is insanity
It's supposed to be museums and archives
Where people can see the importance of our lives
But it ain't about any of this
Cats are trying to get that diamond-studded Rolex on they wrist
You hear a voice in the wilderness you know it's Kris
Higher consciousness lyrics, they will persist
But it's supposed to be about making it better
You see, hip-hop's not a product like pants or sweater
Go ahead, be a hero, get your cheddar
Even y'all gonna see when you look back you remember that

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
It ain't the same now (it ain't the same)
They switched the game now (they switched up on us)
They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)
I know the way how (I know)
Bring it back to one, it's supposed to be

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
You can see in your heart how it's supposed to be
You doing your part, that's how it's supposed to be
Pursuing your art, that's how it's supposed to be
Today you will start, that's how it's supposed to be
It shouldn't be about you moving slowly
Then talking junk when you don't even know me
And you cats be pussy like Josie
I Touch "50 MC's" like Tony
Everybody in the hood ain't your homie
I spit the truth, but I'm not the only
There's plenty, K-R-S-O-N-E

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
It ain't the same now (it ain't the same)
They switched the game now (they switched up on us)
They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)
I know the way how (I know)
Bring it back to one, it's supposed to be

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah

Most likely they probably fucking her

Hold up, shout out my nigga Diddy we hit shit

These hoes so sick so crazy

[Verse 2: Peedi Crack]
It's in my nature to be a player
Pound on her now, growl at her later
I see you pussy and pretty that's all cool
But you ain't fine as the diamonds in my jewels
You want the shoes, Bahamas and cruise
Summer you call your momma and tell her the good news
She want shoes preferably Jimmy Choo's
She think I'm shopping and copping she had too many boos
That girl drunk, though she pass when she flunk
Maybe I had a gas when I said she had a dump
Or maybe I got a trash when I passed her to Skunk
Baby it's been fun and your boy go to run
I got to go lot of x lot of o's
Lot of hugs lot of kiss lot of bad groupie hoes
You already know
Call I never show
Pause hold up, Peedi caught the cheery bow
That's the Lamb, that's probably why he's MIA
And I don't mean Miami he missing in another state
He in some other case let's get it right
He bumped into something new and ooh that coochi tight
I got to tighten up the hat, it's sliding off my gat
It's wet like I just copped the bundle 

[?]
The girl fresh, what up to Mannie Fresh
And 

[?] and all my dawgs from the set

[?] block get the Henny out the truck
And go get another 

[?] cause all the Rose is gone
The Goose is gone the Kettle One is gone

And when he rap you don't understand what he speaking
Just understand that he be freaking every weekend
Me, Omelly, and Meek in Four Seasons its on

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I ball in multiple ways, which means I'm athletic
You been hustling for ten years, which means you bad at it
If a million was nine feet, you wouldn't grab at it
But a cracker got five thousand, you would snag at it
I ball in multiple ways, which means I'm athletic
You been hustling for ten years, which means you bad at it
If a million was nine feet, you wouldn't grab at it
But a cracker got five thousand, you would snag at it
You niggas stupid dumb, which makes me stupid smart
And they be waiting for one play while I be playing my part
My diamonds ricochet, them diamonds lookin' dark

Bitch I be goin' in, but I ain't naked though
And I be flexed up, I own the beau tux', yo!

And if you have them racks, my ho will sit on you like a wig

[Intro]
She don’t really

[Hook 2x]
She loves me, she loves me not
No, she don’t really love me, she love my watch
She loves me, she loves me not
No, she don’t really love me, she love my knot

[Verse 1]
I met a girl name Tasha, she said her man is a doctor
Care less about her man though, her mouth wet as a washer
She caught me up like everyday
I beat that pussy like every way
What goes up must come down
I dog around like a dog pound
Great head I don’t need it though
Got good pussy but I don’t eat it though
She wanna keep it on the down low
But Imma let all my people know
It’s Brick Squad and I’m the CEO
Four bad hoes in the GE 4
Get a monster head like a creep show
On the beat with me but I don’t think so
It’s Gucci Mane my hay day
I got mo bad bitches than Ray J
Flavor Flav Real and Chance don’t bring her round on my payday
I’m on point, I’m accurate
You done bought that bitch an Acura
She suck me up like dracula
It’s Gucci Mane and I’m a movie star

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2]
I’m in Las with a scripper
I’m a big tipper
Club close, she leave with me, she pulling on my zipper (Damn)
She not mine, any baller can get her
Got money  can hit her
I know you wanna twist her (Damn)
It's my city, it’s my night, this my city, this my life
This my world, this my life
And they trynna make her my wife
She’s a fine girl, She’s a party girl
Got good brain, but a dumb girl
No diamonds and no pearls
I fuck her you stalk her
She break you like I taught her
That pimp book I’m the author
I’m a baller, not a blogger
I’m a mogul not a jogger
You been looked for it, you can search for it
Can’t find no girl ass softer
She can hate me or she can love me
Don’t call, I don’t wanna be bothered

[Hook 2x]

[Outro]
She loves me (2x)

Dayum, hate the game, hate on me
And I'm loving it
I'm bouncing with a couple models sipping on that bubbly
I'm talking 'bout them yellow bottles with that bucket under it
Gone in my fast car
Circle round the block twice
So they know you 

[?]
God damn it I'm nice (I know)
And I see a lot of haters in this room
I just look them in they face, then I say what's up to 'em

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Pull up in something brand new
Sipping on that goosey goose
I see some haters in this room
So we tell 'em I love you
Pull up in something brand new
Sipping on that goosey goose
We got some haters in this room
What we tell 'em? I love you
You, make, my life complete
I wonder where would I be
If it wasn't for you

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Ugh, check out the denim bitch

[?] jeans, that's some Japanese shit
That with the dictionary can't even pronounce it
Don't worry bout the name
Just know that they cost 3000
Compton, California
Home of them p-public houses
Where the beast live
And you can hear the city growlin'
Maserati prowlin'
Humping on your neighbourhood corner
Mother fucker I'm ballin'
No Motherfuck that I'm stallin' on them
Every time a nigga come through they be mad then a motherfucker
That's when I reached in my bag and I throw more cash like a motherfucker

[?] every time a nigga spending so I got it on splash like a motherfucker
3 words for them in the club every time I hear them come
Fuck them motherfuckers
Damn right, I could put that on my life
I use their negative energy for my appetite (hungry)
100 horsepower in my car
But I act a donkey
They see me when I see them then I say
What up homie?

[Hook]

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you leave 'em what you tell 'em (Bye hater, bye hater)

[Intro]
Sour Hour, TreeJay
Most Dope, what's good?

[Verse]
I'm calm, cool, got a blunt, gonna roll up two
Don't panic, 'cause I'ma take over this planet 

[?] cut like a bandage
On the net, all up in your bandwidth, no beaver
But God damn it, this sour I smoke enhance it, got a helicopter, where should I land it?
Been searching but can't find it, the things I do is timeless
Where the fuck did this kid find this rhyme shit? Hit lime piff
Always see me chilling with a fine bitch, let her show me where her mind is
Then silence, it's private, so silence
Want a Bentley and a big backyard, friendly but a big rap star
Still show love, more bud to roll up, smoke duds so much to toke up
On a big cigar or maybe in the mood for a doob
If I roll one of these G's up, boy, you gotta roll one too
See, I'm high but I'm stuck in school, don't know what the fuck to do
Uh, self-made, designed my own mind like a pair of custom shoes
So keep 'em fresh please, finna ball, 'bout to win an ESPY
Gretzky, 

[?] your spitting doesn't impress me
You walk but you got two left feet, drink vodka with my Pepsi
I'm drunk, you sober, I'm starting, it's over
Red Rover, Red Rover, you can't break down my wall
My hour is so sour so I ain't gonna answer calls, I'm lost

Maybe it's that Virginia in me (Nigga, say something)
Have a young nigga go so hard (And stay stunting)
Oh, but through it all you stuck with me
Through it all you never ducked off like them cowards
When it hit me, get me?
Girl, I swear to God you the real one and you know it
And I don't hurt anyone of y'all for the real one and you know it
And I hold it down

(Git, git, git)

[Hook]
I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distingué traces
That used to be there you could see where
They'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clocktails

Then you came along with your siren's song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your pointed smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong
Again I was wrong

[Bridge]
Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so assured
Now life is awful again
And the thoughtful of heart
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you I will
And yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush
Life in some small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too
(Yin-Yang)

F#CK 3000

I pray there's a god at the end of all this

Life is short, take more baths

Children of the cornbread

I've never been to afrika

Sorry I forgot to call you back

Obviously oblivious

How good a friend are you

Big girls are beautiful to me
Fruit snack addict

Umm, you still on yo' pyramid?

Across cultures, darker people suffer most. why?

Ok, hand over the cure and stop playing

Art or fart?

I've never had f@ckbook, twitt@r, or inst@gram

Everything is temporary

Ninjas kill me

Breathe

Sloppy wet Poseidon

God. or god?

I love old people

Loners get lonely too
Narcissistic americans

Thinking deeply about shallow s#it

Passionate about compassion

She don’t know nothing about it
She know that I’m handsome and wealthy
She know that I got proper etiquette
She knowing that if she gon pop it
She gon go shopping down in Beverly
Make a movie in the photo room
Every time we step out, it’s a damn photo shoot
Palm trees out in Malibu
You can do whatever that you want to do

Don’t fuck with no rachets, don’t fuck with no rats

[Verse 3: Offset]
Pop that pussy like it is a rubber band
She know that I like it on hand stands
They watching the Migos like on demand
I can’t be her man and she understand
She know that I’m rich and I’ll treat her like shit
And I switcheroo the clique, I’m giving assists
Speak with a lisp when she suck on the (huh?)
Then I stroke from the back and it’s hurting her
I cannot lie, this bitch is a stallion
From Barbados back up to Los Angeles
Sipping margaritas, smoking on cannabis
Need a wife, lil mama got character
Immaculate, swagger sharper than a dagger
She gonna keep looking, then I’m gon attack her
She said that she really don’t talk to no rappers
I don’t comprehend what you say, I’m a trapper!

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
What you know about taking trips to meet the plug?
Pick up the payola and bring it right back
If I gave you the spatula, to the kitchen
Katrina, call FEMA, show you how to whip it
Pull up in the Bentley, red Forgiato
Poking out, looking like lipstick
Lil mama an angel from heaven
A present wrapped up, lil mama she gifted
Wanna ride faster, just sit in that Bentley
She want some diamonds, go shopping at Tiffany’s
Spikes on the Louboutin, made by Christian
When I look at her I get an epiphany
The way that she walk, the way the bitch talk
I think she the baddest bitch a nigga saw
Leaving from the party, head to the love
Your bitch is down, how I catch her, 

[?]

[Chorus: T-Pain]
She give me everything that I want
Everything that I need
And she do everything you don’t know, yes indeed
She made that booty bounce back

[Intro : Akon]
Im steady tryin' to find a motive
Why do what i do?
Freedom ain't gettin no closer
No matter how far i go
My car is stolen, no registration
Cops patrolin
And now they done stopped me, and I get locked up

[Chorus]
They won't let me out, they won't let me out (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out (im locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

[Verse 1 : Nas]
What's up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you should've slid to my crib
Fuck it black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations, you know you got a son?
I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin, talk about he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fucking with the niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is selling drugs all the dime
Hangin out with young thugs that all carry 9's
At night time there's more trife than ever
What's up with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove one what? One love

[Verse 2 : Akon]
Headin up town to re-up
Back with a couple keys
The corner blocks on fire
Undercovers dressed as fiends
Makin so much money
Products moving fast
Put away the stash
And as I sold the last bag I fucked around and got locked up

[Chorus]
They won't let me out, they won't let me out (my nigga I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out (I got locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out (baby girl I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

[Verse 3 : Akon]
Cuz visitation no longer comes by
Seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is getting empty
Cell mates getting food without me
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up

[Chorous]
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
(ohhh I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
(my nigga I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

[Verse 4 : Nas]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is going on
The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
The nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' something word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'm gonna put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Whylin on the Island, but now with Elmira
Better chill cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reels, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buck whylin' in four maine he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it lowkey
So stay civilised, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies, I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda wants to make me murder for real-a
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs for one love

[Outro : Akon]
Pay me a visit (they won't let me out)
Send me some magazines (they won't let me out)
Send me some money orders (they won't let me out, no)
Pay me a visit, baby (they won't let me out)
Cuz I'm locked up, they won't let me out
Where's my lawyer? (they won't let me out)
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, no
Get me out of here (they won't let me out)
Im locked up (they won't let me out, they won't let me out)
Baby, I'm locked up (they won't let me out, no)
Where's my niggas? On the lock-down
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
Ohhh... they won't let me out
Can you please accept my phone calls?
Cuz I'm locked up, locked up, locked up

[Spoken Word Verse: André 3000 & Bentley Fonzworth]
Ahhh, such sweet sound
The Fiddler on the Fuckin' Roof
Is that Mr. Bentley Fonzworth?
Indeed, it is, sir
Good day, good sir
How do you do? Look fine
Fantastically well, I am certainly not fine by far
But you could say I'm close to spectacular
Close to spectacular? How so?
Open your eyes, spectacular's right in front of you
Whatever you say, you're spectacular
No, I'm fantastically well
Come on, man, make up your mind
A minute ago, you said you were fine
No, I said I'm "close to spectacular"
But I'm meetin' fine in a minute
Close to spectacular? You said you were "fantastically well"
Exactly
Exactly? Which one are you?
"Close to spectacular" or "fantastically well"?
I am certainly and without a doubt fantastically well
And was close to spectacular
But I must say, good sir, you just pissed spectacular off
And don't even mention "exactly"
But here comes "fine" right now
Oh Lord, she is fine

Got these bitches... than a fucking pirate

OK! Tape it the robber band, ... in that pussy like ...

[Intro: Chevy Woods]
Way before your time the world knew this would happen
Was destiny to many, was just hard work for you
As you were brought into this world
You tried to find out about your surroundings
The people, the feeling of being alive and breathing the air
The smiles you see at that point are the ones you should always remember
Authentic is due to the choices you make for yourself
It'll be a bunch of fake smiles so easy to forget
But some although not healthy for them will create an understanding of what the word real means
Us and never I is one of your greatest attributes
Others before thyself as long as long as thyself is taken care of is well being
And money, well, I know you know how to get money
I'm gonna say this one time only, live young man, you deserve it
Let's celebrate, Blacc Hollywood

And we be in the club, buying all our champagne
Spillin' it on the couches
Me and my niggas deserve this shit
We was there for the come up
I am Blacc Hollywood, I live Blacc Hollywood

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yea, yea, yea
Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you drive the newest car because she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you brought a lot of drugs because she ain't lookin' for love
That's no love
That's no love
That's no love
That's no love
Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Pull up to the club with my thugs smokin' so strong
Hop out and walk through the back, so high I don't know where I'm at
Them bitches get open, I'm with some niggas who all 'bout that action
Poppin' them bottles, you look outside, see them foreigns
She get them dollars out them niggas cause she ain't lookin' for love
Smoke that loud up by the pound, she get champagne and drink it up
Hope you ain't a Captain Savior cause she ain't lookin' for cuffs
In the club spinnin' face, she in your face, you think it's love
Said you throwin' dubs, bro that ain't enough
Money, clothes, and drugs, that's what bitches love
Rollie cold as fuck, that's what bitches love
Back to the topic, pop that ass and please don't stop it

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yea, yea, yea
Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you drive the newest car because she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you brought a lot of drugs because she ain't lookin' for love
That's no love
That's no love
That's no love
That's no love
Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
That's no love, that's no love
That's your bitch, get her bed in my truck
You ain't give her what she needed, and she ain't lookin' for love
Homie she don't want no flowers, only make her cum

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Poppin' ass, kinda naughty, met her ass at the party
Took her to the after party, drink some gin off her body
Spend some ends, now I'm going in
Took her and her friend, hit the skins
Then we smoked again, eyes like I'm Korean
Shots of gin, that's what all this juice is for
In Blacc Hollywood, that's my newest car
I'm like eney meeney, I got plenty
Pockets filled with hundreds, fifties
Nothin' lower, come fuck with a stoner and get stoned

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yea, yea, yea
Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you drive the newest car because she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you brought a lot of drugs because she ain't lookin' for love
That's no love
That's no love
That's no love
That's no love
Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love

[Verse 1]
This year I'm going insane, mental disease
Puttin' a bar up to a place, niggas can't reach
Bout to cop so many chains, li'l Mr. T
The way she give me brain, she need a degree
She dropped it to the floor, she did it for the cheese
Told her that I need some more, she did it with sleaze
Clique full of G's
And they go ape, don't swing through the trees
Try 'em, them triggers will squeeze
Did it with sleaze
And your wifey love a nigga with sleeves
Hit it and leave
I ain't stressing, when will you niggas believe
Shit is a breeze
Give me the keys

[Hook]
Just copped the newest thang, get it with ease
Hopped up out the bed, did it with sleaze
They say I run the game, literally
I'm walking to the bank, get it with sleaze
My car is sleazy, my squad is sleazy
My job is sleazy, its way too easy
Just got the newest thang, get it with ease
Hopped up out the bed, did it with sleaze

[Verse 2]
Ain't too much hustling
Get it go straight to the bank, my nigga I can't get enough of it
Ashes all over my jeans, if this shit stank I'm puffing it
Trying to do shit just like Puff did it
Dirty ass game, ain't no loving it
That nigga hates, bitches lovin' it
They say I run the game
Got fortune, fuck the fame
My garage is like a showroom
Couple ounces in my brain
Damn she fine, thick as can be
Buy me all the newest things, ma this dick ain't for free
Everywhere I go I'm weed scented
Rock crew necks ripped jean with em
Take no swag, mix sleaze with it
Take your ho, spend cheese with us
Everywhere I go, I'm weed scented
Rock crew-necks reps jeans with it
Take no swag, mix sleaze with it
Taylor Gang, we beez with it

[Hook]
Just got the newest thang, get it with ease
Hopped up out the bed, did it with sleaze
They say I run the game, literally
I'm walking to the bank, get it with sleaze
My car is sleazy, my squad is sleazy
My job is sleazy, its way too easy
Just got the newest thang, get it with ease
Hopped up out the bed, did it with sleaze

[Outro]
Taylor Gang
If you real badass, you know what the fuck I'm talking bout
Fuck the rules, we make our own
I'm my own boss
I count my own money
I fire the fuck out of you niggas If I feel like it
And I'm sleazy as hell
Feel me?

[Hook]
Just got the newest thang, get it with ease
Hopped up out the bed, did it with sleaze
They say I run the game, literally
I'm walking to the bank, get it with sleaze
My car is sleazy, my squad is sleazy
My job is sleazy, its way too easy
Just got the newest thang, get it with ease
Hopped up out the bed, did it with sleaze

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Got no time for the conversations or funny shit
Nigga, only the reals who I get my money with
Used to turn on the TV, see what I want
And now the same one I dreamed about, the same one I'm stuntin' in
In the 6-2, almost 26
And every nigga that I'm with got a zip
I look at this shit as one big table and best believe every nigga I'm with got a sit
They try to hold us back, paint a picture of us, then sell it straight to the public
You young, black, then you thuggin'
What they don't talk about the kid that came from nothin'
Who stuck to what he believed in and turned himself into something great
They should use that story to motivate
But instead they'd rather focus on the fact that he's a pothead
Not the fact there's not a lot where I lived
25 and not dead

[Hook:]
I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real
When you work hard to get it that's how you feel
Them haters talk but they knowin' they ain’t in the way, no
We started small to them houses in the hills
To them houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
To them houses in them hills

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
You make a little money, take care and right yourself
And people start coming up with they hand out
People take their stresses and make them yours
Well that's just what comes with being a man
I try to do all that I can to make sure that
My son grow up without having to see half of the stuff I've been through
But in life we all got our own path
Don't understand that by now you won't begin to
Cop another Rollex or Porsche try and get even with me
Pulled up to the club, swear it looked like the dealer with me
Cause we had so many cars it was stupid
So I don't see a reason to try and reason with me
Made a couple million and fast too
They ain't teach a young nigga that in the classroom
Or how to make your people better by taking knowledge and spreadin' it
Instead bein' in the game, be ahead of it, in a better whip

[Hook:]
I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real
When you work hard to get it that's how you feel
Them haters talk but they knowin' they ain’t in the way, no
We started small to them houses in the hills
To them houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
To them houses in them hills

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Thousand dollar benefit plates
No matter how high the stakes, niggas never outta place
Now I'm high, Empire State
Drunk stumblin', never will I tumble far from grace
I'm one of them under-celebrated greats
Under the influence of what Uncle Snoop threw me
Soon as I stepped off the plane
Switchin' four lanes like Jay and Jermaine
Killin' beats, visitin' grave sites and pissin' champagne
I been in the crib enjoying my habits
Suckers figured this'll be the perfect time to try me
Try me
Assumptions that I'm lunchin', gettin' sloppy
I'm just gettin' better, seasoned veteran
Eagle eye perspective, scope before I go in
Come out with the whole hen
A dollar and a dream
Have a house on the hill and the world on a string

[Hook:]
I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real
When you work hard to get it that's how you feel
Them haters talk but they knowin' they ain’t in the way, no
We started small to them houses in the hills
We started small to them houses in the hills
We started small to them houses in the hills
To them houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
To them houses in them hills

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, Goddamn
How the hell you get all that ass in them pants?
How you drinkin' and you ain't got no glass?
And how you came in here and you ain't got no man, what
Damn, to me you look perfect
Bend that ass over; let me see how you work it
Poppin' and shakin', get on your knees hit the dirt
Girl I go so deep in that pussy while he just hitting the surface
What is you sayin'?

[Hook]
Drop it down on it
Made me get a couple bands drop it down on it
Make you get a couple friends drop it down on it
Turn around drop it down, drop it down on it
Do it for a real nigga, do it for a boss
Do somethin' for a boss, do somethin' for a real nigga
Go and do somethin' for a boss
Do somethin' for a boss, do somethin'

[Verse 2]
You got a ass make a nigga wanna buy a ring
You got a ass make a nigga spend errything
You got a ass make a nigga wanna buy a ring
You got a ass make a nigga spend errything
If you've got an ass like the girls in the videos
Go and bring it my way
Ass so big it could swallow up a stripper pole
I ain't playin', no I ain't playin'
Bust it down on me, I need it, throw it, a boss wanna see it
Just give me a call and I'll beat it
I'll be all where your seat is
Mary Jane got me moving slow
I blow that by the (O, O, O, O...)
Uh

[Hook]
Drop it down on it
Made me get a couple bands drop it down on it
Make you get a couple friends drop it down on it
Turn around drop it down, drop it down on it
Do it for a real nigga, do it for a boss
Do somethin' for a boss, do somethin' for a real nigga
Go and do somethin' for a boss
Do somethin' for a boss, do somethin'

[Bridge]
Got a fat ass
Go on and shake that shit
Got a fat ass
Go on and shake that shit
Whoa
Got a fat ass
Go on and shake that shit
You got a fat ass
Go on and shake that shit
Damn

[Hook]
Drop it down on it
Made me get a couple bands drop it down on it
Make you get a couple friends drop it down on it
Turn around drop it down, drop it down on it
Do it for a real nigga, do it for a boss
Do somethin' for a boss, do somethin' for a real nigga
Go and do somethin' for a boss
Do somethin' for a boss, do somethin'

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
All my niggas is day ones
I only fuck with A1's
You niggas know what the gang is
We young black and dangerous
Still down with my day one niggas, hell yeah I'm still down
Still down with the shit
Still down with my A1 niggas, hell yeah I'm still down
Still down, still down

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, they can't believe I'm still here
Made a million dollars but I wouldn't replace it for nothin'
A lotta niggas been killed here
I done seen niggas get they whole shit blown off in public
A lotta blood, sweat, and hope came from this block
When floodin', a lotta dope came from this block
But fuck it, I'm in my whip pushing buttons
I think about the ones that dead and gone and ones that still thuggin'
Uh, and they still down
Got no love for them pussy ass motherfuckers, cause they still clowns
Smokin real pounds, just bought a real home
Me and my watch, both real stoned
Pour some gin, man it's all about the m's
New Ferrari or a Benz, get a joint and hold it in
And I been with the same niggas since they was hitting licks
And yeah they still with the shits

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
(Yeah, Taylor Gang, Chevy)
Yo, tell them niggas we nothin' alike
They see us and imitate what they want to be like
What's hand and hand to them J's next day on the flight
Shit, where I'm from if you're out too late then you're playing with your life
Bet they feel how I feel, dinner out in Brazil
My day ones'll see about you for me for real
And the finest of fashion, makin' a statement
Who thought it used to take me to get it now anything we can afford it
Hate us so much that I'm cakin', I ain't mad at them at all
Just know about this dough, don't make or make you a John
Huh, the same ones that been A1's
A few niggas gone act different when that change come
Yeah, horsepower from that kitchen vision
It's Taylor Gang, when you they ask you tell them we the business
Them niggas tryna copy us, they lookin' stupid
Swear, dressing all crazy, boy you look like a build-a-bear

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Still down, down, down, down, down
All day err'day I come around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
We stay down, down, down, down, down
All day err'day they say we wouldn't make it
It's just me and my niggas, just me and my niggas

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Intro]
We started?
I've got so much, so much shit to do, don't even know where to start
Be here forever..
I think that's the plan, you know?
Start here, end up there
Soon as you think something's goin' on you start back over
It's never gonna be the same
I ain't complainin' though
I really wouldn't have it any other way
NIGGA

[Verse 1]
Every day you wake up your destiny depends on what you do
Sometimes I roll one when I'm stressed out and sometimes I roll two
Here people sayin' shit about the way I am but I know that ain't true
At times I feel like I'm all by myself and I know you do too
I made some phone calls and checked emails cause I'm always grinding
Ain't no rush, I do things slow cause it's all about timing
Some people think when you get to this point in life you've made it
I've seen so many settle for less, that's when talent get wasted
I ain't there, but if I can I'ma try to be perfect
And for those who ridin' with me, I'ma try to make it worth it
I drink too much, I prefer weed 'cause it's better for the stress
I just woke up, I don't get sleep, boy, my schedule's a mess

[Chorus]
Man, I work hard (goddamn, shit)
Man, I work hard (what? woah)
Man, I work hard (literally, nigga, work, get your bags, let's go)
Man, I work hard (we on, nigga)
It ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)
No pain
Man, I work hard

[Verse 2]
Just left another one
Just rolled another one
Just got another check
'Bout to thumb through another one
Fallin' asleep on the plane, no sleep, the flight come with one
Young nigga holdin' it down, don't care if it make you uncomfortable
Hardly spend nights at the crib, homie that's just how I live
Don't even go hard for myself, I got a wife and a kid
I don't ever question the biz, nigga it is what it is
You niggas ain't killin shit, no you niggas ain't killin shit
What they doin'? They say nothin'
Where they goin'? They say nothin'
Call my phone, it ain't nothin'
I smoke a lot, but don't judge me
Prolly wake up earlier than all of you niggas
Mafuckas always hate on the squad
But all the hatin' mafuckas always hatin ain't get paid

[Chorus]
Man, I work hard
Man, I work hard (fuck!)
Man, I work hard (I mean like goddamn what you want me to say?)
Man, I work hard (it's what I do!)
It ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)
It ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)
No pain
Man, I work hard

[Intro]
(Another)
Shit got me creeping ‘round the block, yeah

[Hook]
From the bar to the penthouse, shit done changed
I’m a pro, I ain’t playing in no pick up games
You want your paper and I want mine on time
It’s funny, I’ve only been doing this shit since ‘09
That’s not a long time (another, another)
That’s not a long time
That’s not a long time

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
It starts off being for the love then it changes
Shaking hands with strangers, hopping in and out of Rangers
Arrangements with spa treatments in the Caymans
Soufflé served fresh out the oven, look amazing
Addiction to the finer things in life
No more Sizzler, no more Golden Corral
Even though Body loves that shit, it’s beneath us
Gum under my sneakers
I just came off tour, bought my mom a new knee
It’s a new day, motherfucker meet the new me
I’m so ahead of the game I’m playing 3K in a Kufi
You still acting like a groupie

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Roll out of bed to cold marble floors in the summer
I need my bank account like a German phone number
Call Klaus, I want the Porsche loaded
Shit look like it’s doing aerobics, all white like Maury Povich
I wasn’t given this, I chose this
I’m eating well so I’m looking bloated
I’m on the plane, but I could have floated, uh
You know I’m golden, just like the hair on Hulk Hogan
The pure oil makes me cough like when the doctor checks my nuts for cancer
Hop in a Lancer like a dancer, I’m the answer
The many different questions Russian scientists don’t even know
I guess that you ain’t need to know

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yo, I’mma smoke what I wanna smoke
Drink what I wanna drink
Buttnaked in the Cherokee
You know I’m high ‘til they bury me
I’m staying high ‘til they bury me
Yo, I’mma smoke what I wanna smoke
Drink what I wanna drink
Buttnaked in the Cherokee
I’m staying high ‘til they bury me
Too high to die ‘til they bury me
(It's not a long time)
(Another, another)
(It's not a long time)
(It's not a long time)
(It's not a long time)
(Another, another)

[Intro]
I took each word she said as gospel truth
The way a silly little child would
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood
She didn't mean it, I should have seen it
But now it's too late

[Verse 1]
I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams
Now it seems this is how the story ends
She's gonna turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"

[Verse 2]
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
Not for long I can see the way this ends
She's gonna turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"

[Bridge]
Why should I care though she gave me the air?
Why should I cry, heave a sigh and wonder why?
And wonder why

[Verse 3]
I thought I'd found the gal I could trust
What a bust, this is how the story ends
She's gonna turn me down and say
"Can't we be just friends?"

[Verse 1]
I'll be around no matter how you treat me now
I'll be around from now on
Your latest love can never last and when it's past
I'll be around when he's gone

[Verse 2]
Goodbye again
And if you find a love like mine
Just now and then
Drop a line to say you're feeling fine
And when things go wrong
Perhaps you'll see you're meant for me
So I'll be around when he's gone

[Verse 3]
Goodbye again
Now and then
Drop a line to say that you're feeling fine
And when things go wrong
Perhaps you'll see you're meant for me
So I'll be around when he's gone

[Verse 1]
Blow, ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowing me no good, no good
Go, ill wind, go away
Skies are, oh, so gray
Around my neighborhood and that ain't good

[Bridge]
You're only misleading
The sunshine I'm needing
And ain't that a shame?
It's so hard to keep up
With troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere when love's to blame

[Verse 2]
So, ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowing me no good
So, ill wind, blow away
Please let me rest today
You're blowing me no good

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
So, ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowing me no good
No good, no good

[Chorus]
We get it poppin' on a late
Pop-poppin' on a late night
We get it poppin' on a late
Pop-poppin' on a late night

Backpack full of good-
Pop-poppin' on a late night
Poppin' on a late

[Verse 1]
We get it poppin' on a late night, rockin' 'til the day
You be in the corner just talking to some lames
Watch me as I take flight hopping on the plane
I'll be goin' til the song drop, drop and go away
Drop and go away?
Bring it right back
And I'ma fight that man in the tight slacks
He need an ice pack, he need his life back
All up in his grill like rat-a-tat-tat
And Mac is that cat looking bad in all black
With my brain in the clouds, so your girl can call back
You mad that your game like the dude from Mall Rats
You rookie ain't better than the Mac, fall back
I see the way that you talking to your date
You either gay or you not up on your game
I keep it moving, ain't stopping for the Jakes
Cause e'rybody know we get it poppin' when it's late

[Chorus]
We get it poppin' on a late
Pop-poppin' on a late night
We get it poppin' on a late
Pop-poppin' on a late night

Backpack full of good-
Pop-poppin' on a late night
Poppin' on a late

[Verse 2]
Backpack full of goods, just walkin' down the street
Three in the morning, wanna get something to eat
My body needs nothing, nothing but some sleep
But my head stay awake, just bumpin' with this beat
We get it popping while e'ryone passed out
Backpack strapped plaid, go and pull your cash out
See your mommy who be tryna pull her ass out
And her man in the corner getting mad now
Cause my homies 'bout to crush any girl around
Loving me cause money well attended, spin the world around
And I be 'bout a dollar like anyone else
I'm so hungry for some money that I steal it from myself
That don't make sense, well I ain't about a nickel (Nickel)
Dumbass rappers just riddle (Aha)
I keep it moving, ain't stopping for the Jakes
Cause e'rybody know we get it popping when it's late

[Chorus]
We get it poppin' on a late
Pop-poppin' on a late night
We get it poppin' on a late
Pop-poppin' on a late night

Baby, you a turn on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby, you a turn on
I'ma put my trust inside of your heart
Baby, you a turn on
I knew I was falling in love from the start
Baby, you a turn on
I've been slowly waiting
Ain't no hesitating
Girl my heart racing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm slowly waiting, I'm not hesitating
I can't tell her nothing, I want to have your babies
Oops I meant I want you to have my babies, ain't no pretending
Girl I'm winning, girl you winning, baby let's get it... Jenny
Pockets on Craig, I'm higher, I'm flyer
They mad, 'cause I ain't deny you, they gon' hate
They gon' try you, my pockets on Weight Watch
My heart beat faster than a stopwatch, she want to stop by
She want to pop lock, she want a drop top
She the top notch (Order top notch), I couldn't fucking leave
She was looking for me like a fucking cop
She throwing up signs, no stop

[Chorus]
Baby, you a turn on
I'ma put my trust inside of your heart
Baby, you a turn on
I knew I was falling in love from the start
Baby, you a turn on
I've been slowly waiting
Ain't no hesitating
Girl my heart racing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing

[Verse 2]
Be quiet, I can't tell her nothing, STFU
You can't tell her nothing, I blow bands on her
I spent lettuce on her, buy her yellow diamonds, she's a damn Corona
I'm in Atlantic station, I'm geeked up
She got patients for me she got to wait for me
I'ma be with her until we ancient, ya see?
She got big ol' buggers on her ankle and feet
And she ain't no hooker but she dancing for me
She accept my partner even though he a thief
Molly tan, don't end it
And she like to hold my hand we in Lenox
She want to show out on all these bitches at M's
I know she bad for Young Thugger Thugger black cannon
I go slow like I'm screwed, I go fast like a semi

[Chorus]
Baby, you a turn on
I'ma put my trust inside of your heart
Baby, you a turn on
I knew I was falling in love from the start
Baby, you a turn on
I've been slowly waiting
Ain't no hesitating
Girl my heart racing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'm sipping champagne 'til we throw it up
I drinked enough for both of us
You talking way, way too fast for me now
So pour up everything to slow it all up
I talked about this "finally famous" lifestyle way back, baby when we was growing up
Made a few plays now everything that we talked about showing up, and I could chauffeur up
But I still get lost on the map to your heart
So far gone let's take it back to the start
To the part where we carved our name in the bark
Preserved all the feelings like it came in the jar
I guess life ain't no picnic basket
Put four years in and came out a bachelor
This time around how does me and you sound
Cause honestly to me it sounds mixed and mastered
Right?

[Verse 2: Maroon 5]
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away?

[Pre-Hook: Maroon 5]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Hook: Maroon 5]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

[Verse 3: Maroon 5]
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
Cause something strange has come over me
Now I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you

[Pre-Hook: Maroon 5]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Hook: Maroon 5]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
"childish gambino is a white rapper"

­i wanna be a white rapper

­i wanna be so white im the biggest rapper of all time

­i wanna be so white i can have a number one song with cursing and parents are fine with it

­i wanna be so white and so big i get eat dinner with the koch brothers

­i hope I'm so big and white i can go to clippers games and it not be a statement

­i hope I'm so white they let my friend out of jail sooner

­i hope I'm so big and white my cousin wasn’t shot and stabbed twice in the neck twice last month

­i wanna be so big.  so white

­i wanna be so big and and so white that white dads feel comfortable sending their daughters, who are home for the summer from Stanford, to my show

­and after the performance they come hang with me on my bus and we smoke and then we fuck to young dro and she holds my face in her hands and her eyes roll back in her head
­then she goes home and her dad says “how was the show?” and she says “it was fun. they had lasers.”

­i hope i become so big and and so white that G-Eazy  will say “damn, this nigga is white” and everyone will agree and nod

­i want to be so big and white that people are scared.  “what if this spreads?

­what if everyone starts to get big and white?  what if this works for everyone and everyone can experience this whiteness and this bigness?”

­i hope i become too big and too white

­but i am just a black male

­i am a nigga

­twitter activism is wack

­marches don’t work anymore

­police should be forced to wear recording devices
Okay, I don't, I don't give a football about what ya'll
Think about Lil Tune, I'm just hoping that it's good thoughts
Yeah, entertainment sports on your network
I love top 10 plays, yessir, best work
Live on TV, mama told me wear a dress shirt
Instead I wore a t-shirt, Michael Jordan sneakers
Red Sox ballcap my dreadlocks fall back
I still think I'm fly, show me where the tarmac
They say I'm taking over, I'm like where do I start at
Green Bay Packer but New Orleans where my heart at
LA Laker fan, let's give Drake a hand
For costing the Toronto Raptors 25 grand, I'm gone

[Verse]
Ay
Tell me what's happening, I'm addicted to plastering these rappers beats with my vocals
What happens when I'm ask to sing
No problem on instrumentals, I guess they ask for me
Then I answer, give em' cancer and they come back for me
So why they mad at me? Cause my mental capacity
Get to over lapping them bastards, the audacity
Haters even clap for me, realizing actually
I represent the betterment and they just late like Letterman, man
Trey Songz, page long, list of who I'm better than
Contact my liaison, I might need Excedrin
Sicker than I ever been, they want me instead of em'
And if they dislike it, I'm letting them, so let em' in (Come on)
Guess I'm 'spose to let em' win, if you was to bet again
It be best if you would just put paper on (the medicine)
I'll let you know, I walk all through your vestibule
I guess you know I'll stretch your ho, her love drip on my testicles
T.M.I. but he is I and I am him
Flyer than propellers, you so jealous, you can tell us just e-mail us
I'm a problem, no you's hatin', there ain't no calculatin'
I'm so nasty on the beat just like a freak that's masturbatin'
Be making fashion statements when I leave my place of residence
Feel like I'm intelligent and everybody's hella dense
Irrelevant and the only exception is my relevance
You lookin' at the future if ever I'm in ya presence shit
Hated right, Trey be like, "haters get ya' paper right"
Swear you fly, tellin' lies
Couldn't live a faker life
They love it, shout out to Kid Cudi
I like to live lovely in your city, somethin' pretty
Why the kids call you ugly? Man I'm buggin', I be trippin'
I be playin' but they listen
I'm saying what the business
What you missin', I'm the illest
I do this in my free time, man you can search but you will never find a weak line

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember, being young, dumb, looking for the next thrill
Angry adolescents, three things on our minds
Money, murder and you

[Chorus: 2 Chainz, (Drake) & A$AP Rocky]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(If finding somebody real is your fuckin' problem)
Bring yo' girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Picture perfect, uh huh
And I paint a perfect picture, my intention's to get richer
But I ain't tryna split the profit with ya
Every pocket on me bleeds, I'm a selfish ass nigga
Mmm, deuces up, black coupes is us (Uh, huh)
Or maybe the white on white, Ku and Klux
Head all in the bathroom
Beg for it, I'll be back soon
Fuckin' problem, fuck your problems
I got my own but one ain't a dollar
I got five phones for five different reasons
London, Tasha, Mya, Keisha
Courtney, blue-eyed devils with no Visas
Overseas, high heels, wine and pizza
Overdosed on bad bitches, I swear
One on both arm but need two pair, I beast

[Chorus: 2 Chainz, (Drake) & A$AP Rocky]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(If finding somebody real is your fuckin' problem)
Bring yo' girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
A.K.A. Benz-is-to-Me-Just-a-Car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow, mmm
Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya, beast

[Chorus: 2 Chainz, (Drake) & A$AP Rocky]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(If finding somebody real is your fuckin' problem)
Bring yo' girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it

[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Yea I'm back to drive you craz
With the hottest shit in the streets, no if's, and's, or maybe's
Errbody gather around from here to little Haiti
Cuz it's Busta (Luda) and (Young Weezy Baby)
With Flip Mode and DTP, shit be gettin' ugly
Weezy tell 'em what you rep (I represent Young Money)
Yea I know you got me homie (Busta, Bust I got you)
Real talk (I'm goin' in)
Get 'em killaaa

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm about to blast off call it rocket science
Daddy fat stacks check my pocket size
And if ya wanna try it, c'mon and try it
You don't want beef, I'll put you on a diet
I'm comin' through ya house with them choppas firin'
And all adults die, leave the toddlers cryin'
I've been a soldier, never met private ryan
Hey welcome to the jungle, and I'm the lion
I'm dippin' in my coupe, with the top behind me
I'm not the president, but I see cops behind me
Well fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, and they can not stop me
So I will be drivin' like Ricky Bobby
It's my prerogative like Whitney's Bobby
I'm skatin' on blades like Sidney Crosby (That's hockey)
Sharper than a ginsu shawty
You not Beyonce, but I can get you body

[Chorus]
Now you know what we about to do, we goin' full throttle
Niggas go and toss ya champagne, and throw a fuckin' bottle
Throw it up (you know we got em)
Throw it up (you know we got em)
Throw it up (you know we got em)
Throw it up (you know we got em)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I throw it up like a cap and tassel, I got my rap diploma
I throw it up like the gangs in Southern California
I Got them burners on ya, have you lookin' at a Russian Ruger
I'll be lookin' like a human torch
Then have you lookin' like Freddy Krueger
So don't be sleepin' on me, this ain't a fuckin' dream
I pass the rock to these jays like I'm on they fuckin' team
But I ain't slangin' dope, I slang Luda-vision
Hip-Hop's God in these jeans, now that's true religion
You couldn't fill my shoes, You couldn't fill my jockey
My niggas fight over ice like we been playin' hockey
I hope you get the goal, I hope you get the point
I'm on a roll with this paper, I hope you get the joint
I hope you fire it up, I hope it burn slow
I welcome chicks to my nest, I let these birds know
And eagles fly alone, so I'm about to take flight
And throw it up like ya girl's dress on prom night

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
When I spit, niggas be askin' "Who dat" It be the god
And I know you niggas really wanna know how the hell I "Do dat"
And the way that I come through
And kill every single thing when I rhyme
Nevermind, niggas can't compete when I spit a little beat same time
(Bring the beat back) My fans will leave ya fuckin' ass leakin'
For sayin' you nicer than me, hypothetically speakin'
Cool and Dre bring the fuckin' beat back for no reason
(Rewind It)
Niggas know my rap and know me for always beastin', Ok
When they see me they stutta, niggas know where I'm from
Scoon nu nu nu ba ba be, like the speakin' in tongues
I single handedly move like a thousand niggas kick on
Trample niggas like a heard of hippo's (Nigga)
When I get hot I pop like oil, that's when they call me crisco (Bitch)
That's when I seek revenge like the Count of Monte Cristo
Crack niggas like Nabisco, swallow a fifth for 'Sisco
A gangsta cat markin territory wherever the piss go
Now that I'm pissy drunk, why the hell you wanna thug and holla
I'll change that and have you consider studyin' Kabbalah (Shit)
They nicknamed me Kamala (Hey), kinda like the Ugandan giant
Flatten niggas with my foot, who wanna try it

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
And I'm in denial, uh
And it don't take no x-ray to see right through my smile
I know
I be on the go, uh
And there ain't no drink out there that can numb my soul
Oh no
Uh

[Chorus]
And all we wan' do is take the chains off
All we wan' do is break the chains off and
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is take the chains off
All we wan' do is break the chains off and
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is be free

[Verse 2]
Can you tell me why
Every time I step outside I see my niggas die?
Oh, I
I'm lettin' you know
That there ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul
Oh no

[Chorus]
All we wan' do is take the chains off
All we wan' do is take the chains off and
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is take the chains off
All we wan' do is break the chains off and
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is be free

[Interlude 1: Dorian Johnson:]
So now it was like the officer is pulling him inside the car and he's trying to pull away. And at no time the officer said that he was going to do anything until he pulled out his weapon. His weapon was drawn and he said, "I'll shoot you" or, "I'm going to shoot" and in the same moment, the first shot went off. And we looked at him and he was shot and there was blood coming from him, and we took off running—

[Bridge]
Are we all alone
Fighting on our own?
Please give me a chance
I don't wanna dance
Something's got me down
I will stand my ground
Don't just stand around
Don't just stand around

[Interlude 2: Dorian Johnson:]
As we took off running I ducked and hid for my life, 'cause I was fearing for my life, and I hid by the first car I saw. My friend, he kept running, and he told me to keep running 'cause he feared for me, too. So as he was running the officer was trying to get out of the car, and once he got out the car he pursued my friend—his weapon was drawn. Now he didn't see any weapon drawn at him or anything like that, us going for no weapon. His weapon was already drawn when he got out the car. He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and started to get down, but the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and he fired seven more shots and my friend died

[Chorus]
And all we wan' do is take the chains off
All we wan' do is break the chains off and
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is take the chains off
All we wan' do is break the chains off and
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is be free
Stephen Fry: I know people talk to you about all the same things but one of the things I just wanted to talk to you about, because it’s so obvious coming here, is the thing I think that you always say is most important to you, which is the fans, and they’re all outside and I gather you took them out some hot chocolate?

Lady Gaga: Actually, well, I sent them hot chocolate yesterday and macaroons, and then today I had press all day and I felt bad because I usually would leave the hotel and I would go to say “hi” but I knew that I wouldn’t have time and they’d be waiting all day, so I just went down and I brought them some fresh cookies and flowers.

SF: Ooooh! And do you find there’s a difference between your fans in different countries or is there a sort of similarity: is there a kind of Gaga fan who has a commonality?

LG: Yes, there is. The little monsters are a community and it’s kind of nice that everywhere I go they create a little home for me.

SF: Both those who, I suppose, describe themselves as your critics and those who adore you, as I do I’m unashamed to say, would concentrate on the fact that you are quite happy to be self consciously a spokesman for the dispossessed, the marginal, the freakish, the outsider, the sexually different, the ugly, the fat, the one who doesn’t fit in, the one who feels outside the tribe, if you like.

LG: Yes, it could be anybody.
SF: Which, in fact, is most of us. None of us really feels we belong, just some of us are better at hiding it than others.
LG: I think so. Some of us wear the mask prouder than others.
SF: Yes. Exactly. And the title of this album is the one that most directly addresses that, I suppose, Born This Way and the title song of it.
LG: Yes. The album is about being able to be reborn over and over again throughout your life.
SF: Oh, so it’s not just that God made me gay or God made me lesbian or God made me bi, and that’s who I am?
LG: No.
SF: It’s about being reborn, is it?
LG: No, not really.

Tell that bitch I’m good, pay me like she should
Shit on leather, grip on wood

["Fell In Love With A Girl" by The White Stripes]
Fell in love with a girl
I fell in love once and almost completely
But she's in love with the world
Sometimes these feelings can be so misleading
Can't think of anything to do
Yeah, my left brain knows that all love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new
Yeah, I said it once before but it bears repeating now

["Last Nite" by The Strokes]
Last night she said "Oh baby don't ya feel so down

Inside you're ugly, ugly like me
I can see through you and see the real you

[Verse 1]
Can someone tell that bitch, take her shoes off at the door?
When she walk all on my marble floor, I stunt like I'm supposed to
Black dreads hangin' off my niggas, shouts to Noah
Walk inside my crib, see dough so thick she can't even fold
Tell me why your bitch keep patrollin' like she 5-0
Say that she my bitch, but that bitch ain't even side ho
She gon' keep on workin' it for Fargo 'til her thighs broke
I can't throw no benjis if I ever see my side broke
Talk about your money, that's that shit that I don't gotta
Would talk about your bitch, but tell the truth, man I forgot her
I'm smokin' on some potent shit, that's loud as a whole choir
And I don't say shut up no more, I just tell a ho quiet
They know why, shit 'cause
I been with the killers talkin' dealers smoke
Niggas speakin' to you, but ain't really talkin'
Sittin' in the trap, eatin' cup of noodles
Higher than a nigga, Andy Milonakis
Niggas used to get it by the 8-ball
Now he tryna get it by the boat load
Condo sittin' out SoHo, smokin' on high grade
Sippin' on slow mo', nigga what's up?

[Chorus]
And you always said I'd be the one
Said I'd be the one
Spendin' all my 24 to get it
Yeah, that's the mission
Yeah, that's the mission
Yeah, that's the mission

[Verse 2]
Shit, don't forget to tell yo' bitch, take your shoes off at the door
When she walk on top this Persian rug, I stunt like I'm supposed to
Backwood swingin', smokin', hangin' out the door
Black drawers showin', jaw glowin' from my gold
Ghetto boujee nigga, order steak but eat them ramen noodles
Don't love yo' bitch, just fuck yo' bitch when I got time to do it
I say she lyin' if she say she wasn't tryna do it
Fargo ain't no rookie, man, that boy a pussy connoisseur
I know she won't fuck a famous nigga and be lit
Just like I'm playin' tag 'cause I can't fuck unless she it
It's your nigga, Argie Fargo, bitch, you used to braid my hair
Now you here up in my condo tryna fuck and be legit
Is she trill? Shit?
I be in the city where my niggas loco
By the Yorkdale while the bitches open
Bitch, this nigga wavy like I'm in the ocean
Pray we never got to let the semi open
Ain't into the he said, she said shit
Unless he said, she said that she take, uh
Ridin' 'round the city fuck one time
Shawty fuckin' wit' me but I only fuck one time, Fargo

[Chorus]
And you always said I'd be the one
Said I'd be the one
Spendin' all my 24 to get it
Yeah, that's the mission
Yeah, that's the mission
Yeah, that's the mission

[Intro]
This for my nigga Dunk, he gone
The squad really miss you! Aha!
What's up, Slim?

[Hook]
This for my nigga Dunk, he gone, I really miss you
When you died, man, a part of me died, too!
This for my nigga for you know, I really miss you!
You're locked up; I'm feeling like I'm doing time too!
It's for my momma, mom, you know I wanna kiss you
And every time I go to jail, she doing time, too (damn!)
This for my nigga, for you know, I really miss you
And every time you're doing time, I'm doing time too!
Aha, time too, time too
Time too, time too
Gucci Mane, time too, time too
Time too, time too
Time too, time too
And I tell that, play up, time too, time too!

[Verse]
After the rumor on the internet that Gucci locked up
Everybody getting heavy, wanna see me fucked up
Soon as I touched down, my man got locked up
Gucci back on the ground and his money back up
When I pull up to the club, gotta bring a brinks truck
Yeah, you're getting good money, but not balling like us
You can even see my Rolly, all these fifty pints up
Make them bite that bitch town just to fix it back up
Man, I miss my nigga Dunk so much, I'd dig his ass up
If I could bring his ass back, I would dig his ass up
We would really go to sleep, we were balling so much
BSM and 1017, third game, we stand up
Remember Flocka was my goon, now he ran his mills up
I feel like 

[?] and pop my real brothers  them my big bros
I feel like... brought those them my lil bros
I can't forget .. closer, cause they can't be real, bro!

[Hook]

[Verse 1: DMX]
Have you ever got up smiling, laid down crying
First you love life then wish you were dying
Bitch so fed up gave up trying
Kept it straight up but niggas kept lying
Ever seen something that you wanted so bad
And got it then wished it was something you never had
You ever been so lost than you thought you won't make it
If you ever been forced to do something you couldn't take it
You ever felt so strong or so loved
But when it came down it wasn't meant to be so hard
Wake yourself up like, where did I go wrong!?
Just get back up, pray on it and go on

[Hook:]
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it

[Verse 2: DMX]
Have you ever wanted to go right, but then chose left
Deep down with a lift to way shows death
Burn in the night but everyday shows stress
Regardless of what you think I'm going in that
Have you ever wished upon a star that really wasn't there
Gaze so in your heart, but really didn't care
Stand out at the wrong turn and now life ain't fair
And all you can do is take it, like ye
Ever found out that the shit you was living with
Deeper, cause to me is tryin' to creep ya
Back your Glock off put your ass in a sleeper
Used to be my dog, now he's the Grim Reaper

[Hook:]
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it

[Bridge:]
Ever seen something that you didn't want to see
Had to be something that you didn't want to be
Had to kill a nigga that looked just like me
Wanted to believe to have a trust like me
I seen the dark, I seen the light
I seen the day, I seen the night
I seen the wrong, I seen the right
I seen the start, I seen the final

[Hook x2:]
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got alot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got alot of it

[Intro: Jessie J]
You're stuck on repeat, repeat-peat, repeat
You're stuck on repeat, repeat-peat, repeat

[Verse 1: Jessie J]
I can see your mouth move
But I don't hear the words
And while you dig yourself a hole
You're burying me in the blur
I can taste the fake, the shame
I've heard this story before
And while you dig yourself a hole
It's the same shit, different girl

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie J]
When I was building a home, you made a bed of your own
A perfect little life for three
But now your cover is blown, you get to be on your own
And find another stupid girl like me
(Another stupid girl like me, another stupid girl like me)
(Another stupid girl like me, another stupid girl like me)

[Chorus: Jessie J]
So go out and party, 'cause I'm just getting started
And I'm dancing to a brand new beat
'Cause you're stuck on repeat, repeat-peat, repeat
You're stuck on repeat, repeat-peat, repeat
So go out and party like you're not brokenhearted
'Cause you'll always just be stuck on repeat
'Cause you're stuck on repeat, repeat-peat, repeat
You're stuck on repeat, repeat-peat, repeat
Repeat, repeat-peat, repeat
Repeat, repeat-peat, repeat
Repeat, repeat-peat, repeat
Repeat, repeat-peat, repeat (Oh yeah)
(Hey)

[Verse 2: Jessie J]
I wanna know, was I the one
Or just the chick on the side?
I gave it all, broke down my walls
You dare say I didn't try
But you won't stop, stop tellin' me what
What you think I want to know
I'm rejecting the sight of you, deleting the thought of you
Record this, and watch me go

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was building a home, you made a bed of your own
A perfect little life for three
But now your cover is blown, you get to be on your own
And find another stupid girl like me
(Yeah) (Another stupid girl like me, another stupid girl like me)
(Another stupid girl like me, another stupid girl like me)
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Jessie J]
So go out and party, 'cause I'm just getting started
And I'm dancing to a brand new beat
'Cause you're stuck on repeat, repeat-peat, repeat
You're stuck on repeat, repeat-peat, repeat
So go out and party like you're not brokenhearted
'Cause you'll always just be stuck on repeat
'Cause you're stuck on repeat, repeat-peat, repeat
You're stuck on repeat, repeat-peat, repeat
Repeat, repeat-peat, repeat
Repeat, repeat-peat, repeat
Repeat, repeat-peat, repeat

[Outro: Jessie J]
Yeah, oh, oh
You're stuck on repeat, repeat, repeat
You're stuck on repeat
R-r-r-epeat
You're stuck on repeat, repeat-peat, repeat
Oh, whoa

[Verse 1]
This dance, this dance
Is like a weapon, is like a weapon
Of self-defence, of self-defence
Against the present, against the present
The present tense
No, I won't get heavy, don't get heavy
Keep it light and keep it moving
I am doing no harm
As my world comes crashing down
I'll be dancing, freaking out
Deaf, dumb, and blind

[Chorus]
In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost

[Verse 2]
I won't turn around or the penny drops
Won't stop now, won't slack off
Or all this love will be in vain
To stop from falling down a mine
It's no one's business but mine
Where all this love has been in vain

[Chorus]
In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost
Drake has confirmed the title of his upcoming fourth studio album, Views From the 6, though he won't begin work on it until after he returns from his 31-city co-headlining tour with Lil Wayne. The tour, slated to start after the Canadian rapper's OVO Fest, will kick off August 8th in Darien Center, New York and run through September 27th, when it ends in Woodlands, Texas. That tour, which is sponsored by a video-game manufacturer, will feature a nightly competition between fans of the two rappers.


The meaning of the album title is unclear, but the announcement is just one part of what will be a busy summer for the rapper. On July 16th, Drake will host ESPN's ESPY Awards at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, where the ceremony will be televised live at 9 p.m. EST on the sports channel. The show intends to celebrate the best moments in sports with music, comedy bits and appearances by famous athletes.

Later in the month, Drake's label OVO Sound will release two records by artists he signed. Majid Jordan will put out A Place Like This on July 22nd, and PARTYNEXTDOOR will release PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO on the 29th. Drake recently made a guest appearance on the latter artist's "Recognize," streaming below via Rap-Up, which will appear on the album.

Drake will then stage OVO Fest in Toronto on August 3rd and 4th, when Outkast will perform and he will do his own set, with appearances by yet-to-be-confirmed special guests. This year, OVO Fest was awarded a CAN $300,000 government grant, which amounts to roughly US $268,000, as part of an initiative to help out festivals in Ontario. A press release claims the festival has sold out of the fest's 35,000 tickets.

[Verse 1]
Electric lights
Blow my mind

Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Verse 2]
You catch my eye
Bitch, you wanna fly?
I'm so alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

[Verse 3]
I'm such a star
Queen Boulevard
Blaze through the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school

Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

[Bridge]
Get my guitar
Sunglasses on
So light it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school

Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

T-Raww
Do this shit e'ryday

[Chorus]
I'm making money nigga e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
She making promises e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
I'm sipping somethin' smoking mary jane, mary jane, e'ryday
Kilos of gold on e'ryday, e'ryday, it's payday
I'm making money nigga e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
She making promises e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
I'm sipping somethin' smoking mary jane, mary jane, e'ryday
Kilos of gold on e'ryday, e'ryday, it's payday

[Verse 1]
Mozart with the Mulsanne
Most hated with the most chains
I'm polar bear on my ice game
You pointing fingers, someone to blame
I'm sick of shit, nigga, tired of liars
So high, feel like dying
No reparations, no check for slavery
My current location somewhere in Vegas
Man, I hope I make it, hope I make it
God's plan, not even you can save me
King Musa baby, I'm a Musa baby
I need baby like a more baby
Need décor baby, my house amazin'
Went so low like a temptation
Shit gettin' rough, gotta be abrasive
Signs of things, gotta keep a banger
Fuck that, when your end's low, can't trust nobody
My back against the wall, and I don't fuck with nobody
Know somebody caught a body and he haunted, I don't want that
Count your blessings, stop complainin'
Be precision with your aimin', 'cause I'm—

I'm making money nigga e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday

Kilos of gold on e'ryday, e'ryday, it's payday
I'm making money nigga e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
She making promises e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
I'm sipping somethin' smoking mary jane, mary jane, e'ryday
Kilos of gold on e'ryday, e'ryday, it's payday

[Verse 2]
Wish you knew somebody, wish you knew that keep it quiet
Ain't new to this island, if you knew me you be silent
Every day that's a new bitch in my face, what you say
Pop that Rollie in my case and my space like NASA sponsor
Pussy monster, chop that nonsense, it get violent 'round my way
It's poppin', better make your mind up, start that engine, need you start us
I'm typically not normal, I ain't atheist, so believe in me
All about my currency, dollar signs and king-ery (T-Raww)
The new Messiah, follow me into your freedom
I can lead you, swear of allegiance
No more pain and grievin'
Suffer long from dreamin'
When I know what's up with me and Wiz Khalifa
But me and Wiz Khalifa smokin' reefer
Then I'm flyin' private to a feature 'cause

[Hook]
I'm making money nigga e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
She making promises e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
I'm sipping somethin' smoking mary jane, mary jane, e'ryday

I'm making money nigga e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
She making promises e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
I'm sipping somethin' smoking mary jane, mary jane, erryday
Kilos of gold on e'ryday, e'ryday, it's payday
I'm making money nigga e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday

[Verse 1]
You’re quoting lyrics that I never thought you knew
He’s coming round again
‘Cos now he don’t give a fuck about you
And you’ll work it out soon

You’re throwing shapes at him
And everyone is so adorn
To see your face when you found out
The songs were all about you
But he’s the perfect gentleman to you

[Chorus]
It will all make sense, yes
It will all make sense
It will all make sense, yes
It will all make sense
It will all make sense, yes
It will make sense later on

It’s past 12 so I’m not getting up
It’s past 12 so I’m not getting up
It’s past 12 so I’m not getting up
It’s past 12 so I’m not getting up
It’s past 12 so I’m not getting up
It’s past 12 so I’m not getting up
It’s past 12 so I’m not getting up
Turns out that you don’t give a fuck and
All of those words
Were all about you
Were all about you
Were all about you
Were all about you
(It will all make sense, yes, it will all make sense)
Were all about you
(It will all make sense, yes, it will all make sense)
Were all about you
(It will all make sense, yes, it will make sense later on)

[Hook]
And you said "I am now in love"
If it's only for a while
But you're jealous and now in love
So just sit the fuck down and smile

[Verse 1]
And hey stop pushing me
I'm only here 'cos I wanna be
Your tight pants are way too scene

And now I'm through with talking to Jesus
'Cos he was a prick when I met him in Teasers
Now this is love without sleep

[Pre-Hook]
But watch out or you'll crash
And you'll go tumbling down like Jack or Jill
And cease to come back again

[Hook]
You said "I am now in love"
If it's only for a while
But you're jealous and now look
So just sit the fuck down and smile

[Verse 2]
Hey, this is for me
Exactly what you wanna be and I'm
So sorry you had to be

As soon as your brother got to the door
He was jumping off the roof like he does parkour, he broke his leg
I pissed myself and did one

[Pre-Hook]
Watch out or you'll crash
And you'll go tumbling down like Jack or Jill
And cease to come back again

[Hook]
You said "I am now in love"
She's only here for a while
But you're jealous and now in love
So just sit the fuck down and smile

[Bridge]
But what are you listening to?
But why are you listening to?
I guess you'll go with that

[Hook]
And you said "I am now in love"
If it's only for
You turn in the rain
You turn in the rain
You turn in rain
You don't need me
You don't need me
In a zen-like state
I turn my car around in your drive
You've got a great apartment
It's such a shame we can't go inside

[Chorus]
And she said, "All the drinks are all on me"
And she said, "All the drinks are all on me"
And all and all and all and all and all
And all and all

Come back to my apartment
And don't be afraid of the ghosts
Tonight, baby girl, we'll have a party
And they'll just be invisible hosts
For you

[Chorus]

Grab your shoes
And your bag
And grab your coat
And then she just flew back home
And then she just flew back home
And then she just flew back home
And then
Well, she just flew back home
And then she just flew back home
Then she just flew back home

[Verse 1]
Watch out he’s coming for you
Watch him as he finds us on your roof
Well I came back home to find out I’d not had sex with you

[Chorus]
Because now that you’re here
This song will go on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
Because now that you’re here
This song will go on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on

[Verse 2]
We’ve wasted too much time again
So tell my friends that I just had an accident
Go on just tell my friends
That I just had to go

[Verse 3]
Because now that you’re here
This song will go on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
Yes now that you’re here
This song will go
I can’t hear you
I can’t hear you
I can’t hear you
What did you say?

I can’t hear you
I can’t hear you
I can’t hear you
What did you say?

Fuck that
I’m sick of waiting on you
I dropped you off just as soon as I got my phone back
And I can’t hear you
I can’t hear you
I can’t hear you
Just what did you say?
(What did you say before?)

[Outro]
But but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what

If he finds you?

[Verse 1]
I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin' it's gonna be alright

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Verse 2]
I never miss a beat
I'm lightnin' on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
I'm dancin' on my own (Dancin' on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop groovin'
It's like I got this music in my mind

Hey, hey, hey
Just think, while you've been gettin' down and out about the liars
And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been gettin' down
To this sick beat

[Bridge]
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, "Oh my God!" But I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh, oh, oh

And it started when he was leaning on your car
He said please leave if you’re uncomfortable
And he said here’s the way it goes
But he cries at dashboard shows
And he’s making me uncomfortable
Let's fuck him up and hit the road

If I search I’ll find you
Yeah maybe through hide and seek
I’ll find you

And that's only if I'm pushing it too far 'cause I couldn’t bear to see you uncomfortable
Now the fun has gone away let it snow on Christmas Day
And I don’t care if you don’t believe me telling you your new boyfriend’s gay

And if I search I’ll find you
Yeah maybe through hide and seek

And if I search I’ll find you (I’ll find you)
And if I search I’ll find you
Hey, I watched your axe fall
Right through the bedroom floor
And I’m still five hits behind you
Your ninjas are a joke
Said I’ll collect up all them golden ropes
They’ll only slow you down
Or bring you close

And hey I’ll never watch Karate Kid without you
And hey I’ll never say the Golden Axe was a joke

Now I watched your axe fall
I can’t stand it when you’re so routine
(Now you’re so routine)
Hulk Hogan is the man
You know he kicked that Undertaker’s head

And hey I’ll never watch Karate Kid without you
And hey I’ll never say that Golden Axe was down

Well in four thousand miles we’ll meet you
Four thousand miles you’re left behind
And I’m so sorry that you couldn’t be
Well hold back your heartfelt stories
Your grandmothers lost her glory now
And I’m so sorry you had to be…

Yeah well the hotel’s got a ground floor
But your mother’s in the basement
And your dad just left he was crying on the steps like we’re all just trying to replace him well fuck you
And I’m so sorry that you’ll be

And hey I’ll never watch Karate Kid without you
And hey I’ll never say that Golden Axe was down

Well in four thousand miles, we’ll meet you
Four thousand miles you’re left behind
And I’m so sorry that you couldn’t be

Well hold back your heartfelt stories
Your grandmothers lost her glory now
And I’m so sorry that you’ll be

And hey now the hotel’s got a ground floor
But your mother’s in the basement
And your dad just left
He was crying on the steps
Like we’re all just trying to replace him
Well fuck you
And I’m so sorry that you’ll be
Well I will look and I will find
Yeah I will look and I will find
Yeah I will look and I will find
Yeah I will look and hey I will
Your days are switched
And I’m so impressed because
It looks like you dressed yourself today
Said when you go to join
If you keep this up
Then you’ll be the spitting image of your old man in no time

Go on, go on your way
And I will push you into the lake
Said focus all your rage I guess
Before I push you

Your mum and dad
Well they found it hard to be
Surprisingly different with me
In charge you’re like grabbing a feel
I'll fucking kill him if he touches you

Said focus all your rage
Along before I push you into the lake
Yes focus all your rage
Along before I push you
You're always delighted
At what was the same
Yeah you should've never been one
'Cos I've never been more proud of you like

Well I said think quick ‘cos it’s pissing it down
The flat and the rock as well they’ve all found out
A nice idea
It was a nice idea and I said
You can hold my hand or just walk away

Well I’m looking at you
And I’ve been looking straight at you and I’m
Here to say I’m right fucked off with you
'Cos you said that we could have
And Golden Gun is on but I’m being Oddjob

Are you coming back home soon
Coming back home soon
Coming back home
Any time soon

Well think quick cos it’s pissing it down
I wanna be soaked to the skin before we work this out
It was a nice idea
It was a nice idea and I said
You can hold my hand or you can walk away
Well I’m looking at you
Well I’ve been looking straight at you but I’m
Compelled to say I’m right fucked off with you
Cos you said that we could have
And Golden Gun is on but I’m being Oddjob

[Intro]
What's up? What's happening Jeezy? I just touched down
These hoes on me, Jeezy, for real

[Hook: Jeezy]
What I'm supposed to do, these haters on me
They make it so bad, these bitches want me
Spent the whole thirty grand, blew the whole clique, damn
When I fell up in the spot the forty on me
What I'm supposed to do, these haters on me
What I'm supposed to do, these bitches want me
What I'm supposed to do, these haters on me
What I'm supposed to do, these bitches want me

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
There be no hating, no faking, no lying, no snitching
You play with it, you go there, you cross line, I'm tripping
Them hoes try them long clips, I'm going straight loco
Your clique poor, you dead broke, I'm world wide, you local
I'm grinding, I'm shining, I'm stunting, I'm flexing
Them bitches you came with, they all in my section
They smoking, we drinking, they turnt up, they sipping
She spilled Don P on me, I said bitch you tripping
My weed costs, my belt costs, my jeans cost a grip, bitch
And you know that four cal is right here on hip, bitch
Two door cost half mil, that there be rich shit
Don't know me? You hate me? That there be bitch shit

[Hook: Jeezy]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Keep the shit talking, turn me up a little more, uh
Oh my God, look what I just bought
Another presidential rollie, don't ask what it costs
And you might get lost, come into my crib
I'm just a young nigga, getting it how I live
I'm supposed to stacking, supposed to be grinding
Supposed to be swagging, supposed to be shining
Supposed to be way up ahead of my game
While you in back, or stuck in the line
I'm spending my cash, I'm in this bitch, rolling my grass up
Club's so packed in there, can't no one get past us
Oh, I'm with my whole crew, spent thirty thousand in the club
That's what I'm supposed to do, say fuck the chase
I drink it straight, like what I'm supposed to do
If you made what I made a show you'd probably throw it too

[Hook: Jeezy]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I told a bitch to bring her friend, like what I'm supposed to do
I bought a bottle, drink it straight, like what I'm supposed to do
I hit the club on hella hoes, like what I'm supposed to do
And V.I.P. be rolling drugs, like what I'm supposed to do
You see me driving foreign cars, like what I'm supposed to do
A hundred deep up in this bitch, can't see me rolling through
This nigga tripping, took his bitch, like what I'm supposed to do
A young rich nigga, I'm buying for my whole crew
And I'll serve a nigga pound if he roll through
Real niggas with me and they well known too
And if I'm smoking one you best believe she smoking too
A million dollars, one summer, what I'm supposed to do, uh

[Hook: Jeezy]

[Verse 1: Usher]
A foreign beauty so exotic
When she smiled at me, she took my breath away
She's reminiscent of a goddess
It's a shame that we could not communicate
How do I say...

[Chorus: Usher]
How do I say hello? I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
My baby, how do I say, how do I say?
How do I say?

[Verse 2: Usher]
The room was filled with a sweet aroma
When she danced, her hips moved oh so sensuous
She speaks with her body, so hypnotic
In the language that I never will forget

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
I hear her calling
Spinning around in the crowd till she found me
Then she started moving closer and closer
Does she know that I want her, I want her?
I wanna be with her tonight
So I caressed her face, kissed her lips
All my life, I've never felt quite like this
I've never had a loss for words
One kiss from her has got me speechless

[Chorus: Usher]
How do I say hello? I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
Mujer bonita, how do I say, how do I say?
How do I say hello? I really wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
Mon chéri, how do I say, how do I say?

[Bridge: Usher]
Baby, let's engage in a deep conversation
In the body language we speak, won't need any translation
An odyssey of physical pleasure
As we explore
Together, this universal language of our love
(my love, my love, my love) x2
Can you tell me, how do I put it into words?

[Chorus: Usher]
How do I say hello? I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
Molto bella, how do I say, how do I say?
How do I say hello? I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
Mon chéri, how do I say, how do I say?
How do I say hello? I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
Mujer bonita, how do I say, how do I say?

[Outro: Usher & Female]
I want you (te deseo)
How do I say?
I need you (te necesito)
How do I say?
Can I have you? (tienes que ser mío)
How do I say?
What must I do? (¿qué debo hacer?)
How do I say, how do I say?
What is your name? (¿cuál es tu nombre?)
How do I say?
So beautiful (eres tu hermoso)
How do I say?
Can I take you? (¿puedo tenerte?)
So precious (tan precioso)
How do I say?
I love you (te amo)
How do I say, how do I say?
How do I say?
How do I say?
How do I say?

[Intro]
Rrrr ting (Brrt, brrt)

[Verse]
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (Ga, grrra-ga-ga-ga-ga)
Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy (Watch that)
Get hurt, boy (Get hurt)
Aww, here go another muhfucker that don't understand
The concept of puttin' money first, boy (First)
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy (Work)
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy (Work)
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy (Worst)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business (Get it)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
Rolling swishers, hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it (Naw)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (Why?)
You too worried 'bout the bitches (What you worried 'bout?)
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it (Try a ting)
She'll admit it, she'll admit it (Try a ting)
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished (Why?)
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy (Hot up in the 6)
Shit hot up in the 6 right now
Shit hot up in the 6, boy (Hot up in the 6)
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now (Ga, ga, ga)
Come see us and get it fixed, boy (Hey)
Black Benz on the road, boy (On the road)
Already had a Rolls Royce (On the road)
Sold a couple Bentley last week
Them were my old toys (Man, this shit is old)
I give a fuck about old boy (Man, that boy old)
I give a fuck about his squad, boy (Man, that thing old)
I give a fuck about your mob, boy (Oh)
I'm the real 6 God, boy (Whoa)
I'm about to say a true thing (Yeah)
I'm about to say a true thing (Yeah)
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
Goddamn, you changed
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things

[Outro]
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this, I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
Yeah, so I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now

[Verse 1]
Tell me what it means
To be black, someone tell me what it means
Who I gotta vote for, who am I to be
What car I gotta drive, where I gotta buy my jeans, black man
If you ain't really hood, you can't be a black man
Is it cause I'm proper when I speak, black man
Should I be a chain and gold teeth black man
Or a Martin Luther King had a dream black man, a dream black man
You really gotta practice what you preach, black man
How you gonna talk about peace, black man
When I got death threats on my screen
I am not the enemy, black man
So who draws the first straw
Everybody hurt, who caused the first scar
Cause as soon as you see niggas get to fighting
You be the first mother fucker wanna yell out World Star
Can't nobody else touch a nigga
But it's cool for a brother just to bust a nigga
Guns sold in every hood, he'll slay a dozen niggas
Gon' kill yourself, while you're at it, take a couple with you
And that don't justify the cop shit, I'm just on some black mob shit
The best way to protest, hit 'em where it hurts, their pockets
It's time to boycott shit
We need less rappers and more doctrines
We need less ballers and more prophets
We need more unity, less gossip
But who am I to speak, I never went to college
I hate to be the bearer of bad news
But all of this double standard thinking is taboo
If black hate is a myth, the term new black wouldn't even exist
I pray for tomorrow, I pray for the sorrow
I pray for the truth and I pray for Chicago
I pray for Detroit and I pray for Oakland
I pray for Port Au Prince and I pray for New Orleans
Somebody let me know, how can I be a better African American
Like I ain't grow up being black in America
Like I ain't grow up around crack, AIDS and heroin
Damn

[Chorus]
They don't really know, black man
They don't really know, ugh, they don't really
They don't really know, black man, black man, black man

They don't really know, ugh, they don't really
They don't really know, black man, black man, black man

They don't really know, ugh, they don't really
They don't really know, black man, black man, black man

They don't really know, ugh, they don't really know, ugh

[Verse 2]
Sim simmer sim simmer, ugh
Pour some liquor, for my niggas, ugh
Bust a swisher, roll a cigar
Hitta another strip club, throw my income
Well, I guess it's all we know
Hate is all we been taught, so that's all we show
Just a nigga from Decatur, white as all our doors
Even though the days of dark, still we all got hope
So what's the motive
We don't control shit, cause we don't own shit
Even in our own hoods, we ain't votin'
And not just for Obama, but locally voting, that's power
Rome wasn't built in just an hour
Can you hear me, do I need to speak louder
Christopher Columbus ain't the only one founder
They don't mention niggas that was on the Mayflower
Wait a second, let it soak, mind blown
Bobby Ray from a different timezone
I dare to speak my mind, and I'm wrong
Well shove it up your ass with a pinecone
I'm tryna paint the bigger picture
You looking for the enemy, then stare into the mirror
I said I'm trying to paint a bigger picture
You looking for the answer, then look into the mirror, black man

[Chorus]

[Outro: B.o.B Speaks]
I'm not even against the whole movement
Like I'm not even hating on it
It's just, if we put that energy into ourselves
And into our community
And not so much into complaining about how we've been done wrong
And, and we have been done wrong, but it's like
We gotta stop just saying the same thing and do something different
All this energy that we're putting into protesting
We should put it into our community
Put it into start up businesses, put it into your kids
Put it into your community
Start our own businesses
So we don't have to support all these other businesses
Feed the, fuck, feed the homeless all year
Do this all year, don't just stop
Don't just stop after this case is over
Don't just stop after this topic, keep it going

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you 'til you come home
Here all alone, I'll stay alone for your love
For your love (Oh-oh)
For your love (Oh-oh)
For your love (Oh-oh)
For your love (Oh-oh)
For your love (Oh-oh)
For your love (Oh-oh)

[Verse 1]
Put my pimp cup down, nothing lost, nothing found
It's the things that you do, that makes me love you
Turn around and thump thump, that's what I want you to do
Even when I want you, I hope you want me too

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you 'til you come home
Here all alone, I'll stay alone for your love
For your love (Oh-oh)
For your love (Oh-oh)
For your love (Oh-oh)
For your love (Oh-oh)
For your love (Oh-oh)
For your love (Oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
I know what I'ma do now, I'ma keep you around
I like your teeth when you smile and your booty is like wow
So turn around and thump thump, all that junk in your trunk
I really, really want you, I hope you want me too

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you (Yeah) 'til you come home (Yeah, yeah)
Here all alone (I'm here, I'm here, I'm here), I'll stay alone for your love (For your love)
For your love (Yeah, oh-oh)
For your love (Yeah, oh-oh)
For your love (Yeah, oh-oh)
For your love (Oh-oh)
For your love (Love, oh-oh)
For your love (For your love, for your love, oh-oh)
Gucci Mane;
Order more drinks from the bar, that's basic
Ten bottles of champagne, I ace it
Baby so horny, and I'm so wasted
Patron shots but I still can't taste it
Gucci Mane the shit, punk boy just face it
Woke up home, don't know how I made it
Walked in the club and the club got crazy
Told the DJ, Hey let's get faded
Higher than a white boy, I'm Slim Shady
Dancin' on the dance floor with your old lady
Maybach benz, Can I fit em in? Maybe
Drownin' in Don Piece, someone save me
Bricksquad's a army, no we're the navy
I'm a kush smoker, I blow kush daily
Hunnid dollar haircut, my temp fade wavy
The East Atlanta Mob told me its all gravy

[Hook]
I touch a lotta paper, I been havin' this shit
I got a bookbag full of hunnids, I been stashin' this shit
Private jet to Las Vegas, I've been gamblin' and shit
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (We ain't the average clique)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ridin foreign, ridin foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ridin foreign, ridin foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ride-ride foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ride-ride foreign)

[Verse 1]
Gimme the keys to the van, fi-fi-fifty keys in the van
You can bleed in the van, you can leave in the van
Take a chance with the man, then I'm squeezin my hand (HA!)
But the man in the back ain't part of the clan
Slapped him with the gun 'bout as hard as I can
Took the dope out the van then I ran with the bands
If a nigga try to follow, find his head in the trash
Smash on your ass, I'll blast at your ass
100-yard dash in the grass for the cash
Brick and a Carbon-15 in the stash
But he still got found with his brains on the dash (EW!)
You a big bully, was a fool in the past
Fuck that nigga, I ain't cool with his ass
Two bags of the gas, now the wolves on his ass
Fuck around with Gucci Mane get some holes in his ass
Fifty goons on me when I came to the Bash
Po-Po-Point a nigga out that you want me to smash
Two size of the trap, put the trash on the track
If that the only son track then it might be a crash
Yellow ice, white ice, little shitty glass
Swag so sick that I might have a rash
Rollin a blunt while I'm hittin it from the back
Where your name tatted at, where I'm dumpin the ash

[Hook]
I touch a lotta paper, I been havin this shit
I got a bookbag full of hundreds, I been stashin this shit
Private jet to Las Vegas, I've been gambling and shit
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (We ain't the average clique)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ridin foreign, ridin foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ridin foreign, ridin foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (Ride-ride foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (Ride-ride foreign)

[Verse 2]
Hahn!
I can't even lie, I'm in my own lane (GUCCI!)
Talk so much shit cause I got my own slang (huh?)
Bricksquad is my own squad, I got my own gang (SQUAD!)
Stamps on the bricks, got my own 'caine (GUCCI!)
These niggas followers, don't got they own brain (durr...)
Tr-Trickin off but won't take care of they own kids (damn...)
This Gucci Mane and people say I'm on drugs (true)
I tell them people "go get on your own dick"
When you the boss nig-ga you make your own rules
I'm the only nigga that don't need no cosigner
And my suede shoes match my suede headliner
And my closet filled with the top designers

[Hook]
I touch a lotta paper, I been havin this shit
I got a bookbag full of hundreds, I been stashin this shit
Private jet to Las Vegas, I've been gambling and shit
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (We ain't the average clique)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ridin foreign, ridin foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ridin foreign, ridin foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (Ride-ride foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (Ride-ride foreign)

Come on, come on
1-2-3

[Verse 1]
It was, like, six of us
Three in the Benz, three in the truck
On 85, headed to the Plush
10 minutes later is when we pulled up
I parked the Benz
Hit the alarm, glanced down at my rims
Tucked in my pant leg in the tongue of my Timbs
Hand in my shirt to reveal the gems
Proceeded to walk in, just then, I saw this
Magnificent misses
Sipping on a glass of Cris
With a couple of her friends giggling
I knew...

[Chorus]
You are the one
I don't give a damn
Even if you got a man
Take my hand, girl
You are the one
Girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance
Take a chance, girl

[Verse 2]
Said, I know you got a few with you
Don't even trip, I got my crew here, too
Keep it real, what you wanna do?
I really wanna chill with you
Tell your friends
They can hop in the truck, we'll take the Benz
But if we split up, maybe we can hook up again
You never know, I guess that all depends
If I can get you from the floor to the door of my six-O-O
Two-O momo's and low Pro's
So finish that Mo', get your coat
Tell your girls, "come on, let's go"
'Cause you are...

[Chorus]
You are the one
I don't give a damn
Even if you got a man
Take my hand, girl
You are the one
Girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance
Take a chance, girl
You are the one
I don't give a damn
Even if you got a man
Take my hand, girl
You are the one
Girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance
Take a chance, girl

Girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance

[Verse 1]
I've been looking at you turning brothers down
Some got their song, well, it's time for me to holler now
(Your body is calling, don't fight it)
Ooh, I like it
You're dancing alone, what's that all about?
You're so fine, but it's time for me to call you out
(Watch out, I'll straight run up on you)
Girl I want you

[Chorus]
You're the hottest thing in the club tonight
Having visions of making love tonight
With you constantly to the break of dawn
We can shake the spot if you say it's on

[Verse 2]
Dancing so close, got me up like, "whoa!"
We're doing the most, Is leaving with you possible?
(Your body is saying you want to)
And I want you
More than you know, sugar, if only for one night
I'll make you feel like you've been to paradise
(It's all up to you, tell me something, baby)
I know one thing

[Chorus]
You're the hottest thing in the club tonight
Having visions of making love tonight
With you constantly to the break of dawn
We can shake the spot if you say it's on
You're the hottest thing in the club tonight
Having visions of making love tonight
With you constantly to the break of dawn
We can shake the spot if you say it's on

[Bridge]
Baby, tell me, what's on your mind?
Do you think that I'm being too forward?
Ooh baby, by coming at you this way
I can't help myself, you're...

[Chorus]
You're the hottest thing in the club tonight
Having visions of making love tonight
With you constantly to the break of dawn
We can shake the spot if you say it's on
You're the hottest thing in the club tonight
Visions of making love tonight
With you constantly to the break of dawn
We can shake the spot... say it's on
You're the hottest thing in the club tonight
Visions of... love tonight
Constantly... break of dawn
Shake the spot... say it's on

[Intro]
Yeah, let me holla at you real quick
I'ma bring y'all back to the good old, good old days
You feel me?
Some of that
Good old, good old, good old ghetto, good old
Good old, good old ghetto
Good old, good old ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Good old...

[Verse 1]
I told my man I'm having a barbecue
So grab some folks and won't you slide right through
He brought this shorty that I used to know
It brought me back to when I was in school
She said, "Usher where have you been?
We used to kick it every now and then
Remember when I used to call your phone
And tell you come on 'cause my mama's gone
How about them times I had to throw a rock at your window
To let you know
To come downstairs and open the door?
And after that, baby, it was on, fa sho"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now, honey got my head spinning around, for real
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout how good you used to feel
And I got a girl now and I don't get down like this
But I must admit I'm tempted and starting to reminisce
'Cause...

[Chorus]
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto

[Verse 2]
Now, she's asking me to take her
On a tour of my house so we can catch up
For all the time lost since I blew up
And became the man that drops his pants and every girl around the world is dying to love
Break the beat down, let me tell you what I'm talking about
If you're not careful, it'll turn you out
It's that way she used to go when you want it nice and slow
Even though you can't, the memory will make you want some more
She used to understand me, touch me, hold me
Taught me how to be a man
She used to kiss me, all them things she used to show me
Damn, I wish that I could do it again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Honey got my head spinning around, for real
Cause I’m thinking ‘bout how good you used to feel
But I got a girl now and, yo, she’s right upstairs
And I must admit I’m tempted and starting to not care
'Cause...

[Chorus]
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto

[Verse 3]
Never had somebody that's so bad
Somebody with a whole lot of body
Attitude that'll make you wanna leave the one you with
'Cause you know how good it is
Not a prissy, little missy, baby, talk that slang
I used to love how she kissed me when she popped that thing
She was a friend of the fam, hot without the glam, not
When I be tripping, she didn't really give a damn, stop
It's what I need to do 'cause I know what this is leading to
If I keep on thinking about that back and I'm gonna be right back in it
'Cause, yo...

[Chorus]
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto

[Intro: Usher]
Yeah, ayo
2000, it's us
Yo, it's time to U-Turn
You heard me?
You're either with us or against us

[Verse 1: Usher]
It's been some years now
Since we hit the floor to get down
We always had a step to go with the sound
Now everybody wanna sit around, drink and ball
Remember the snake
And how the floor used to clear and everybody would break
What's crunk now used to be called getting to it
I'm bringing it all back, this is how we do it
Just...

[Chorus: Usher]
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn

[Verse 2: Usher]
In the '80s, fresh was the talk
MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk
In the '90s, I had a high flat top
Doing the wop, Pee-Wee to the Reebok
I can't forget about my high school days
The sound was Bobby Brown, the dance was the running man
Now everybody wanna push Bentleys
The year is 2, everybody, do the U-Turn

[Chorus: Usher]
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn (Come on)

[Bridge: Usher]
All you need to do is let go (All you gotta do)
Let the tempo take over you
I came to have a good time
Let the rhythm deep inside your soul
Let it lead you to the floor (Ah), come on

[Chorus: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me
Come on, come on, it ain't hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me
Come on, come on, it ain't to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn

[Chorus: Usher]
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's...

[Intro]
Hello everybody
Welcome, today, to the wonderful world of you
Now, check it, you have two options:
You can eat it
Or throw it away

[Verse 1]
See, it's a shame that when you're working hard and doing well People hate you
Buying nothing else but the best for yourself
They really hate you
You gotta live for you and no one else
Don't let them make you feel
Like you're not being real
Just live how you wanna live
You gotta do for you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Dig that)
If you work hard, play hard (dig that)
And do what you wanna do (dig that)
Just pop your collar, don't let what people say bother you (dig that)
You perpetrators, I got something to say (dig that)
You can eat it or throw it away (picture that)
You're just mad 'cause you're following in my trap
But can you dig that?

[Chorus]
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you

[Verse 2]
You can see me every week
Hanging out with a different girl sitting next to me
'Cause I'm not about to settle down right now
I gotta be free
Some of y'all fellas might be jealous
But y'all know that don't phase me
I just pop my collar, tip my hat
And turn my back on the ones that hated me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Dig that)
Never going home alone (dig that)
If she follows, then you know it's on (dig that)
She use the pager, not the cellular phone (dig that)
I let her know I won't be around for long (dig that)
To all you haters, I got something to say (what's that?)
You can eat it or throw it away (picture that)
Stop hating, wishing, waiting
Anticipating for my heat to fade

[Chorus]
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you

[Bridge]
I break my neck for the things I get
So much sweat, just so I can get that check
And I'm not gonna let nobody bring me down
Nobody's gonna steal the crown
Because I eat good, I live good
I rock good, my life good
If you got a lot and you're working for it
Pop your collar, don't be afraid to show it

[Chorus]
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, T-T-P
Oh, oh, oh, T-T-P

[Verse 1]
Somebody tell me
Why do people stay in situations that'll never work?
And 'bout you wanna leave and you can't wait to get even
But deep inside, it really hurts
You never should've ever got in the mix
You never understand till you go through it
All the right things to say, the wrong things to do
Why you out and trying to pick and choose?

[Chorus]
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package

[Verse 2]
I used to be young and dumb and always wanted to run
In the streets 'cause I thought that was where it was at
But it wasn't, all it did was leave a brother in the cold
With nowhere to go
I caught myself slipping, thinking I was the lick
I was tripping, trying to jump dip to dip
I thought it was the way to be happy
Until somebody took time to tell me

[Chorus]
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package

[Verse 3]
So many people think they got it, but they don't have a clue
You gotta have more than just a body for me to be talking about you
Take it from me, when playing the game, your day will come
When you gotta stop what you doing, start looking for the one

[Bridge]
Don't stop
Keep looking, fellas
Don't stop
You got to get it, get it
All and together now
Keep looking, fellas
Don't stop
You got to get it, get it

Don't stop
Keep looking, fellas
Don't stop (trying to be with somebody that keeps it)
You got to get it, get it
Don't stop
Keep looking, fellas
Don't stop

[Chorus]
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package

[Chorus: Usher]
Girl, what's up?

[Chorus: Usher]

[Bridge: Usher]
What's your name? Baby, what's your number?
'Cause, girl, you got me, you got a brother wondering
If you want a homie and a lover
I can be your friend till the end

[Verse 3: Usher]
Would it, should it be a problem
If I holler, "õcomo se llama?"
Would you bother, like Donna Summers?
Girl, give me this last dance
We slowly skating, babe, don't wanna float away
'Cause we got the light, you be the ball, and I'ma be the chain, babe
Now, rotate (round and round and round)
You got nowhere to go, babe
Illuminate and create a new thing
Let them paparazzi this you and me thing
But we can't do a thing till I know your name

[Chorus: Usher]
Girl, what's up?
I'm going crazy
Hey, girl, what's up?
'Cause I wanna know if I can love you
Yo, girl, what's up?
Yo, won't you be my lady, yeah?
Hey, girl, what's up?

[Verse 4: will.i.am]

[Chorus: Usher]

[Outro: Usher]
Hey, girl

Hey, girl
Hey, girl
Hey, hey
Hey, girl
Hey, hey

[Intro]
You gonna say something to the people?

[Chorus]
Prayer for you
A prayer to you
Do I sound that bad?

[Verse 1]
Just the simple thought of you means everything
To my life you give meaning you're the best thing
So precious, my gift for life
That's why I send you up this prayer
I pray for your protection, your covering
That everything intended for you, you'll receive
And I'll believe He'll guide you
Lord, honor my prayer

[Chorus]
Prayer for you
A prayer to you
I pray for you
Pray for you

[Verse 2]
I'll do my best to be there for you every day
To be what my father wished he was to me
Baby, I got you
Daddy, you'll be there (I'll be there)
To encourage you to be the best you can be
You carry my name, I pray that you're better than me

[Outro]
I ain't going nowhere, even when I get on your nerves
'Cause I'm your daddy
My prayer for you
Son, I pray for you

[Verse 1]
Listen, I'd be a liar if I told you that I didn't see it coming
Be more of a liar if I said, "Hey, I didn't want it to be something"
You deserve much better for the love that you have shared
I know you won't believe it, but girl, I swear

[Pre-Chorus]
That I got love for you, big love for you
Even when I'm tripping
The fact remains that you will always be my baby
My baby
But dig the truth, baby, dig the truth
I can't hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see

[Chorus]
That my heart is in two different places
I got you in my life and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right
Someone tell me, what's a man to do when he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie, but he can't tell the truth?
What's a man to do when he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart in two different places?
(Not in two different places)

[Verse 2]
I know you feel it 'cause you stayed
There is much more to this story
But I'd be a fool to say I trust her and I'm always gonna love her
You know that you don't wanna hear
How I'm living on the edge, baby
So I just say, "Yeah, baby"
She ain't nothing, but she is real
But why I take her through it

[Pre-Chorus]
When I still got love for you, big love for you
Even when I'm tripping
The fact remains that you will always be my baby
My baby
But dig the truth, baby, dig the truth
I can't hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see

[Chorus]
That my heart is in two different places
I got you in my life and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right
Someone tell me, what's a man to do when he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie, but he can't tell the truth?
What's a man to do when he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart in two different places?
(Not in two different places)

[Bridge]
I wanna tell you it's over, that I ain't thinking of her
I wanna really mean it, that I want you to see it
That I'm really trying to leave her behind
And I'm trying not to make you cry
I wanna tell you that I ain't playing games
And I'm dedicated to receive a change
But when I look in the mirror, it's the same old man

[Chorus]
That my heart is in two different places (oh)
I got you in my life (my life) and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces (faces)
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right
Someone tell me, what's a man to do when he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie, but he can't tell the truth?
What's a man to do when he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart in two different places?
(Not in two different places)

[Outro]
Not in two different places

[Verse 1]
I'm hoping that this ain't too hard to believe
'Cause baby, you're the only one for me
I know it get hard when I'm moving in and out of state
But I promise my heart for you, I would save
Just remember that...

[Chorus]
No matter how far I go
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing can change
Forever yours, here I stand
Here I stand, baby

[Verse 2]
You're like a mirror to my soul, but a queen, my queen
And finally now I know just what that means, oh yeah
You're the blessing I never thought I would get
And to the Lord, I humbly bow my head

[Chorus]
Just remember that no matter how far I go
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing can change
Forever yours, here I stand

[Bridge]
Ever since you came (since you came along)
It seems like (couldn't get it right)
Yeah, I felt I sunk so low
That there's was no way I could be found (never thought love would find me)
And when we make love (everytime you give, give to me your love)
Give, you make me feel a way I never felt with no one else
And I can't help myself

[Chorus]
I'm telling you that no matter how far I go
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing, nothing, baby
Never change the way I feel, I'm your man
Listen, see, forever yours
Yours, all yours, here I stand, yeah
No matter how far I go
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing can change
Forever yours, I'll remain, here I stand

[Verse 1]
Can you help me?
Anybody out there help me
Please, can you help me?
Excuse me mister, I fell on hard times
I need some help, but don't need a dime
Don't turn away, I'll wash your clothes
If you let me stay, I'll find your remote

[Bridge]
Day after day, people walk by
I can't catch their eyes, I pull out my sign

[Chorus]
It says: "will work for love"
I will, I will, I will
I'll work for love overtime
Babe, it says: "Will work for love"
I will, I will, I will
I'll work for love for all my life
I will work for love

[Verse 2]
Can you help me?
Anybody out there help me
Please, can you help me?
Excuse me, you two, got love to spare?
Search my whole heart, it ain't none in there
Pardon me, sister, I'm on my last
Don't have no love, that's okay, God bless

[Bridge]
Day after day, people walk by
I can't catch their eyes, I pull out my sign

[Chorus]
It says: "will work for love"
I will, I will, I will
I'll work for love overtime
Babe, it says: "Will work for love"
I will, I will, I will
I'll work for love for all my life
I will work for love

[Bridge]
I remember the day I lost my heart
Took it for granted, I went too far
Fall down, cried, and then begged
To feel that love again
I hold on this sign till the very end
Do anything

[Chorus]
I will, I will, I will
I'll work for love overtime
Babe, it says: "Will work for love"
I will, I will, I will
I'll work for love for all my life
I will work for love

[Outro]
Help me, I will work for love

[Intro: T.I.]
I know radio prolly ain't gonna play this
But chopper going off in the hood man like Afghanistan
Or the Gaza strip somewhere man
Yeah, we hear it so much we probably numb to it by now
After all, it’s the American way right?

[Hook: Skyler Grey]
Home of the brave and free
Free just to murder me
Land of the beautiful
Cursed by the hate we throw
Is this the new national anthem?
Is this the new national anthem?

[Interlude: T.I.]
It's America, land of the handgun
Home of the shotgun
You're dead if you ain't got one
It was like this before I got here, baby I ain't do it!
I ain't start it, I'm just a part of it
Turn it!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
You say this the home of the brave I guess
I say this the home of the K’s and the vets
All alone with the J’s smoking yay cause he stressed
On chrome with a Tek taught to spray for respect
I learned from the best used to stay in the “jects”
Bought work from the vets burning rubber in the 'Vettes
This as good as it gets used to play with the rats
Then I got older and learned stay away from the rats
God blessed this nigga, to hustle up and make eight figures
Turned from a goon to a great young nigga
No complaining just doing what it take young nigga
I was raised in a decade of hate young nigga
Always dodging polices because they hate young niggas
And we hate them too, 38 in him shoe
All the changes the system will take him through
He ain’t a killer but he will if you make him do it
Homicide he’ll ride, they’ll put him on trial
Let him have a life sentence then do it with a smile
And he only 19, he ain’t even had a child
As a child, told his mama he’ll be gone for a while
And she cried, still they just put him inside
Now she all on her own because her other son died
Listen to the politician as he lied and he lied
He a snake in a suit, trying to hide in disguise

[Hook: Skyler Grey]
Home of the brave and free
Free just to murder me
Land of the beautiful
Cursed by the hate we throw
Is this the new national anthem?
Is this the new national anthem?

[Interlude: T.I.]
Well damn officer, what did I do?
Naw hold up man, don’t shoot, I live over there
Ay, man what you doing? You trippin, dawg
How many times has that ever happened to you?
What the fuck do you know about being a black man in America?
And you wonder why we walk around with straps

[Verse 2: T.I.]
For the stars and the stripes prison bars and the pipe
Young nigga rolling weed in a cigar he can light
Bang red either blue selling hard and the white
Live by the gun, never run from a fight
Trayvon in a hoodie, walking through the neighborhood he
Didn’t do shit to buddy, he didn’t have to die did he?
I guess it’s because his dad was a judge in the city
They didn’t want him in the pen with the thugs that could get him
A jury of his peers said all was forgiven
But touch one of mine, right or wrong, I’ma kill them
Fill them with the lead like they put in Martin Luther King’s head
Like they killed Malcolm X, Edgar Hoover did that
You can catch me in the hood where they shooting niggas at
They don’t know if Neighborhood or the Hoovers did that
Whether Piru or VL's or GDs wit me we
Down to uprise from the OG’s to peewees

[Hook: Skyler Grey]
Home of the brave and free
Free just to murder me
Land of the beautiful
Cursed by the hate we throw
Is this the new national anthem?
Is this the new national anthem?

[Interlude: T.I.]
Don’t get it fucked up
If you ain’t found something you’re willing to die for
You ain’t fit to live
To get something you’ve never had
You must be willing to do something you’ve never done
I’ma die by mine

[Interlude: T.I.]
Let me ask you something, if the kids are the future
Tell me why you can get more for being C.O. than you can for being a teacher?
Tell me why it means more to the government to pay the people
Who got to watch over the prisoners more than the people
Who got to keep the children from becoming prisoners? That make sense?
Tell me why 9 ounces of crack will get you more time than a rape right now?
Tell me why them crazy white boys can tote a gun but I can’t right now?
Yeah I had felonies, I done did dirt in the streets
But I ain’t ever gave it to anybody that didn’t deserve it
You know what I mean?
I ain’t ever ran in no public place with no pistol shooting no innocent people
I ain’t never ran in no school, killing no kids
Man this is the result of you refusing to deal with the issues at hand
We are a product of the environment you placed us in
We ain't do it, we just lived through it

[Hook: Skyler Grey]
Home of the brave and free
Free just to murder me
Land of the beautiful
Cursed by the hate we throw
Is this the new national anthem?
Is this the new national anthem?

[Interlude: T.I.]
Message to my people
Stop waiting on folk to help you, help yourself, it starts with you
Get yourself out, reach back, get somebody else out
And that’s the way we’re going to get ahead
Sitting around waiting on government to do something for us
Ain't never gonna happen partner, they don’t give a fuck about us
But don’t play into their hand partner, you making it easy for em
Hell is you doing?

You got some nerve, baby
You think you're so bad?

I feel like you might be the one tonight, baby
You got me so excited, baby

The more she trying to keep me from her (Yeah!)
The girl is so cold (Yeah!)

[Verse: Ludacris]
(Haha, Luda!!)
Get me bodied like Beyoncé
I beat it up like Bangladesh, Shondrae
"Can you smell what I'm cooking?" like The Rock say
Smells like a feast and you looking like the entrée (bon appétit)
These other women just hors d'oeuvres
I picked you and that's what's getting on these whores' nerves
'Cause I be at like subpoenas when the court serves
Give me, give me love like Serena when the court serves
'Cause she don't know that she got me wanna get frisky
'Cause pineapple juice with Conjure, got her tipsy
And so I order more bottles of that good stuff
It's Ludacris, women call me Mr. Good Stuff
So I'ma take her to the rooftop, rooftop
Girl's so cold, I need a flu shot, flu shot
She said she want me to take her to the shoe shop, shoe shop
But I told her keep her head up, 2Pac, 2Pac

[Bridge: Usher]
Girl, I'm gonna make this dilemma the best way that I know how
'Cause you're killin me with it, you're just a problem that I can't put down
'Cause every time, you get too far away
She can tell I got something missing, it be all up in my face

[Chorus: Usher]
She don't know that she making me want her (Yeah!)
The more she trying to keep me from her
She don't know that she making me love her (Yeah!)
The more she trying to keep me from her (Yeah!)
The girl is so cold (Yeah!)
She know what I know (Yeah!)
But she keep her mouth closed (Yeah!)
She's so sexual and she knows
She don't know it's killing me inside 'cause I want her body
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro: Puff Daddy & Usher]
The king is back
Hey ladies, you know what time it is
You ready, playboy?
Usher, baby
Let's get them

[Verse 1: Usher (Puff Daddy)]
You looking good
So fucking good, I wanna celebrate
And I love the way you do it
Girl, you so fly, you 'bout to levitate
And as the lights bounce off your gown
Baby, I can't help but stare
And as the lights are going down
Sparkles flash up in the air
It feel real good in here

[Chorus: Usher (Puff Daddy)]
So many girls, so we need champagne
Relax, maintain
Wait a minute, let me do my thing
But I still won't spill my drink
So many girls, so we need champagne
Relax, maintain
Wait a minute, let me do my thing
But I still won't spill my drink
So many girls! (Asians, Caucasian, Bajan, Jamaican)
So many girls! (Brazilian, I swear I got a million)
So many girls! (Egyptian, do you fit that description?)
So many girls! (all over the world, all over the world)

[Bridge 1: Usher & Puff Daddy]
Tell the waitress I need another round
You hear that bass line coming through the ground?
You know it's on when they make that sound
I could take you home right now
Now, tell the waitress I need another round
You hear that bass line coming through the ground?
You know it's on when they make that sound
I could take you home right now
So many girls
I'ma need you, and you, and you, and you, right here

[Verse 2: Usher (Puff Daddy)]
We on that trón
So everything is in slow motion now (going to slow it down for you, baby)
This bottle's almost gone (I'ma need another)
But I still ain't trying to slow it down
And when the DJ says, "Last call"
I'll be standing on the bar
Screaming from the window to the walls
It feels good to be a star
Yo, who got a light for my cigar? Fire it up

[Chorus: Usher (Puff Daddy)]
So many girls, so we need champagne
Relax, maintain
Wait a minute, let me do my thing
But I still won't spill my drink
So many girls, so we need champagne
Relax, maintain
Wait a minute, let me do my thing
But I still won't spill my drink
So many girls! (Asians, Caucasian, Bajan, Jamaican)
So many girls! (Brazilian, I swear I got a million)
So many girls! (Egyptian, do you fit that description?)
So many girls! (all over the world, all over the world)

[Bridge 2: Usher]
Can't decide which one I'll be taking home
I could take you home right now, s-so many girls
They're ready, I'm the one they're waiting on
But I feel I can turn you out

[Chorus: Usher (Puff Daddy)]
So many girls, so we need champagne
Relax, maintain
Wait a minute, let me do my thing
But I still won't spill my drink
So many girls, so we need champagne
Relax, maintain
Wait a minute, let me do my thing
But I still won't spill my drink
So many girls! (Asians, Caucasian, Bajan, Jamaican)
So many girls! (Brazilian, I swear I got a million)
So many girls! (Egyptian, do you fit that description?)
So many girls! (all over the world, all over the world)

[Bridge 1: Usher & Puff Daddy]
Tell the waitress I need another round
You hear that bass line coming through the ground?
You know it's on when they make that sound
I could take you home right now
Now, tell the waitress I need another round
You hear that bass line coming through the ground?
You know it's on when they make that sound
I could take you home right now
So many girls

[Outro: Puff Daddy]
Usher, yeah
Back with this one, baby
This time, we ain't going nowhere
I see you Mal
Danja
Yeah, come on
Turn the lights off

[Verse 1]
I can't believe my eyes
Looking at your sexy ass body
The way you do it with your hands up
I just wanna be all over
Let me rock, with you
Don't let nothing interrupt this groove
Going at it like we 'bout to
Touching all on you like you're my girl

[Chorus]
You probably saying that's a damn shame (it's a shame)
I don't even know your name (no)
I know it probably won't matter tonight
'Cause you been all on me I'm like, "okay!" (okay)
Suggest we take this here home (oh yeah)
So we can make a love song
I can be the best part of you waking up
Shorty, holler at me if that sound, okay
(Oh, aaah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I see you wanna take it slow
Go on, drop it to the floor real low
You know I want you bad 'cause I been all on that ass
And you ain't looking at me sideways
And the DJ is playing the last song
And it's coming down to our last call, be ready
This slow jam is 'specially dedicated
What better way for the night to end?
Come on

[Chorus]
You probably saying that's a damn shame
I don't even know your name (I don't, I don't know your name)
I know it probably won't matter tonight (matter tonight)
'Cause you been all on me I'm like, "okay!"
Suggest we take this here home
So we can make a love song (make a love song)
I can be the best part of you waking up
Shorty, holler at me if that sound, okay (okay)

[Bridge]
Ooh, cars outside waiting, baby, if you're ready to roll
Now that I got you opened up
Curious of mine
To know what's on your mind, girl
(Curious, to know what's on your mind, girl)
Girl, we been at it so long, I can't wait
Just wanna make sure we on the same page
Come on, come on, come on
I be on some other shit when that liquor talk
And I know you...

[Chorus]
You probably saying that's a damn shame (it's a shame)
I don't even know your name (I don't know your name)
I know it probably won't matter tonight
'Cause you been all on me I'm like, "okay!"
Suggest we take this here home (ooh)
So we can make a love song (we can make a love song, all night)
I can be the best part of you waking up
Shorty, holler at me if that sound, okay
You probably saying that's a damn shame (I know it's a shame)
I don't even know your name (I don't know your name)
I know it probably won't matter tonight
'Cause you been all on me I'm like, "okay!"
Suggest we take this here home (suggest we take this home)
So we can make a love song (we can make a love song, oh)
I can be the best part of you waking up
Shorty, holler at me if that sound, okay (okay)...

[Verse 1]
Watch me as I dance under the spotlight
Listen to the people screaming out more, more
'Cause I create the feeling that keep them coming back
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep them coming back
So captivating when I get it on the floor

[Bridge]
Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure with seconds left, I show up

[Chorus]
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

[Verse 2]
Get up both your hands, I'm in the zone, s'aite
Put em in the air, if you more, and more
'Cause I can't wait to feel it
I go hard, can't stop
But if I stop, just know that I'ma bring it back
Never quitting, don't believe in that

[Bridge]
Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure with seconds left, I show up

[Chorus]
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Oh, gonna push it to the limit, give it more
Oh, oh
Oh, gonna push it to the limit, give it more

[Chorus]
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, gonna push it to the limit, give it more

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Sipping on Rosé
Silverlake sun coming up all lazy (This is how we do)
Slow cooking pancakes for my boy
Still up, still fresh as a daisy
Playing ping pong all night long
Everything's all neon and hazy
Chanel this, Chanel that
Hell yeah, all my girls vintage Chanel, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
It's no big deal
It's no big deal
It's no big deal

Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting

Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is how we do

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Big hoops, and maroon lips
My clique hopping in my Maserati
Santa Barbara-chic at La Super Rica
Grabbing tacos, checking out hotties
Now we talkin’ astrology
Getting our nails did all Japanese-y
Day drinking at the Wildcat
Sucking real bad at Mariah Carey-oke

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
It's no big deal
It's no big deal
It's no big deal
This is no big deal

[Chorus: Katy Perry]

[Verse 3: RiFF RAFF]
Rap game Ted Koppel in Versace boxers
I valeted the chopper on top of Red Lobster (RiFF RAFF)
Who’s startin’? (Katy Perry) Who’s parkin’ the Aston Martin?
Caddy-cornered in Neiman Marcus
Moon roof, Grey Goose, Bentley Coupe doing Kung-Fu
Rap game Dr. Drew for example, I pull up in the Lambo (Damn)
Both hands glow, Roman candles
Uh, now I’m Larry Flint with a candy blimp
Champagne filled the sink and my drink is pink (Okay)
Now I’m overseas speaking Japanese (Japanese, Japanese)

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that

[Outro: Katy Perry]
Wait… no, no, no, no bring the beat back
(Bring it back)
That’s right
(This is how we do)
Oh, oh
(This is how we do)
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Look at yourself, if you had a sense of humor
You would laugh to beat the band
Look at yourself, do you still believe the rumor
That romance is simply grand?
Since you took it right on the chin
You have lost that bright toothpaste grin
My mental state is all a-jumble
I sit around and sadly mumble

[Verse 2]
Fools rush in, so here I am
Very glad to be unhappy
I can't win, but here I am
More than glad to be unhappy
Unrequited love's a bore
And I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore
It's a pleasure to be sad

[Outro]
Like a straying baby lamb
With no mammy and no pappy
I'm so unhappy
But, oh, so glad!

[Verse 1]
I get along without you very well, of course, I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves, then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms, of course, I do
But I get along without you very well

[Verse 2]
I've forgotten you just like I should, of course, I have
Except to hear your name
Or someone's laugh that is the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should

[Bridge]
What a guy, what a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
What's in store? Should I phone once more?
No, it's best that I stick to my tune

[Verse 3]
I get along without you very well, of course, I do
Except perhaps in Spring
But I should never think of Spring
For that would surely break my heart in two

[Verse 1]
I see your face before me
Crowding my every dream
There is your face before me
You are my only theme

[Verse 2]
It doesn't matter where you are
I can see how fair you are
I close my eyes and there you are
Always

[Verse 3]
If you could share the magic
Yes, if you could see me too
There would be nothing tragic
In all my dreams of you

[Refrain]
Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
I can't erase your beautiful face before me

[Interlude]

[Refrain]
Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
I can't erase your beautiful face before me

[Chorus]
You ain't been blue, no, no, no
You ain't been blue 'til you've had that mood indigo
That feeling goes stealing down to my shoes
While I sit and sigh, "Go 'long blues"

[Bridge]
Always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye
In the evening when the lights are low
I'm so lonesome I could cry
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me
I'm just a soul who's bluer than blue can be
When I get that mood indigo
I could lay me down and die

[Chorus]
You ain't been blue, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You ain't been blue 'til you've had that mood indigo
That feeling goes stealing down to my shoes
While I just sit around and sigh, "Go 'long blues"

[Verse 1]
What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair?
The love that you cherish so often may perish
And leave you with castles in air

[Verse 2]
When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies?
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

[Verse 3]
What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone

[Verse 1]
What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?

[Verse 2]
I saw you there one wonderful day
But you took my heart and you threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lord up in Heaven above
Just what is this thing called love?

[Verse 1]
Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real, so right
Ages ago last night

[Verse 2]
Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that seems so bright?
Ages ago last night

[Bridge]
To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

[Verse 3]
So now let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung
When we were young last night

[Verse 1]
Once I laughed when I heard you say
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy, in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

[Verse 2]
Once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And order orange juice for one
It never entered my mind

[Bridge]
You had what I lack myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

[Verse 3]
Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

[Verse 1]
The world is lyrical
Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though she's some other place, her face I see
At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my love is there

[Verse 2]
She dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
All through the night
I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
But there's my love
Up there above

[Verse 3]
I whisper, "Go away, my lover
It's not fair"
But I'm so grateful to discover
That she's still there
I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love

[Verse 1]
I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once used to be
And when the songbirds that sing tell me it's spring
I can't believe their song
Once love was king
But kings can be wrong

[Verse 2]
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same
Since we're apart
Though there's such a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same
Never be the same again

[Interlude]

[Outro]
I'll never be the same
Never be the same again

[Verse 1]
This love of mine goes on and on
Though life is empty since you have gone
You're always on my mind, though out of sight
It's lonesome through the day, but, oh, the night

[Verse 2]
I cry my heart out, it's bound to break
Since nothing matters, let it break
I ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine
What's to become of it, this love of mine?

[Interlude]

[Outro]
I ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine
What's to become of it, this love of mine?
This love of mine goes on and on

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm... (Hey)

[Verse 1]
So what you trying to do to me? (Hey)
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies (Hey)
But we get along when I'm inside you, yeah (Hey)
You're like a drug that's killing me (Hey)
I cut you out entirely (Hey)
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free (Hey)
You can find other fish in the sea (Hey)
You can pretend it's meant to be (Hey)
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound (Hey)
Taking me down, rolling on the ground (Hey)
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh (Hey)

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm... (Hey)

[Verse 2]
So if I run, it's not enough (Hey)
You're still in my head, forever stuck (Hey)
So you can do what you wanna do, yeah (Hey)
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up (Hey)
But don't deny the animal (Hey)
That comes alive when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free (Hey)
You can find other fish in the sea (Hey)
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound (Hey)
Taking me down, rolling on the ground (Hey)
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh (Hey)

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Bridge]
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie (No, no, don't lie)
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny (You can't deny)
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals (Hey, hey)
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals, oww!
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Outro]
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie (No, no, don't lie)
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny (You can't deny)
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Look out new world here we come
Brave, intrepid and then some
Pioneers of maximum
Audacity whose resumes
Show that we are just the team
To live where others merely dream
Building up a head of steam
On the trail we blaze

[Chorus]
Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze

[Verse 2]
Paradise is close at hand
Shangri-la the promised land
Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas, undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man behold the child
On the trail we blaze

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The trail we blaze
Is a road uncharted
Through terra incognita to a golden shrine
No place for the traveler
To be faint-hearted
We are part of the sumptuous grand design
(Shangri-la the promised land)
Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas, undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man before the child
On the trail we blaze

[Produced by Diplo]

[Verse 1]
If you're only as good as the company you keep
Then I'ma blame you for what they say about me
(Free your mind and let your conscience be free)
When I was by myself, I was fast asleep
Since you came around, I've been up for weeks
(Free your mind and let your conscience be free)
Yi-Yi-Yikes, I've been with the wrong crowd
I can make you a believer
If I turn the nonsense down
I keep my secrets in a safehouse (A safehouse)
Better if I don't speak (Don't speak)
Devil's tryna tempt me
They just outline my shape out (My shape out)
Place me at the crime scene (Crime scene)
I can see from this high up
You ain't got a heart, girl (You ain't got a heart, girl)
Privacy is for the cheater
Obviously you're deceiving

[Pre-Chorus]
I know, I know just who you are
You put me on layaway
You just love to heart shop, oh girl
I think that it's over
I think that it's over

[Chorus]
I swear to God I'm moving on
(Mmm, back up)
(Brap)
I ain't going back no more
I-I ain't going back no more, ah-ah-ah
I ain't going back no more
I-I ain't going back no more, ah-ah-ah

I ain't going back no more
I-I ain't going back no more
(I ain't trippin' off you, you, you)
I ain't going back no more
I-I ain't going back no more

[Post-Chorus]
You just start a fight
I ain't fighting back, I'm cool with it
I simply came here to party
Why would I trip off that bullshit
When I'm on that good shit?

[Chorus]
I swear for God I'm moving on
(Mmm, back up)

[Verse 2]
Substitute love for a better thing
I deal with my pain like a lonely child, yeah, yeah
I didn't build these walls for you to piss all on my castle
Go ahead, burn it down, I'ma build me another one
All these clouds

[Pre-Chorus]
I know, I know just who you are
You put me on layaway
You just love to heart shop, oh girl
I think that it's over
I think that it's over

[Chorus]
I swear to God I'm moving on

I ain't going back no more
I-I ain't going back no more

[Intro]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

[Verse 1]
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

[Pre-Hook]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

[Hook]
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
(Look at her butt)
Look at, look at, look at
Look, at her butt

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
Just got a collect call from Hector, I was on the phone
Outside of my double decker, Margiela umbrella
Pop trunk in stormy weather, on who? Cinderella
Lobster for breakfast, necklace playin' checkers
Hold up that wrist, her thong red licorice
Pre-rolls filled, Alizé and prescription filled
Codeine dreams, I lean like Stojaković
I ain't top five? What the H-E-double hockey sticks?
My left hand was an avalanche
My right hand, uh, eight grand, finna traffic jam
Doors locked, hundred K on the Porsche box
My socks, got glow-in-the-dark rocks
LA Leakers, bustin' out the speakers
Keep your mouth closed when JODY HiGHROLLER speakin'
Ass cheeks like two volleyballs
Neon spandex turnin' heads at the damn mall
I'll lay down 'fore I lift off
In this Lamborghini plane, seats sure are super soft

[?] Versace lip gloss
So I pull up, Mike Myers

[?] on the tires

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Bridge]
Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back

[Outro]
Yeah, he love this fat ass, hahahahahahahaha!
Yeah! This one is for my bitches with a fat ass in the fucking club
I said, where my fat ass big bitches in the club?
Fuck the skinny bitches! Fuck the skinny bitches in the club!
I wanna see all the big fat ass bitches in the muthafuckin' club
Fuck you if you skinny bitches, what?! Kyuh
Hahahaha RRRRRR
I got a big fat ass (ass, ass, ass...)
Come on!
Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me, but to love you
And the way you look tonight

With each word, your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely; never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight

[Instrumental]
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart

Lovely, Don't you ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you
A-just the way you look tonight

Mm-Mm, Mm-Mm
Just the way you look tonight

[Verse 1: Drake]
You must remember wakin' up in Paris with the blunt
You must remember fuckin' me like anytime you want
What made us wanna act like we were married for two weeks?
Now we back in California, we don't even speak
That's a no no
Everyone said we look good on paper
You deserve that action
Plus you get more paper than I do, that shit attractive
Things that make me miss you, where Jen and Melissa
(Say Hi, M)
Tell the squad I said what up girl
Look at me, look at me, look at I
Ballin' out, swear I use to be shy
Young nigga
Back when I, was tryna' make a, MI
My nigga, when can I
How is this shit goin' how it is
I always seem to kill it and yet everybody lives
I hope that they remember me, for everything I did
It's some views from the 6
Just some views from the 6

[Pre-Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then you comin' home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open, let me see you get loose

[Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
It's goin' down for real
It's goin' down for real

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Yo' girl just kissed a girl, I do bi chicks
Shake for a sheik, I'm throwin' these Emirates in the sky
Spendin' this As-salamu alaykum, peace to M-O-N-E-Y
I love my beaches, south beaches, surfboard in high tide
I could just roll up 'cause I'm swole up
So that birthday cake get the cobra
Bugatti for real, I'm cold, bruh
That auto-biography rover
Got the key to my city, it's over
It's no thots, only Anna Kournikova's
I set records, ratchets hol' up (I set records, ratchets hol' up)

[Pre-Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then you comin' home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open, let me see you get loose

[Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
It's goin' down for real
It's goin' down for real
(And they already know me)
It's goin' down for real

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
It's going down further than femurs
Girls get wetter than Katrina
Yeah, my girl, you've never seen her
'Cause my tints by limousines
My touch say it's the Midas
We the plus, your man a minus
My team blowin' on that slam
Make you cough-cough, that's Bronchitis
Put your hands up, oh
It's a stick up, no more makeup
Get that ass on the floor
Ladies, put your lipstick up
Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hatin', I get money
Then I double up tonkers

[Pre-Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then you comin' home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open, let me see you get loose

You know I'm surgical with this bitch Jake
How you want it dawg?
Closed Casket?
Remember that fool in a wheelchair?
How you think he got there?

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got my air-conditioning on right now
Real cool about it
Oil talking please
Slick with it

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Wanna know what death feel like
I suggest that you stay in the house at night
The scope that I got for the long rifle fit pretty damn right
Plus my connect got a pretty good price
I could take off your neck with just one slice of the blade
No, I'm not Wesley Snipes
One cut can have her screaming out first aid
Been this way ever since first grade
Forte demeanour was to get paid
Birthday solution was to shoot straight
Thirteen I was ready for gunplay
Stand on the block taking pay
I get four shots like a freak oh he know
Not to fuck with K-D-O-T
Oh, I forgot
Never come around here without a Glock
You want beef with your boy
Nigga I put heat on your boy
Leave him tied up on the back seat
With your boy duct taped won't let out noise
Oh yes we got them toys
Oh yes we got them choppas
LAPD they can't stop us
Rockets shoot down helicopters
In the kitchen (in the kitchen)
Betty Crocker (betty crocker)
Got kick (got kick)
You hate (you hate)
You wait (you wait)
One sec (one sec)
I'll be back we then gon' west
No vest, I'ma aim at your face
Unless you can stop them
I'm so throwed
Oh yes people there is a problem
I say

[Hook: Z-Ro (kendrick lamar)]
(Know what I'm talking bout?
I can feel that lane
Sometimes I just lay back and let them look at me
I'm so 

[?] too
You see they be loving the oil talk
Its real slick for them
I keep the air conditioning on
Cool, cool, cool)

[Verse 2: Emjae]
Pop shots yeah we kill niggas
On the real nigga
Run when I flex the steel
Coming with a 

[?] to grill niggas
Save on the ounce but don't know the price
But I know one time ain't bust late night
Trying to set me up so I gotta think twice
Ain't no fucking with it I'ma let em plague mic
I keep a nine for you dummies then I split your brain
I'm going to your safe, take your cash, cocaine
All your weed in your range cause you're going platinum chains
And when I leave I 

[?] your white carpet got a stain
Watch as my city get gritty
Fuck pity, we gon' do you niggas shitty
Domino effect when we spray them with the semi
Big k-holes in your dodge you can hear me
Front to back
Stack for stack
Nigga go clip for clip
Either gat for gat (braaap)
Wise niggas better check my stacks
We let the match ratatat
And all the heads we crack
Stacked, lots of cheese
Tryna cop the gs

[?] mac sale when we pop the fees
Cop the keys
To the boss got rocks to feed
Roster fees
Cause ain't nobody stopping me
I got a flow so cold
Style so bold
A nigga run up, I leave his face all swole
Hit him with the 8 better yet with the 4
And I don't feel bad he put himself in the hole
West coast in motion
Promoting another episode
Down south them niggas get

First Half

[Produced by Tim Suby]

[Verse 1]
I ain't lovin' these fake hoes, room smellin' like 8 Swishers
Room service like 2K, NBA, I'm ballin', nigga
All them niggas, fallin' like Autumn, nigga
Talkin' shit, I saw them niggas, now their daughter want a picture
Rough ain't it? Fuck famous
Niggas too real, got the most haters
Wrote a story so Stephen Curry: how it feel to be golden?
Why was I chosen?
Hanalei Bay with my bae, what can I say?
I did it, my timin' was perfect, I'm comin', they know it
Becomin' the last great American poet
The flow Lindsay Lohan
Tired nigga, retire nigga
My word is art like a hieroglyphic
What island is this?
Cabernet, I can smell her talk
She wanna swim but can barely walk
She 'fraid of sharks, she'd hate my lawyer
Atlanta, Georgia, got somethin' for yah
I'm doin' somethin', stay wit' it
I sport the Oakland A fitted
Cause it's moneyball and I'm throwin' funny
But all the kids'll go get it
God dammit I'm ill
I got one question for the haters, is your girl on the pill?
I'm playin' though, but like really, really?
Second Half

[Produced by Childish Gambino]

[Interlude]
Oh man
Oh man, oh man, oh man
I got a hook for this, it's like
Ba-b-ba-b-ba-ba
B-ba-b-ba-b-ba-ba
Na-na-di-ma-ma-ma
I love you all the time
Somethin' like that

[Verse 2]
I'm the man forever
They can't let a nigga live cause the life is better
85 everyday, why'd I bring this sweater?
I fell asleep on the beach, tiny pink umbrella
Fell out of my drink, she yellin', "What we doin' tonight?"
50k their first week, you ain't doin' it right
Young Bino best friends with the show promoters
Good year, my career is floatin', it's all me
Cause I stay real, the worst pain, niggas don't feel
Cause they ain't feel a nigga, tried to kill a nigga
But he still went stupid
Silver stones on her and the game so clueless
These niggas ain't us
Hopin' that I diss you back so I can make you famous
I'm just tired of haters
The AK goin' off, sound like cicadas
We the clique all day, man I'm so Decatur
Me and Fam backstage, yeah I know you hate us
But you gotta pay us
Let 'em speak at my peak in the game for a minute
But I don't know how
All these light skinned niggas came back in style
Ye lied to us, pretty girls at my concerts
Flow so cold so you know it was my verse
Stank attitude but I like the way she diddy bop
Puffin' white O's, body bang somethin' Nitty Scott
They want the old Bino so they try to rewind
The new Bino too ahead of his time
In a couple of years, they'll have to say I birthed a couple careers
Chances are I get your boy a couple of ears, you know it

[Outro]
Ba-b-ba-b-ba-ba
Duh-d-duh-duh-d-duh
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh
To love you all the time
I don't have words for this part
But I know it should sound like this
Duh-d-duh-duh-duh-duh
To love you all the time

Run up on a Young Thugga playing
And I'mma burn your head like Michael
Kimbo, slice those arms off of his body
Yesterday I was broke, today I got M’s, no Illuminati
Los Angeles lifestyle, I left a dude for the fishers
Fuck nigga, you a rat, you got whiskers
You full of it, I’m an emperor
Leave 'em in the attic, no temper
Rap around his chest like suspenders
Then open up like it’s Christmas
Live life, a number 7
I’m not Mike Vick, but I’m a G
Like 1000, speaking 1000
I spend 1000, on my trousers
Smoking white boys, eight milers
In the mountains is where they found us
I pray the critics stay behind us
And we ain't gay anyway
Only ladies can climb us
I pull through your set, you hear cops, you hear bust
You hear sticks, you hear tecs
We shoot heads, we shoot necks
M16, they come through the vest
And they come for your soul and they come for your flesh
They turn white 

[?] and it's a mess
We tryna hit you, a knife on your leg
We come in the noon, we come in the morning
We try leave you sick like you just caught pneumonia
I redo your hair, but no I'm not Sonya
I dive in your bitch, I might have a cowbunga
I wet up your block like my mama’s tsumani
No sperm, but I’m selling everything coming
Booker T Washington, it’s history
Your nickname Scooby Doo, cause you’s a mystery
Let my nigga wrapper wrap em like a cypher
Webster, we come in your home
And you better come out and stop us (Thugga)

It's not my birthday
Please remove yourselves

Baby, please don't act like you're special

Na-na-na-nuh, the, nuh

Surrounded by some niggas with fake jewelry
We came up from nothing just like Tony
Now my chain could bring back the stone age
Look us up, Prosper with the lonely
But gotta sample something, make it holy
I got 

[?], what they told me
I worried that's what not she had told me

[Chorus]
So, please don't act like you're special
Baby, please don't act like you're special
I'm so special, I'm so special, I'm so special
Baby, please don't act like you're special

[Verse 1]
Nobody's ever loved me like you do
That's just something I'm not used to, ooouuu
So I always push you away (sorry)
Even though I know I want you to stay with me

[Chorus]
(I know) I was the one who made you love me
(I know) just when you was beginning to trust me
I do it all again, do it all again (I do it, do it)
Hit her up again, hit her up again (I hit it, hit it)
And you don't deserve it, she ain't even worth it
But I still do it anyway
And it breaks my heart, my heart
To know I break your heart, your heart
Believe me

[Verse 2]
I tried to apologize (sorry, baby)
But I hurt you one too many times, baby
I had no reason why (no reason why)
I just continue to make it right, ohhhh I

[Chorus]
(I know) I was the one who made you love me
(I know) just when you was beginning to trust me, I
I do it all again, do it all again (I do it, do it)
Hit her up again, hit her up again (I hit it, hit it)
And you don't deserve it, she ain't even worth it
But I still do it anyway
And it breaks my heart, my heart
To know I break your heart, your heart

[Verse 3]
Oh baby I know
I hurt you so many times
I tried to change it
But I can't, it's apart of my life
And I don't wanna to lie to you
Although I always lie to you
And I don't like to lie to you (no I don't wanna lie)
But I always lie to you (I can't help it, no)

[Bridge]
Sometimes it happens that way (I'm sorry)
It happens that way (I know you heard me say it before)
Girl, I hate that it happens that way (I'll never do it again)
But it happens that way (for real)
Ohhh (believe me)

[Chorus]
I do it all again, do it all again (I do it, do it)
Hit her up again, hit her up again (I hit it, hit it)
And you don't deserve it (I know you don't deserve it), she ain't even worth it
But I still do it anyway
And it breaks my heart, my heart
To know I break your heart
(To break your heart), your heart
Hey, oh, believe me

[Intro: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called “Hi! My Name Is” dropped
Started thinking my name was Fault
‘Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent
Of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me
That I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
"Do I really belong in this game?", I pondered
I just wanna play my part
Should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful
Or disrespect the art form I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face
Before you get made pissed off
And keep plugging, it's your only outlet
And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it… ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion 80 times
How many times can I say the same thing
Different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story, bet you feel the same way I felt
When I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to—

[Pre-Chorus: Sia, Eminem]
I was a, afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found (My dreams)
I didn't wanna go another round (Yeah)
An angry man's power will shut you up (Agh!)
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run (Yeah)

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear (The time is near)
Guts over fear (Might shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down (Now I got)
Guts over fear, guts over fear

[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I know what it was like, I was there once
Single parents, hate your appearance
As you struggle to find your place in this world
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song
Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
Started to spit harder shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park? Oh
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen
‘Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song
But I'd rather make “Not Afraid 2”
Than make another motherfucking “We Made You,” ah
Now, I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just open enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt
‘Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells, I was made to walk
But thank you, Ma, ‘cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium
Least I made it out of that house
And found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did
Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say
Don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt—and eat their fucking faces off!
The legend of the angry blonde
Lives on through you when I’m gone, and to think I was a—

[Pre-Chorus: Sia, Eminem]
I was a, afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found (My dreams)
I didn't wanna go another round (Yeah)
An angry man's power will shut you up (Agh!)
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run (Yeah)

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear (The time is near)
Guts over fear (Might shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down (Now I got)
Guts over fear, guts over fear

[Verse 1:  Aminé]
Said she want ring and a white picket fence
Suburbia for her nervia
I couldn't live that life
So thats why I'm here with you tonight
I-I don't know if you're interested
But I do know that you can have my kids
Excuse me if I'm a little too forward
I'm just wanna hit it from the backward
Ain't this awkward
I can't believe I said that
Oh my ain't she a bad gal
Oh gal how you do that

[Hook: Aminé and Emily Libera]
Get down get down
Get down down down
Get down get down
Down down
Baby I don't want to love

Baby I don't want to love
I just want to find someone

Get down have fun

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Hibbie jibbies
I didn't know you was freaky deaky
I just thought you was goodie goodie
Now you got me like
I don't want none of them girls
I'm an N.E.R.D. Girl that's Pharrell
When it comes to ya booty that mass appeal
Even Rita couldn't fuck with your Ora
Curves like the hills
So I call you Mrs. Lauren
You so damn pretty girl
Plus you're so-so minimal
Say you wanna have some fun
So lets get physical

[Hook: Aminé and Emily Libera]

[Verse: Aminé and Emily Libera]
Do you wanna love anymore?

No,no, no

Do you wanna fuck anymore?
Baby we can get it on til' the mornin'

What about love?

What about trust?

What about us?

What about lust?
And I'm starin' at your eyes like
I'm tryna' get this figured out

And it ain't hard to figure out boy
I got you all figured out

I gotta catch a plane
A jet, a cab I gotta go

Anywhere you want babe
As long as I can go

[Outro: Aminé and Emily Libera]

[Intro]
Lost in a plastic life
Say she don't really love no one
Lost in a plastic life
And she pop champagne all night like

[Verse 1]
Lost in a plastic life
Dropped out of school the first night like
And her parents don't know
Refund checks for her manicures like
Cigarette smoke while she choke
Chugs that fifth and she work at sacks 5th
Six inch heels and a pole
Strips on the side just to get by
Ohhh
Tears runnin' down ya face
Can ya tell me why?
Ohhh
Rent is due but ya copped jimmy chu's
Can ya tell me why?
Ohhh
Ya know ya too drastic
And ya know this life plastic
It's righteous
And ya might just
Break
DOWN

[Chorus]
Hollywood lights
Pop champagne
Plastic life
So she want that fame
Rollie on
Diamond rangs
All them likes
So he like that fame
Gucci, Fendi, Prada, no fake
Lost in the plastic life they really hate

[Verse 2]
Lost in a drastic life
He takin' pics of his cash like
I mean flexin' is a right
But homie you know that's yo rent like
TURNUP
That's his favorite phrase
Spent his check on the liquor takin' it straight
GROWUP
Maybe one day
But all he really want
Is the money and the fame
He like 30 with a Jersey
Why ya so throwback
He got a gold chain but he a no name
Why ya gotta do that
Ohhh
Ya know ya too drastic and ya know this life plastic
It's righteous
And ya might just
Break
DOWN

[Chorus]
Hollywood lights
Pop champagne
Plastic life
So she want that fame
Rollie on
Diamond rangs
All them likes
So he like that fame
Gucci, Fendi, Prada, no fake
Lost in the plastic life they really hate

[Intro:]
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me

[Chorus]
Why would I try when I know it's all a lie
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Status of names ya followers and chains
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Turnin' up when the world is corrupt
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Ple-ease somebody save me

[Verse 1:]
Welcome to America the land of the weak
Where everybody tweets but don't know how to speak
Gimmicks are acceptable when it's on a dope beat
And people wanna beleive almost everything they see
Rappers know they verse KAPOOT
But they do it for the LOOT
They do it for the chain
And they do it for the coup
I mean
How can I blame ya
Ya hustlin' dawg
But if ya hustle
Keep ya muscle
Please don't soften up dawg
I morn for the norm
Cus' the morals ain't normal
These women half naked but they treat them like they royal
Blue 10's instead of payin' his rent
Out comes the outcome of foolish regret

[Chorus]
Why would I try when I know it's all a lie
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Status of names ya followers and chains
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Turnin' up when the world is corrupt
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Ple-ease somebody save me

[Verse 2:]
500 dollars for a WorldStar video
No standard for the fuckin culture
Why would mad lib care about yo ad-libs
Shit
Every nigga rappin' now, every bitch a model now
Hip-hop gettin' lost in it's thots
The booty shots bigger now
Make these hoes thicker now
Hollywood done turned to Hollyhood
Bitch
Twerkin' ain't a dance you just shakin' yo ass
I can't believe you believe what the media perceives
A couple big words now you think he got degrees
A little drug talk and now you think he sellin' keys
Shit Might as well teach ya bout the birds and the bees

[Chorus]
Why would I try when I know it's all a lie
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Status of names ya followers and chains
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Turnin' up when the world is corrupt
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Ple-ease somebody save me

[Chorus]
Mr. Me too
Misses me too
Chasing all the things that ya didn't need to
Mr.  Me to
Misses me to
Burnin' every bridge that you didn't need to
And now ya want
Everything
And now ya want
All the chains
And now ya want
All the fame
And now ya lost
In the game

[Transition Verse 3:]
Flickin' pens
Since the age of 10
They told me
Diaries were not made for men
I was tryna
Make mends cus
I hate to sin
Lord forgive my pleasure gimme pain if sin again
I-E-ya
Couldn't piece
Everything together
Needed peace
So I pieced it on a piece paper
Paying dues revenue mean everything
And if ya bus it home you ain't getting wedding ring
They sayin'
4.0 's and GPA's
Means ya whole life but it cost you a price
To what degree does your degree mean
Professors tellin ya that this is what you really need

So I stroll to class
In these soles of mine
Probably owe this school like 9 souls of mine
Sucked the whole regime but she thinkin' she a dime
This just a nickel of it baby you just border line

How can I leave rap alone
That's the only chick that I really cheat with
Word to my mother
And word to the paper
And word to the pen that began everything
Oh
How can I leave rap alone
That's the only chick that I really cheat with
Word to my brother
And word to the paper
And word to the pen that began everything
How can I leave rap Rap
Rap
How can I leave rap alone that's the only chick that I really cheat with

Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me

[Chorus: Prince & Lianne La Havas]
You should never underestimate the power of a kiss on the neck, When she doesn't expect
A kiss on the neck, when she doesn't expect, a kiss on the neck
And every time you catch her singin' in the shower
You should go and get her a flower
Don't matter what they what the hour
Just rub it on her back, rub it on her back, rub it on her back

[Verse 1: Prince & Lianne La Havas]
In this brand new age
We do everything quick, fast in a hurry
All of our lives a stage
Everybody stars, reality's so blury
If you screamed out loud (loud)
Top of your voice wouldn't be high-er up than the crowd, no
Tattoo-less and proud, yeah
We're getting high on something, that doesn't require clouds, no
We don't need no clouds, no

[Chorus: Prince & Lianne La Havas]
You should never underestimate the power of a kiss on the neck, When she doesn't expect
A kiss on the neck, when she doesn't expect, a kiss on the neck
And every time you catch her singin' in the shower
You should go and get her a flower
Don't matter what they what the hour
Just rub it on her back, rub it on her back, rub it on her back

[Verse 2: Prince]
I wanna  gonna give you something baby
But I wonder does it really even matter if it ain't on the stage
If it ain't on a stage, I don't really think it matters in this brand new age

[Bridge: Lianne La Havas]
When life's a stage, in this brand new age
How do we engage?
Bullying just for fun
No wonder there's so many guns
Maybe we're better off in space

[Skit: Lianne La Havas]
Mr Nelson, Mr Nelson, can you hear my voice?
Sir, we know you're a little bit groggy
And you're probably going to find it hard to speak
But don't try to talk or process too much now
We just want to let you know that the medication you were given
Has put you in a suspended animation for quite some time
In fact 45 years
But where you are now, is in a place that does not require time
That being said, you are completely safe
And we are here to help you"

[Outro: Prince and  Lianne La Havas]
You should never underestimate the power of a kiss on the neck, which she doesn't expect
A kiss on the neck, which she doesn't expect, a kiss on the neck
It's in my power to love you
It's in my power to love you up
It's in my power to love you
It's in my power to love you up
(Hot)
I got a grind, won't stop, Hustle won't quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit
I got high price lifestyle, super bad bitch
If I want it, bet I got it
If I don't bet all I gotta do is
Go, get It - stay up out my business
Ball til I fall, Flossin' til Im finished
Go, get It - stay up out my business
Im living just to kill it, stacking millions to the ceiling

Eveyday above ground, all I wanna do is ball
Put my money over bitches, put my hustle over all
Louie down to the drawers, Luis Vuitton kicks
Got a Mad Hatter swagger, bitch I’m stupid dumb sick
With a group of young bitches and they stupid dumb thick
I’m the marathon man, all I do is run shit
A sophisticated convict, superficial, still official
Multimillion dollar shit
Money is the object, hot shit
Bitch I got a sauna on my arm
See bigger with no diamond
They just talk about they got it
I’m the upper echelon, though
Bitch I‘m bout that action, you could go on with that convo
I have done more than you dream bout
Got your dream bitch and your dream house
On lean passing them beans out
With a bad crew, the whole team high
Go on boy, get seen by, bro you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough, that’s all I see
I g.o.g.e.t.i.t
I got a grind, won't stop, Hustle won't quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit
I got high price lifestyle, super bad bitch
If I want it, bet I got it
If I don't bet all I gotta do is
Go, get It - stay up out my business
Ball til I fall, Flossin' til Im finished
Go, get It - stay up out my business
Im living just to kill it, stacking millions to the ceiling

I live life, up late night
Get shitfaced when I take flight
I get paid, no sick days
My outfit’s on switch blade
Don’t sniff yay, but I blow dro
Bank roll on loco
Still ride with that 44
Don’t let my P-O know
Bad white bitch super thick
I’m Ice T, she Coco
She got another bitch, other bitches
Her ass fat, face so-so, no paper trail
No phone call, no emails, no photos
Just backshot, with that fat butt
And low blow headbutts in slow-mo
Purple label polo and Akoo, that’s all I do
Man I strive and roll my denim in my new Margiella shoes
Man, we be cool if we just parle
On Margharita Molly and the strongest pack around
We menagin’ for a hobby
We kick it how we kick it
Know you envy how I’m living
Just can’t resist this pimping
Get the million bout my business
Bro you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough that’s all I see

[Verse 1:]
Not lookin' for relationship
Just lookin' for a summer chick

It's funny when they'd rather have
A trapper then a pastor
A raptor then a mothafuckin' nigga with a masters
These hoes man

Get a couple likes
Now she thinkin that she famous
Six feet deep for them six inch heels
But she bad as hell
So who da' fuck cares?
Cameron Diazes, Megan good-asses
Puerto Rican, Caribbean
I love all the masses
ATLien, I'm such an outkast
Probably have to get chain and a durag
For her attention, and did I mention
I took her on a date in my mommas van
She looked at me and told me
I can only fuck wit benzes
Heh, wit benzes

[Chorus: Aminé & Neka]
Mr. Nobody
Nobody knows who
Mr. Nobody
Nobody needs you
'Cause when you at the bottom
Ya feelin' real blue
And when you at the top they just all want you 'cause
When you in the gutter
And when you in the slums
They just tell ya Mr. Loser you already done
And when you at the top and you already one
They just tell ya man I knew that you would be the one

[Verse 1: Aminé]
I stop
And think for a sec
I really hustle hard but I feel like empty car
Oh
Nobody
And lord yes sir I'm sorry
I do respect ya plan but could ya help me understand
Me no Mr. Willy Wonka
Just give it to me proper
Don't sugarcoat it, let me know it
If ya think I'm loser
'Cause like mi familia, it's really all love
And sometimes I need a laugh when I'm really in the dumps

[Pre-Chorus: Neka & Aminé]
You might think
I'm no one
But to me
I'm someone
I know
Who I am
And who I be
Can't believe in themselves so they say this to me

[Chorus: Aminé & Neka]
Mr. Nobody
Nobody knows who
Mr. Nobody
Nobody needs you
'Cause when you at the bottom
Ya feelin' real blue
And when you at the top they just all want you 'cause
When you in the gutter
And when you in the slums
They just tell ya Mr. Loser you already done
And when you at the top and you already one
They just tell ya man, I knew that you would be the one

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Stop for a moment and realize who you are
Anything is possible and you could be a star
No matter what they say, no matter who they are
Use a living breathing being and can be anything you want
You put in work all day
I swear it pays off
Always
So now ya success can be back stress
Old friends callin' up like, "wassup"
Ya know Ii's funny how it always goes
People that did the least always want all the most
Hol' up, my old girl said I was a no one
Now that's my ex girl for a reason

[Pre-Chorus: Neka & Aminé]
You might think
I'm no one
But to me
I'm someone
I know
Who I am
And who I be
Can't believe in themselves so they say this to me

[Chorus: Aminé & Neka]
Mr. Nobody
Nobody knows who
Mr. Nobody
Nobody needs you
'Cause when you at the bottom
Ya feelin' real blue
And when you at the top they just all want you 'cause
When you in the gutter
And when you in the slums
They just tell ya Mr. Loser you already done
And when you at the top and you already one
They just tell ya man I knew that you would be the one

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say, be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

[Pre-Hook: Katy Perry]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

[Hook: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Bridge: Katy Perry]
This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wave length
And be there when you vibrate
For you I'll risk it all
All

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Katy, you gon' create a monster, fucking with an alien
Cause once you let me in, your world will never be the same again
We invading USA, the Russians and Australians
Cause we keep the radio active, uranium
Landed in a pod in Little Britain, David Walliams
Now I'm in your Sun, your Star, your Mirror and your Mail again
I'm Saville Row ten remixed with vintage Nike blazers
I can read your body language like you just came out of LA Ink
Caps lock, baby, cause I'm all about my capital
I think so irrational, I'm big international
All my raps is factual, I'm so supernatural
And I've been fly a very long time, terminators

[Hook]

[Part 1 - "Loser" by Beck]
Soy un perdedor!

So why dont you kill me?
Everybody!
Soy un perdedor!
I'm a loser, baby!
So why dont you kill me?
HEY!

[Part 2 - "Sex Type Thing" by Stone Temple Pilots]
I am, I am, I am
I said I wanna get next to you
I said I'm gonna get close to you
You wouldn't want me have to hurt you too
Hurt you too
I know you want what's on my mind
I know you like what's on my mind
I know it eats you up inside
I know, you know, you know, you know
Here I come, I come, I come, I come
Here I come, I come, I come, I come

[Part 3 - "All I Wanna Do" by Sheryl Crow]
'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I've got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I've got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Part 4 - "Closer" by Nine Inch Nails]
HELP ME! I broke apart my insides
HELP ME! I got no soul to sell
HELP ME! The only thing that works for me
Help me get away from myself
I wanna (BOING) you like an animal
I wanna feel you from the inside
I wanna (BOING) you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to god
Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Part 5 -"Bang and Blame" by R.E.M.]
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Blame, blame, blame
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
It's not my thing so let it go!

[Part 6 - "You Oughta Know" by Alanis Morissette]
'Cause that love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough
For you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you die, 'til you die
But you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left
When you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bare that you gave to me
You oughta know
HEY!

[Part 7 - "Bullet with Butterfly Wings" by Smashing Pumpkins]
Despite all my rage
I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage
I am still just a rat in a cage
And someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage
I am still just a rat in a cage

[Part 8 - "My Friends" by Red Hot Chili Peppers]
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

I don't owe you anything!
I don't owe you anything!
I don't owe you anything!
I don't owe you anything!

Black hole sun
Won't you come, won't you come
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come
Black hole sun, black hole sun

[Part 11 - "Basket Case" by Green Day]
Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone no doubt about it
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps all adding up
I think I'm cracking up
And am I just Paranoid
Am I just stoned?
Or am I just stoned?

[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & Iggy Azalea]
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Ooh)

You wanna meet her, you wanna touch her
See the light in her eyes, and it starts to make you wonder (Ain't that a freak)

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
All the sexy girls in the party

Y'all know what I've been on, y'all know that I've been on
I'm queen big booty, Iggy, now find me a throne to sit on
Girls with the cheeks, put 'em hands in the air
Then pop that, pop that, let 'em know that you there

You know that we've got enough to share
But fact we girls with the big fat booty too fancy to ever play fair

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez & Iggy Azaela]
Mesmerized by the size of it (Oh-oh-oh, uh-huh)

[Hook]
I'm about to make a motion picture, picture, picture, picture, picture, picture
I wish that you could see the bigger picture, picture, picture, picture, picture, picture
I'm just trying to get some money with you, with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
I wish that you could see the bigger picture, picture, picture, picture, picture, picture
Its Gucci man and I'm a motion picture

[Verse 1]
Every Brick Squad production is a big budget production
All this cash in my pocket, I'll make you handsome if you ugly
She see me on the screen and she love to scream my name
Had a sex tape with your wifey, I didn't even know her name
I'm so icy niggas don't like me, I'm so iced out that a nigga wanna fight me
Bitches be swearing I play for the Vikings
Bitch I play for the Sun Valley Strikers
If I like a Tina Turner I could beat her, beat her, beat em
Raw paw to pay 

[?] keep good reefer
Niggas bait you with a pitcher, trust you with a pitcher
Trick you with a pitcher counterfeit you and remix you
Niggas never play with Guwop, they see the bigger picture
I put you on a tshirt then mail your mom a thank you card

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Last night I heard someone shot a nigga
Police going door to door showing my fucking picture
Last week scrape girl on custody
My aunt got nothin' but pictures and memories of her daughter
Paint a picture with my words, I'm a fucking author
Go get a mark up, five hundred thousand my marker
Forever good, I learned to hustle from my uncle
And I'm so hood, it's hard for me to get a sponsor
Rap shit is long as the street, 14k all over my teeth
Tattoos all over my face, saying I'm one single away
How when I'm dealing the yay
Fat boy, I'm eatin the K
New rolls and forgis on a rari I'm ballin' like 

[?]

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I do this when I wanna, momma
I hustle when it's hotter
Money, gun, weed in the water bottle
I'm the coolest in the sauna, momma
I ain't sweatin' it, I'm bettin' it
I'll make it back tomorrow, momma
I got corner honor
Ain't been to court since 2004
Looks like I got it goin', your honor
I'm a lone rider, grind for my own dollars
They was in front, but I blow by 'em

[??]
I'm all holes like corn-rolls, open toes
Fake titties, yes, I bought both of those
Hold your nose, I'm the shit, can't be flushed
I got the toilet stopped up, call the plumber up
My stomach's stuffed, that's right, I'm eatin'
I smoke the best weed, look like I'm sleepin'

[?] evening, off it by the morning
Professional dope-boy, my office is Tha Carter
Yes I do, and I do it better than most
My competitive drive knock a nigga off the road, yeah
Lock and load, pull the triggers and roll, yeah
The bigger your mouth, the bigger the hole, yeah
We figured 'em out, them niggas is hoes, yeah
They lawn chairs, baby, quicker to fold
But me, I'm quick on my toes, I remember the code
You need a pass for the hood, watch me get through the toll
Shit, I been through the cold, I shot through the fire
Still rock too much ice, shoulda got you a visor
I pull up, the bitches flockin' at my 

[?]
Fresh like I just stepped outta the drier
Yes, no threat, I got the locker for lyin'

[?] the whole block's behind me
Yeah, stay low, the cops are spyin'
But they could never figure out the rocket science
No pocket knife, no pocket iron
Yeah, pots and pans make the pockets wider
Dig 'em a hole, let the property hide 'em
Build a house and throw a party over your dead body
Never said I never fell, but never dropped an assignment
Gotta finish what you start or the cops'll find it
Dinner in the park, yeah it may seem cool
But me, I'd rather not let 'em see my food
I'm stayin' strapped like Fila shoes
Bet I bust a motherfucker till the enemy move
C'mon, it's my game, nigga, get in and lose
Ya'll niggas never did what I do
I do me..

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Streets'll swallow you in this
So many bricks that you could build a mansion
With the house guest house, and a room for expansion
Twelve rooms, eight baths, don't make me laugh
Twelve rounds on my hip, don't make me blast
It ain't no secret, hoes is about it
Was flippin' that soft white before I ever became famous
A few tried, but they shall remain nameless
Lunar eclipse, they try to block my shine
Say what the fuck you want, can't stop my grind
One million, two million, three million, four
What the hell, maybe it's twelve
So listen little mane, this before the rap game
Before them videos, before all of them shows
Look at me now, nigga, I rock my own clothes
Mow my bitches, yeah, I make my own hoes

Bitch I'm K-Dot, act like you knew me
Got me fucked up me don't pay for no booty
You looking for a prize, bitch I'm not no fool G
I'm hot like Cooly, sicker than the cooties

I'm soon to be the greatest for the ages of the young
Watch the game like a raven, craving rappers till I'm numb
Novacane can contain the pain that I brung
Bitch I shine like a microscope bouncing off the sun
Words bouncing off my tongue like a damn trampoline
Hoes manicure him enough the bottom of my jeans so I kick him off
Got haters pissed off, used to have no bank
Look at my account, you see O's like Rick Ross
I drift off to the moon, martian
Use the Big Dipper as a teaspoon
Parking my UFO somewhere that you don't know
Welcome to the C4
You see one you see four
Bombs in my peak hold
Bombs over Baghdad, son you niggas
You can never say I was a bad dad
Run you nigga like a marathon
This is when Vietnam meets the Babylon
Bring it to yo front porch, tanks on your grass lines
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, jumping from the foul line
In order to see the king you gotta swim through the ponds

[Hook: Ab-soul]
Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin')

And I'm the realest yes, keep these bitches wet
And we don't give em chips, we just give em dick

It's Friday, been on the donut since Monday, highway
How I touch sky like Kanye, kill em
Black Ali boombayah killa
SWAT meet shopping, till I not need nothing
Ran between the legs of a naughty women
Say it ain't so soul, say it ain't say
I ain't fucking with you like Nazi public
Fuck em, fuck it, slide in the bucket
You rolling on adults I'm sitting on the team summit
T-pain on, back steat fucking puffing la la la like a Lil Wayne song
And why would I lie like a nigga in denial?
When I can tell the truth and be free like style
Top notch TV don't touch that dial
Unless you finna wash up, you niggas better watch us

Lido missed the boat that day he left the shack
But that was all he missed and he ain't comin' back
A tombstone bar in a jukejoint car, he made a stop
Just long enough to grab a handle off the top
Next stop Chi town, Lido put the money down and let it roll

He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road

Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road

Lido be runnin', havin' great big fun, until he got the note
Sayin' toe the line or blow, and that was all she wrote
He be makin' like a beeline, headin' for the borderline
Goin' for broke
Sayin' one more hit ought to do it
This joint ain't nothin to it
One more for the road

Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Lido's waitin' for the go

If I had a dollar, for every time they counted me out
And my back was up against the wall
I could have died but I came out fighting, fighting
I could have died but I came out fighting (x3)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
With a breast full of lumps, man she ain't no punk
Said he gonna ride on it like a chopper in a trunk
Pink ribbon woman, she gone live forever
Even though the doctor said she only get a month
Said "It's my life, and you onle get in once"
These flowers smell too damn good to be living in the funk
So I finna get it in, and I finna get it crunk
And I finna get to living, ey-ey-ey-eyes on remission from the junk
Breast cancer can't hold me back
That's the answer when they told me that
It can knock me down, but I'm gon' be back, strong
Down for whatever, exceptional and I don't know how to quit
And I never said never, you can have that hair cause real talk bitch
I think I look better, let's do it

[Bridge 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Fighter, with everything inside her
Reporting live from Death Row, drop the charges see you life uh
Cellphones and your lighters, need you to put 'em up higher
So many candles on her birthday cake, might set the thing on fire

[Hook: Jennifer Hudson]

[Verse 2: Common]
My daddy say he got it in his prostate
When I went to see him, he had lost weight
Trying to find the words in a lost state, of mind
Pictures on the wall that remind
Me of the times that we once had
Had to take my daughter to see granddad
Pop, pop, nothing's impossible, you never been logical
I know what doctor's do, I know what God can do
Abdominal pain, hard to explain
For you to get better, it starts in your brain
Life ain't a game, the fight it remains, dance in the rain
When it first came, I was like damn
Then I start thinkin', then I start praying
Spirits went up, count went down
You gon' live forever, how you living now

[Bridge 2: Common]
Fighter, definition of a rider
Got all that ishh about you, with what you got inside ya
Cellphones and your lighters, put them things up higher
Even when you tired, you keep me inspired

[Hook: Jennifer Hudson]

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Went undiagnosed and untreated
When they finally found it, told me too far along and he couldn't beat it
But he couldn't see it, miss me with that dead talk
Miss me, my legs walk and my hearts beats and my wife witness
So fuck cancer, my life with me, and if I die, it die with me

[Bridge 1: Lupe Fiasco]

Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off

Well, I went out to a party just the other night

Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off

I gotta boogie (gotta boogie, uh huh, he's gotta boogie)

I gotta boogie (gotta boogie, uh huh, he's gotta boogie)
Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off

Hey, you wanna boogie? (No man, I don't wanna boogie)
Wanna boogie? (Get that boogie out of my face)
Do any of you wanna boogie? (No!)

Gotta boogie on my finger
Gotta boogie on my finger
Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off

[Verse 1]
I hear those ice cream bells and I start to drool
Keep a couple quarts in my locker at school
Yeah, but chocolate's getting old
Vanilla just leaves me cold
There's just one flavor good enough for me, yeah me
Don't gimme no crummy taste spoon
I know what I need baby

[Chorus]
I love rocky road
So won't you go and buy half a gallon, baby
I love rocky road
So have another triple scoop with me, ow

[Verse 2]
They tell me ice cream junkies are all the same
All the soda jerkers know my name
When their supply is gone
Then I'll be movin' on
But I'll be back on Monday afternoon, you'll see
Another truck load's comin' in for me, all for me
I'm singin'

[Chorus]

(oh, make it talk)

[Bridge]
When I'm all alone, I just grab myself a cone
And if I get fat and lose my teeth that's fine with me
Just lock me in the freezer and throw away the key
Singing

[Chorus] 

[x4]
I visit Mr. Frump in the hospital
I see him most every day
And when I see Mr. Frump in his iron lung
This is what I hear him say

[deep breathing]

Y'know, Mr. Frump is my very best friend
He's never a chump or a tease
He never tells me lies, and best of all
He never disagrees

I bring him candy and flowers every afternoon
Sit down by his side and say "Hi"
And then I ask him his opinion of the world situation
And I wait for Mr. Frump's reply, and Mr. Frump would say

[deep breathing]

Well, unfortunately, soon it came to be
Mr. Frump's dying day
And now I bring to you the very last thing
That Mr. Frump had to say....

[deep breathing, that fades and dies off]

Amen

[Intro]
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you

[Verse 1]
Well, it's time to celebrate your birthday, it happens every year
We'll eat a lot of broccoli and drink a lot of beer
You should be good and happy that there's something you can eat
A million people every day are starving in the street
Your daddy's in the gutter with the wretched and the poor
Your mama's in the kitchen with a can of Cycle Four
There's garbage in the water
There's poison in the sky
I guess it won't be long before we're all gonna die

[Chorus]
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you

[Verse 2]
Well, what's the matter little friend, you think this party is the pits
Enjoy it while you can, we'll soon be blown to bits
The monkeys in the Pentagon are gonna cook our goose
Their finger's on the button, all they need it an excuse
It doesn't take a military genius to see
We'll all be crispy critters after World War III
There's nowhere you can run to, nowhere you can hide
When they drop the big one, we all get fried
(Come on boys and girls, sing along, okay?)

[Chorus]
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Wow!

[Verse 3]
Well there's a punk in the alley and he's looking for a fight
There's an Arab on the corner buying everything in sight
There's a mother in the ghetto with another mouth to feed
Seems that everywhere you look today there's misery and greed
I guess you know the Earth is gonna crash into the sun
But that's no reason why we shouldn't have a little fun
So if you think it's scary, if it's more than you can take
Just blow out the candles and have a piece of cake

[Chorus]
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Wow!

[Chorus]
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
(Happy Birthday!)

[Outro]
And a pinch to grow an inch!
Had to park my car for just five minutes
I had to go inside to use the phone
When I came back again my car was gone
Well, I didn't know it was a loading zone
What a bummer, I was so brought down
I had to chase that tow truck all over town, yellin'

"Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my car around"

Took my baby to the local disco, I was jumpin' like a maniac
But then the owner came and pulled me off the floor
Then he, he took me to his little office in the back
He said, "I really like your snaggletooth necklace
Your pants are groovy, and your hair's okay
But, man, that car of yours is so uncool
Like wow, I'm sorry, but we towed it away!"

Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my car around
Now I'm at home, I'm watchin' Gilligan's Island
Guess it's time to trade my old car in
For twenty dollars and my '64 Plymouth
Maybe I could get a second-hand Schwinn
Look out the window, there's tow truck in the driveway
I grabbed the driver and I asked him why
He said, "I'm sorry kid, you're late with the payments
It's time to kiss your little car goodbye"

Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my car around
Stop draggin' my car around

Listen, the check's in the mail, no, really
Stop draggin' my car around
Oh man, I just got the hub caps painted
Stop draggin' my car around
Hey! Hey! I left a sandwich in the backseat
Stop draggin' my car around
Oh

[Verse 1]
Ooh, my little hungry one, hungry one
Open up a package of my bologna
Ooh, I think the toast is done, the toast is done
Top it with a little of my bologna

[Chorus]
Never gonna stop, eat it up
Such a tasty snack, I always eat too much and throw up
But I'll soon be back for my, my, my-y-y, woo
M-m-m-my bologna

[Verse 2]
Spreadin' on the mustard now, show me how
Spread it on a little of this bologna
Hopin' that we don't run out, don't run out
If we do I'm sure that I'll miss bologna

[Chorus]
Never gonna stop, eat it up
Such a tasty snack, I always eat too much and throw up
But I'll soon be back for my, my, my-y-y, woo
M-m-m-my bologna
M-m-m-my bologna
Hey

[Accordion Solo]

[Verse 3]
Goin' to the market now, market now
I'm the city's biggest bologna buyer
Walkin' down the shopping aisles, shopping aisles
Filling up my basket with Oscar Mayer

[Chorus]
Never gonna stop, eat it up
Such a tasty snack, I always eat too much and throw up
But I'll soon be back for my, my, my-y-y, woo
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-my, my, my-y-y, woo
M-m-m-my bologna
M-m-m-my bologna
M-m-m-my bologna
M-m-m-my bologna
Well, hey how ya doin' have a seat, have a drink
Boy it's good to see you, what can I say?
Oh, sorry gotta run we'll get together again
Say, what was your name anyway?

Well we're working on the problem, we'll get back to you soon
But don't try to call me I'll be in a meeting every afternoon
For a year maybe longer keep in touch
Thanks for dropping by and have a nice day

The check's in the mail, hey! You're beautiful
Don't ever change you know what I mean
My girl will call your girl we'll talk, we'll do lunch
Or leave a message on my machine
So baby won't you sign on the dotted line
I'm gonna make your dreams come true
The check's in the mail, would I lie to you?

Well hey wait a minute what's the matter hold on
You want me to fork over the loot?
You say you hate my guts you wanna take me to court
And you got yourself a lawyer with a three-piece suit?
Well I'm proud to say you're not the only critic of mine, yeah
So if you wanna sue me I'm afraid you're gonna have to wait in line
Take a number thanks for calling who loves you baby
Don't forget to read the fine print

The check's in the mail, hey! You're beautiful
Don't ever change you know what I mean
My girl will call your girl we'll talk, we'll do lunch
Or leave a message on my machine
So baby won't you sign on the dotted line
I'm gonna make your dreams come true
The check's in the mail, would I lie to you?
Oh, trust me!

The check's in the mail, hey! You're beautiful
Don't ever change you know what I mean
Why don't you leave a message with my girl
I'll have lunch with your machine
So baby won't you sign on the dotted line
I'm gonna make your dreams come true
The check's in the mail, would I lie to you?
The check's in the mail, would I lie to you?
I don't care about your karma
I don't care about what's hip
No space cadet's gonna tell me what to do

I won't swim in your jacuzzi
You can't make me settle down
I'd rather kick and jump and bite and scratch
And scream until I'm blue

I may as well be hyper as long as I'm still around
Cause I'll have lots of time to be laid back
When I'm six feet underground

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
When are you cosmic cowboys
Gonna get it through your heads?

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

I can't stand the smell of incense
I don't really like to jog
No Joni Mitchell 8-tracks in my car, ooh

I hate anything organic
Even health food makes me sick
You won't catch me sipping Perrier
Down in some sushi bar, I tell you

Now's the time to go for all the gusto you can grab
You'll have plenty of time to be low-key
When you're laid out on the slab

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
When are you cosmic cowboys
Gonna get it through your heads?

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

I don't want no part of that vegetarian scene
I won't buy me a pair of designer jeans
No redwood hot tub to my name
I got all that I want and if it's all the same to you

I don't need a course in self-awareness
To find out who I am
And I'd rather have a, a Big Mac or a Jumbo Jack
Than all the bean sprouts in Japan

So don't ask me what I'm into
I don't need to prove I'm cool
I'll break your arm if you ask me what's my sign

I won't tell you where my head's at
I don't need to see no shrink
Psychosis may be in this year
But I'm really not that kind
And I'm in no hurry to be casual
In fact, I think, I'll wait
Until I'm pushing up the daisies
Like wow, man, can you relate?

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore ?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
Cause you don't love me any more

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand, no, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does...

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye...

Looking at the same sky that we used to lay under
Are you thinking about the love that I took from us?

[Pre-Chorus]
When you close your eyes, do you see me, love?
Am I keeping you awake?
What you scared about? Are you giving up?
When you know, you know, you know

[Chorus]
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, don't you worry, girl

Shorty so fine that I can’t put the bitch out

Slick sauce on my clique boss, this ain't Kriss Kross

Big Guwop in the house and he showed out
Disrespect Brick Squad, and you get drugged out
Every time I look down the street, that’s a plug walk
Gucci used to be the shiznit, can he still lift?

Telling everybody in the place, can’t sit still
Sorry to say that I know where your bitch live
Gucci used to be a rich man, and he still is

Birds over your head, no pretending, I got plenty
Freeze, bitch, get in position
Knees, please, suck me 'til I'm empty

Does he know your nasty side? (Look at her, look at her, ooh)

And I can't help myself no more
Can't fight these feelings for you

(No matter how long it takes, Julien, I will stop you!)
(Courageous words, sire, but where you're going, that won't be possible.)

(No matter how long it takes, Julien, I will stop you!)

[Verse 1]
Now listen to me and put your head into my hands
I'm here to save the world because I'm a magic man

[Chorus 1]
And I went through years of dreaming just to avoid you
But now you're back from outer space
With that sad look upon your face
Just like the one you had when you came back
And Laura told you we were going out
And I always said I mean you well
Watch you, you were the one I swear
When I came back home to find the hotel rooms and the phone bills
You spent on him
Just give me a chance now to turn it around

[Verse 2]
Now here's the time of day
I've been around the block
Well I’m aware of the guy you insist who’s smoking pot

[Chorus 2]
And I went through years of dreaming just to avoid you
But now you're back from your grandma's place
With that pissed look upon your face
Just like the one you had when you came back
And found Bon Jovi had broken up
But I always said I mean you well
You're always living on a prayer
When I came back home to find the hotel rooms and the phone bills
You spent with him
Chin up, chest out and turn it around

[Audio Sample]
(You'll regret this, Julien. You'll regret this.)
(Careful, Roman. I'm sure there's more to this than meets the eye.)

[Bridge]
And if I search, I'll find you
Darling!

[Outro]
Well, I'm back
Can I see you?
I'm back
Can I see you?
I'm back
Can I see you?
I'm back
Can I see you?
I'm back
Can I see you?
I'm back
Can I see you?
I'm back
Can I see you?
I'm back
Can I see you?

When I take off on that molly, she got a perfect lil body
Ride it like a kawasake, buy her brand new Maserati
You know rapping is a hobby, you know capping is a habit
And that ass I got to have, I’m not grabbing, we can share it
Baby girl don’t take it personal, but I can never ever ever propose
But them M’s I can post those, and I’m smoking indoors outdoors

Every time I get finessed, she want to practice all day
She want to come to the bed, she see this Versace

Cause you shave it and crave it, I eat it when you bathe it
I like it when you wear lazy, bent over like you praying
With babies, no Deangelo, but girl get naked
When you leave I wish that I could copy it and paste it
I'm riding 'round with stoners, and all my blunts are laced, ayy

[Hook]
Skating like a skater
100 thousand on the Lakers
Bought my girlfriend a new crib
And she even like the neighbors
Riding round with her best friend
I know this beef ain’t gon never end
100 thousand for the necklace
Now I’m looking like a champion, a champion

[Hook]
Skating like a skater
100 thousand on the Lakers
Bought my girlfriend a new crib
And she even like the neighbors
Riding round with her best friend
I know this beef ain’t gon never end
100 thousand for the necklace
Now I’m looking like a champion, a champion

[Verse 1]
If you respect me, don't protect me
You can tell me; I can handle it
Stop pretending, 'cause we're going down
If you let go, then just let go
It's disrespectful how you've handled this
Never ending, kinda run around

[Pre-Chorus]
I lied to my heart, 'cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me if you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing, but if you're gonna
Well, then you better

[Chorus]
Un-kiss me, un-touch me, un-take this heart
And I'm missing just one thing: a brand new start

[Verse 2]
Can't erase this, can't delete this
I don't need this, I can't handle it
I just feel it that you're over us
Oh, if I wait here, if I see you
It won't matter, what's the point of this?
We're in pieces, because you're over us, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I lied to my heart, 'cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me if you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing, but if you're gonna
Well, then you better

[Chorus]
Un-kiss me, un-touch me, un-take this heart
And I'm missing just one thing: a brand new start

[Post-Chorus]
So, un-kiss me
So, un-kiss me
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
So, baby, let go, gotta let go
It's disrespectful, I can't handle this
Never ending, kinda run around
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Un-kiss me (Un-kiss me)
Un-touch me (Oh)
Un-take this heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm missing (I'm missing)
Just one thing
A brand new start (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
So, un-kiss me (Oh, oh, oh-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh, oh)
So, un-kiss me (Oh, oh, oh-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh, oh)
Un-kiss me

You got me begging, begging, I'm on my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be needing your love

Moving down the highways of my life
Makin' sure I stay to the right
Moving down the highways of my life
So I shan't be concerned with the other side of the road

[Verse 2]
Reading all the signs along the way
Knowing where I am not what they say
My destination's closer day by day
So I can't concern with the other side of the road

[Chorus]
Da da dop da da ah
Down the highway da de ah
Da da dop da da ah
Down the highway da de ah

Da da dop da da ah
Down the highway da de ah

Leaving all the sorrows and the pain
There's no love between us that remains
Although you are the one you're not the same
So the other side of the road can only take me back home

[Chorus]
Da da dop da da ah
Down the highway da de ah
Da da dop da da ah
Down the highway da de ah

Da da dop da da ah
Down the highway da de ah

Friday, Chicago

[Verse]
The pride needs to cool, little rain didn't do it
Never got it back from you (drive away)
And you can be a fool, remember
You can ride away, never gonna get back there
There's a red light in the moonlight
That's all, I'm moving on from you
You can try to leave me or doubt me
Oh, I'm the coolest still, right now
I'd never say goodbye, little baby
Never again

[Verse 1]
You got in so late, it's Sunday morning
Said that you were leaving, letting go of us
Where did we go wrong?
And now you say you're leaving California
Gotta head back east and wanna leave tonight
Pack your things and go

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you run away, I won't be alright

[Chorus]
Even if the sun crashes into us
I won't let go, I won't let go
And I can be your light, stay with me tonight
I won't let go, I won't let go-o-o-o

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Pick up all the pieces, fight to hold on
Put them back together, do it all for love
Never let it go, oh, yeah
'Cause I don't need a reason just to hold ya
Wipe all of your tears and look you in the eyes
Oh, oh, baby, please don't go

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you run away, I won't be alright

[Chorus]
Even if the sun crashes into us
I won't let go, I won't let go
And I can be your light, stay with me tonight
I won't let go, I won't let go-o-o-o

No love, no love, no no
Say, what you're crying at me for, me for?
Try to control your ego, yeah
That's not the way you show love, show love
No love, no love, no no

[Chorus]
'Cause I got all the things I wanna say
But nothing's coming out
And all the times I came to you, I never, ever lied
Show me that phone in your pocket, girl
Show me that phone in your pocket
So wait, you think that I don't know what this is really all about?
It should be really easy if you had nothing to hide
Show me that phone in your pocket, girl
Show me that phone in your pocket

[Verse 2]
So, what you spying on me for, me for?
Tell me what you're looking for, yeah
This shit you said is so low, so low

Goodbye, ooh

All this time I've been living it up
And every night I'd be falling in love, ooh
But I'm finally seeing the light
Falling in love with you every night, yeah

[Chorus]
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me now?
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me?
This is a new love, this is a new love, this is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me?

[Verse 2]
What the fuck? I got nothing to lose
I'm a slave to the way that you move
I'm an addict for all that you do
You're the only drug I wanna do, yeah
I can tell that you're needing my love
And all I want is to give it to ya
And don't give up on the moment tonight
You'll regret it the rest of your life, yeah

[Chorus]
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me now?
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me?
This is a new love, this is a new love, this is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me?

[Bridge]
I still don't get it, 'cause if you don't know it yet
You'll know that I'm not your enemy, your enemy, yeah
'Cause I know I lie, and it wouldn't kill you trying
Won't go until you've forgiven me, forgiven me
'Til you forgiven me, forgiven me, forgiven me

[Chorus]
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me now?
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothin' overnight

I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
(Strange business)
If I put a hundred thousand in the Charger
Do that make me a moron?

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
If I drop a quarter million on the chain
Does that make me insane?
Drop a quarter million on the bracelet
Does that make me crazy?
If a drop a million dollars on the Bugatti (car)
Does that make me somebody? (stuntin')
You in the V.I.P. with me
Bitch, still you know you's a nobody
You's a nobody, you's a nobody
I don't know you, nigga, cause you's a nobody
You's a nobody, you's a nobody
You don't know me, nigga, you don't know nobody

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
If I gave a damn what people thought
I probably wouldn't have shit
Laughin' at the teacher
Cause she said I wouldn't amount to shit
Gamblin' for fifty cents, from fifty G's to fifty keys
2015, got the C like fifty M's on fifty M's
Fifty G's fifty shooters
Fifty niggas with a roogas 

[?]
Come by me and come by heli
Runnin' from the damn police

[?] cause I bet that they remember me
Red bottoms on the power knockers
Gucci Mane got stupid cheese
Yes I do shoot missiles ho
My pistol dismember folks
Hella lit November 4
By December damn, I'm broke
Times so hard, I thank the Lord
I'm richer than a year ago
That's your mouth and
That's your nose and
That's the route you chose to go

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can barely see the light
I make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own

[Chorus]
You'll never see me again,  I’ll be better in time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again

[Verse 2]
At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you life goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you
It's taken all of my stength
But I'm stronger now

[Chorus]
You'll never see me again  I’ll be better in time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive

Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you life goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again

[Intro]
In my life, I've seen it all
And now it's time
For me to pass on this knowledge to you
All my sisters
My troubled sisters
This is my gift to you

[Verse 1]
Been many days, couldn't take the pain
Felt I should take my life away
See it every day in every other young sister's fate
(Young sister, sister)
See, I'm cryin' now, mind full of doubt
Runnin' in the streets, no self-esteem
Thinkin' that used to be me
What a shame

[Pre-Chorus]
Damn, life is a mutha, it's hard to sit back
And see the same thing that happened to me happen to you
This ain't love, but here's the love I wanna give to you

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter what they say or do (Do)
Don't let it get to you (You)
Don't be afraid, you can, you can, you can break through
Take what I been through (Through)
To see that
You can't hold a good woman down (Down)
Went through the same point of giving up (Up, up)
Felt like I had enough ('Nough)
Went to the edge of the ledge but I didn't jump
My life will sum it up (Up)
You can't hold a good woman down

[Verse 2]
Ooh, when I used to see my daddy beat
My mother down, down to her feet
I used to say that ain't gon' never be me (Never be me)
Now look at you, bruised up from him
Girl, recognize you're better than
Him telling you that he'll never hit you again
Girl, don't cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Damn, life is a mutha, it's hard to sit back
And see the same thing that happened to me happen to you
This ain't love, but here's the love I wanna give to you

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter what they say or do (Do)
Don't let it get to you (You)
Don't be afraid, you can, you can, you can break through
Take what I been through (Through)
To see that
You can't hold a good woman down (Down)
Went through the same point of giving up (Up, up)
Felt like I had enough ('Nough)
Went to the edge of the ledge but I didn't jump
My life will sum it up (Up)
You can't hold a good woman down

[Bridge]
Through your changes I will hold your hand
Use my songs as remedy
Whenever you're feeling down and blue
I'll be there for you
Trust and know that I've been where you're at
Seen the things that you can't see
Looking at you resembles me
But you gotta hold on

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter what they say or do (Do)
(Ooh, girl, don't cry)
Don't let it get to you (You)
Don't be afraid, you can, you can, you can break through
Take what I been through (Through)
To see that
You can't hold a good woman down (Down)
(You can't hold a good woman down)
Went through the same point of giving up (Up, up)
Felt like I had enough ('Nough)
Went to the edge of the ledge but I didn't jump
(Went to the edge of the ledge but I didn't jump)
My life will sum it up (Up)
You can't hold a good woman down

[Post-Chorus]
You can't hold me, you can't hold me down, you can't hold me
You can't hold me down, you can't hold me
You can't hold a good woman down, oh, oh
You can't hold me down, can't hold me down, no, no, no

[Outro]
There you have it
I'm still with you, my sisters
My troubled sisters
I still have troubles too
(You can't hold a good woman down)
You're not alone
I'll always be there for you
Rock on
(You can't hold a good woman down)

[Verse 1]
I know I do some things that make you so confused
One minute I'm so in love and the next I can't stand you
But if you may ask it's just some things that you do
That reminds me of all of the mess that I've been through

[Chorus]
All of this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay for what
Somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do
With all this baggage in me
Every time I hurt your feelings
(Every time I hurt your feelings)
It's what someone's done to me
(Didn't mean to hurt you, babe)
I don’t mean to hurt you

[Verse 2]
Heartache and pain, I just can't do it again
So I look for the worst and brace myself for the hurt
But nobody has ever treated me this way
Please be patient with me 'cause I want you to stay
But I got baggage

[Chorus]
All of this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay for what
Somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do
(I don't know what to do)
With all this baggage in me
(With all this baggage)
Every time I hurt your feelings
It's what someone’s done to me
(I never meant to hurt you, babe)
I don't mean to hurt you
All of this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay for what
Somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do
(I don't know what to do)
With all this baggage in me
Every time I hurt your feelings
(Every time I hurt your feelings, boy)
It's what someone's done to me
(I don't really mean it, no, no, no)
I don't mean to hurt you

[Bridge]
This is no way to be livin' my life (It's no way for me to live)
But I can’t get it out of my mind (Can't get it out of my mind)
You know I love you, yes I do (You know I love you, baby)
So don't go and get it twisted

[Verse 3]
Don't be confused 'cause, boy, you know I really do love you (Oh)
I want you to stay with me, I never meant to hurt you, baby (Oh)
It won't be easy getting rid of all this baggage, see
All this baggage, yeah

[Chorus]
All of this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay for what
(Don't wanna make you pay)
Somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do
(Don't know what to do)
With all this baggage in me
Every time I hurt your feelings
It's what someone's done to me
(Every time I hurt your feelings)
I don't mean to hurt you
(Never meant to hurt you)
All of this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay for what
(So much baggage)
Somebody else has done to me
(What somebody else has done to me)
I don't know what to do
With all this baggage in me
Every time I hurt your feelings
It's what someone's done to me
I don't mean to hurt you
All of this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay for what
Somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do
With all this baggage in me

MJB, the voice
H-O
You can't hide from love

[Intro]
Oh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
No matter what I do
I want you to pull me through
'Cause I need you
Every day and every night
You make wonders in my life
That's why I call on you

[Chorus]
Ooh, this is true (My baby)
I can't get enough of you (I can't get enough of you, my baby)
This is true (Ooh, this is true, my baby)
I can't get enough of you (I can't get enough of you, my baby, listen)

[Verse 2]
You bring joy instead of pain
Bring me flowers after rain
You give me lovely days, mmm
I know I can count on you
To turn my gray skies blue
That's why I love you

[Chorus]
Ooh, this is true (My baby)
I can't get enough of you (I can't get enough of you, my baby)
This is true (Ooh, this is true, my baby)
I can't get enough of you (I can't get enough of you, my baby)
This is true (I love the way you tell me the truth about me, my baby)
I can't get enough of you (It's the only thing that can set me free, my baby)
This is true (You love me more than I love myself, my baby)
I can't get enough of you (No one can give me this confidence, my baby, no)

[Bridge]
Please don't (Please don't leave me)
Ever leave my side (I can't do it, I can't do it, no)
I can't live without you (I can't live without you)
I've already tried

[Verse 3]
I don't think that I can make it
And I'm not prepared to take it
If you're not with me, no
I can't make it through the storm
I need your love to keep me warm
It's what makes me strong

[Chorus]
This is true (My baby)
I can't get enough of you (I can't get, I can't enough of you, my baby)
This is true (Oh, this is true, my baby)
I can't get enough of you (My baby)
This is true (I love it when you tell me the truth about me, my baby)
I can't get enough of you (It's the only thing that can set me free, my baby)
This is true (You love me more than I love myself, my baby)
I can't get enough of you (No one can give me this confidence, my baby, no)

[Intro]
Oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Every day, I'm tryna get to know ya
But more and more, you're changin' up your act
Every day, I look for ways to bring us closer
But more and more, you appear to be drawing back
And baby, when we're makin' love, it's getting weaker
My heart don't feel it, and feeling is everything
And I'm feeling like maybe you just don't feel it
And I don't know how to play it
In the past, didn't know how to say it, but I

[Chorus]
I've held my tongue too long, I can't do it no more (I just can't do it, baby)
See, how can a man be so cold to a woman that loves him more? (I don't get it at all)
But if you wanna go (There's the door)
I can't hold you (Boy, you're grown)
You must got me confused, I treat myself way too good
And a love that tears you down ain't really love

[Verse 2]
Every day, I'm gettin' up and makin' breakfast
And more and more, you're walkin' in without a word
And every day, I'm tryna ask, "Baby, what's wrong?"
And more and more, you say I'm getting on your nerves
And then you take me to the level of some bullshit
You said you never had these problems from a white chick
You got me twisted and twisted is just not how I get with it
You need to sit down and hear it, oh

[Chorus]
I've held my tongue too long, I can't do it no more (I just can't do it, baby)
See, how can a man be so cold to a woman that loves him more? (I don't get it at all)
But if you wanna go (There's the door)
I can't hold you (Boy, you're grown)
You must got me confused, I treat myself way too good, oh
And a love that tears you down ain't really love, oh yeah

[Verse 3]
I'm pouring out my heart (My heart)
Don't just sit there while my heart is on the line
Speak your truth (Speak your truth)
What it's worth (What it's worth)
Not a word you say will go unheard
Now if it's like that, then baby, just pack your bags
'Cause I'm sick and tired of fightin'
I'm sick and tired of tryin'
I had enough of waitin'
I'm not that good with playin'
I know I love you, but I love myself too

[Chorus]
I've held my tongue too long, I can't do it no more (I just can't do it, baby)
See, how can a man be so cold to a woman that loves him more? (I don't get it at all)
But if you wanna go (There's the door)
I can't hold you (Boy, you're grown)
You must got me confused, treat myself way too good now
And a love that tears you down ain't really love (Ain't really love, ain't really love, no)
I've held my tongue too long, I can't do it no more (Held my tongue too long, and I just can't do it, baby)
See, how can a man be so cold to a woman that loves him more? (How can a man? I don't get it at all)
But if you wanna go (There's the door)
There's the door (Boy, you're grown)
You must got me confused, treat myself way too good, oh yeah
And a love that tears you down ain't really love

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can I talk to you, baby?

[Verse 1]
When I was a little girl, I didn't have a father
And that's why I'm leanin' on you
When I was a baby, I didn't get a hug from daddy
That's why I need a hug from you
Oh, it's not easy, and I thank you for putting up with me
When you don't have a daddy's love

[Pre-Chorus]
(To say that you), to say that I'm your little girl, yeah
(Are his little girl), oh, why didn't he love me? Yeah
(And give you the love), I need love, yeah, yeah, yeah
(You really deserve), and I believe I deserve it, and that's why, oh

[Chorus]
That's why I need the father in you (Oh, I need the father in you, baby)
That's why I need the father in you (Please don't hurt me, please)
That's why I need the father in you (Oh, that's why, really need you)
That's why I need the father in you (Please be true, mmm, oh)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
Oh
Woah
Woah

[Verse 2]
Oh, things got bad
To the point where mommy couldn't hold us down
And that's when it hurt me so much to see her

[Pre-Chorus]
(To see her cry), oh don't cry, mama, don't cry, mama, no
(Each and every night), we're gonna be alright, that's what I used to say, yeah
(I said that some day), that I would try to take his place, oh
(But it was too hard), it was so hard tryna be a man, not a woman, and that's why I need the father in you

[Chorus]
That's why I (Oh, I need it), need the father in you (I'm puttin' my trust in you, baby)
That's why I need the father in you (Please don't let me down, oh)
That's why I need (Oh, oh, I, I), the father in you (I need in the father in you, baby)
That's why I need (Hold my hand, oh yeah), the father in you

[Outro]
Because we never had one at home, no, no, no, no, no, no
As a little girl
So I understand why daddy couldn't be there
'Cause it's so obvious nobody taught him how to be a father either
Oh, and I'm not saying this to reminisce on the past
I'm just saying this to make you understand that I needed a father
And this is my problem
This is why I couldn't keep no one
This is why I couldn't stay alone, I was so scared, I know
Every woman needs a man, and I don't think she understands
That she really needs a father, the father in you, my brother
Oh
She really needed a father, the father in you
When your wife is speakin', fellas
Pay attention, yeah
Don't ignore her, oh, no, no
Ooh
I really need the father in you

[Intro: Mary J Blige]
Baby, can I talk to you for a minute?
Oh
Oh, listen

[Verse 1: Mary J Blige]
Boy, you had me fooled, I can't believe you
'Cause you never done anything that I asked of you
Always talkin' like I just can't do right
Blamin' me for everything, and that just ain't right

[Chorus: Mary J Blige]
('Cause I can't do this alone, alone)
I don't know what to do, I'm tryna stay with you
(It's not all about you)
(Boy, I can't do this alone, alone)
You're makin' this harder
Boy, I'm bout to leave ya
'Cause I can't do this alone (Alone, alone, alone)

[Verse 2: Dave Young]
And I gave you everything I had
There, and I never said nothin', mmm
Did everything for you, mmm (And what did you do?)
What did you do? Nothing
Then you got the nerve to wanna run your mouth
Like I ain't never held you down, no
Baby, what did I do to deserve this? Mmm
'Cause I put you on a shelf
Girl, I need help
'Cause I can't do this alone, baby

[Chorus: Dave Young]
('Cause I can't do this alone, alone)
I don't know what to do, I'm tryna stay with you
(It's not all about you), I can't do it
(Girl, I can't do this alone, alone)
You're makin' this harder
Girl, I'm about to leave ya
I can't do this alone (Alone, alone, alone)

[Bridge: Mary J Blige & Dave Young]
And I'm trying to work this out (I'm trying to work this out)
But boy, you're changing now (Ooh, you're changing now)
What do I do? (What do I do?), I'm so confused (I'm so confused, baby)
And I'm trying to work this out (And I tried it all)
But girl, you're changing now (So did I)
What do I do? (What do I do? What do I do?), I'm so confused

[Chorus: Dave Young & Mary J Blige]
('Cause I can't do this alone, alone)
But I'm tryna stay with you, yeah
(It's not all about you)
No, no, no, it's not all about you
(Boy, I can't do this alone, alone)
Tried everything, woo
I've done everything, woah
But I can't do this alone (I feel ya, I feel ya)
(This alone, alone)
Baby, help me
Baby, help me (It's not all about you)
It's not all about you, no, no, no, no, no
(Boy, I can't do this alone, alone)
I wanna stay together (I wanna stay together too)
Girl, I'm 'bout to leave ya (I'm 'bout to leave you too)
'Cause I can't do this alone

[Interlude: Mary J Blige & Dave Young]
I don't know what to do
'Cause boy, I'm so tired of you, yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Said I don't know what to do
Girl, I'm so tired of you
Do what you gotta do
'Cause I, I can't do this alone

[Chorus: Dave Young & Mary J Blige]
('Cause I can't do this alone, alone)
Oh, I tried everything, but I can't do it no more
(It's not all about you), It's not all about you
(Boy, I can't do this alone, alone)
Baby, I'm so alone, what I'm 'posed to do? (I don't know)
Girl, I gotta leave you (I don't know what to tell you)
'Cause I can't do it a— (Alone, alone, alone)

[Outro: Dave Young & Mary J Blige]
Said I can't do this, no
Said I can't do this, no
Said I tried everything, I done everything
Oh, what we gonna do, baby?

[Verse 3]
C3, AK47 is a long one
Hold hundred grams in my long johns
Brown Tru's today, with these air force ones
Two fifty shots, these not air force ones
I don’t know the name, I know they cost a chain
I don’t know your name, but I will bust your brain
I don’t know your name, but I fuck your main thang
Hit her from the back, insane swang
Ooh, what it do, baby who are you?
Soo crew, Soo Woo, it ain’t nothing blue

I put on my Lebrons, South Beaches
Then hop off in that foreign feature, cause I

[Hook]
Used to want to be like you, till I fucked your girl
Used to want to buy a coupe, till I fucked your girl
Take that bitch to thug world, and just fucked the girl
Let you buy diamonds and pearls, I just fucked the girl
Fuck your girl, yeah I fuck your girl
Fuck your girl, fuck your girl
Let you buy this bitch a coupe, I just fuck the girl
I fuck girls, I fuck girls, I fuck girls and girls

[Hook]

Baby girl need a grammy, how she rolling rolling
Baby girl need a grammy, how she rolling rolling

And every time I spend the night with her my old leg gon kick
That’s why I strap it up
I strap it up
I drink a four or better, designer cup
My girl in love with me and I’m in love with her
And every time I give her the weed, she roll it up
And I just be like prove it baby, prove it baby
And I know you my old number, you my newest baby
Just drop me off Sun-Trust now I’m coming out with them bands
I skate in that pussy good, got an endorsement with Vans

[Hook]
She so fine, and I like the way she’s staring at me
I told that girl to come back to the cabins with me

She need a grammy, how she rolling rolling
Baby girl need a grammy, how she rolling rolling
Baby girl need a grammy, how she rolling rolling
I say you deserve a grammy, how you rolling rolling

[Verse 2]
First tip, ooh

She see no component
No I’m not her parents
I’m not god, but I own it
She like my tunes, I feel looney
She get me out of the feds, I feel ruined
I’m pursuing, what I’m doing
She made me come roll it, feel like truance
Assalakum, Assalam
Pill bottle suck all red tums
I’m a stoner, I’m a geeked up child
She’s a horse, young thug in the wild
I buy her mink coat, she a child
And the girl not my partner, she my pal

[Hook]
She so fine, and I like the way she’s staring at me
I told that girl to come back to the cabins with me
She know tricks and I even like how she standing on me
No toes, but baby come put that camel on me

Baby girl need a grammy, how she rolling rolling
Baby girl need a grammy, how she rolling rolling
I say you deserve a grammy, how you rolling rolling

Cartiers, 25 hundred bucks
That's nothing to a fucking boss, bruh
Right wrist, Audemar, Brietling on the left
I'm a stoner child, aka Jeff
Scrabble board, too many choices
Molly or the Mary, fish scale

Chrome Heart specs, they salute my face
Guwop a real nigga, he just beat my case
He know I got street ties, I came from that clay
I'm surrounded by M&Ms, doctor Thugger Dre
Get wicked 'bout them M&Ms just like Lil Wicced
MPA, my bitty, we count real digits
Hundred thousand pounds of midget
Seven, seven or eight, cooked up chickens
Powder, powder, powder

And you know my dope is white as a towel
If you know you sweet, go take it 

[?]

Nine-eleven
You know I’m gonn' kill them when I call that 911
You know I'ma smoke on that hash till there’s nothing left
You know I'ma cop them foreign cars till it’s none left
Thousand dollar step, I’m in that 911
Tearing out the streets in that new 911
Motors become a beast when you get 911's
Bitches turn their feets when you in 911's
911's, 911's

[Verse 1]
Tearing on the block, I don’t care about no cops
I ain’t gonna never stop, they gonna race me to the top
I’m in that 911, just don’t panic
Whip it all up out that bowl, water, Titanic
I think my car need a band aid, I’m bleeding through the streets
Me and DK on the autograph, my car get a lease
Ain’t nobody supposed to have it, I snatched it
I gave 'em mostly green like a salad, not average
Come across the ocean on a boat, then a train
I’m not trying to go to prison but I’m blowing out the brains
No shirt with a scarf on my head like Sudan
Got a bank full of cash money, Baby and Wayne, dang

[Hook]
Nine-eleven
You know I’m gonn' kill them when I call that 911
You know I'ma smoke on that hash till there’s nothing left
You know I'ma cop them foreign cars till it’s none left

Tearing out the streets in that new 911
Motors become a beast when you get 911's
Bitches turn their feets when you in 911's
911's, 911's

[Verse 2]
Brand new AP, came from OG double D
R-I-fucking-P, 5 mill' spent in the streets
You know we gonn' spaz, we gonn' kill her to find out
But we street bees, we don’t have no honey hide out
Bleeding like a fool, Memphis Mark, OG boo dirty
Just hit my line when they ask I say “I know you heard me”
OG Double D left everybody’s streets working
I miss him, I got RIP OG Double D on all the birdies
Feeling like Ken, hundred dollar bills on Tonka Trucks
Riding round with so many sins, I ain’t gonn' tell 'em all that
The pussy nigga hit the pen, I ain’t gonn' tell 'em fall back
Catch me riding in the 9 11, banging fall back

[Hook]
Nine-eleven

Motors become a beast when you get 911's
Bitches turn their feets when you in 911's
911's, 911's

[Hook]
Got for-for-for-foreign bitches, they ain’t drunk yet
They all the bom-bom-bom-bomb like Lotus
Got lipstick kisses all on my garment
And you know I want it
Thugger Thugger really want it
Got them bad bitches telling me they not drunk yet
I got them bad bitches telling me they not drunk yet
They saying they ain’t drunk yet, they ain’t saying they drunk yet
We got 1000 bitches telling me they not drunk yet

[Verse 1]
Stumbling inside the club
Leaning, on me no cup
Leaning, only no book
Hold up, throw up, chug, pour up

[?] to this, get, get
My wrist, super glisten
S on my chest, I'ma save you tonight
Let this wrist do the rest
Ok, you a good investment
No way, cause I fucked you on the first date
Nat nat nat, nat nat nat (natural)
I’ll kill your ass, get inside your motherfucking back
I'ma wake up, kill you again baby, Iraq
Then make you stand at the mailbox for that fine pack

[Hook]
Got for-for-for-foreign bitches, they ain’t drunk yet
They all the bom-bom-bom-bomb like Lotus
Got lipstick kisses all on my garment
And you know I want it
Thugger Thugger really want it
Got them bad bitches telling me they not drunk yet
I got them bad bitches telling me they not drunk yet
They saying they ain’t drunk yet, they ain’t saying they drunk yet
We got 1000 bitches telling me they not drunk yet

[Verse 2]
They say they not drunk enough to leave with me
So I told her to be with me
Patiently, don’t speed your way
Out of the way, get it
I hope the girl get it
Cause I ain’t really with it
I ain’t buying 

[?] tickets
She said no won’t play no police games
I ain’t tryna be bandit
I just fuck her real good, like DMX on Belly
Ay Keisha, senorita
Let’s go to California beaches
Pay fuck food with your Visas
Then get back to 

[?] fuck round and round on you
I might jump out of this rubber, acting 

[?] on you

[Hook]
Got for-for-for-foreign bitches, they ain’t drunk yet

[Verse 1: Punch]
I'm still lost in my own zone in the living room
Like I'm dead to the world playing Donny Hathaway
Patron shots I consume taking the pain away
Each sip bring me closer to my doom
Sun shining bright through the crack in the blind
Thinking to myself this morning what happened to time
It's passing away, the world decides, it ain't what it used to be
Everything I love don't mean what it used to mean
For example spitting a 16
No thrills, feeling numb like i'm of Thorazine
It used to be nicotine, I was addicted to this rap thing
Now I'm just trying to trap cream
Enough drowning in my sorrow, never put off tomorrow
What you can do today, that's my new motto
With that said, I roll out the bed
Hit the showers, it's time to get this bread, now make dollars

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up in the morning, washed my body, put some clothes on it
After that, put on my heat like Alonzo Mourning
Cause everybody got a gun, it's like they're copy cats
So me without one is like I'm dated
I'd be out of style like Adidas and fat laces
Starter Jackets and dookie ropes or whatever the late 80's had favored
I'm one of the best of my Homo Sapiens
One of the best of God's creations
He shows favoritism everytime you hear the record on radio stations
I know you mad, you ain't gotta say much, I can feel you hating
Serving mc's like waitress, Andre Agassi, multitalented
Rapper slash athlete, killing these niggas, they're screaming in agony
Half of these niggas ain't half of me
Half of these niggas ain't talking 'bout nothing, yakity, yakity
Pushing my buttons like plaid shirts, clapping them rapidly
Actually, Kurt, Co-Bain
Ten years in my career, pray to God that I don't blow up my brains Lord, I'm here
Great Depression, I don't know much, all I know is studio sessions, and how to get my bars up
They call me Subway sandwich the way i give them cold cuts
Cut from a different cloth, and these Yves Saint Laurent jeans;
They cost so much
(?) Usher
Either way i'm caught up in materialistic
Anything that's custom, best believe I'mma get it
Getting tired of it and get rid of it, don't step on the Compton premises without your weap-on on your hip
The home of the stray bullet that murder the innocent
No matter the crime rate I still remain content
Moving at my own pace, cause if it don't make dollars
Then it really don't make sense, and if you can't comprehend
I holler like a rottweiler behind a backyard fence
(Holla) - x4

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I woke up this morning, counting my cash
Girls calling me now, straight throwing the ass
I threw on my T, I grabbed my bitch
Laced up my chucks, rock sharp as a piece
They used to call me a creature, but now I'm a beast
With my voice on the beat, I'm the voice of the streets
From my head to the feet, I'm bad to the bone
Nigga, I won't stop, 'till I'm add to the throne
Dog, I ride with the chrome, gotta be safe in this shit
Call me Pharrell, boy, I keep me them Clipse
I don't ride on no skateboard, I roll with some grinders
Trapped in the hood, far from Giligans Island
I was a drug dealer, but now I'm a wild spitter
Nigga, I'm more iller, call me a hospital
You got the hiccups, I got this fluent as shit nigga
I spit a bar, straight ruin your shit nigga
Known as a mack, I can influence your bitch
I'm the reason these niggas be handcuffin' them quick
I'm the reason these bitch niggas be playa hating on us
See them in the streets, these niggas don't be saying nothing
But keep on talking, you ain't ready for beef
Jay Rock down to bust a nigga head in the streets
I can't help it, the hood flow through my blood
This gangbangin shit, should be considered a drug
Everybody doing it now, I see you rap niggas
Wrong place, wrong time, that's how you get clapped nigga
Raised in the projects, money my object
They standing in my way, like a frog I dissect them
You'll get shot walking through my section
Now you a verse all in my session, they say life is a school
Everyday is a lesson, well I get kicked out, shit got me guessing
Shit naw, check my ghetto report card, straight A student in every class up in the Gardens
Money over bitches, nigga i'm heartless
Money over bitch niggas, rich is my target
(target) - x4

[Verse 1]
I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But, how will you ever know if you never try?
There's something new inside my heart
And it cries like a child whenever we're apart
I've seen your face under every sky
I find the less I look, the more I find

[Chorus]
So let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
You know I'm never gonna leave you
'Cause you're the only one I want

[Verse 2]
You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But, I'm fearless and brave when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me upright
When I'm strong or falling

[Chorus]
So let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
'Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
'Cause you're the only one I want

[Bridge]
There will be times
When we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams
No doubt that we'll almost fall apart
Then burn the pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But, without each other, nothing else is enough

[Chorus]
So let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
'Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
'Cause you're the only one I want

[Outro]
You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no
East side, Zone 6, where I'm from
Got a couple hundreds I'mma throw 'em like ones
Fuck her with a rubber, I ain't tryna have sons
Nigga mean-mugging, they don't really want none
Fuck it, I'm turnt up, too loud
Ratchet bitches won't do me I'm like "What the hell I'mma do now?"
I'm rich, used to be poor
I don't really trust 'em if I met 'em on tour
Bought a new house, livin' on the top floor
Elevator go bing when you at the front door
I ain't ever do chores, I ain't takin' your trash
I ain't made no beds, got a maid with an ass
Put em on blast, I don't give a fuck
Got a bad bitch like she peed on the rug
Yeah i used to live of Candler, in 88 like piano
I put ya girlfriend on camera
I see the future, ciara
Molly all in her champagne, she knew it
Big sean that baby moms, I do it
Fuck that bitch with a broken dick, I love my new girl
She don't talk, shit she don't act extra
She just give brain and the brain so MENSA
Put her in the game but a nigga might bench her
I don't pay attention, I don't even text her
She wanna talk shit, but damn on our friendship
Fuck you bitch and I hope you're offended; bitch!

[Intro]
Put your hands together
No, like this
Surprise, surprise
Another treat, another trick
This is sweet, which one's which?

[Verse 1]
For the record let me state that I never had a reason to break contractual endeavour or sever a relationship with anyone I
Pleasure, pleasure
For the playa let me stop and say-ah that I only payed attention when I heard you mention that he tried to take your
Treasure, treasure
(Ohh no he didn't!)
(What then?)
And as a matter of fact I would have gave you back but then he had a heart attack when you made impact and said his shack without you would be
Better, better
(See what I really mean, uhh, uhh)
But see what I really mean is that our future queen should never be in frustration with this rock and roll machine no, no, not
Ever, ever
(Yeah, huh, you know)
(What?)

[Chorus]
You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone you know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know
You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone you know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know

[Verse 2]
If you really wanna find the answer to this cancer
Then we must rewind
Then never mind the first opinion
(You better ask somebody else)
To run this game requires fame
Your soul and name and nothing gained
Unless it's sacrificed my dear it's only plain for His dominion
And any question of the deal is met with another demand to kneel and reprimand concealed allegations of your
Sinning, sinning
(Uhh, what's that all about?)
That's why I'm, I'm
Feminine rising, not surprising recognizing that the power of the breasts is just a test that you'll be
Winning, winning
(You got this, baby)

[Chorus]
You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone you know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know
You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone you know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know

[Interlude]
There it is
Put your head down
Just, just know thyself, know thyself
Talk to him
Right

[Chorus]
You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone you know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know

["Wannabe" by Spice Girls]
Yo, I'll tell you what I want

You might as well be walking on the sun
Might as well be walking on the sun

["Closing Time" by Semisonic]
Closing time!
One last call for alcohol
So finish your whiskey or beer
Closing time!

I know who I want to take me home
I know who I want to take me home
Take us home!

'Cause its closing time!

Watch this...

[Hook]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
I came up with more secrets to tell you today
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me
So now I gotta give you part three of my confessions
First I told you 'bout that skank that I was cheatin' wit' (Wit')
Then I mentioned she's having my kid
But that's not all, no, I recall more you see
So I give you part three of my confessions

[Verse 1]
Now this gonna be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Gonna tell you everything left out of Parts 1 and 2
Like remember when I told you I knew Pauly Shore?
Pauly Shore—that's a lie, I dont know what I said that for
I borrowed your Chapstick (From you) without asking
Oh, and I tried out your nose-hair trimmer, too
And, by the way, your diamond ring is cubic zirconium
Killed your goldfish accidentally, just replaced it with another one

[Hook]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
I need to get some things off my chest right away
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me
So now I gotta give you Part 3 of my confessions
Threw up on your dog last time I had too much to drink
There's been times that I've peed in your sink
Don't know why, but you and I should agree
That belongs in Part 3 of my confessions

[Verse 2]
Baby, forgive me, I'm still trying to figure out
Why I used your toothbrush to clean off my bathroom grout
Oh, and sometimes, in private
Really like to dress up like Shirley Temple and spank myself with a hockey stick—hockey stick
My boss thinks I'm a jerk, I didn't get that raise
I haven't changed my underwear in twenty-seven days
And when I'm kissing you, I fantasize you're a midget
I'm so sorry, Debbie—I mean, Bridget

[Hook]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
I got some more secrets I'd like to convey
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me
So now I gotta give you Part 3 of my confessions
Gave you Buttered Toast I dropped and picked up off the floor
FYI that was not a cold sore
Oops! My bad! But you'll be madder at me
When I finish Part 3 of my confessions

[Spoken]
You don't know how hard it is for me to tell you this. But remember that shirt you got me for my birthday? Well, I returned it for store credit. That thing was hideous. What were you thinking? Oh, and by the way, I wasn't really sick last week. I just didn't want to go to your stupid office picnic. Oh, and at breakfast, when I told you we were all out of Rice Krispies, what I meant was there was only enough left for me. Sorry

[Hook]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought all I could say
I thought up of more things that should scare you away
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me
So now I gotta give you Part 3 of my confessions
Once I blew my nose, and then I wiped it on your cat (Cat)
And I lied, yes, that dress makes you look fat
Anyway, I shouldn't say any more
'Til I give you Part 4 of my confessions

[Outro]
I mean, I'm just getting started here. I'm not even halfway down the list. This thing could go on for... Hey! Where are you goin'? Honey? What? Was it something I said? Ugh... Women...
Veren zol fun dir a blintse

[Intro]
How ya doin', Bernie? (Oy vey! Oy vey!)
How ya doin', Bernie? (Oy vey! Oy vey!)
How ya doin', Bernie? (Oy vey! Oy vey!)
And all the goyim say I'm pretty fly for a rabbi

Meccha leccha hi, meccha hiney hiney ho

[Verse 1]
Our temple's had a fair share of rabbis in the past
But most of 'em were nudniks, and none of them would last
But our new guy's real kosher, I think he'll do the trick
I tell ya, he's to die for! He really knows his shtick!

[Chorus]
So how's by you?
Have you seen this Jew?
Reads the Torah
Does his own accounting, too!
Working like a dog at the synagogue
He's there all day, he's there all day
Just say "Vey iz mir!" and he'll kick into gear
He'll bring you lots of cheer
And maybe bagels with some shmeer
So grab your yarmulke
And hey, hey! Do that Hebrew thing!

How ya doin', Bernie? (Oy vey! Oy vey!)
How ya doin', Bernie? (Oy vey! Oy vey!)
How ya doin', Bernie? (Oy vey! Oy vey!)
And all the goyim say I'm pretty fly for a rabbi

[Verse 2]
He shops at discount stores, not just any will suffice
He has to find a bargain, ’cause he won't pay retail price
He never acts meshugga and he's hardly a schlemiel
But if you wanna haggle, oy, he'll make you such a deal!

[Chorus]
People used to scoff, now they say "Mazel tov!"
He's such a macher ’cause he works his tuchis off
Yeah, he keeps his cool
And teaches shul
What's not to like? What's not to like?
On high holy days, you know he prays and prays
And he never eats pastrami on white bread with mayonnaise
Put on your yarmulke
And hey, hey! Do that Hebrew thing!

[Bridge]
When he's doing a Bar Mitzvah, now that you shouldn't miss
He'll always shlep on down for a wedding or a briss
They say he's got a lot of chutzpah, he's really quite hhhip
The parents pay the moyl and he gets to the keep the tip!

[Intro]
How ya doin', Bernie? (Oy vey! Oy vey!)
How ya doin', Bernie? (Oy vey! Oy vey!)
How ya doin', Bernie? (Oy vey! Oy vey!)

Meccha leccha hi, meccha meccha cholly ho

[Chorus]
He's doing well! I gotta kvell!
The yentas love him, even shiksas think he's swell
Shows up at his home and says, "Shalom!"
And "Have some cake!  You want some cake?"
Yeah, he calls the shots
We really love him lots!
Oy gevalt, I'm so ferklempt that I could plotz
So grab your yarmulke
The one you got for Hanukkah
Let's put on our yarmulkes
And hey, hey! Do that Hebrew thing!

[Verse 1]
I’m popping bottle after bottle
Model after model
Maybach, I back up out of it
I live it, you rap about it
Niggas be talking money, really I laugh about it
Cause I’m getting tickets just like the cops when they try to stop us
Stop us cause we be balling
Rappers be 

[?] foreign
This new rari be retarded, I handicap when I park it
Push button when I start it, these niggas they can’t afford it
That foreign, it get imported, I seen it, I went and bought it
I step up in the dealer, feeling like a killer
Banana clip for all you niggas who think you gorilla
Got a couple miller, my life is feeling realer

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Stunting, you see me balling, I’m shitting on niggas
That lambo purr like a cat do, but I ain’t kitten my nigga
In the Maybach with Maybach, I’m talking Ricky my nigga
Jesus piece in the Rolex, but ain’t no Biggie my nigga
Iced out jewels, spiked out Lou’s
50 thou field, thinking I might not lose
At the table in Vegas, I’m out with players, we caking
Where I stay at is acres, so now my neighbors are 

[?]
I’m getting money, I’m getting to it
And all that shit you niggas talking, I really do it

And then I got a couple million, I really knew it
But check me out cause I be stunting and balling
I'm balling and stunting on niggas

And their bitches be rolling, they want to fuck with a nigga
Because they know that I’m triller, boy I’m a microphone killer

[Chorus]
Stunting, you see me balling

[Hook: Gourdan]
Hop up out the block, straight to the jet

We ain't wrong at all

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Am I wrong cause I want it all
Am I wrong cause I want to ball
Am I wrong for dropping fifty on this Audemar
Cause I remember times slinging dimes by that corner store
Risking my freedom, ditching them people
I'm on them papers the system want me to give them a reason
So they can shatter my dreams, now I'm a king
I'm riding Phantom Ghost you know that my passenger mean
I'm with a bad bitch rolling out cause she ain't never had shit
Scoop her out the projects and put her in this Aston
Tell me am I wrong for that nigga it's a passion
Stunting and balling, balling and flexing then I cash in
I heard these suckers talking what they heard about
But what these niggas talking it's just word of mouth
Fuck around I get them murdered though
Thirty grand I send the murder man just to blow them up

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg]
I don't know why, but today seems like it's gonna be a great day
There's something in the air that makes me feel like thing are gonna go my way
The birds are chirping "tweet-aly deet", the sun is shining bright
There's a skip in my step, a pep in my pep, and I don't know why

[Interlude 1: Andy Samberg, Mailman Fred]
Hey there, mailman friend, any letters from my ex-wife or the kids?
No
Fantastic news! Hahahahaha

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg]
Wonderful day makes me feel so happy that my face is numb
My heart is racing along, "ba-ra-pa-papapa-pahm"
So many people and places to meet, now that I lost my job
They say, "Young man, the world's your oyster–"

[Interlude 2: Andy Samberg]
Hey! Hey! Get the fuck off me! No! Fuck no!
Just give me a second (*snorting*)

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg]
I don't know why, but today seems like it's gonna be a great day
La la la, blah blah blah I should spend more time with my kids
It's carpe diem, gotta seize the day
Gonna move to Spain and run with the bulls
And my wife and boss and kids and parents will say
"We were wrong about you, Dennis."

[Interlude 3: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone]
Hey, Dennis!
That's my name
Are you really gonna run with the bulls?
Why would I do that?
Because you said you were gonna
Come on man, that was like three days ago
Or was it?

[Verse 4: Andy Samberg]
Something today makes me feel fine and fancy-free
Much of the ocean is still unexplored, how did I get up in this tree?
Now I'm over here, now I'm over there
Now I'm under this dude, now I'm back in this tree
Now I'm hanging out backstage
With my very best friends, Alec Baldwin and Tom Petty

[Interlude 4: Andy Samberg, Alec Baldwin, Tom Petty]
Get the fuck out of here
What?
Now
Tom?

[Bridge: Andy Samberg]
Why would they diss me? I thought they were my homies!
(*snorting*)

[Verse 5: Andy Samberg]
Any problem is solvable, we can feed the hungry and cure disease
But all of that would be a huge waste of time
Because we live in the Matrix

[Outro: Wife, Husband]
What is wrong with him?
He's on drugs
Oh

[Chorus: Quavo]
Try to take my life, try to take my life
Try to take my life, try to take my life

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
It was 1993 when I was jumped out the Porsche
When niggas was killing niggas just for wearing a pair of Jordans
Was a short little darkskin nigga but I was 

[?]
It was so hard I wished my momma

[Chorus: Quavo]
Try to take my life, try to take my life

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

Havin' one of those days when I can't make up my mind
So don't even look at me

My lower back is aching and my clothes don't fit (Oh shit)
Now ain't that a bitch? (Yes it is, yeah)

Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away
'Cause I'm PMS'in, yeah

[Verse 1]
We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I’ve been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won’t you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love

[Verse 2]
Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I’m not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I got to have a real love

[Bridge]
Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true
I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong, maybe I’ll find
A real love

[Verse 3]
So I’ve tried my best and prayed to God he’ll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
Ill give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love (Real love, real love)
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love

[Bridge]
See, I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go
(Real love, I’m searching for a real love)
Been around the world and high and low and still I never know
(Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love)
How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way 'cause it seems he can't be found

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love

[Snippet 1]
Dance too much money in the pants
Dance too much money in the pants
Oh, ratchet sluts!
Hoe Face.....

[Snippet 2]

[...] ratchet!
Don't fuck that chick she's ratchet!
Now go home, now go home
Don't make me get my hatchet
I know you wanna smash it
Don't fuck that chick she's ratchet!

[Chorus: K-Ci]
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do (No, no, no, no)
I don’t wanna do anything else
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do
I don’t wanna do anything else
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do (Yeah, yeah)
I don’t wanna do anything else (I don’t wanna do anything else baby baby)
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do
I don’t wanna do anything else (Listen, baby)

[Verse 1: K-Ci]
Every night and day I dream of another way
To tell you something good, I don’t think that I’m understood
You walk away and I frown with my head hung far down
You tell me what is wrong
You just wanna be loved all night long, baby

[Chorus: K-Ci]
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do
(I don’t wanna do anything else)
I don’t wanna do anything else (Yeah)
(Won't you tell me, baby?)
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do (Oh)
I don’t wanna do anything else (I don't wanna do)
Mary, Mary

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
You told me a thousand times that you would be mine, all mine
I do everything for you, but in your smile, I still can’t find
Now you tell me this, this is something that I can miss
And all you wanna do is to love me for me and I'll love you for you

[Chorus: K-Ci & Mary J. Blige]
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do
I don’t wanna do anything else
(I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do anything else)
(No, no, no, no, no)
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do (I don't wanna do nothing else)
I don’t wanna do anything else

[Verse 3: K-Ci & Mary J. Blige, Both]
Now that I know I’m gonna make love to you
So let it open up your heart
And let me in where I belong
If lovin' you was all that I have to do
Then it won’t be wrong, baby
'Cause we belong together baby

[Bridge: K-Ci, Mary J. Blige, Both]
Together, we will be as one
Just me and you, you, you, you
Will you love me? (I will love you)
Will you please me? (I will please you)
Girl, don’t leave me (I won’t leave you)
Let's make it easy (I’ll make it easy)

[Chorus in Background: K-Ci]
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do
I don’t wanna do anything else

[Outro: KCI & Mary J. Blige]
They could take my possessions
They could never take your love away from me
Ohh, see now listen with every breath I breathe and every beat of my heart
I know that no one, I know that no one can tear us apart
'Cause I love you, baby
I love you too
And I need you
I need you too
Stay with me, more than just a day
And you know, you know, you know
I love you
You make me feel so good, baby

[Verse 1]
Go and take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose

[Pre-Chorus]
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

[Chorus]
And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

[Verse 2]
There's an art to life's distraction
To somehow escape the burning wait, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else; I guess any thrill will do

[Pre-Chorus]
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

[Chorus]
And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

[Bridge]
I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sinned
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha
That you would pray for him

[Chorus]
'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day

[Refrain]
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better

[Chorus]
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

[Intro]
Ohh, baby
What you gonna do, baby?

[Verse 1]
I was a fool to let you in
Knowing you would play with my heart
But that was so long ago that I thought we could make a new start
You left me broken-hearted from the day your love departed
Now that I love you, I’m with someone new, you’re gone
And so you wanna come back

[Chorus]
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?

[Verse 2]
Sweet memories of yesterday when it all seemed so right
I was loving you, kissing you, holding you tight
I wish you know that woman that you learned to leave today
And it’s a shame that you wanna come back now, baby
My love is gone away

[Chorus]
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?

[Verse 3]
I’d make a fool for ya, baby
And you stole away my heart
Now that my love is gone away
Sweet memories of yesterday
Now that my love is gone away

[Chorus Repeat and Ad-libs Until Fade]
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?

[Chorus 1]
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you?
Changes I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you

[Verse 1]
It’s all gone, the moment that we shared is gone away
Maybe it’s better that we didn’t stay together
Seems like we’ve gone through this a thousand times
Baby, I still don’t have the answer
Why can't you tell me why we couldn’t be together?

[Chorus 2]
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you?
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)

[Verse 2]
See, I didn’t want to ever want to cry
But still I need love and affection
Was it that hard for you to show me some attention?
Tell me, baby, did I push you away?
Was I coming on strong for you?
Why can’t you tell me, tell me what am I to do?

[Chorus 2]
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you?
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)

[Interlude]
Don't you wanna be with me?
Don't you wanna be with me?
Don't you wanna be with me?

[Chorus 1]
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you?
Changes I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you?
Changes I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you?
Changes I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you

[Outro]
So why can’t ya see?
Pretty baby, can’t you see that I wanna be with you?

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
The memories we shared could last a man a lifetime
It's like truth or dare when you're there, no
And I'll admit that I'm scared to lose you to another guy-y-y
But it's up to you to decide who to love

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tonight I'ma break my promise
I know I said I'll set you free
But baby, you told me to be honest
Girl, I need you here with me

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
So we can do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
A whole lifetime would not be enough
'Cause I wanna love you, baby, over and over
And girl, each time I see you shed a tear
I wanna wipe 'em all up with my kisses and make you smile from ear to ear

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tonight I'ma break my promise
I know I said I'll set you free
But baby, you told me to be honest
Girl, I need you here with me

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
So we can do it again
Do it again (When you need me there)
Do it again (Again)
Do it again (Again, again)
So we can do it again

(Whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Baby, let's do it again

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
Girl, what are you running from? (Running from)
I'm willing just to give you everything you want (Oh, oh)
Girl, you are always number one (Number one)
I'll say it 'cause I know you're more than wonderful (Wonderful)

[Intro]
Your world, I wanna live in it
Your world, I wanna live in it
Your world, I wanna live in it
Your world, your world

[Verse 1]
I've been, chilling on the beach down in Mexico
Staring at the lights up in Tokyo
Dancing in Spain as the rain falls down
I've been, in New York City where they never sleep
First-class flights on my way to Greece
I've been everywhere and back around

[Pre-Chorus]
See I've been to London
I've been through France
And all that means nothing
If you don't give me a chance

[Chorus]
'Cause it's your world, yeah, it's your world
That I've never been until you let me in
'Cause in my world, yeah, in my world
I will never win until you let me into your world

[Verse 2]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you every night
Picturing your body laying next to mine
What's it gonna take for you to open up?
Oh, tell me
'Cause I wanna know everything about your world
I wanna be there when you need me, girl
I wanna be more than a fool in love (Fool in love)

[Pre-Chorus]
See I've been to London (Hey)
I've been through France (Hey)
And all that means nothing
If you don't give me a chance

[Chorus]
'Cause it's your world, yeah, it's your world
That I've never been until you let me in
'Cause in my world, yeah, in my world
I will never win until you let me into your world

[Bridge]
Baby, let me dive into your ocean (Let me dive)
Let me wish upon your shooting star (Shooting star)
We gotta put this thing in motion
Bring our two worlds to the same heart
Your world, I wanna live in it (Oh)
Your world, I wanna live in it (Oh-oh)
Your world, I wanna live in it
Your world, come on, girl

[Chorus]
'Cause it's your world, yeah, it's your world
That I've never been until you let me in
'Cause in my world, yeah, in my world
I will never win until you let me into your world
'Cause it's your world, yeah, it's your world
That I've never been until you let me in
(I wanna go, baby, let me go there)
(And breathe in your beautiful air)
'Cause in my world (In my world), yeah, in my world (In my world, I will never win)
I will never win until you let me into your world

[Outro]
Your world, I wanna live in it (I wanna live in it)
Your world, I wanna live in it (Just need to live in it)
Your world, I wanna live in it (I wanna live in it)
Your world (Your world), your world (Your world)
Your world, I wanna live in it (Oh)
Your world, I wanna live in it (Oh-oh)
Your world, I wanna live in it (Oh-whoa-oh)
Your world, your world, your world

[Verse 1]
You take from me
So why you holding back? Boy, why you holding back?
So vacantly
But you won't get away with that, no, you won't get away with that

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't see what you do to me
From the outside
This can't be what it used to be
From the outside

[Chorus]
I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round
My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more
No, I won't play this game

[Verse 2]
Don't wait for me
When you know you did me wrong, I've been holding on too long
Eventually
I’ll make the call

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't see what you do to me
From the outside
This can't be what it used to be
From the outside

[Chorus]
I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round
My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more
No, I won't play this game

[Bridge]
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time

[Chorus]
I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round
My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more
No, I won't play this game

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
You keep talkin' that shit, muhfucka
You'll make me mad, I'mma get my cutter
Get my M16, my MAC-11, my K, I'mma call my brother
Matter fact, I don't need no 'nother
Nigga, I ain't even gotta call my brother
This lil chopper gon' take care of all that drama
17, I don't need no mother
I got pain, I killed the pen and I killed the paint job
Rocket launcher, crazy gun like in Super Contra
Kangaroo pouch with the strap, it's down under
Satellite dish, turtle top dunk, cowabunga
Got them black shades, can't see shit, Stevie Wonder
And I'll shoot a nigga in his shit, you better run, bruh
"Gucci got a gun, he 'bout to click, better run swift"
I just wanna shoot, don't wanna hit, got a four fifth
My niggas'll shoot yo' ass for shit, they like 4-6
MAC-11, don't keep it at home, got it right here

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Bag full of guns, let me pick out one
Whomever wanna test, let that bad man come
Who wanna war? Let come, bet the game begun

Flocka got a gun, please put down the gun
Gucci got a gun, please put down the gun
Flocka got a gun, please put down the gun
Gucci got a gun, please put down ya gun!

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
.38s, .45s, Glock 9s, pistol in my hand, I don't do the waistline
Heart all black, Akon, how you gettin' money but can't make bond?
Silencers on the chopsticks, Avon - I got a lot of guns
Big guns like Contra that'll shell shock you like Blanka
Shooter save a shooter, I'm a top shotter
Waka Flocka Flame, I got the juice, partner
Low jolt the gun, that's the anaconda
Fuck the law until they free my partner
Chopper kick like Liu Kang, free Poo Tang, who-who bang?
You real then I'm recruitin', you a dead man wit' that FN in my hand
Don't fuck wit' niggas, Ku Klux Klan, get love all in the Motherland
Make ya best friend kill you for the bands, get love all in Rosecrans
Got a Mack 10, AK, SK, .223, 3 throwaways, that's a 40, real P-Funk
Slow him down like a speed bump, the barrel pump, Elmer Fudd
Whoever thugs, I'll leave ya slumped, show you no love
I'm shinin' hard, Michael Jackson glove
Brick Squad, there's too many guns, shoot for fun, just because
Kill a nigga, kill a nigga, kill a nigga, kill a nigga, Squad!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Bag full of guns, let me pick out one
Whomever wanna test, let that bad man come
Who wanna war? Let come, bet the game begun

Gucci got a gun, please put down the gun
Flocka got a gun, please put down the gun

[Verse 3: Ca$h Out]
Ca$h Out got a gun, put ya hands up
They say they want war, put ya bands up
I buy these niggas' partners, make 'em hit they mans up
And these niggas snitchin', that's why they takin' a stand, bruh
Jewels 'round my neck, ridin' by myself
Pistol on my hip just in case a nigga wanna trip
And I don't need no crew
Them the niggas who snitchin' on you
Just a couple real niggas 'round me
Who don't give a fuck about you, ooh
These niggas know I hang around them shottas
Only comin' for ya medulla oblongata
Wanna see yo' noodles, love eatin' pasta
(I'm on the phone wit' Mac A Zoe, he put me on the roster)
Yeah, we talkin' crazy, in Miami in a rari wit' them Haitians
Shit, I just talk it how I live it
Probably that's the reason why I party at Liv, rich nigga shit

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Bag full of guns, let me pick out one
Whomever wanna test, let that bad man come
Who wanna war? Let come, bet the game begun
Because I murk niggas for fun, man, I kill for fun, for fun

Gucci: Legends

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Old boy, killa cam, trunk full of old boy
Murking fuck boys in the hood like Dope Boy
Oh my good grief damn, who is this guy?
Gucci on a mob tie looking like a wise guy
Working with 5 I cut it on the 

[?]
If it ain’t a fork I can whip it with a wire
You don’t got a scale, I can do it with my eye-eye
Couldn’t find a scrap so I whipped him with a tire iron
Egg beater fast, nigga bread do the work 

[?]
Got your whole neighborhood stash in my book bag
My worker said ‘Wop looked good with a crook hat
Told that bitch to get butt naked when she cooked that
Versace, medusa head, neat, where my fleece at
Told that bitch she might turn to stone if she look back
A rapper, a trapper, two hats, my but my head back
Bricks come with four in the pack like a kit kat
Plain Jane, rolling 50 thou, ginger P
Cash out shouldn't of said that, it should've been a secret
Me and P geekin, please keep a secret
Thug make me mad, he forgot where the weed at

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Riding around with two girls
I ain’t talking bout Haiti or Marie
Home alone with no help
Ain’t nothing but this motherfucking carbon
I’m riding around with two boys
I ain’t talking bout Jake or Kyvion
I’m traffickin' that ball, that ball like I’m the Edison
Traffickin', traffickin',  traffickin'
Traffickin'  traffickin' ,  traffickin' , that yay
I’m home alone, I’m home alone
I’m home alone and I’m  traffickin' , that yayo, yayo, yayo
We don’t need no motherfucking dope
This bitch beating down the floor
We just bought an Audemar
Gio go, Gio go, Gio go, Gio go, Gio go

[Bridge: Young Thug]
Million DK, I’m a slug
I mug every motherfucking club I enter
Gave him 17 5 for the slug, lay em down
Open my mouth saying baby girl enter
I remember when I couldn’t afford a car
Now we got a million dollar worth of rentals
I remember when I used to ask for a dog
Now I got a free dog for my denture nigga

[Verse 3: Peewee Longway]
Wow, Longway got chicks in the Phantom
3 white bitches, molly in the middle
Smoking gas with my thumb in the middle
Is it gooey, is it bushy, is it funky, did you diss it?
My shoes are on Jumanji you, YSL, she the prettiest
Fool with designer, everything come from Italy
Casper the ghost, I'm on my Forgiato killing them
Tommy gun out on my tummy, I'm Longway Dillinger
100 round drum my gun, don't make me spit at you
Hit at you, I murder for fun, you fucking bumbaclot
Booted up on molly, I spray through your ho, you throw em out
Don't play with my funds
I make your bitch ass do the walk it out
Bad Panamanian passenger in my Panamera
Kinda like I'm in a motherfucking Camera
For a couple more I got Longway on Lil Daryl
Two chicks in the trunk of 

[?] llama, Alcatraz
Bricks of the dirty harry, VVS’s got to stare
Call the squad from Delaware, just book this 

[?]
Keep changing the color of her hair, she Dennis Rodman
Mailman drop off the box, that mean that loud in
Keep some cash out, I'm thugging for dollars
My hermes buckle cost me  thousands
If you ain't two white chick, bitch don't bother
Cause I ain't got room for you in my Impala

[Verse 4: Cash Out]
Pockets on sumo, wore the Rolex other day, now the Hublot
In Miami got your bitch on the jet skis
Take her to the room and that pussy jet ski
Dirty money in the Swiss account
That money that you talking like my bitch’s mouth
Had my old bricks at my old bitch’s house
Paid her rent full time, then I kicked her out nigga
New plug, hey I got to switch him out
New cars, hey I got to switch em out
80 K for the S6, I could get that that bitch, that bitch, that bitch
And that bitch, naw mean, turn up in the booty club
All she want is a half inch, fuck it up
Fuck it up, that’s what I do for her
Let your hair blow shit, no roof for her
I’m a dog shit, so you know that I roof for her
If she don’t fuck, then you know that I’m booting her
Who the hell taught you how to fuck, girl, tune it up
I’m leaning, I bet the pot it stay leaning
My pockets, they stay scheming
With the head, they ain't tryna' do shit
Tryna' double up, two bitches on me
Tell them hoes double up
Head so good, WTF, what the fuck
Hashtag, 

[?] in the black Jag
Fucked her girlfriend, now she calling me the natnat

[Bridge: Young Thug]
Million DK, I’m a slug
I mug every motherfucking club I enter

I remember when I used to ask for a dog
Now I got a free dog for my denture nigga

[Intro]
They wanna know why I do it?
It's actually pretty simple
Haha, look

[Verse 1]
I do it for the music
I do it for the love
I do it 'cause my purpose is way more than just because
I do it for the soul
I do it for the funk
I do it for the people who used say that I'm a punk
I do it for the haters
I do it for the fans
I do it for the people who helped make me who I am
I do it for everyone
The world, the water up to the sand
The quiet kid in your school who wanna just be the man
I do it because I can
I do it because I love it
There ain't a better feelin' than to know your feature's done it
'Cause now, this my job, this what I live for
Every day the best day ever, still tryna get more
So I never take a day off
Every single game, gotta treat it like a playoff

[Refrain]
Buckle up, we 'bout to take off
Heart and soul move us all
I just smile and remember what I do it for

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna know what you doin' and why you doin' it
We livin' life, so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash
Everybody wanna know what you doin' and why you doin' it
We livin' life so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash

[Verse 2]
I do it for the generation, all the kids who 'bout to grow up, run shit
Put our thumbs in the air and the blunt lit
Feelin' like I can do it in my sleep
But I'm workin', gettin' better, thinkin' 'bout what's out my reach
Hopin' that it's nothin' but I'm hopin' for discussion
How I crashed into the game and nobody seen me comin'
They saw a youngin who just love what he does
A brain behind the face and a heart behind the buzz
I keep it real, ain't got a reason to lie
Just mention me when your favorite MCs come to mind
I'll bless a rhyme if you give me the time
In Pittsburgh, I just want my whole city behind me
'Cause "We" is who I do this for
Soundtrack to life, this a movie score

[Refrain]
Buckle up, we 'bout to take off
Heart and soul move us all
I just smile and remember what I do it for

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna know what you doin' and why you doin' it
We livin' life, so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash
Everybody wanna know what you doin' and why you doin' it
We livin' life, so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash (Hey, hey)

[Verse 3]
Hey, third verse
Yeah, I do it, I ain't done yet
Do it for the crack of dawn and every time the sun set
You played all of your cards and got none left
I'm stayin' smart, strategic for what come next
Yeah, I'm ready for it, prepared heavy for it
That's why I do what I do and I ain't ever bored
If life a game, I got a better score
I guarantee you I'ma do this right here
I do this for the feelin' that you get when you hear the perfect beat
You know exactly what to say and all your homies holler, "Preach!"

[Refrain]
We 'bout to take off
Heart and soul move us all
I just smile and remember what I do it for

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna know what you doin' and why you doin' it
We livin' life, so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash
Everybody wanna know what you doin' and why you doin' it
We livin' life, so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash

[Outro]
Yeah
My thumb stay up
'Cause at the end of the day, I know why I do it
We do it to be happy
We do it 'cause it's all love, you know?
Don't be mad at me
Hey

[Intro]
Ayy, the blog is hot, Q, haha
Uh

[Verse]
Everybody love it 'cause we do it with ease
Hop up online, get your music for free
The blog is hot, it's no longer on the down-low
A song side if it get a lot of downloads
Everybody love it 'cause right before a hit drop
Already grabbed it off HotNewHipHop
Blog is like the shit-talk comin' at your neck
'Cause fake shit comin', well, it doesn't get respect
Blogs hit the net like a muhfuckin' typhoon
Nobody droppin' dollars on iTunes
Websites good to look at like a hot mom
RapMullet, AllHipHop.com
A lot of hate on HipHopGame
Dudes like, "Damn, white boy is lame"
But it's great 'cause I love hate
So listen, fuck-face, I'm givin' news, hip-hop updates
You want music? And all that fly?
You better do it like motor and blog or die

While others be's puttin' up them two dope boys
We all rap and gettin' long cash
Puttin' hip-hop on smash
Exclusives, pictures, everyone can see me

Blowin' like alamo

Balls like cockfights, jaws like dog bites
Daily check-up or nah, right?
And I see dope, got me three phones, haha

I got splash and low-key heard that new
Oh, new Mac Miller? Yeah, I heard that too
So if I forgot to say your blog and you showin' love

[Outro]
But I love all y'all, man
Good luck, everybody
Keep puttin' up that free music
And post my shit, damn!

[Intro]
United girls, united girls
Get united girls, united girls
Get united girls

[Hook]
What if the women of the world went on strike?
What if they finally decided to end this fight?
And because of your broken heart you have every right
What if the women of the world went on strike?

[Verse 1]
Honey come and hold my hand
Please forgive me, I'm only a man
Thought your silence meant you understood
But please don't give up for good (no)

[Pre-Hook]
Where I sat and I imagine
Or every man that has a girl
If there was no more mothers and no more lovers
Nothing would be left, it scares me to death

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm a fool, I'm a fool, yes I know
The world ends as I know it, please don't go
I am so so ashamed and afraid (so afraid)
Of the mess that we made

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
We know we lied and wasted time
We should have listened, ladies
Without love we could not live with us, without you
So talk to us, take us higher
Your love brings us out of this fire
And you're the object of my desire

[Hook]

[Outro]
United girls, united girls
Get united girls, united girls
Get united girls, united girls
Get united girls, united girls

[Verse 1: Turk]
Ever since I came home from the pen
Been grindin' on my own and shit
Eight thou', seven-hundred sixty hour
YT puttin' all this shit
Real nigga, again the street fuckin' with me
Fuck a bitch nigga, got them red killers with me
Uptown nigga, let it bust
'Til it's if ya gettin' money is a must
But I'll stick it if you tempt me, so nigga don't tempt me
God don't do shit neither
Chopper worth of trouble, it's gone faster than a cheetah
Savor to the thuggin', I g'd up
Get it from the mud
I'm a thug, posted up like a meter
Stay strapped with the heater
I fuck pussy - pussy nigga, I don't need you
I'm grindin', me and my people
Puttin' in work like Amiga (Like amigos nigga)
Like Jeezy, I done seen it all
The feds askin', nigga I ain't seen nothin' at all
Swear I been nigga outside, ten time a hundred, nigga, one thou'
Grindin' for all my shit
Tryin' to build a house with one brick
Tryin' to fuck you, your bitch, and your clique
And no nigga, I ain't gave me shit

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I put time into all this shit

I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
The feds be spying on all of us nigga
These hoes be lying to all of us nigga
I got news for the monogamous niggas
Yo' bitch fucking anonymous niggas
I done seen it all my nigga
Cause these hoes seeing all of my niggas
Cause what’s the hottest shit on these corners?
That’s me and all my niggas
Grind for all this shit, I ain’t ever fall for that bitch
Cause picking up the feather from a lovebird
Is like a medicine ball to that bitch
We'll bring Gucci bag in this bitch
And you know what's stashed in that bitch
These niggas walk around with they chests out
Like Janet Jackson and shit
I’m sweatin’ grindin’ this bitch, I need a shrine in this bitch
Fuck double O seven, I work twenty-four seven
Ain’t got time to bond with no bitch
Heard Jay Z got a new Cognac, where to find that shit?
The weed sticky, grind that shit
Where I got it from? Nevermind that shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
I got a new vision for all my shit
I don’t know what to call that shit
I know, I’m selling all of my cars
I’m selling all of my watches
I’m selling diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I don’t need that shit
I’m a different breed with this shit
I’m tryna turn M’s to B’s in this bitch
And I ain’t ever pay to be with no bitch
I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed
Fifty mill in one room, you, you could ask anyone out here
Who running the game? And they’ll tell you the truth
Man, they'll tell you
Oh look, they fuck with me now
I think they’re hearin' me now
Someone said "Nigga they takin' you seriously now"
I’m like "I think they just might be scared of me now"
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day
Go, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin' out of space
Mothafucka that’s grindin'

[Hook]

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
(Grindin’, grindin’) Perfect timing
(Grindin’, grindin’)
(grindin’, grindin’)
I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe
Than peek inside the safe and say I’m running out of space
Believe that

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Scoob, find another oo-wop
Tell them niggas cool out
Cause it can be a mohafucking shoot-out
Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out
Top floor, window he get threw out
Deuce out, pussy bitches, deuce out
Flying out the crew out, they flew out
Invite 'em to my new house, my new house
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, grindin’
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I'm grindin’
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I’m grindin’

[Outro]
Twap, twap!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Yeah, I was fucked up, but bitch, I'm back
I wasn't at the club, 'cause I was in the trap
I see you show me love, you ain't like when I was down
Now, I'm stuntin' on them hoes, bitch, how you like me now?
Bitch, how you like me now?
I tell 'em, "How you like me now?"
'Cause I be shinin' like a diamond, I got money in my pocket

I see it, like it, I'ma cop it, oh!

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah
I see it, like it, I'ma cop it, nigga, what's the topic?
Started from the bottom, now I really got it poppin'
See these bitches in my section, they just wanna ride it
Same hoes that fronted back, they want it, now I got it
'Cause I'm ballin', I'm talkin' Spaldin'
Rollie on my wrist, flooded like New Orleans
A nigga buzzin' now, I'm talkin' hornets
'Cause I murder all my enemies, stretch my opponents
Microphone killer, tell 'em Mac Miller
Zombies in my neighborhood, shit is like "Thriller"
And I'm Mike Jackson 'cause I'm they dealer
In my zipped-up jacket and my neck on chiller
Goin' hard is gettin' scary, I swear it's gettin' scary
I put mirror tint all on this ghost and screamin' Bloody Mary
So when you see me: "Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary"
A nigga play around with me, he get fuckin' buried

[Chorus: Meek Mill, Mac Miller, Meek Mill & Mac Miller]
Yeah, I was fucked up, but bitch, I'm back

Now, I'm stuntin' on them hoes, bitch, how you like me now?
Bitch, how you like me now? (How you like me now, bitch?)
I tell 'em, "How you like me now?" (Aight, look, man)
'Cause I be shinin' like a diamond, I got money in my pocket
I don't even have to press, I see it, like it, I'ma cop it, oh!
I see it, like it, I'ma cop it, oh! (What up, Meek?)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Uh
Uh, comin' through the city, up in Philly, out with Meek
Make a hunnid every week so now I'm stuntin' like a Sheikh
And we do this shit for PA, we do this shit for PA
How I used to get it dirty, now my money come the clean way
Blindfold on me, do a hunnid down the freeway
'Til I'm drivin' off the cliff, just to fly and take a trip
Bitch, I came right out some circus shit, youngin but I'm learnin' quick
Murder this, burn your kids, then call up child services
And they ain't even gotta ask, they know that Mac workin'
Act certain, smoke a fuckin' beat like it's a Nat Sherman
Haha, go 'head and hand me a rapper
I'ma chew his ass up like he a animal cracker
I might rip your hands off, slap you in the face with 'em
Spit straight venom, give you bars like it's a state prison
Yeah, I'm still scruffy, gettin' money
Got these writers all mad 'cause they daughters wanna fuck me, ayy

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Yeah, I was fucked up, but bitch, I'm back
I wasn't at the club, 'cause I was in the trap
I see you show me love, you ain't like when I was down
Now, I'm stuntin' on them hoes, bitch, how you like me now?
Bitch, how you like me now?
I tell 'em, "How you like me now?"
'Cause I be shinin' like a diamond, I got money in my pocket
I don't even have to press, I see it, like it, I'ma cop it, oh!
I see it, like it, I'ma cop it, oh!

I just wanna get high with my best friend
Kiss her on my tongue, just like I'm your boyfriend
I just wanna get high with my best friend
Kiss her on my tongue, just like I'm your boyfriend

Shit so bright, like we're flying through the supernova
I just wanna get high with my best friend
Kiss her on my tongue, just like I'm your boyfriend

[Intro]
I'm in love with you

[Chorus]
Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time to spend on loving, spend on loving you
To spend on loving you, to spend on loving you

[Verse 1]
I got the time to be your throwaway
If I get to hang with you every day
Sitting on the ground, drinking champagne
Flying 'round the world, private plane
You're like the best kind of Novocain
Super ease, take the pain away
Nice kinda numb, yeah, it's a-okay
Back of the car, I will stay smoking

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay hot like fire
You are my one desire
But you will never tire
Because you always keep on taking me higher
Super sweet, like a French bon-bon
Super story, how you were gone, gone
You got my heart dressed up like a debutante
You're the apple of my eye and the only one

[Chorus]
Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time to spend on loving, spend on loving you
To spend on loving you, to spend on loving you
Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time to spend on loving, spend on loving you
To spend on loving you, to spend on loving you

[Verse 2]
I like it when you kiss the back of my neck
I like it that you show me super respect
You're not the kind of guy I think I'll regret
You're not the kind of guy I'm gonna forget
Sparkle in your heart always glows in the dark
Rainbows in the sky when we walk through the park
Hand in my hand, toes in the sand
Super ultra love for my man

[Chorus]
Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time to spend on loving, spend on loving you
To spend on loving you, to spend on loving you
To spend on loving you, to spend on loving you

[Intro: Interview with Justin Bieber]
Reporter: If you were gonna sing something to a girl to try and seduce her, what would you sing, and will you sing it for us?
Justin Bieber: Seduce her?!
Reporter: Yup!
Justin Bieber: Uhh, I don't know, um... I've never tried to seduce a girl yet...

[Verse 1]
Under your magic
Under your magic in the night
I twist and turn
But I can never put up a fight
You are like diamonds
You are like diamonds in the night
Ask me a question
You know I'll do anything, I'm hypnotized (dance)

[Pre-Chorus]
Just stay
Just stay awake
Just lay
Just lay for me

[Chorus]
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but you want me to
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance but you like what I do
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but you want me to
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but I'll dance for you

[Verse 2]
Body electric
Lost in our hyper fantasy
I really feel it
I'm moving both my arms, yeah, it's happening
Lost all my feelings
I don't really care who's watchin' me
We're on a level
If they don't like what we do, well, they can just leave

[Pre-Chorus]
You stay
You stay awake
You lay
You lay for me

[Chorus]
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but you want me to
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance but you like what I do
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but you want me to
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, but I'll dance for you

Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber)
Justin (Bieber), Justin (Bieber), just in place

[Verse 1]
And so once again, my dear Johnny, my dear friend
And so once again you are fightin' us all
And when I ask you why, you raise your sticks and cry and I fall
Oh, my friend, how did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum?

[Verse 2]
You say I have turned like the enemies you've earned
But I can remember all the good things you are
And so I ask you please, can I help you find the peace and the star?
Oh, my friend, what time is this
To trade the handshake for the fist?

[Verse 3]
And so once again, oh, America my friend
And so once again you are fighting us all
And when we ask you why, you raise your sticks and cry and we fall
Oh, my friend, how did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum?

[Verse 4]
You say we have turned like the enemies you've earned
But we can remember all the good things you are
And so we ask you please, can we help you find the peace and the star
Oh my friend, we have all come
To fear the beating of your drum

[Verse 1]
Baby, since the day you came into my life
You made me realize that we were born to fly
You showed me everyday new possibilities
You proved my fantasy of love could really be

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go to a place only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the clouds we're floating away, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh this feels so crazy
Oh this love is blazing
And baby we're so high
Walking on cloud 9
(You've got me up so high) So high
(My shoes are scraping the sky) So high
(You've got me up so high) Oh
(My shoes are scraping the sky)

[Verse 2]
Maybe later we could go up to the moon
Or sail among the stars before the night is through
And when morning comes we'll see the sun is not so far
And we can't get much closer to God than where we are

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll go to a place only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the clouds we're floating away, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh this feels so crazy
And oh, this love is blazing
And baby we're so high
Walking on cloud 9
(You've got me up so high) So high
(My shoes are scraping the sky) So high
(You've got me up so high) Oh
(My shoes are scraping the sky)

Ooh...yeah
Ooh...oh hey

[Chorus]
Ooh this feels so crazy
Oh this love is blazing
Baby, we're so high
Walking on cloud 9
You've got me up so high
You've got me up so high
You've got me up so high
My shoes are scraping the sky
You've got me up so high
You've got me up so high
You've got me up so high
My shoes are scraping the sky

[Outro]
This is how love's supposed to be
This is how, this is how love's supposed to be, yeah
Let's go to the moon baby, ooh
Let's go to the moon baby, yeah
Let's go, go, let's go to the moon baby
So high...

[Verse 1]
I pray for better days to come
I pray that I would see the sun
'Cause life is so burdensome
When everyday is a rainy one
But suddenly there's no more clouds
And I believe without a doubt
That heaven sent an angel down
Then she turned my life around

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You know and I know
Friends come and friends go
Storms rise and winds blow
But one thing I know for sure

[Chorus]
When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry 'cause
I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
'Cause we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright, it's alright
Oooh...

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now peace is so hard to find
We're terrorized and victimized
But that's when I close my eyes
And think of you to ease my mind
You take me to another place
There's no more war (no more war)
Just love and grace
Baby, you restore my faith
I know the struggle's not in vain

[Bridge 2]
You know and I know
Through all the battles
Baghdad to Israel
There's one thing I know for sure

[Chorus]
When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry 'cause
I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
'Cause we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright, it's alright
Oooh...
Alright it's alright
Alright it's alright
Alright it's alright
Oooh...

[Chorus]
When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry 'cause
I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
'Cause we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright, it's alright
Oooh...

Oh it's gonna be alright
Ooh...

[Outro]
'Cause you give me peace
In the middle of the storm
When it's cold you're keeping me warm
It's alright
It's alright
I'm never gonna leave
You give me what I need
It's alright, it's alright

But now we've grown and gone our separate ways (aah)

[Chorus]
Times is hard (times is hard)

[Verse 2]
Do you remember (ooh)
Back at Grannie's house on Christmas Day? (ooh)
Help me sing...

Times is hard (times is hard)
And things are a-changin'

That we can remain the same
All I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change
No it don't have to change (aah)
Times is hard (times is hard)
And things are a-changin'
I pray to God
That we can remain the same
All I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change
No it don't have to change

[Intro]
Ha-ha ha-ha ooh...

[Verse 1]
You know we've been struggling for such a long time
Working here and there just to get by
It's finally time for me to get mine
No more robbing Peter so we can pay Paul (oh no)
Or going to Mama's house to make a phone call (no no)
No we don't have to struggle at all

[Bridge 1]
'Cause now every day is feeling like Friday (Friday)
I'm getting paid and doing it my way (my way)
We're finally on our way
Baby now it's time to celebrate

[Chorus]
Oh live it up, we can go crazy
Live it up, you and me baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up
We're flying high, don't wanna come down
We'll let 'em know all over town and
Live it up, live it up, live it up

[Verse 2]
No more putting it in the layaway (away)
'Cause boo, I got the money today (today)
Come on and go to the mall and let's play (play)
Let's go raise a toast to the days ahead (ahead)
You can't take it with you when you're dead (dead)
You might as well enjoy it now instead (instead)

[Bridge 2]
Oh now, it's about to be a long evening (yeah yeah)
We'll party through the rest of the weekend (come on)
We're finally on our way
Baby now it's time to celebrate

[Chorus]
Oh live it up, we can go crazy
Live it up, you and me baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up
We're flying high, don't wanna come down
We'll let 'em know all over town and
Live it up, live it up, live it up

[Interlude]
We can fly so high in the moonlit sky
'Cause there's no more cloudy days
It's so beautiful, when you feel the flow
We can dance the night away

[Verse 3]
Do you remember when times were hard? Oh so hard
Through it all, we've come so far
(Ha-ha ha-ha ooh)
So we gotta live it up
So we can just celebrate there's no more pain
Raise your glass and feel no shame
(Ha-ha ha-ha ooh)
Oh so we gotta live it up

[Chorus]
Oh live it up, we can go crazy
Live it up, you and me baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up

Live it up, live it up, live it up

[Outro]
Oh it's time to celebrate baby
(Ha-ha ha-ha ooh)

Hmm, we don't have worry no more
We don't have to struggle no more, yeah
(Ha-ha ha-ha ooh)
It's time to celebrate baby
Yeah we gotta live it up
I've come here to kill my maker
'Cause I'd feel much safer alone

I remember everything
You're inside singing
You look so different
You're walking across the tile floor
You look like Jesus on the water

Please don't help me, oh
Please don't help me, oh
Please don't help me, oh
Please don't help me, oh
Please
I was a girl
I was the only kid in the world, I thought I knew
What it meant to you
But I'm wrong
I'm wrong, I'm wrong
I'm not okay
In fact, I'm sick today, I'm on the floor
It's such a bore, it's
Nothing new
To you
I'll be downstairs, let me do my hair
And put my makeup on, it feels so wrong
You say
"Rock on"
I'm not the same

Everybody wants you, yeah
Everybody loves you
Your smile, your teeth, your hair
They don't know you're not there
They don't know you're not there
Too fast, too slow, too late
You are never gonna make it
You're never gonna make it
(I'm not the same)
I get feelings
From the TV
They can't hurt me
They don't know me
I saw daddy
In a movie
He's on big screen
He don't know me
He gets lonely
He forgets me
And he bought us a TV
'Cause you don't come around anymore
And we don't see you anymore
And I don't know what it's for

'Cause you don't come around anymore
And I don't know what it's for

[Snoop Dogg]
Uh-huh, hmm... I was chillin, right around my way (way!)
21st eastside of the Beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talkin shit with his homies like he was a straight.. G
Askin where I'm from while he runnin up
Gangbang, my set on e'ry one of 'em (true)
Some things, sons they just won't change
Fools don't respect nuttin but the gangbang (bang!)
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you niggas runnin like a marathon
Little G's tryna creep, on the East with it
Talkin 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it (nmm hmm!)
But they don't know once they get close
It's Tic-Tac Toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor (watch out!)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray - I heard the ese say, he said...

[Hook: B-Real] + (Snoop Dogg)
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys and they act real hard (and what they do?)
They twist the fingers and said, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (uh huh!)
They keep buckin and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (and what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

[Break 2X: Snoop Dogg]
(BLAOWW!) Run nigga, run nigga!
(BLAOWW!) Duck nigga, duck nigga!
(BLAOWW!) Run, motherfucker run!
(BLAOWW!) Run, motherfucker run!

[2pac]
I went from rags to riches
Quick to socializing with the baddest bitches
Went from a bucket to a rag with switches
I'm seein' death around the corner
I'm bumpin' Gloriaaaa doin' 90 cause I wanna
I'm getting high and like I said it was some chocolate thai
Mixed with some indonesia watch me fly
And even though I know the cops behind me
Hit the weed and uh I continue doing 90 (Biotch)
Until I get caught another ticket get to kick it in court
Fuck the law give a shit I'm even worse than before
I know they wanna see a nigga buried
But I ain't worried still throwing these thangs
Got me locked in these chains
And hey nigga what the fuck is you wailin' 'bout
Soon as I hit the cell I'll be bailin' out
And when I hit the streets I'm in a rush to ball
I'm screaming Thug Life nigga fuck y'all

[Hook] + 

[Break]

[DMX]
Cats playin' games, so I'm goin' raw
Run up in that fuckin' building, kick down the door
Y'all don't want no fuckin' problems wit' X
Y'all don't wanna see them four-legged beasts
Wit' them collars on their necks
Wit' them niggas downstairs wit' the tech, you know the rest
Fuck it, blow it y'all niggas, bitch I take respect
Dog's shit hot, that's why y'all cowards froze me quick
I pop up, catch niggas on some cozy shit
With Chinese slippers and silk scarves on
Nigga out here tryin' to get his bark on, wonder why the dog gone
I couldn't take it, deface it, that nigga make shit
That's somethin' that'll happen, nigga wanna brace it
And for the record, what you gonna do to fill up my spot?
I ain't gon' front, that "Pon De Replay" shit, was kinda hot
Not!! How you gonna jack Will Smith for a beat?
That's like tryna jack me for the streets! It ain't happenin'!

[Verse 1]
Whippin' the dope, ride the pot like a peg
Nigga got the whole rock under my feet, no Pro Ked
These bitches like when I go crazy, I swear I go crazy like spazz
Nigga could never be none of you, never ever, you're not it
Consider our street soldiers, run with the wooly
Lil' Mexico lingo lingo
Yes I got a will, but you're not included
All because you're not cutthroat (slime)
Yes I got bales in the pantry
Yes I got pounds in the attic
I don't like you
Yes I'ma turn my head on you like you a lil' faggot
If I ever take a trip to the chain gang you know they embracin' lil' homie
The warden on me, they pourin' on me
You think it's a dream, you blurry on me
My skin is tatted, you can tour on it
Matter fact you can explore on it
You should go down on your numbers, my nigga
You overexaggeratin', plural on it

I just want you baby, baby, got you on the bed, bed
Don't ever stop, don't ever stop, shit

[Verse 2]
I just might, I just might, I just might, I just might, I just might, I just might, hit that tommorow
Oh, I dive in the sky, I really believe I can fly
I be like "Hurry and buy"
I fucked 'em both I'm connivin'
I'm an angel in the sky
I look down on the drive by's
Hundred bands inside of my pants
YSL loaded
I don't like gold jewelry no more
Put it up like a trophy, I'm the coldest
Smell like flowers, she's the bomb
I just call her "Lotus"
Dick get hard on her butt
My nickname "Hokus Pokus"

[Chorus]
I just might spend a whole milli' (Racks)

And while we're burning this incense

Single mother, where they come from
How we gonna save the nation
With no support for education
Cause right now it don't make sense
Right now it don't make sense
Let's talk about our part

[Intro]
I've been grindin' my whole life, nigga
I've been grindin' my whole life, Rosenberg
I've been grindin' my whole life, Fam
Yo, let me see, yo, uh

[Verse 1]
Stuntin' on the low so they feel better
Damn, why they hatin' on a real nigga?
East side Atlanta where they kill niggas
I was in a coma but I stayed with you
I'll be right by your side, radio play me that new 3005
Bino won't die, illest rapper alive
See what's up with Fredo when I'm out in the Chi
Murder everything I touch, but I don't know why
And he can get the business, your girlfriend love me
Turn it up, who is this? Shots at your fitted
Gra-ta-ta, are we not that fly?
Are we not young God, is this not black excellence?
I could lie to you people but my soul too sensitive
Gam-b, y'all ain't got shit on me, man I'm so fly, like XYZ
Threat to the throne, man, I'ma murder this
You are such a poser, you ain't ever heard of this
Shots at you fake boys walkin' 'round in turtlenecks
And a du-rag? Wanna be me so bad
And the hair so homeless, record labels want us
Bino well read, like Octobers
Hit me on my Snapchat, hit me on my Nextel Chirp
Run up on them boys, get murked
Nigga sit down, he can't stand me
Curly black hair, bright pink panties
Blush on the vanity, tanner with her ass out
We don't have to love each other, she just wanna cash out
Stone Mountain bitch, run it off a mixtape
This is for my niggas up in Onyx getting shitfaced
He just dropped a mixtape, she got so excited
Took her to a Clippers game and niggas ain't invited
Drugs on the rider, need to clean my act up
Man, I thought he was an actor
Thought he was a fuckin' joke, when I wrote them fuckin' notes
Everything I do is dope, I hope you niggas overdose
I hope you niggas hear the truth, so honest in my interviews
If Parker Lewis couldn't lose, I'm blackin' out at Tongue & Groove
Royalty, I run the crew, we them boys

[Interlude]
Yo, I've been grindin' my whole life, nigga
Nah I'm talkin' 'bout?
I'm just sayin' I'm grindin' my whole life, nigga
Nah know I'm talkin' 'bout?
Yo, I got some more, I got some more, yeah, yeah
Let me see, Imma try and go in, uh, uhm

[Verse 2]
Mothafuckin' right, we the niggas huffin' OG
In the club tryna keep it lowkey
She was all on my D, then we fell out of it
Cause I'm never really there and she tired of it
Real nigga shit, real love, real pain, real intimate
These niggas so scared, I'm killin' it
These niggas so scared, I'm killin' it
So serious, gave the wrong young niggas money
They gave the wrong young niggas money
Gave the wrong young niggas money
Schoolin' these niggas, got so many zeros they think I'm a dummy
Unlike these other niggas, man I'm really from Atlanta
This dark-skinned art student with light-skinned advantage
I'm ahead of my time, online messiah
Who spits so much fire that you a God damned liar
If you say he ain't hot, numbers don't lie
Niggas do though, when they say he ain't cold
Niggas need to learn code, man I'm sick with the Python
Mothafucka, I'm ill, born just to die, that's the human curse
The world in my words, spit a universe
I know they hate a nigga down in Spin Mag
Worst album, best song, how you spin that?
The best part is that they love Chance
But our fans are the same, you should fuck with your man
And I wonder what they'd say if that EP drop
"His verse was wack, his verse was hot"
I'm on my jock cause I don't need these hoes
They're all the same so I don't need these clothes
Same white shirt with his nappy ass hair
Like "bitch do I look like I care?"
Nah, in the end they will notice that we've been God
I watched these niggas switch jerseys when your team lost
And yet it's bitch move nigga, make the show 6 figures
Then you fly to Kauai for a week off
And his girl's body lookin' like a centaur
They do what they can, I do what I want
Let's move it along, the point of this song
I think you doin' fine all the time, drop a fuckin' bomb, nigga Vietnam
On my mom with my hand to God
So my hand's on my fuckin' chest, but you didn't notice
Niggas hang around like we didn't notice
Niggas can't help me but they want a selfie
Cause their girl is a fan and they really love us?
Know behind closed doors
You fuck with the kid or you still not sure? Be a man about it
Don't talk your shit and shake hands about it
Be a man, I doubt it, I don't know

[Outro]
I've been grindin' my whole life

[Skit]
Can anyone live with Eartha Kitt?

That's not for me to decide. That's for someone who decides to live with me to decide. Not for me

But are you willing to compromise within a relationship?

To compromise? What is compromising? Compromising for what? Compromising for what reason? To compromise? For what? To compromise. What is compromise?

If a man came into your life, wouldn't you want to compromise?

(Hahaha) Stupid. A man comes into my life and I have to compromise? You must think about that one again. (laughs)
A man comes into my life and you have to compromise? For what? For what? For what? A relationship is a relationship that has to be earned! Not to compromise for! And I love relationships. I think they're fantastic. But one thing I think that's great I think is, nothing in the world more beautiful than falling in love. But falling in love for the right reasons. Falling in love for the right purpose. Falling in love. Falling in love. When you fall in love, what is there to compromise about?

[Verse 1]
Ise' got to make this quick
I don't want to waste time
Make it faster, stronger, deeper
Pulled out with the passion rolled out
Roll out on the red carpet
Roll out the chariot
Friar, dancing
By the fire
Singing
I'm leaving, tonight
I'm leaving tonight
I'm leaving tonight tonight
Yeah
Haven't we been here before
Haven't you heard the end of the story?
It isn't over yet
Keep patience on the left side of your brain
Virtues are relative
No pain
(Alright)

[Chorus]
Get your lady
Cop piff, inhale and cough, rip the label off this
Picked the road that got twists
I'm holding my dick and playing cautious

[Verse 1]
I'ma show you how it's done right, nigga
Drop this when the sunlight gone
Better run right home when the sky turn black
Screaming "Fuck five-O" 'til my line go flat
In a ash-gray Bimmer—we'll be callin' that the pigeon coupe
Jackknife bitches to the couches in they living rooms
Ask who the best and I doubt that they picking you
Back like how I need to style, I invented you (Yup)
Act like you don't know the name
Only time I ain't eating when the chocha stanky
Listening to "Pre," getting throat while I lane-switch
Bitches by the three licking coke off the pinky
The poster child, you're 'posed to hate me
Bold and wild, you broke and angry, my nigga
Name getting bigger than the difference between us
Niggas is fake, I limit the features I give 'em
Sweat (Sweat) shirt (Shirt)
You know you famous when the niggas that's around you switch
And if they hated in a passive tense
Now, they hound your dick, and you ain't ask for this
Now you surrounded with a gaggle of a hundred fucking thousand kids
Who you can't get mad at when they want a pound and pic
'Cause they the reason that the traffic on the browser quick
And they the reason that the paper in your trouser's thick
I said, Sweat (Sweat) shirt (Shirt)
You can tell the Reaper I'ma meet him when he send for me
With a cleaver and a 30 and some twisted weed
I pick one and let the crimson leak, nigga (Nigga)

[Hook]
Get your lady
Cop piff, inhale and cough, rip the label off this
Picked the road that got twists
I'm holding my dick and playing cautious

[Verse 2]
You used to say you like violins
And your lifestyle depend on me
And I know it's nighttime when you get lonely
And tell all your lil friends how that bitch stole me
And despite all of the facts that you got phony
You gon' tell them about the night that you exposed me for the bastard I was
And how I probably smashed every bitch that I passed in the club
And the last couple months was the worst 'cause I smashed all the trust
That I earned in the past couple months that we had as a couple
My absence of fucks was a problem that we ain't ever really get to solve
We just smashed and we scuffled
Tryna keep it calm but I snap at you
Now you're taking all your property back and it's obvious that
That, apart from the fact that we fuck, and it's bomb
Man, I hate when you home
And I— And when I'm gone, I don't call 'cause you nag
Man, I brought you the shit and I bought you some shit
What you offering here?
(Fuck you offering here?)

[Hook]
Nigga, get your lady
Cop piff, inhale and cough, rip the label off this
Picked the road that got twists
I'm holding my dick and playing cautious

[Intro]
Ooh
Your love is fading, I can feel your love fading
Girl, it's fading away from me

[Verse 1]
'Cause your touch, your touch has grown cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I've fooled myself long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man

[Chorus]
It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same
Ooh, baby, I'm losing you
It's in the air
It's everywhere
Ooh baby, I'm losing you
(Losing you)

[Verse 2]
When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face I see
I'm hurt, down-hearted and worried, girl
Cause that face doesn't belong to me

[Chorus]
Oh, it's all over your face
Someone's taken my place
Woo, ooh, baby, I'm losing you
You try hard to hide
The emptiness inside
Ooh, I can tell I'm losing you
Ooh (Losing you)
I don't wanna lose you

Ooh, I can tell when we kiss
From the tenderness I miss
Ooh, little girl, I'm losing you
Girl, I can feel it in my bones
Any day you'll be gone
Oh, baby, I'm losing you

Oh, my dear
What happened to the love we shared?
Oh, baby, I'm losing you
I know it's true
There's someone new
Oh baby, baby, baby, I'm losing you

[Intro]
Um...
Thugga Thugga, baby
Say what up?
Free bars

[Verse 1]
I'm having sex with molly (Hey, what?)
Fuck a bodyguard (Ha)

You know, you know, you know
All these motherfuckers screaming behind me I can't help but look back
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know...

[Verse 1]
You wanna be right here with the Young Thug but you can't
And I'm black but I fuck with Asia
And if you blink, you'll get a shot
Or ten letters after A, you might get that K-shot
'Cause you're too tough, I'm too rough
No crew cut but I will give your crew cuts
He used to be buff, and now he's too snuff
I used to be broke, but now I'm too up
'Cause I do stuff like fuck on hoes
And I'll fuck his ho, then she'll fuck my ho
Then they are on gold 'til I don't want no more
And I don't want no more of your bitch's hours
Bring her to the loaf and get it right back sour
And we snort it like some whiff 'til she don't know vowels
We know her name but she don't know ours
But she fuck for hours, but she fuck for hours (Eat her alive)

[Chorus]
I'm one step over you you try to knock me down I'ma shoot back
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
All these motherfuckers screaming behind me I can't help but look back
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know..

[Verse 2]
And I'ma purple syrup sipper, I get cash to my niggas and it ain't 'cause they some killers
Man I fuck with them niggas, they like y'all
No hunter, but I stay with them niggas them my dawgs
For real
If you not with us they'll get shot
Kidnap them niggas and go fuck on they wall
Big bruh just got a L so motherfuck the law
Cuz keep on talkin' shit like he forgettin' them flaws, ooh
Rent low means he got another one
Levi's they lookin' like Louis, I got the Tommy Gun
This is for the niggas with L's my brother got one
Got me wonderin' why this cracker die and he got shot one
Woah

[Chorus]
I'm one step over you you try to knock me down I'ma shoot back
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
All these motherfuckers screaming behind me I can't help but look back
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know..

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
A new disease in my town called Idiotic
Every pretty lady in my city got it, point blank
Periodically empty seats, dine at Cipriani's
Like Beyoncé, they're getting by or they get embodied
So Sasha Fierce, a whole lot of tears
Rolling down her cheeks, crying till she's sound asleep
Preach, pray that today is not a lonely one
You gotta know you not the only one

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 3: Sam Smith]
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 4/Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
We all guilty of the same crime
If you ask me, I might've had a couple women at the same time
But you handle the pressure, Jack Daniels for breakfast
A cap of valium mixed with antidepressants, precious
My momma said that we need love
Till I found out life's a bitch with no prenup, you're on your own
Divorces or court splits, decisions and choices
The Porsche or the fortress? Ignore it or forefeit

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Outro]
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, know
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 1]
Protect the wild
Tomorrow's child
Protect the land
From the greed of man

Take out the dams
Stand up to oil
Protect the plants
And renew the soil

[Chorus]
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
Who's gonna say that she's had enough?
Who's gonna take on the big machine?
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
This all starts with you and me

[Verse 2]
End fossil fuel
Draw the line
Before we build
One more pipeline
End fracking now
Let's save the waters
And build a life
For our sons and daughters

[Chorus]
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
Who's gonna say that she's had enough?
Who's gonna take on the big machine?
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
This all starts with you and me

[Verse 3]
Damn the dams
Save the rivers
Starve the takers
And feed the givers

Let's build the green
Let's save the world
We're the people
Known as Earth

[Chorus]
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
Who's gonna say that she's had enough?
Who's gonna take on the big machine?
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
This all starts with you and me!

[Childish Gambino:] speaking to Peter Rosenberg

“It’s a pop album essentially,” Childish Gambino said. “We never wanted to make a rap album. I’ve talked about this before. Rap is done. Rap is done. I love Hip Hop. I love rap, but the thing it was supposed to do it doesn’t do anymore. Like I love it as a music. It’s the same thing as like jazz. Jazz when it was doing what it was supposed to do. And people still listen to jazz now, but it doesn’t have—It’s not doing the social work it’s supposed to do anymore. And that’s not because it’s gotten bad…It’s just a different movement. Whatever movement is happening now—Like I would like to think I’m a leader of whatever movement is happening. People call it ‘new black.’ People call it whatever, but I don’t want to name it cause it’s bs to name it. As soon as it gets named that’s when you start marketing it. And it’s like ‘Ah, this is hipster.’ Cause hipster was cool until it became hipster...And then it became monetized. Same thing with Hip Hop. So, whatever this thing is. Whatever’s happening. Like whenever Jaden Smith tells me he’s like ‘I’m real excited for whatever’s happening.’ He can feel it. I can feel it.”

Later in the interview, the Stone Mountain, Georgia singer/rapper discussed the lack of “a sense of balance” between races and also addressed crooked cops

“That’s the thing,” he said. “People feel like that’s an attack on something. It’s like ‘I get it. I understand. You guys are in charge. You don’t want to lose the power. I totally get it’…I’m not hating on that. I totally understand. I get it. I’m just saying there’s got to be a sense of balance. Same thing with cops. It’s like ‘I get it. You’re putting your lives in danger also. But what am I supposed to do when a cop who’s a bad person does something? Who am I supposed to tell? I would call you guys, but at the same time I know what’s gonna happen.’”

Gambino also addressed a controversial poem he penned last month following the shooting death of 18-year-old Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In the poem, he states “I wanna be a white rapper.”

According to the singer/rapper, he wrote the poem, which he says was “about freedom,” while he was “in the moment.”

“That poem was about freedom,” Gambino said. “It really was. It was about freedom. That’s what I wrote and I—People were upset. But yeah, good. A poem should make you 

[upset]. Like when was the last time someone wrote a poem that made you feel bad like crazy? That was heart. That’s how I felt in the moment…I just wanted to write about—I wanted to show how freedom is something that’s so great when you feel it. Like I felt it. I feel it on stage…I don’t hardly remember when I’m on stage most of the time. Cause it’s like freedom.”

[Outro]
Yeah-yeah
Time to love
Said we only got time to love
Said we only got time to love
Baby

[Verse 1]
Well, life on a farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
It's early to rise, early in the sack
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well, a simple kind of life never did me no harm
A-raisin' me a family and working on the farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy

[Chorus]
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

[Verse 2]
When the work's all done and the sun's setting low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
Thank God I'm a country boy
I'd play "Sally Goodin'" all day if I could
But the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
So I fiddle when I can and I work when I should
Thank God I'm a country boy

[Chorus]
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy
Whoo

[Verse 3]
Well, I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels
I never was one of them money hungry fools
I'd rather have my fiddle and my farming tools
Thank God I'm a country boy
Yeah, city folk driving in a black limousine
A lot of sad people thinking that's a-mighty keen
Well son, let me tell you now exactly what I mean
I thank God I'm a country boy

[Chorus]
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

[Fiddle breakdown]

[Verse 4]
Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
And he took me by the hand, held me close to his side
Said, "Live a good life, play my fiddle with pride
Thank God you're a country boy."
My daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
He taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
He taught me how to love and how to give just a little
And thank God I'm a country boy

[Chorus]
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
Whoo, thank God I'm a country boy, yes!

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, with Jhené Aiko]
Said I'm all up in my feelings, doubled up on this shot
Got me feelin' some type of way
Told you I hate you, I don't mean it
And the only thing that I got
Is the pain that you've been feedin'
Faded, faded, faded, all because of you
Now my current situation
Tryin' not to think of you, not to break the rules
Why this always happens when I get this way?
Just can't stop myself

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko]
So baby, tonight
I'm blowin' up your line
I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to fight
So I'll be

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko]
I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you
Yeah, baby, I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko]
Drunk texting you
Drunk texting you
Drunk texting you
Drunk texting you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko]
I'm lookin' at my phone thinkin'
"Am I gonna hit send or nah?"
It's gonna be one of them mornings when I wake up and regret it
If I don't get no reply
I don't wanna make it obvious that I'm faded, faded, faded off a drink or two
And you know how it goes, this ain't nothin' new
Why's it always happen when I get this way?
No, I just can't stop myself

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko, Chris Brown]
So baby, tonight (Yeah)
I'm blowin' up your line (Oh yeah)
I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to fight
So I'll be (I'll be)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko, Chris Brown]
I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you (Hey)
Drunk texting, drunk texting you
Yeah, baby, I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you (Girl, I'm drunk textin')
Drunk texting, drunk texting you (Oh-oh)

[Bridge: Chris Brown, Jhené Aiko & Both]
Intoxicated, intoxicated
That's when I think of you the most
But after the toast, anything goes
When I put my pride aside
I'll be doing the most, doing the most
I done spent 1, 2, 3 AM, thinkin' about you
Don't wanna be without you 'cause I'm on that liquid courage
I hope this shit is worth it 'cause if it ain't then it's all bad, all bad

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko, Chris Brown]
So baby, tonight
I'm blowin' up your line (I'm blowin' up your phone)
I got you on my mind (Whoa-oh)
And the truth is hard to fight (Yeah)
So I'll be (I'll be)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko, Chris Brown]
I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you (Ooh-ooh)
Drunk texting, drunk texting you
Yeah, baby, I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you ('Cause I'm fucked up right now)
Drunk texting, drunk texting you

[Outro: Chris Brown, with Jhené Aiko]
If by chance you're layin' next to someone else right now
Girl, I
I-I-I hope it's the worst sex ever
Yeah, yeah
Hope it's the worst sex ever
MUSIC CUE: MINE

I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oooh
Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far

[Background Vocals: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup
On my mind up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is, we should get married
We should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

Babe

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
It don't get no better than my tongue writing you letters, babe
Feeling you get wetter, we'll be making love until the morning after
And I can feel your tide slowly rising as I'm sipping from your water fountain
We gon' flood the bed, take it to the ground
While I'm in your ocean baby, hold my head down, down (Oh)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & R. Kelly]
I wanna drown in it, drown in it
Yeah, babe
Drown in it, drown in it
Just take me under, oh

Under your waters, girl
Drown in it, drown in it
I won't ever come up, oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
High heels and your red lips (Hey-y-y-y-y-y)
It's Fahrenheit in here (Ayy)
And I can see a million ways for me to surfboard between your waves
Girl, we be going up down, all around, drip drop, don't stop
No umbrella, playing in your rain
Shawty, I'll be splashing in your deep end
Hydrate me, oh baby, come sit that right on my face

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I wanna drown in it, drown in it
Drown in it, drown in it
Oh, just take me under, girl

No price compares to what it's worth, babe
And your pool is like Heaven on Earth, baby
You screaming while I'm touching your spot
Oh, girl, I got your waters so hot
And I wanna drown in it
I wanna drown in it, babe

All you gotta do is keep filling me up with your juices
Keep it right there baby, don't lose it (Ayy-y)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, R. Kelly & Both]

Swim in your deep, babe

All up in your creek, baby

And I'm not coming up, baby
I wanna drown in it, drown in it
Gonna stay right there, baby
Drown in it, drown in it
Gonna live in there, baby
I wanna drown in it, drown in it
Right there under your water, baby
Drown in it, drown in it

[Outro: R. Kelly & Chris Brown]
Yeah, yeah
I stay thirsty, babe
Yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I don't know why I even try 'cause you don't want this no more
I would rather leave before I hurt you
And I would have died long ago if I ain't have my faith
I see you're startin' to hate me, I see it in your face
My home don't feel like home
Just like my heart is empty
You change the number on your phone
So when I call, you ain't gotta listen

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
And all your girls think that I ain't shit
And they the same ones lost in the club, them bitches is basic
Now I'm number one that's lost in love, I can't take it
I'm on a knee, you're gonna see a grown man cry, I won't lie

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm startin' to hate me
A little more and more each day
I don't know me
It's like I can't get out of my own way
And you don't love me
You don't love me
If I knew better
I would do it better

[Verse 2: Brandy]
Lookin' at the names on your list and I can't find me
I'm deep underwater, are you gon' let me drown?
I see you're happy now, you're the life of the party, actin' out
Ain't seen you in months, you ain't call me once

[Pre-Chorus: Brandy]
And all your boys say that I ain't shit
And they the same ones lost in the club, niggas is basic
Yeah, and I'm the one who lost in love and I can't take it
I'm on my knees, don't you hate to see me cry? I won't lie

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Brandy & Both]
I'm startin' to hate me (Ayy)
A little more and more each day
I don't know me
It's like I can't get out of my own way
And you don't love me
You don't love me (Oh)
If I knew better, yeah-yeah
I would do it better, better

[Bridge: Chris Brown, Brandy & Both]
Thinkin' 'bout you and I, thinkin' 'bout you and I
My heart's beating in slow motion, knowin' that it's over
Thoughts got me thinkin' 'bout suicide, baby, this is do or die
When you told me it's over, ain't no point in being sober
All I wanna do is fade away, fade away
I hope that God will forgive me
'Cause I know that you ain't gon' miss me
Baby girl, I won't try to say my goodbyes
You ain't gotta shed a tear for me, baby girl, don't cry

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Brandy & Both]
I'm startin' to hate me
A little more and more each day
I don't know me
It's like I can't get out of my own way
And you do't love me (Oh-oh)
You don't love me (Oh-oh)
If I knew better
I would do it better

[Outro: Chris Brown, Brandy & Both]
I would do better, I would do better
I would do better, I would do better
I would do better, I would do better
I would do better, I would do better
I would do better

AnonXmous

[Verse 1]
You love another man
My heart is broken in two
She wears a ring on the other hand
She's scared to tell me the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
But, if you are leaving, oh
I want you to know that
I shoulda loved you way more, way more
So if this is the end of us now

[Chorus]
I'll see you 'round
I'll see you 'round, around
You mean more to me than anything
And it hurts 'cause you don't love me
No, no, no, no
So I just wanna see you happy

[Verse 2]
Now that you are comfortable, I think that I am losing my mind
It's crazy 'cause we were so inseparable, guess things change with time
Oh, does he kiss and wipe away your tears?
Does he tell you that there's nothing to fear?
Oh-oh, if I had a wishing well, I would have you right here

[Pre-Chorus]
So girl, if you are leaving, oh
Baby, I want you to know that
I should've loved you way more, way more
So if this is the end of us now

[Chorus]
I'll see you 'round
I'll see you 'round, around
You mean more to me than anything
And it hurts 'cause you don't love me
No, no, no, no
So I just wanna see you happy

[Outro]
I didn't listen, you went missing, he has your heart now
I'm missing your kisses, want it again, don't leave me down
Wish I could keep you all to myself, I wanna work it out
But you moved on, I see it now
Oh-oh, guess I'll see you 'round

Dream, when you're feelin' blue
Dream, that's the thing to do

Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So, dream when the day is through
Dream, and they might come true

Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream

Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Got a choppa for the narcos
Sniper rifle with the goggles
I'll throw a nigga in the gulf of mexico
??? lo ago
Gotta fire arm on me now
I'm the type to gun a nigga down
Shoot you in the street like a dog
Bury you in the ground like a hound
Guwap don't fuck around
Kill a nigga ass out of town
Y'all fuck niggas talking out loud
But I don't hear you sayin' shit now
When the Mac 10 go like pow, pow!
I'ma hear a nigga say ow, ow!
And when his mama looking for him when the body not found
And the head in the lost and found
New Orleans voice, nigga what's around?
Got a 30 round clip, nigga what's a round?
Like a jersey nigga like what's up son?
But I'm a down south nigga with a big ol' gun
I'm on the west coast, me and snoop lion
If I'm lying nigga then I'm damn flying
Talking fly shit like forty water
Damn you got a pretty daughter
In the mid-west like ??
Sixteen year old girl, R Kelly virgin
But these little girls super clean and dirty
And a kid might think that its dish detergent
My niggas so trick they might frisk a person
My bullets so big might miss a person
Put a pistol on nigga like pitch perfect
Red shirt the same color as my Falcon Jersey

Got a choppa for the narcos

[Intro]
Hey, back in, ah
Baby, come on

[Verse 1]
Are you back in Greenwich, droppin' acid?
Are you at the Archive, watchin' television?
Did you leave for Battery with your weed?
And your leather, lookin' like Ray Gillen?
Are you still the king of rock 'n' roll, babe?
Bet you miss hearin' me sing, calling me Lana
And did you take your run today
Along that West Side Highway?
Do you miss your baby mama?
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never come back to me?

[Verse 2]
Does it feel like yesterday to you, yet?
How quickly you forget how I made you smile
I remember everything
The diamond horseshoe, wedding ring, and the tiara
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never return to me?
If the nightingales could sing like you
They'd sing much sweeter than they do
For you brought a new kind of love to me

And if the sandman brought me dreams of you
I'd want to sleep my whole life through
You brought a new love to me

I know that I'm the slave, you're the queen
Still you can understand that underneath it all
You're a maid and I am only a man

I would work and slave the whole day through
If I could hurry home to you
You brought a new kind of love to me

[Intro: Big Sean]
Uh-huh

(Mustard on the beat, ho) I don't fuck wit' you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't

Fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, uh

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic (Woah)
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick
Brr brr, I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, "I don't fuck wit'-
Chu, bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill, yeah
And every day I wake up celebratin' shit, why?
‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch, I
Stuck to my guns (Woah,) that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here, that's what made me this (This)
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on (Swerve)
And then another one text (Swerve, swerve,) then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like—

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't fuck wit' you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus: Big Sean, E-40]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I don't give a (E-40)
Fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do (Hawoo)
I don't give a fuck, uh

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online, limited amount of time
Chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich (Hella rich)
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio (Arsenio)
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless (Uh,) you might end up domeless (Uh)
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty (Mmm)
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth (Pour up)
Why you always comin' around with bad news? (Bad news)
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose (Hope I lose)
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew (Crew,) but them niggas cool (Cool)
It's just that—

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean, E-40]
I don't fuck wit' you (Lil' biatch)
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu (Uh-uh)
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus (Extended): Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I don't give a
Fuck about you, or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do (You)
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I don't give a
Fuck about you, or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for (God)
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for (Swerve, swerve, swerve)
Yeah, I got a lot, but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor (Floor)
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up (Uh)
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up (Uh)
That shit can break ya down, if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up (Yup)
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious (Woah,) feel me
When you get a fine bitch, just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma too real, so I hope you doin' cool
But still—

[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
No, no, no, no
Little stupid ass, I ain't fuckin' wit' (Woah)
I ain't fuckin', I ain't, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu (Woah)
I ain't fuckin' wit'chu, ha
Straight up, yeah, yeah
Woah

[Chorus]
I always wanted to stunt so hard (Yeah,) I always wanted to ride that whip (Always)
I always wanted to fuck that bitch (I always,) thank you, God, I fucked that bitch (God)
I always wanted to live this life (Life,) I always wanted to wear that ice (All this ice)
I always wanted paradise, I always wanted paradise, look

[Post-Chorus]
Now it don't take a lot to make you rich (To make you rich)
I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit (I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit)
But I feel like money is the best drug (Best drug)
Sometimes hate can be the best love

[Verse 1]
Walkin' in like I got cameras on me, niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie, got a pretty young girl, look like Janet on me (Word)
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers ‘til we crash up the whole database (Word)
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base (Yeah,) closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes (Yeah)
What you think this life just landed on me? My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homes (Yeah,) every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances, back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic, even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie, I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie, making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed, so fuck is my ransom, homie?

[Pre-Chorus]
Money bag, money bag, money bag
Money bag, money bag, money bag (Yeah)
Money bag, money bag, money bag
Money bag, money bag, money bag (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I always wanted to stunt so hard (Yeah,) I always wanted to ride that whip (Always)
I always wanted to fuck that bitch (I always,) thank you, God, I fucked that bitch (God)

Ear Drummers
Oh damn, damn
Mike WiLL—Mike WiLL

[Verse 2]
Aw damn, I'm illuminated, man, I knew I’d make it and I get that shit accumulatin’ (Accumulatin’)
Never throwing money out, I boomerang it, finally famous over everything, that's a numerator, weed lit, yeah, it's luminated
Room lookin' like it's fumigated, bitch, my crew invaded, when I walk in, man, they body to body
Hol' up everybody, don't worry, man, I got it, I got it, I need a hundred dollar bill, photocopy the email and copy
Man, I'm going hard all season, these hoes goin' both ways, offense, defense
Livin' life on the deep end, F-F allegiance, beat the odds and got even
What you think, that we just started, nigga? Boy, the sword just got sharpened, nigga
This ain't war, we just sparring, nigga, I was on the rooftop with my nigga Mike Carson, nigga
Shootin' that "Too Fake" video, my nigga, we all in, we set ourselves apart from all our apartments
Was up in Florida, no Marlins, nigga, I'm that Sean, no Marlon, nigga, uh
Look at my girl nigga, fuck yo' bae list, fuck yo' night list, fuck yo' day list, fuck yo' playlist
I'm from the D, fuck your A-list, I been working eight days a week, I don't even know what the fuck today is
I hit the booth and I just went Super Saiyan, I run with the purp like I play with the Ravens
These bitches rant and rave, I hope I never have to go back watching Everybody Loves Raymond
Eating ramen, nigga, this paradise, life's a fucking paradox and pair of dice
If they not rolling with you, then they parasites, nigga, I had that vision, it was ClearSight, nigga, Sean Don

[Intro]
I look up
Straight up
I gave 'em time, time
Time

[Verse 1]
Now it's back to me nigga
I took my clique turned it to faculty nigga
Took my operation to factory nigga
When I'm in the zone they won't tackle me nigga
I touched down in the city, a fuckin' walkin' target
Still man all my bitches miss me, yeah they miss me but not misses
If you ask me what my interest, all my interest involve interest
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off but you can't cut my percentage (No no)
With the bases loaded all we need's a hit, boy I'ma still swing for the fences (Gone)
I guess you tend to over do it when you come up underprivileged, look
I came to my senses, I can never count on people
I can't even trust the senses in this world full of venom
All I need's my spider senses, my short temper to cool out
Yeah sometimes I need woosah, time to get paid by the goo-ghaas
My office on top of that rooftop, for my mama Myra Anderson
Tell me who gon' be set for life, Myra and her son, fo' sure
One time for the fam, they don't eat, I don't eat
I can't rest on my feet till they all on they feet
They say rest your eyes, I'm just like why?
Bitch I ain't never seen Ben Frank asleep
But I do need that paper like sheet after sheet
I got so much drive ho, look both ways in the streets
When I heard 'bout all these singers and all they naked pictures I'm like "Did my email just leak?"

[Interlude]
Hol' up
Lemme check, oh nah nah nah
They fake, we good, we good

[Verse 2]
The stock goin' up, makin' all the right moves
Boy you would have thought I got tipped off (Tipped off)
You would have thought these niggas fell off a skateboard
The way they take these hoes and trick off (Trick off)
I got a rich girl, I swear to god dawg, man she's like a walkin' ATM
Except she ain't come in with drawls
I know you've been having G.O.O.D. Music withdrawls
I can not deal with the fuckery that fake shit you be in
All that bullshit that you rappin' honestly just makes me cringe
Money doesn't grow on trees, okay someone explain to me
Then how the hell does my whole team just keep on rakin' it all in, hah?
We stressed on, we pressed on
Met with Hov and Bey they told us we next on
We dream that, been slept on, we kept on, we left home
Mama earlobes is VS stone
Her earrings so big she can't even fuckin' hear nothing nigga
Don't give a fuck, no I can't spare one nigga
No I do not have five wheels, I can't spare one nigga
Talkin' like I'm on the last cigarette because I had to take it back to square one nigga
Sometimes to win the war man you got to lose a battle
But if I lose a girl just know my next one gonna be badder
When I pulled up to the church, ooo, they thought it was the pastor
Heaven sent, raisin' hell, same time, what that's the rapture?
Didn't go to class for a second I swear I woulda failed everything
My passport was the only thing I'm passin', flyin' overseas turnin' dreams into habits
Turnin' coach to first classes, mom I'm never movin' back
And I put six years in the flow, okay, no wonder it got mastered
The flow need a dam, why it's doin' too much damage
God damn it's good to get it, even better with ya niggas
Call up my dog who been in and out depression
Said boy how you living, don't lie to me 'bout your feelings
On the outside you look fine but on the inside could be killin'
You act like a comedian but now you're Robin Williams
And now we cryin' rivers that nobody wants to swim in
When one phone call coulda been the one to prevent it
So I'm there for my dogs till we forever on
Till we hit the dealership and cop the Megazord
Nigga that's the red range, white range, black range, green range, pink range
Yellow range, blue range, every neck comes with a few chains (Ohh shit)
I learned that every bad bitch comes with mood swings
Just like Mortal Kombat, Liu Kang, so true man
G-5 down to Mexico, G.O.O.D. Music familiar man
We back at it to let you know, I figure it's best you know
In the middle of recordin' we got caught up in the news
About what happened in St. Louis
We midwest kids that shit coulda happened to us
I looked up the flight tonight
Then I realized man I got a grandma now that's half alive
And honestly what happened in St. Louis probably happened in Detroit like twenty times
I hope we finally see the signs
Puttin' gas off in my Benzo, I ran into a youngin'
The same age as me except he in the trash huntin'
Asked me for some change I gave him like one somethin'
Man to keep that shit a hunnid I wish I woulda gave a hunnid
Cause if you ask me how I'm doin', shit you could do the math
I just bought a five bedroom, four bath
Three story, two car garage, I'm one man
I just did it for my mom, finna do it for my dad
And I ain't even sell my soul, imagine what I coulda got for that
I made something out of nothing, it's like I pulled it out a hat
Man when I'm done they gonna statue me, I turned my clique faculty
Operations to factory, in my zone they won't tackle me
Touched down in the city, the fuckin' walkin' target
Still all my bitches miss me,  yeah they miss me but not misses
If you ask me what's my interest, all my interest involve interest
Nigga
Straight up

[Verse 1]
Ho, I got my cell phone ringin', nowadays it's hard to get me
Nine times out of ten, if you ballin' then you busy
Sippin' Henney, sippin' Rémy like it's Chrissy
And I pop that champagne like it's my birthday, really it's a Wednesday
All about the benjis, I've been gone all year
Came back, I swear you niggas ain't done moved an inch or centi
Mind movin' like a semi, pop pop pop, the truth is
I feel like masseuses when I back off in this bitch, I feel the tension
Ho, you've got your hand out, what that mean, like gimmie?
What you need your ass, a penny? Better off askin' for kidneys
I know thug ass niggas that'll run in your house
You lock the door, you lock the window, they gon' come down the chimney
Skinny nigga but I walk inside this bitch like Dikimbe
I'm the Laurent St., I keep a angel face with me
You got your hand out, ho, again, what that mean, like gimme?
What you need you, a penny? Better off askin' for kidneys
If a bitch don’t suck my dick, I swear that shit just offend me
Ho, I'm really from Detroit, I went to Cass and not Renni
Actin' like you can't die tonight, what, you gon' come back like Kenny?
I roll up spazzin' like Timmy, hand is attached to the benjis

[Hook x2]
Atta-tached to the benjis, not attached to these feelings
I don't love these hoes, I'd rather fuck me a million, I mean it
If I said it, I mean it

If I said it, I mean it
If I said it, I mean it

[Verse 2]
Nigga, I be the most imitated, my crib renovated
My old bitch assessin', my new bitch is waitin'
Just like a doctor with my operation
I got me my check-up but still got no patience
All of these texts and calls I'm not takin'
My phone overflowin', that shit can get drainin'
I signed up with Ye, and he just explained it
How we gotta get it like Jay-Z and Damon
Did back in the year that they came in
Stuck between a ROC and the G.O.O.D. place is where I'm remainin'
Bitch, it's finally famous
What you do in a day I could do before breakfast
Young nigga T-rexing
My old bitch wish that she would've got pregnant
Tryna be the first lady because my wrist just won a presidential election
Bitch, and I hope you offended
I said it, I meant it, I hope that recorded
I just broke a Guinness
I flew in from Italy through the Pacific
Shout out to Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Scott Disick
When you see my pretty face, shut the fuck up and kiss it
And just know that my hands

[Hook x2]

If I said it, I mean it
If I said it, I mean it

[Outro]
It's goin' down, down in the earliest round
And baby, we'll be goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
I've got a loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
It's goin' down, down in the earliest round
And baby, we'll be goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
I've got the safety off, cocked back, ready to pull it
Cameraman and spectators: "Nerdy Chris, what it go, how it go? How it go Nerdy Chris?" "Let's go Nerdy Chris"
Chris Brown: "Ok, line for line"
Lupe Fiasco: "Why you gotta a singer on a rapper?"
Chris Brown: "It's breezy, Grandma on shwayze"

[Chris points to Lupe to start freestyling]

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, yeah, Get my flavor flav on
A clock on my chest, No Glock on my hip
Got rims on my whip, the rims on my whip
Got Tims on my feet, Never
Too clever forever, for any MC
I'll will beat any competitor
Rippin to live and hold it down
Man, Christopher Brown

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I'm in the town, I'm flickin-flickin flows
But I don't care about which any meany-miny-ho
I want to get to know
I'm trying to get the diddy
So I can take the teleo, and do the show
I rock, I rap, I rickity-diggity-ickity rap
But I do my own thing, and he's still a mack

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
And the sniggy-sniggy snap, and we live in the Chi
And we do it from the bottom to the top
To the tippy on my tippy-toes
Many flows spittin
When I rip into conditions, it's critical
When I be flippin, spittin introductions
Everybody's bustin, No we still hustlin
No need for introduction, percussions
Concussion you will receive when you leave
From me like Christopher Reeve

[Bridge: Gucci Mane]
Three bands
I'll send it to your front doorstep

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shooting dice in the laundromat
Gangsters back
Fuck nigga I'm shooting back
Bad bitch with me
And you know her ass is fat
Boksburg pussy nigga
I'm parking that
Bricksquad Monopoly(Squad!)
Shawty that's my company
I'm buying property
Bitch I'm from the corner niggaknowlogy
14 years old
Bet that young nigga kill for me

[Verse: Gucci Mane]
Real nigga handle business
Benz with the tented windows
Bricksquad CEO
Rolex presidential
All my verses monumental
I'm a legendary nigga
Canary yellow diamond bracelet
Try to rob, I'll kill a nigga
Latino plug
Don't speak no English
When we talk
We use a finger
Jumping like it's Blake Griffin
You can say I'm water whipping
In my Rolls Royce riding
Looking for some competition
When it comes to confrontation
Empty all the ammunition
Balling out
You penny pinching
Cooking dope in momma's kitchen
Hide the bales off in the ceiling
Vacuum seal a half-a-milli
Thousand pounds of midget dick
Fuck it I'm just reminiscing
Million dollars worth of cap
Two days I'm a damn magician

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shooting dice in the laundromat
Gangsters back
Fuck nigga I'm shooting back
Bad bitch with me
And you know her ass is fat
Boksburg pussy nigga
I'm parking that
Bricksquad Monopoly(Squad!)
Shawty that's my company
I'm buying property
Bitch I'm from the corner niggaknowlogy
14 years old
Bet that young nigga kill for me

[Verse]:
I said abracadabra and hocus pocus
Then the top disappeared and I went to Strokers
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, I'm not no local joker
But I'm locally invested in Coca-Cola
I'm made a bonafide business off baking soda
Give you one more summer then I'm taking over
I got 100 pounds of loud, you can smell the odor
I got the thangs for 45 but don't tell 'em I told you
I'm a Bricksquad soldier, I thought I told you
Mr. Ice Cream Man, I'm smoking doja
Pull to the thang in a brand new testarossa
Then walked in the club and set off an explosion

[Intro]:
808, 1017, Purps on the beat

[Verse 1]:
I'm trying to sell it to you cheap nigga, dirt cheap
You know I sell dope in my sleep, but I don't sleep
You know I sell codeine that lean for a good number
And I got white squares of that clean and that green ganja
I got that shit that make a fiend have extreme hunger
Look like she 50, but I swear she like 10 years younger
These 'sace shades on me and now I feel like Stevie Wonder
But when you go to jail to them your just another number
I called this bitch from jail and made she changed the fucking number

[?]

I got your bitch with me and guess what man I'm about to fuck her

Got her sippin' on the sake, tryna pull it out the socket, uh
Pull her hair like it's tug-o-war (Yeah)

You look good standin' next to me (Next to me)
There ain't enough room, we need to get a suite (Get a suite)
And if my momma had another child (Child)
Then she would've had an extra G
Fuck that, flip that, that soul (Oh)
She need a pole by the stove (Stove)
She cookin' eggs and she twerkin'
You might just think I'm perverted
But she ain't got on no clothes, Hootie Hoo (Uh)
Exit the club to the Trump
And her back is so fat you can see from the front
And I walk in, this bitch smellin' like joints, uh

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx & 2 Chainz]
I don't wanna hold your hand (I don't wanna hold your hand)
Girl tonight I got other plans (Not tonight)
I just want to see you throw it back
Back on me and let me see if I can catch all of that

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
The party ain't a party 'til I get up in the party

[Outro]
Wait a minute

[Hook]
And I'm ridin' wit a body on the shotty
Stretch a nigga out like Pilates
Catch a nigga outside his hidey
Snatch all the honey from your honey comb, now the bees keep flyin' by me
I'm on that piff that pody
That shit, smokin' like Vladi, spendin' dough from the 90's
Shinin', P-90, in the liming
I'm timing, don't time me mu'fucka

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm a, young ass piranha
Don't get caught in that water cause I'm waitin' for a drowner
And on the corner I got packs on the counter
Before ya bitch leave I make Young Mob count em
Tryin' to get a dollar i could turn into a thousand
I'm so determined its a economic problem, drama
That's why I carry the llama
Ready at any given day to bury my honor
Love weed so much i tried to marry Juana
So pass the pastrami and asparagus mama, I'm watchin'
Cause in my area
If you got bread you better break it off share in here
I got his ankles, and his stereo
Cause i could get a cool buck fifty for that and the body yo, that's Hollygrove
It's Hollygrove til I adios
I gotta go, gotta go, got more bags to dope, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Hot boy Wayne
Since the beginning I've been in and out of some shit
Thinnin' out the thick
Living out the script, for the role that was chosen
But I don't want an award, I'm tryin' to afford
Back to the road in a Honda Accord
The whole right side slam down with that braw
A city supply the city get high, like
If I was Clear I woulda touched Claudette
I'm so fresh, like sex in the sheets
But I'm from the dirty dirty, like sex on the beach
The checks on my Nikes they match my carneesh
The button up shirt match my button seats
The AK-47 match my fuckin' heat
Watch your fuckin' feet cause I'm hot in the streets
A quarter thing is how i got in the streets
I had money ever since that week, young Weezy!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
17 gangsta, Hollygrove solider
Got a lil money, got a lot more colder
My top don't roll up, it fold up
My money don't fold up, it build up
You niggas ain't fly, get your gear up
Copped my bitch the Mark Jacob boots, and the ear muffs
Got her lookin' like Kamora or somethin
Brought Kamora to the South now Kamora stuntin'
Yeah we big business pimpin', chyea
Walkin' wit a limp, talkin' with a slur
Barkin' at ya' bitch, bet her pussy cat purr
She all on mine, she ain't lookin' at yours
And if a man trip he get the blit bla blat blurr
Credit Wayne for bringin' the hood back first, chyea........chyea
Credit Wayne for bringin' the hood back first! Chyea

[Hook]

[Outro]
Muhhhh Fukka Wizzle!

[Intro]
Baby, I'm so glad you're over here
Now I get to show you all the things
That I been wanting to show you for such a long time
Don't say nothing

[Verse 1]
Picture this you and me in the kitchen babe, on the counter
Feeding each other fruits babe
Straight from there walk into the bedroom babe
I touch your hair and then you turn around and say what's on your mind
And girl, tonight we'll be making sweet love

[Chorus]
Girl, tonight we'll make sweet love
Until the rain comes falling down on you and me
All of these things and etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
Wanna kiss you places you want me to
Promise, girl, that I'll do all of these things
And etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
(Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 2]
Doing you pretty much all night long babe
'Till I hear you screaming my name babe
In the pool you and me skinny dipping darlin'
Kelly's rules, no playing hard to get
Now tell me what the deal cause
Girl tonight we'll be making sweet love

[Chorus]
Girl, tonight we'll make sweet love
Until the rain comes falling down on you and me
All of these things and etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
Wanna kiss you places you want me to
Promise, girl, that I'll do all of these things
And etcetera, etcetera, etcetera

[Verse 3]
Put on some clothes and let's go to the IHOP, baby
(Let's go to the IHOP babe)
No, no, no (Baby we just made love)
No matter how good the food may taste
(No matter how the food may taste)
I'm still thinking about your body baby, yes I am
(It's your body I'm thinking of)

[Chorus]
Girl, tonight we'll make sweet love
Until the rain comes falling down on you and me
All of these things and etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
Wanna kiss you places you want me to
Promise, girl, that I'll do all of these things
And etcetera, etcetera, etcetera

[Verse 1]
How did I ever let you slip away
Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more
Ever since you closed the door

[Chorus]
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darling you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darling you, you'd still be mine

[Verse 2]
Funny, funny how time goes by
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye
Why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering
When every day I pray please come back to me

[Chorus]
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darling you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darling you, you'd still be mine

[Verse 3]
And you had enough love for the both of us
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa

[Chorus]
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darling you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darling you, you'd still be mine
Oh I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)
Never do you wrong (If I could turn back)
And never leave your side (If I could turn back)
If I could turn back the hands
There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you (If I could turn back)
Forever honest and true to you (If I could turn back)
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you (If I could turn back the hands)
(If I could turn back)
Oh oh, that would be my will
(If I could turn back)
Darling I'm begging you to take me by the hands
(If I could turn back the hands)
I'm going down, yes I am
(If I could turn back)
Down on my bended knee, yeah
(If I could turn back)
And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me
(If I could turn back the hands) Oh oh oh
(If I could turn back)
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall
(If I could turn back)
Then I'd come to realize how much I love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
(If I could turn back the hands, If I could turn back the hands)
(oh oh oh oh)

[Chorus]
(!Franchesckaar!) They all love you
(!Franchesckaar!) They all want you
(!Franchesckaar!) Of course they do
(!Franchesckaar!) Oh yes, it's true
(!Franchesckaar!) They love your skin
(!Franchesckaar!) They want your hair
(!Franchesckaar!) They want your eyes
(!Franchesckaar!) I tell no lies

[Verse 1]
Jack Wills, clipped hair, penciled eyes, you get attention
Tight shirt, straight teeth, pinned up smile, all of them mention
How you look nice, tip-top, beautiful, the cat's pajamas
Suntan, golden brown, where you been? To the Bahamas?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but you can't see it, babe
Oh, you just see through it all
Oh, the girls turn green when they see you
'Cause all of the boys start to call

[Chorus]
(!Franchesckaar!) They all love you
(!Franchesckaar!) They all want you
(!Franchesckaar!) Of course they do
(!Franchesckaar!) Oh yes, it's true
(!Franchesckaar!) They love your skin
(!Franchesckaar!) They want your hair
(!Franchesckaar!) They want your eyes
(!Franchesckaar!) I tell no lies

[Verse 2]
You've got your blue eyes, pink lips, Ugg boots, and lots of passion
Acoustic, iPod, soft sounds, music fashion
Sloan style, neck scarves, clingy friends all around you
You're the icon, shine out, watch what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but you can't feel it, babe
The effect you have on all of them
Oh, everyone stops and stares
And then the boys begin to call

[Chorus]
(!Franchesckaar!) They all love you
(!Franchesckaar!) They all want you
(!Franchesckaar!) Of course they do
(!Franchesckaar!) Oh yes, it's true
(!Franchesckaar!) They love your skin

[Bridge]
'Cause they want you and they need you
And they love you and they crave you
'Cause they want you and they need you
And they love you, love you
(!Franchesckaar!) They love you, yeah, yeah, they love you
(!Franchesckaar!) They want you, yeah, yeah, they want you
(!Franchesckaar!) They want your skin, your hair, your eyes
(!Franchesckaar!) I don't tell no lies, no

[Chorus]
(!Franchesckaar!) They all love you

[Intro]
You see, the thing about her
She's just a bit too young, I think, personally
I don't really think she's ready for this kind of commitment yet
But whatever, you know what I mean?
It's your life, isn't it?
Bitch

[Verse 1]
When you first walked in the room, I had this feeling
You were gonna build me up then slowly tear me down
But then I looked behind the framework
And all of the glitz and gleams in your eyes (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause you're just a bad, bad girl with no brains inside your head (No)
Keep givin' it all this talkin' like you know it, but you don't know shit
'Cause people cringe when you tell 'em a crazy fact (Ha ha)
The way the words pour out don't make you sound all that

[Chorus]
'Cause Lucy, no one wants you here
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (No, they don't, no)
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (Ha ha ha)
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
The way you were slagging me off before you even met me
With your preppy ex-boyfriend, that just weren't too wise
The way I caught you whisperin' and lookin' me up and down
Subtlety is clearly not your game

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're a mixed up girl with no real friends in life
You get mouthy in a second, but pipe down, it don't work on me
'Cause people laugh when you get mad (Ha ha)
Tellin' people how to run their lives is really quite sad (Yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause Lucy, no one wants you here (No, they don't, nope)
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (No, they don't, no)
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (Oh, yeah)
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (Yeah)

[Bridge]
I'll do what I want, get out of my way
Don't just stand there, say what you want to say (Move)
Get out of my face (Move), 'cause you got it wrong (Ugh)
Just move along now on your own (Get out of here)
Don't get on my nerves (Yeah), I've got my contacts (Get out of my way)
Don't try and control me 'cause you'll get knocked back
Back into your place, right where you belong
Lucy, take a good listen to this song (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Lucy, no one wants you here (No, they don't, no one wants you, just go)
Lucy, no one wants you here (No, they don't want you)
Lucy, no one wants you here (She doesn't want you, I don't want you, just go)
Yeah, Lucy, no one wants you here (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, Lucy, no one wants you here (Just leave me alone, go away)
Lucy, no one wants you here (No, they don't want you)
Lucy, no one wants you here
Yeah, Lucy, no one wants you here (Yeah, ha ha ha)

[Verse 1]
It was twenty-five past nine at night and I was really bored
So I sat down with my guitar, but I needed some new chords
I spoke to my good friend called Chas, he was an indie boy
With skinny jeans and vintage shoes and hair all over the shop

[Chorus]
And he said, "Oh girl, just use a good chord combination
That will make the boys go goo-goo eyed
And give them inspiration, honey
You need a sweet and simple melody that you can sing along to
An indie tune that'll make the girls swoon
That a raver boy can dance to"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I said, "It sounds okay"
He said, "Of course it does, you're a magician on guitar"
I said, "thank you, love
I'm not that great and I wouldn't go that far"
I've got this friend called Paul and his brain ain't small
He played the violin
But now he's a rocker, a leather jacket shocker
I wish I could play like him

[Chorus]
He said, "Oh girl, just use a good chord combination
That will make the boys go goo-goo eyed
And give them inspiration, honey
You need a sweet and simple melody that you can sing along to
An indie tune that'll make the girls swoon
When a raver boy asks for a dance"
For a dance, for a dance

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
And he said, "Oh girl, just use a good chord combination
That will make the boys go goo-goo eyed
And give them inspiration, honey
You need a sweet and simple melody that you can sing along to
An indie tune that'll make the girls swoon
That a raver boy can dance to"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Now is the time
We've both crossed the line
It's been way too long
And now we both see
How we can really be

[Verse 2]
And I see your face
And it reflects mine
Except mine isn't stained
With teardrops and lines
'Cause like you
Our friendship has withered

[Chorus]
Quick, go away for a long time
Before I change my mind
If you stay, I'll only want more of you
So get out of my face
Get off of my doorstep and leave me, yeah
To cry on the inside

[Verse 3]
Well I'll call you again to see if we're friends
But I think we both know that our friendship
Cannot continue
Well I'll say that I'm fine and just wait for the time
Till I know that I can live up to your expectations

[Chorus]
Quick, go away for a long time
Before I change my mind
If you stay, I'll only want more of you
Get out of my face
Get off of my doorstep and leave me, yeah
To cry on the inside, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
I didn't love you, but oh, when I'm not with you
I can't help but want you, you so bad
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Quick, go away for a long time
Before I change my mind
If you stay, I'll only want more of you
So get out of my face
Get off of my doorstep and leave me, yeah
To cry on the inside
Wake up one morning and your hair's all over the shop
What happened last night?
Well, the only person who knows is the person lying next to you
Get out of the bed, and you scream at your reflection
Same old, same old, it's just a typical day, it's going ahead again

But oh, boy, why don't you get some variation
Oh, boy, just have a retaliation
Oh, boy, just get some motivation
'Cause your friends are all out getting drunk
Whilst you're sitting at home having no fun

Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride
Why don't we go for a ride?
Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride

Backcomb your hair
Tie up your shoes
We're gonna go to town
Come on, take the camera, you got nothing to lose
Scream and shout, all your friends do it too
Come on, what you waiting for?
I told you before, you got nothing to lose

Oh, boy, you're seeming so much better
Since I posted you on your red letter day
Oh, boy, you know all the girls are jealous of you
And they're polishing their pumps with the ra-ra skirts and the polka-dots
Just to try to impress you

Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride
Why don't we go for a ride?
Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride

Oh now, you're getting too good for me
Oh now, you're getting too good for me
Oh now, you're getting too good for me

Stealing all my limelight and my backstage passes
But then you say

'Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride
Why don't we go for a ride?
Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride
Oh

[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh, la-da-da-da
I sit up in my room at night
Hold on to my pillow tight
My dreams are being invaded by something I don't know

[Verse 1]
I hear these words in my mind
I don't know who put them there, but they sure ain't mine
Who's inside everyone's brain?
Cause recently everybody's been acting all the same
But now I know

[Chorus]
Who writes the songs?
The machines do
Who rights the wrongs?
The machines do
Who plants the bombs?
The machines do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
How did they get inside my head?
Making us feel so cold and dead
Your thoughts being captured as well
Replacing originality
With the same story we all tell

[Chorus]
Who writes the songs?
The machines do
Who rights the wrongs?
The machines do
Who plants the bombs?
The machines do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Who writes the songs?
The machines do, they do
Who rights the wrongs?
The machines do
Who plants the bombs?
The machines do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
I don't know where my words are from
I don't know where my friends have gone
I keep trying to break these rules
But my words, they never flow through
What's happening in the world today?
Seems like my mind has gone astray
It's okay to lose control
But I've never felt so lost before
But now I know

[Chorus]
Who writes the songs?
The machines do, they do
Who rights the wrongs?
The machines do
Who plants the bombs?
The machines do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Who writes the songs?
The machines do
Who rights the wrongs?
The machines do
Who plants the bombs?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Machines
Now if I had to be honest with ya
I thought you did fancy me just a little bit
It was like one of 'em twisted love tales
The endings didn't quite fit but

You were different
A rock and roll troll with your hair greased up, all in leather
And I was a pretty girl, polka-dots, hair in curls
Close friends all quite clever

It didn't really happen to start with
I have to say, I thought that maybe
I was wrong and you liked the girl you met on holiday
More than you liked me

But then I thought
'Hey, what does she have to offer that I don't?'
Three Rolls-Royces and a cruise boat
But you picked the tramp over the queen

And you know
I actually liked you
You made me laugh lots
Made me giggle when I sipped my drink
Made me put more effort into my lyrics
It didn't really happen to start with
I have to say, I thought that you were still obsessed by
The model stunners like Lily Cole and that Brazilian chick
Whoa, oh, oh

What do you say when you think it's time to walk away
Turn around, wave goodbye?
Or come and politely kiss me on the cheek, by my side?
Now that it's over, will you take my picture off your wall
Fill it with the holiday girl and Lily Cole
Or will you just leave me there to hang un-peacefully?
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Intro]
Let it pour, let it fall down like your dreams
Let it go, let it flow away into the gutter
Let it wash all the colour away from yourself
Let it take away the pain

[Chorus]
I remember when you asked me do I ever watch the rain
And I remember I was watching it then but I just didn't want to say
And now when you look out your window it will never be the same
'Cuz when it pours down from now on you'll always think of my name, yeah
I'll be in your brain

[Post-Chorus]
And if you get a leak in your roof
Just think of it like my problems pouring through
And if you get a hole in your ceiling
Think of how I'll be feeling, cold and all alone
Like a drifting leaf, yeah, falling from the autumn trees yet again
(And again and again and again)
And again, oh oh

[Verse]
Watch it drop from the sky like a child running away
Watch it roll off the page like a tear from my face
Hear the pitter patter on the pavement like me knocking on your door
As it brushes the floor

[Chorus]
I remember when you asked me do I ever watch the rain
And I remember I was watching it then but I just didn't want to say
And now when you look out your window it will never be the same
'Cuz when it pours down from now on you'll always think of my name, yeah
I'll be in your brain

[Post-Chorus]
And if you get a leak in your roof
Just think of it like my problems pouring through
And if you get a hole in your ceiling
Think of how I'll be feeling, cold and all alone
Like a drifting leaf, yeah, falling from the autumn trees yet again
(And again and again and again)
And again, oh oh

[Bridge]
And I know you're working me out slowly but surely, slowly but surely
And I know you'll never tell about my other side
And that's why we all watch the rain, to wash away the secrets and the lies
'Cuz I know everyone watches the rain sometimes

[Outro]
Watch it fall down as you watched me fall for you
'Cuz you knew it was about you but you didn't have the guts to say
That you knew it was all for you

[Verse 1]
What's been goin' on this week
Well, people started dealin' speed
And kids my age start smokin' weed
Just so that they can get some sleep

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause parents, they get really mad
When their children start to turn all bad
And start hanging out with the wrong group of lads
Who smoke dodgy spliffs and pick fights with the chavs

[Chorus]
But they forget
You can't rewind, no
You can't turn back time
'Cause there's always gonna be a better grassy side
But no one's gonna get there
So, just let them live their lives

[Verse 2]
Take a look inside the bag
It's enough to make you want to gag
'Cause you find out your daughter's a filthy slag
Some naked pictures and a box of soggy fags

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause parents, they get really mean
And they start to get all threatening
Saying they'll pack you out onto the street
If you come in late, smelling of green

[Chorus]
But they forget
You can't rewind, no
You can't turn back time
'Cause there's always gonna be a better grassy side
But no one's gonna get there
So, just let them live their lives

[Verse 3]
What's been goin' on today
Well, Susie didn't have her say
So she got her things and ran away
Never showed her face again
And Johnny failed every exam
Screwed up his parents' whole life plan
They got no job, can't be no man
He's a lazy ass, not a helpin' hand

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause parents, they get really mad
When their children start to turn all bad
And start hanging out with the wrong group of lads
Who smoke dodgy spliffs and pick fights with the chavs

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause parents, they get really mean
And they start to get all threatening
Saying they'll pack you out onto the street
If you come in late, smelling of green

[Chorus]
But they forget
You can't rewind, no
You can't turn back time
'Cause there's always gonna be a better grassy side
But no one's gonna get there
So, just let them live their lives

[Outro]
Go on, let them live it
They're gonna just live their lives
Let her take another drag 'cause
They're gonna just live their lives

[Intro]
I can't believe you actually said to me
"I'm the one who made you"
Who do you really think you are?

[Verse 1]
You know you're making this more complicated than before
You know you're making me hate you more than I've ever done before
'Cause there's no way that you're allowed to say
That you built me up 'cause I was already made this way

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, look what you've done now
Just back down, yeah, back down (yes, back down)
'Cause I don't want you and your skinny jeans hanging around (just get out)
I was made to apologize but I didn't mean it (of course I didn't)
'Cause that T-shirt that you got me
I don't want it, you can keep it (is that your facts?)

[Chorus]
We messed it up, yeah (we got mashed up)
Both too proud to back down from the battle (from the battle)
Now we've got our neons on and our glowsticks out, trying to fight it out
To see who's more individual (ha)
But we know that's what it's about, yeah

[Verse 2]
So, what you gonna do when I leave you
You'll have no one who wants to play along with your silly little rules
'Cause you look up to someone much older
And bolder who barely knows you
They only want to talk to you so they can steal
Your cardigans and your Air Force Ones

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, look what you've done now
Just back down, yeah, back down (yes, back down)
'Cause I don't want you and your skinny jeans hanging around (just get out)
I was made to apologize but I didn't mean it (of course I didn't)
'Cause that T-shirt that you got me
I don't want it, you can keep it (is that your fact)

[Chorus]
We messed it up, yeah (we got mashed up)
Both too proud to back down from the battle (from the battle)
Now we've got our neons on and our glowsticks out, trying to fight it out
To see who's more individual

[Bridge]
You got your glowsticks and all of your, you know
Your flashy little things
You've got your Spider-Man stickers, your brown hair, your polka-dots
But just leave it out
Leave it out
I told you, we're both the same
Both as catty as each other

[Outro]
Do you remember when we went to see that band
We couldn't stand and dance around 'cause you got us seated tickets
And oh, remember when we used to hold hands
Skip along and try to get our Converse dirty like
I remember when you used to call my name
And we'd play them cheatin' games behind people's backs
But we lost that in the neon competition
That's what it was really about, oh
(Game over)

[Verse 1]
It was quarter to ten at night
And she was feelin' alright
Just been out shoppin' all day
'Cause it was the school holidays

[Verse 2]
And she got back home, sat alone
Flicked on the computer and talked to her friends
And this boy came online
He said he'd missed her
He said he liked her
Even though they weren't best friends
And had been for such a long time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So she started to ask some questions, oh oh oh
Just some random little things, yeah, yeah
'Cause she felt that if they were going to click
She'd need to know the details

[Chorus 1]
He said "my favorite color's light blue, I like Irish ice cream
Whiskey's pretty yummy and I like worn-in jeans
I prefer kissing over hugging and laughin' over tears
I like pizza and Mauritius but I ain't been there in years"

[Verse 3]
Well, what a lovely, lovely boy
He seemed bright enough
He had a life and a good personality
But not much going on in the bedroom, if you know what I mean
But I guess it kinda adds to his appeal

[Verse 4]
This is the guy who said he liked her
And that she reminded him of something
He could see but couldn't quite reach

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So she wrote all this down in a book
That she could look at any day
And it would always remind her of his smile
And his funny colored hair

[Chorus 2]
She said "I like lots of different colors and cookie dough ice cream
Baileys is the best even though it's quite fattenin'
I prefer kissing over hugging and laughin' over tears
I like pizza and I don't think I've been to Mauritius yet"

[Bridge]
Oh, yeah, yeah
Is it good there? Is it good there?
Does it have lots of sun?
Is it good there? Would it be really, really fun?

[Outro]
He said "I think it would be fun if we went there sometime"
He said "Let's go"
She said "Where?"
To Mauritius
Oh, I never noticed it before
How beautiful your fire burns
And I'm not really into the whole love song thing
But I'll try it out just for you

This is my last chance
This is my last chance
And I ain't taking any risks this time, no, no

This is your last chance
This is your last chance
To prove, to prove you'll be fine on your own

Now that I've warned you
Oh, what you gonna do?
You put the broken bottle up against your lips and take a drink
Breathe in, breathe out
But we don't care anymore, no, no, no

This is your last chance
This is your last chance
And you ain't taking any risks this time, no, no, no
This is our last chance
This is our last chance
To show them, to show them we'll survive on our own
On our own, on our own
On our own, on our own
On our own

[Intro]
Baby, now I realize
All of those times I told you I loved you
I just didn't show it
I'm sorry
Don't put me out, don't put me out
Don't put me out, don't put me out
Don't put me out, don't put me out
Don't put me out, don't put me out
Don't put me out, don't put me out

[Verse 1]
I remember when you said to me
Don't talk about it be about it
I should have felt you when you said
To me that you were all alone
I act like I was doing a favor
For you 'cause you were with me
Something let me thinking that whatever happens
This would be my home
But I was wrong (I was wrong)
How could I have been so low
(How could I have been so low)
I wrote a song all about it
(Took a pen and wrote a song)
Wanna hear it, here it goes, from now on

[Chorus]
I won't talk about loving you
'Cause I'm gonna be about loving you
I won't talk about coming home
'Cause I'm gonna be about coming home
I won't talk about both of us
'Cause I'm gonna be about both of us
I won't talk about making sweet love
'Cause I'm gonna be about making sweet love

[Verse 2]
Now I remember when we used the crib in Studio 12A
Clothes and pallets on the floor making sweet love night till day
Used to say I wanna have a baby boy and call him Man
But now it's all gone up in smoke and baby I don't understand
All I know that is I was wrong
(Dead wrong, yeah)
How could I have stooped so low
(How could I have stooped so low)
I wrote a song about it
(Wrote a song)
Wrote about it, here it goes, from now on

[Chorus]
I won't talk about loving you
'Cause I'm gonna be about loving you
I won't talk about coming home
'Cause I'm gonna be about coming home
I won't talk about both of us
'Cause I'm gonna be about both of us
I won't talk about making sweet love
'Cause I'm gonna be about making sweet love

[Verse 3]
Now all the money in the world couldn't add up to what you did
'Cause when I was down and out you took the burden off of me
I never thought that when I took her out somehow it'd cause me pain
I was rooming at the Drake, how the hell you found my name
Damn I was wrong (I was wrong)
How could I have stooped so low
(How could I have stooped so low)
I wrote a song, yeah
All about it, wanna hear it?
Here it goes, from now on

[Chorus]
I won't talk about loving you
'Cause I'm gonna be about loving you
I won't talk about coming home
'Cause I'm gonna be about coming home
I won't talk about both of us
'Cause I'm gonna be about both of us
I won't talk about making sweet love
'Cause I'm gonna be about making sweet love
I won't talk about loving you
'Cause I'm gonna be about loving you

[Outro]
Girl, open up the door and let me in this house, please baby
I'm tired of banging on this door the neighbors say I'm loud
Honey, I beg of you
Don't put me out, don't put me out
Don't put me out, don't put me out
Don't put me out, don't put me out
Don't put me out, don't put me out
Don't put me out, don't put me out

[Verse 1]
She listens to Yellowcard
Just to fit in with her friends
Cause they all know all the words
So she sings along just to click with them and
She tries to straighten her naturally curly hair
But it don't work, oh no, it don't
It just looks like a pile of shite on top of her head

[Chorus]
Well, yes, yes, yes I'm banging on about her again
(and again and again and again)
Cause I can't get those things she's been sayin' off my brain
And this time I ain't mentionin' no names
(no names, no names, no names)
Cause that would make it too damn obvious (yeah)

[Verse 2]
She helps out all the drunks who don't really want to know
Just so she looks like some kind of Good Samaritan and
She gets her friends to break up her enemies' girlfriends and boyfriends
And that kind of thing that they've got going on

[Chorus]
Well, yes, yes, yes I'm banging on about her again
(and again and again and again)
Cause I can't get those things she's been sayin' off my brain
And this time I ain't mentionin' no names
(no names, no names, no names)
Cause that would make it too damn obvious (yeah)

[Bridge]
(1, 2, 3, ow)
Well, she used to have a lot of love
But I reckon she fucked it up and
I reckon she was one of 'em over-possessive types of girl
Comes up to her man, calls out 'Sam' and she turns all catty
Hisses and scratches them away

[Chorus]
Oh, yes, yes, yes I'm banging on about her again
(and again and again and again)
Cause I can't get those things she's been sayin' off my brain
And this time I ain't mentionin' no names
(no names, no names, no names)
Cause that would make it too damn obvious (yeah)

[Chorus]
Well, yes, yes, yes I'm banging on about her again
(and again and again and again)
Cause I can't get those things she's been sayin' off my brain
And this time I ain't mentionin' no names
(no names, no names, no names)
Cause that would make it too damn obvious (yeah)

[Spoken]
Feel the rhythm

[Intro]
Fourteen's all about being free
And that's what I told people
What I am is free
Even though I'm in love

[Hook]
So I'll play in the woods with you
So I'll play in the woods with you
So I'll run through the river with you
So I'll run through the river with you
So I'll climb that tree with you
So I'll climb that tree with you
So I'll take that bicycle with you
And I'll wheel it through the town

[Chorus]
'Cause that's the kinda thing that people do when they are in love
'Cause they've got their own little song playin' on repeat in their heart
Some people's go (you ready)
Shooby do do, oh wop bop do do
Mine goes something like this (listen close)
'Cause I love you
(love, love, love, love)
(love, love, love, love)
(love, love, love, love)

[Verse 2]
You can drop me down, pick me up again
If you promise you'll catch me any day
You can listen to my songs anyway
'Cause I know you won't laugh (ha!)

[Verse 3]
You can wear matching clothes and
Dance along to the radio whilst
We walk back to your house along the main road
And you can drag me 'round Statesmans in my golden pump shoes

[Chorus]
'Cause that's the kinda thing that people do when they are in love
'Cause they've got their own little song playin' on repeat in their heart
Some people's go
Shooby do, oh wop bop do do
Mine goes something like this
'Cause I love you
'Cause that's the kinda thing that people do when they are in love
'Cause they've got their own little song playin' on repeat in their heart
Some people's go (yeah)
Shooby do do, oh wop bop do do
Mine goes something like this (yeah)
'Cause I love you (yeah)
(love, love, love, love)
(love, love, love, love)
(love, love, love, love)
(love, love, love, love)
(love, love, love, love)

[Outro]
Back to fourteen
All about bein' free
Tried to make myself not write this
But it had to be done
Tried to make myself not write it, but it had to be done

[Chorus]
I say the easiest thing in the world
Is to love you
And the hardest thing in the world
Is to lose you

[Verse 1]
Said I tried and tried again to keep you
But it just ain't no use
I'm baffled 'cause of what went down
See I got your letter, so you're leaving town
Just take one minute to think about
Baby, let's backtrack on what happened in this house
Now I remember clearly it was a Saturday
I came walking in four o'clock in the morning
And I thought you were sleeping one eye opened
You turned and said to me, "Where the hell you been"
Then I turned it around and hollered, "With some friends drinking"
And now I'm sitting here all alone
Wishing you were here to house this home, oh

[Chorus]
I say the easiest thing in the world
Is to love you
And the hardest thing in the world
Is to lose you

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm sitting here sipping on things
I'm not supposed to (Sitting right here)
And that ain't cool (You know that ain't cool)
I've got to get over losing you

[Verse 2]
Shattered I can't believe you're gone
I'm left in the middle of these four walls
Lying helpless 'bout to lose my mind baby
I can't fathom life without you by my side
Now every night before I go to sleep
I pray to heaven for a better me
Nights I'm up thinking and days I'm up dreaming
You were at work I was at play
A nigga wanted you and plus his cake
I know I ain't got no right to say
But I need you to head on back this way
Because I'm sitting here all alone
Wishing you were here to house this home, oh

[Chorus]
I say the easiest thing in the world
Is to love you
And the hardest thing in the world
Is to lose you

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm sitting here sipping on things
I'm not supposed to (Sitting right here)
And that ain't cool (You know that ain't cool)
I've got to get over losing you
Baby. can't we just moan for love like we used to

[Chorus]
I say the easiest thing in the world
Is to love you
And the hardest thing in the world
Is to lose you

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm sitting here sipping on things
I'm not supposed to (Sitting right here)
And that ain't cool (You know that ain't cool)
I've got to get over losing you

[Verse 3]
See, sometimes we men, we can dish it out
But sometimes we men, we can't take it, hey
So I'm gonna get up out this chair
And catch me a train, and get where you are, hey
Because I love you, babe
And I need you
Right here by my side
Ghetto woman come on home to me
I'm dying sorry and I can't seem to break free

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Uh, Rockland
In my life
Uh, Track Masters
You're all I need in my life
Make money
You're all I need in my life
Duece, duece
You're all I need in my life
Uh huh, yo, yo, yo, yo
I remember in the days

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Y'all niggas talking all that shit about keeping it real
But when it comes to this game I'ma play the field
Rockland had loot before we signed the deal
Haters get in the way and catch the sky like Seal
We used to use the streets for the football field
In church free lunch was our only meal
But now we push whips with Lorenzo wheels
Living it up in Beverly Hills

[Verse 2: Tone]
You know 9 to 5 was only temporary
Now the ladies wanna find Tone in a hurry
Got 'em hittin' notes that Mariah couldn't carry
All you player haters going down like Mary
Cop the Rolls Royce a player with a choice
Ladies stay moist from the sound of my voice
The lady killers pass the keys to our villas
Rockland, Track Masters top billers

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Only the loot can make me happy
(Nothing but the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot)
Only the loot can make me happy
(Nothing but the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot)

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
I never thought that I
Could make someone like you
I felt energized
When you went through my groove
I'll never let you go no
You're so right for me
I've got to let you know
Forever you and me
(The balla's anthem right here)

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Only the loot can make me happy
(Nothing but the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot)
Only the loot can make me happy
(Nothing but the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot)

[Verse 4: R. Kelly]
You must be heaven sent
Sent into my life
And I compliment you honey the money
We have a love that's long
And true I make you in many ways
I've got to roll with you
In each and every day

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Only the loot can make me happy
(Nothing but the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot)
Only the loot can make me happy
(Nothing but the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot)

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
You're all I need in my life
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you
You're all I need in my life
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you
I said you're all I need in my life
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you
You're all I need in my life I don't need no one
I don't need no one but you

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Only the loot can make me happy
(Nothing but the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot)
Only the loot can make me happy
(Nothing but the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot)

[Outro: R. Kelly]
You're all I need in my life
I said you're all I need in my life

[Chorus]
All that money I spend
All those places I been
I can't forget you, babe
Here's life without you
Working hard for this loot
Girl, I wanna spend it with you
I want you with me, babe
Here's life without you

[Verse 1]
Baby, through all the ups and down
You were a lady
I wanna show you how I love you
Baby, deserve the very best
And I, I'll give it to you, only you

[Pre-Chorus]
How can I show you that
Only you satisfy everything that you do
Baby girl, anything that you want
I'll give to you, just promise me forever, boo

[Chorus]
All that money I spend
All those places I been
I can't forget you, babe
Here's life without you
Working hard for this loot
Girl, I wanna spend it with you
I want you with me, babe
Here's life without you

[Verse 2]
Baby, I can't imagine life without you
With me, I never want to be without you
Baby, I want you to believe it's true
All that I do, I do for you

[Pre-Chorus]
How can I show you that
Only you could satisfy, everything that you do
Anything that you want I'll give to you
Just promise me forever, boo

[Chorus]
All that money I spend
All those places I been
I can't forget you, babe
Here's life without you
Working hard for this loot
Girl, I wanna spend it with you
I want you with me, babe
Here's life without you

[Bridge]
Don't know why you stayed by my side for so long
So I dedicate, baby, in every way
All my heart and soul
It all belongs to you

[Chorus]
All that money I spend
All those places I been
I can't forget you, babe
Here's life without you
Working hard for this loot
Girl, I wanna spend it with you
I want you with me, babe
Here's life without you
All that money I spend
All those places I been
I can't forget you, babe
Here's life without you
Working hard for this loot
Girl, I wanna spend it with you
I want you with me, babe
Here's life without you
All that money I spend
All those places I been
I can't forget you, babe
Here's life without you
Working hard for this loot
Girl, I wanna spend it with you
I want you with me, babe
Here's life without you
All that money I spend
All those places I been
I can't forget you, babe
Here's life without you
Working hard for this loot
Girl, I wanna spend it with you

[Chorus]
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high

[Verse 1]
Girl, what's your problem?
'Cause I know it's hard sometimes, baby just give it some time
Oh honey now girl, we can solve them
If you just give me some time I can open up your mind
If you let it shine, you can free your mind
'Cause I know

[Chorus]
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high

[Verse 2]
Girl, if it's done right
Well you know it's got to be, something wonderful to me
Oh honey now girl, give it one night
If you just give it a chance, loving you is not my plan
Cause I know one day you'll see
All the things that we can be
No, no, no...

[Bridge / Beat Switch]
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
(I want to be the only one)
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so
(But now I'm so high)
(But now I'm so high)
(But now I'm so high)
(But now I'm so high)
(But now I'm so high)
(But now I'm so high)

[Outro]
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high...

[Intro]
I don't understand
I do all this for you
You contemplating on me
Or is it him? Or is it me? Or is it him?

[Verse 1]
He told you he'd be there for you and he wasn't
I told you I'd be there for you and I was
And still is the real is who takes care of biz
Took you from apartments and got you home like The Wiz
I'm not the kind of guy to give you everything
But if you're real then, you can get some ice in your rings
You and me straight to the crib off the tour bus
Spottin' my eyes, fireplace, big as us
It really don't matter who's first in the shower
Fruit platter from a young maid every hour
And when it comes down to the dollar, you can have it
All ya gotta do is keep it hoppin' like a rabbit
Friends come around, don't be ready to change
Treat me like a stepchild when I'm up on the game
Remember I'm the first to give your cootie the pain
So I wanna hear you answer when I ask you my name

[Bridge]
Ooh, baby, I want you here with me
And give you everything that your heart desires
Lady, can you feel me?
Do you wanna be with me for always?
Baby, can't you see what you do to me?
When he do the things that he has done to you, baby

[Chorus]
You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you, ooh babe
'Cause I can do those things if I'm with you, baby

[Verse 2]
Now who took you in when that nigga put you out?
And who picked you up when that nigga put you down?
Restraining orders keep that fool from around
Had to set you up in a spot downtown
See I was the one who was there for you
But I'm not the one that's gon' play the two
Channel bags in the trunk, what you gon' do?
You could treat the future like a menu
As long as I'm the only one to bend you
And when you wanna take a flight, I'm the one to send you
Never be the one that's out to hurt you
Tell you that I'm there and then desert you

[Chorus]
You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you, ooh babe
'Cause I can do those things if I'm with you, baby
You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you, ooh babe
'Cause I can do those things if I'm with you, baby

[Bridge]
Baby, can't you see what you do to me?
When he do the things he do to you, baby

[Chorus]
You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you, ooh babe
'Cause I can do those things if I'm with you, baby
You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you, ooh babe
'Cause I can do those things if I'm with you, baby
You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you, ooh babe
'Cause I can do those things if I'm with you, baby
You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you, ooh babe
'Cause I can do those things if I'm with you, baby

[Intro]
Baby, I'm sorry
(Not gonna let you down)
Sorry for the things that happened to you, babe
For what he did
I'll show you that I'm not gonna do those things that he did to you
I'm gonna love you I'm gonna hold you
I'm gonna give you everything that your heart desires
You don't have to question love
'Cause when I get home I'll show you love

[Verse 1]
I know you're hurting baby
Because of what he did
But here I am to rescue you
From that man of sin
He took your life from you
And noted you for him
Promised you brighter days
But now your light is dim
He had no right to do
The things he did to you
If I had half a chance
Girl, I'd be good to you
Don't let don't let don't let don't let
Don't let what happened in your past hurt our future

[Chorus]
One man can make one woman hate all men
Tell me why is it that
One man can make one woman hate all men
Makes a woman hate all men
One man can make one woman hate all men
I'm sorry that he took your heart and did you in

[Verse 2]
You lived your life a lie
Now it's time to seek the truth
If it takes the rest of my days
I'm gonna make it up to you
So you let your guards on down
I don't want to go no rounds
'Cause baby, I'm here for you
Truly, truly here for you
Don't let don't let don't let don't let
Don't let what happened in the past hurt our future

[Chorus]
One man can make one woman hate all men
Tell me why is it that
One man can make one woman hate all men
Makes a woman hate all men
One man can make one woman hate all men
I'm sorry that he took your heart and did you in

[Verse 3]
Girl I'm sorry that he took your heart and did you in
I'm not tryin' to hurt you
(I'm not tryin' to hurt you pretty baby, pretty baby)
I just wanna make sweet love to you
(All I wanna do is make you feel good all over)
While making love all the things
He said he'd do to you and he didn't girl
I'll do for you
Baby I'll do, vow to cuz I'm sorry that he took your heart
And did you in, yeah

[Chorus]
One man can make one woman hate all men
Tell me why is it that
One man can make one woman hate all men
Makes a woman hate all men
One man can make one woman hate all men
I'm sorry that he took your heart and did you in

[Verse 4]
Ladies, it was us all along
That made ya get up and get out and do wrong
I know you didn't really wanna do it
Hey, but being pissed off at us led you to it
Yes it did, yes it did, yes it did, oh, oh, oh
It mean I'm sorry baby
For coming in late from being out all night oh yeah
See I was so busy out there doing you wrong
While you were out there with somebody else
Getting your groove on, oh, oh, oh, oh
I guess its' a lesson to be learned
Be careful of the bridge you burn, oh oh

[Verse 1]
I'm sick and tired of the games you played
Every move I make your ass got something to say
Scandalize my name when you see it in the paper
Trying to turn it all around when it wasn't that way
Everybody is trying to figure me out
What the hell is wrong with y'all just let me live my life
I can't go one day without y'all in my face
Y'all done lost y'all minds if you don't hear what I say
Cops chase me when I'm standing still
You know I ain't done shit wrong so why you want me in your cell
You don't like my songs well it pays the bills
And you cut me down 'cause I keep it real
Sometimes I wanna fly far away from here
To another place it ain't worth these tears
Sometimes at night when I close my eyes
I know the haters are busy making up hater lies
Sometimes I laugh trying to keep from crying
If I was plain out of love then tell me who could I trust
See I work so hard just to get ahead
If it wasn't for God I'd probably be dead
Sometimes I think y'all trying to pull me down
But y'all wasting your time I got you haters figured out
If yo had your way it'd be lock and key
Everywhere I go trouble follows me
Where the hell is my father shit it hurts sometimes
There's a hole in me and it rocks my mind

[Interlude]
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned
When was your last confession

[Verse 2]
His true fears he left without a care
And that was more than I could bare
When you need my help I never tell you no
When I need your love you got somewhere to go
I'm getting sick of this shit but I'm not gonna quit
I've come too far gotta keep my pockets thick
I get mad as hell but that's ok
Kick off these shoes 'cause I'm here to stay
I gotta let you know got no time to play
So feel me and all that you hear me say
What I'm building up you can't tear it down
'Cause it's built on solid Rockland ground
We don't die, we multiply, hit after hit, living platinum style
Keep my head up high, looking toward the sky
Nothing in my view, hey I can fly
Y'all just hate, I can't take no more
And if you feel me raise your hand and show

[Chorus]
This is what I feel, ooh, this is what I feel
Feel me, feel me, feel me, hey, hey feel, woo
Westside tell me can you feel me, hey, oh
Eastside tell me can you feel me, whoa, oh south
Southside tell me can you feel me
Feel me, feel me

[Intro]
Ruminations on the looming effects of the parallax view
And the figure and the form and the revolving door
That keeps turning out more and more
Good women like you
Yet another woman to whom I won't get through
Ruminations on the looming effects of the parallax view
And the figure and the form and the revolving door
That keeps turning out more and more
Good women like you
Yet another woman to whom I won't get through

[Verse 1]
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies
Take it easy
When he leaves me
Please be my guest
To whatever I might have left
In his kitchen cupboards
In the back of his bathroom cabinets
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes
There's a dress in the closet
Don't get rid of it
You'd look good in it
I didn't fit in it
It was never mine
It belonged to the ex-wife of another ex of mine
She left it behind with a note
One line that said:
"I don't know how I'm coming across
But I'm really trying"
She was very kind

[Verse 2: Blake Mills]
Oh, 

[?]
Take a closer look from a few steps back
See all that is that which is comprised of you
That which I love you
Cause fuck you, I love you
Make a place for me
Beneath the rain cloud balloon above you
It'd be insane to make comparisons
It would be insane to engage in competition with me

[?]

[Outro]
Ruminations on the looming effects of the parallax view
And the figure and the form and the revolving door
That keeps turning out more and more
Good women like you
Yet another woman to whom I won't get through
Ruminations on the looming effects of the parallax view
And the figure and the form and the revolving door
That keeps turning out more and more
Good women like you
Yet another woman to whom I won't get through
Ruminations on the looming effects of the parallax view
And the figure and the form and the revolving door
That keeps turning out more and more
Good women like you
Yet another woman to whom I won't get through
Ruminations on the looming effects of the parallax view
And the figure and the form and the revolving door
That keeps turning out more and more
Good women like you
Yet another woman to whom I won't get through

[Verse 1]
I've waited many years
Every print I left upon the track
Has led me here
And next year, it'll be clear
This was only leading me to that
And by that time, I hope that

[Chorus]
You love me
You love me

[Verse 2]
I move with the trees in the breeze
I know that time is elastic
And I know when I go
All my particles disband and disperse
And I'll be back in the pulse
And I know none of this will matter in the long run
But I know a sound is still a sound around no one
And while I'm in this body
I want somebody to want
And I want what I want and I want

[Chorus]
You to love me
You

[Bridge]
And I know that you do
In the dark, I know that you do
And I know that you know that you got
The potential to pick me up
And I want you to use it, blast the music
Bang it, bite it, bruise it
Whenever you want to begin, begin
We don't have to go back to where we've been
I am the woman who wants you to win
And I've been waiting, waiting for

[Outro]
You to love me
You
You
Ooh, ooh

[Intro]
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't care

[Verse 1]
You know I love it when you're loving me
Sometimes it's better when it's publicly
I'm not ashamed, I don't care who sees
Just hugging and kissing our love exhibition
We'll rendezvous up on the fire escape
I’d like to set off an alarm today
The love emergency don't make me wait
Just follow, I'll lead you, I urgently need you

[Chorus]
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't

[Post-Chorus]
Let's make love
Let's go somewhere, they might discover us
Let's get lost in lust, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't care

[Verse 2]
I see you closing down the restaurant
Let's sneak and do it when your boss is gone
Everybody's leaving, we'll have some fun
Or maybe it's wrong but you're turnin' me on
Oh, we'll take a visit to your mama's house
Creep to the bedroom while your mama's out
Maybe she'll hear it when we scream and shout
But we'll keep it rocking until she comes knocking, oh

[Chorus]
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't

[Post-Chorus]
Let's make love
Let's go somewhere, they might discover us
Let's get lost in lust, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't care

[Bridge]
If we keep up on this fooling around
We'll be the talk of the town
I'll tell the world I've a love in the town
Let's open the blinds 'cause we really don't mind

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't care about propriety
Let's break the rules, ignore society
Maybe our neighbors want to spy, it's true
So what if they watch when we do, what we do

[Chorus]
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't

[Outro]
Let's make love
Let's go somewhere, they might discover us
Let's get lost in lust

[Intro]
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Life is cheap, bittersweet
But it tastes good to me
Take my turn, crash and burn
That's how it's s'posed to be

[Chorus]
So don't rain on my parade
Life's too short to waste one day
I'm gonna risk it all, the freedom to fall
Yes, it sure looks good to me

[Verse 2]
Time passed by and leaves you behind
Take it naturally
Heaven knows there's so much more
More than what we see

[Chorus]
So don't rain on my parade
Life's too short to waste one day
I'm gonna risk it all, the freedom to fall
Yes, it sure looks good to me
Hey, sure looks good to me

[Refrain]
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Deep in my mind, I'm secure with getting by
I wanna see the light before I die
Before I lie in an empty space
The darkness comes and I've been tellin' my soul
And me and myself, we turn around, we're gettin' old
But the lightning crashing, foolish emotions
Are the bruises and the beauty of this moment that we're feelin'
And I feel like I'm seeing the world inside of me
But I can tell you that I know it's getting easier to breathe
There's a cold in the morning, endless equation
Of who we've become, it's a complex situation
So live love life, give love, live love life, give love
Live love life, give love, 'cause who are we anyway?

[Chorus]
So don't rain on my parade
Life's too short to waste one day
I'm gonna risk it all, the freedom to fall
Yes, it sure looks good to me
Hey, it sure looks good to me
I'm tellin' you, it sure looks good to me
Yeah, sure looks good to me

[Outro]
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, me, yeah
Looks good to me, ooh!
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
If you ain’t get no money, nigga, what’s yo purpose?
Don’t need no clowns in my circle, this is not a circus
I keep on doin’ what I’m doin’, what I’m doin’ workin’
They say the watch on my wrist is picture perfect
They say the way I hold the pot is picture perfect
I left the lot and dropped the top cuz tops they make me nervous
I got the game, all I got, my life and my verses
And all that sneaky bitch shit, it came to the surface

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Just to wake up it’s a blessed day
But I’m boomin’ cage like everyday
Gonna muscle down I put my hustle down
I gone makin’ money like several ways
Got a traphouse in the neighborhood
Get my grass cut by seven J’s
Flashback, yellow Lamborghini
I pulled up to the figure eight
Got a book man, I’m the coupe man
Get the S-scrolls, I’m extra paid
I pulled up in that Rolls Royce
All the pussy niggas had nothin’ to say
Cockroaches in the industry
I think it’s time for me to fumigate
Asenzi(?) committed when I get through those pretty J’s
Might buy a pain, I might crack a seal
Then pour for my ace of spades
Might buy a pound and then break it down
Then smoke a pound in the VIP
I get money, you ain’t gettin’ money, is that the reason you mad at me?
Got fifty bags of that Cali gas
And it's all free if you find a seed

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
If you ain’t get no money, nigga, what’s yo purpose?
Don’t need no clowns in my circle, this is not a circus
I keep on doin’ what I’m doin’, what I’m doin’ workin’
They say the watch on my wrist is picture perfect
They say the way I hold the pot is picture perfect
I left the lot and dropped the top cuz tops they make me nervous
I got the game, all I got, my life and my verses
And all that sneaky bitch shit, it came to the surface

[Verse 2: Chill Will]
I hope she get so wet I get a backstroke
And fuck a nigga, what the fuck you think these scraps fo'?
Yeah, I be ballin’, and I ain’t talkin’ ball back
Big money, start talkin’ lil money fall back
Show me where them brawls at, show me where the mall at
Chill with the shit, bitch, show me where the staul at
Look at all this work, I don’t think that I can move it all
Look at all this dope, I don’t think that I can sell it all
Yeah, I’m tellin’ ya, big cookin’ work in the kitchen, I’m smellin’ ya
Shout out to the east cuz I be there on the regular
Yeah, we call em squares but their shapes are rectangular

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
If you ain’t get no money, nigga, what’s yo purpose?
Don’t need no clowns in my circle, this is not a circus
I keep on doin’ what I’m doin’, what I’m doin’ workin’
They say the watch on my wrist is picture perfect
They say the way I hold the pot is picture perfect
I left the lot and dropped the top cuz tops they make me nervous
I got the game, all I got, my life and my verses
And all that sneaky bitch shit, it came to the surface

[Verse 1]
Can we get away? Somewhere far away
Out of all these blocks and corners
With my Henny in hand, ooh
When I’m with you babe, feels like, ooh
Like the stars changed colours now

[Chorus]
Can we go to a place but alone
With my Henny in hand? Ooh
Can we bump to the bass real slow?
With my Henny in hand, ooh
Stay safe in the streets

[Verse 2]
When you say my name, gray skies turn bright, baby
Just wanna take you somewhere far
With my Henny in hand, ooh
Looking at your face, ooh
Those beautiful eyes, make me wanna
With my Henny in hand, ooh

[Chorus]
Can we go to a place but alone
With my Henny in hand? Ooh
Can we bump to the bass real slow?
With my Henny in hand, ooh
Stay safe in the streets

[Verse 3]
Can, we go far to a place where the place where the bass and 808s play hard
Where the jakes stays far from us and the car dump chase lay far from the place where we laid safe
In the AK seats, straight peace, you ain’t gonna tell a nigga stay safe in the streets
Where we live kids layin' in peace and the sun down but for now let me lay you in sheets

[Intro]
Sometimes
Sometimes the world gets hard
Oh, na, na, na
I'm gonna take it from there, girl
Don't you worry

[Verse 1]
I wanna be your lake or your bay
And any problems that you have, I wanna wash 'em away
I wanna be your sky
So blue and high
And every time you think of me, I wanna blow your mind

[Verse 2]
I wanna be your air
So sweet and fair
So when you feel that you can't breathe
Ma, I'll be there
I wanna be your answer, all the time
When you see how I put your life before mine
With no question

[Chorus]
When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here

[Verse 3]
I wanna hold your hands
Review all your plans
I wanna make sure every one of your dreams will stand
I wanna be your broadway show on review (Why?)
So I can act out how God was when he made you
I wanna be your lighthouse when you get lost
I'll light a bright and shining path to help you across
I wanna be your mother, wait
See what I see
And when you see that can't nobody hold you like me
'Cause I love you

[Chorus]
When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here (Take it from here, baby)
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl (No, no)
I'ma take it from here

[Verse 4]
And when there's no one there to hold
And you realize the world is cold
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here  (That's what I'm gonna do)
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time (Don't you worry baby girl, baby girl)
Don't worry, girl (Baby girl)
I'm gonna take it from here (I'll take you wherever you want)

[Bridge]
Give me one reason why we should not be leaving
This world is so deceiving, the time is now
Let's fly away, speeding
Through the Garden of Eden
Look at where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds

[Chorus]
When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here

[Bridge]
Give me one reason why we should not be leaving
This world is so deceiving, the time is now
Let's fly away, speeding (Fly away)
Through the Garden of Eden
Look at where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds

[Chorus]
When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here (I got somethin' I wanna tell ya, baby)

[Break]
Love ain't always the way they write in books (No, no)
See there's the good guys and also heartbreak crooks
Your heart's the real book; just take a look inside
'Cause it's a colorful illustrated guide

[Outro]
So there you go
Don't worry
I'll be the one
To help you weather the storm
I'll be there mami
No matter what time
No matter what place
You can always count on me
I'll take it from here

[Intro]
Oh, we got this beat?

[Chorus]
I'm just sitting in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
Oh, song so f'ing dope, girl, it's hard not for me to blaze it, let's go
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I could play with
Huh, aight, let me see, let me see what I got

[Verse]
Okay, I be bangin' all on that beat
808, she got the bass when her booty shake
She got her friends with her and they a sight to see
All that butt, don't let it go to waste
All this Hennessy, the liquor, 'bout to penetrate
While I'm pushin' Lamborghini's on the interstate
I long-stroke her, I'ma go for hours
You minute-made like lemonade
I'm fresh as hell in these Margielas
As I skate pass, better than veterans
Bipolar cold, give me the medicine
My chain too bright, no Thomas Edison
When I pull it out, chick nervous
Better ride this wave, chick, surf it
Girl, you better keep them legs open
Only thing you close is these curtains
Ha, and she only got time for a brother if I take her out to eat
A brother really gotta motivate
Man, that's too much work for the kitty, I don't work for the kitty
Really don't communicate
Ha, I'd rather lick it like a dinner plate
I'd rather keep my money in a safe
Man, I ain't got time to play
I need it now, not a minute late
Now she blowin' up my line on the cellular
She wanna lock a brother down, on the regular
Talkin' crazy to me like she own it
But I don't trust her as far as I can throw her
Huh, momma told me to find a keeper
But I switch like designer sneakers
A girl with the finest features
Every brother wanna talk to her, but I got her first, finders keepers
Violins in the back, is my theme music
Her booty on my mind, I dream booty
Any __ wanna ___ my ___
Then it's off with his head, how kings do it
My ring's ruby
Red bandana, I stay woopin'
Got too many cribs, I stay movin'
Three Lambos, I stay coupin'
Yeah, but you don't hear me though
Virginia to the Westside
My car foreign, the girl sit on the left side
I smokin' weed on the plane, that's the best high
She gotta sign the waiver 'fore I let her fly
Huh, it's helipads on the boat
Chillin' in the South of France, Saint-Tropez, Nice, Monaco
But nothin' compare to what's in my pants, girl, stop playin'

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Lord have Murcielagos waiting on the nigga
At the end when the time come
Get the drop on the weed spot
Like there's too much water in the tea pot, huh
Lord have Murcielagos on the poor, nigga, pour, nigga
They adore the event of war
Down force on the doors of adored niggas
Does the Lord like to thank award winners?
And the war winners'll rewards inner
Or the all-enders ain't the pure chemists
So the form in this can be raw in this like the porn business
Keen to king 'til the, 'til the pawn hit us
If he goes, half a million sold, sold the soul, going gold
In the end will it go to the pawn business?
You ain't doing nothing with it
Let a nigga get it for the low-low-low-low
Lames tried to form it, brains couldn't storm it like a Ororo-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro
In the Philippines eating chicken wings, smothered with adobo-dobo-dobo-do
Vatos, fiascos, vocos locos like a cho-lo-lo-lo
Gadget go, go, go, go, go, ratchet ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Santa ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, K-Ci, Jo-Jo-Jo-Jo-Jo
Brown skin brother in a fed box at the hell lil' nigga live there for months
Except these young, black males wouldn't drive if you give them trucks
Nigga, nigga, nigga what, I don't give a, give a, give a, fuck
With a, with a mind full of money, pockets full of nothing
Niggas gonna feel what a nigga feel
Always been a winner ever since beginner
All the way to the end and never ever been a pussy

[Hook: Billy Blue]
Pussy nigga, pussy pussy nigga, pussy pussy nigga get fucked

Pussy nigga, pussy pussy nigga, pussy pussy nigga get fucked
Real nigga, Twitter, what?
Pussy nigga, pussy pussy nigga, pussy pussy nigga get fucked
Real nigga, Twitter, what?

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Lord, please keep these diablo niggas off a nigga mind
Lord, please keep these diablo niggas off a nigga spine
Lord, please keep me Fiasco outta rest of these nigga lie
These nigga lie, these nigga lie, these nigga lie, these nigga lie
Lord, please forgive me for the sinning
Sinning please forgive me for the snitching to the Lord
Openin' for business scissors to the ribbon niggas wanting to get in, open up the doors
Son wanna feel 'em, open up the ceiling
Niggas start tripping, open up the floor
Trap like Indiana Jones looking for a map
That I sketched on the back on one of my raps under my hat
Coffin is the cousin to the bed that's under my back
Dream so real niggas die taking one of my naps
Mattress full of money, monster under that sheets full of raps
Comfort for the weak, sleep for the whack
Party while you slumber, tell 'em money coming, jump in my sack
Niggas wanna exercise, exercise I-X-I ain't no jumpin' my jack
If I lift an arm I'mma lift a car, nigga, that's a gun in my lap
Hurdle to the tire, chariots of fire
I'm a flyer, take you under my flap
Is he going nuts? Is he going bolts?
No, going both running my track
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga what
I just figure, figure, figure you gon' be a nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga what
And since niggas is faster than them white folks on the tracks
White folks tightrope, like both, I could be a sprintin' nigga
Nik Wallenda, runnin' over rap
I higher, higher wire, you a wire on a power pad running over that
Running over that, running over that, running over that, running over that
Five time winner, five-nine, fine line thinner
Einstein mind, mind bender
Fine dine, nine, wine, find cocaine in my mind's antenna
Pussy!
