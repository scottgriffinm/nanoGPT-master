 white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
How'd I get so white and nerdy?

[Verse 2]
I've been browsin', inspectin'
X-Men comics, you know I collect 'em
The pens in my pocket, I must protect 'em
My ergonomic keyboard never leaves me bored
Shopping online for deals on some writable media
I edit Wikipedia
I memorized Holy Grail really well
I can recite it right now and have you "ROTFLOL"
I got a business doing websites
When my friends need some code, who do they call?
I do HTML for 'em all
Even made a homepage for my dog, yo
I got myself a fanny pack
They were havin' a sale down at The Gap
Spend my nights with a roll of bubble wrap
Pop, pop, hope no one sees me, gettin' freaky
I'm nerdy in the extreme and whiter than sour cream
I was in AV Club and Glee Club and even the Chess Team
Only question I ever thought was hard
Was do I like Kirk or do I like Picard?
Spend every weekend at the Renaissance Fair
Got my name on my underwear

[Chorus]
They see me strollin', they laughin'
And rollin' their eyes 'cause I'm so white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
All because I'm white and nerdy
Holy cow, I'm white and nerdy!
I wanna bowl with the gangstas
But, oh well, it's obvious I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy

[Intro: Green Lantern, Eminem & 50 Cent]
Okay (Yeah)
It's about that time again (Haha)
Green Lantern (That's Right)
G-G-G-G-G Uni-*burp*
Shit!
Hahaha, Shady
We back (Invasion!) Part II
The Conspiracy

[Hook: Eminem & Green Lantern]
'Cause we ain't gonna never stop, you just keep wasting your energy
On us, you should find something to do with your time (time)
And quit fuckin' with us 'cause we ain't fuckin' with you
And it must be fuckin' with you so much you must be gone out your mind
(Shady Records mixtape, come on Em)

[Verse: Eminem]
They say I'm a day away from my entire empire crumbling
Speak up, you're mumbling, what the fuck-a you's a
Bibi-bay okay big-bi-bi-baby, this is Shady
I know you was bi-bi-hoping we be-be-would just go away
But weeble mable weeble wobble but we don't fall down like
Jam Master Jay's two turntables, our label is just too stable
Your magazine's so motherfucking thin you using staples
To hold it together it's turning back into a newspaper
And ya'll got somethin' for my ass every issue
Thank you, 'cause I keep runnin' out of fucking tissues
And I could diss you but God I was sick of looking at you
At least now I can see when Nike's got a new tennis shoe
But-but I guess no good news is always good-good news
Moving on to bigger and better things (chicka chicka jeera)
50's blowing up, this year just keeps going up
What the fuck is going on? Who the fuck is Norah Jones?
Shady, wait a minute, baby, leave the whore alone
Just go up there and be humble and take them awards home
Bush has just declared the world a fucking war zone
Meanwhile we got a war going on of our own at home
My fuckin' mind's blown
Trying to figure out how to fight my own clone
Rhinestones are so nice, they shine so bright
Especially at night
After a hit of ecstasy, ain't that right Ro'oh?
Wait a minute, I'm rambling
Back to the matter at hand, it's Green Lantern
With Elvis Presley the selfish MC
Back to ruin rap and destroy the industry
Single handedly and oh man did we
Yeah me and 50, Obie, me and Twizzy
And Nelly and Missy and Jigga
God damn, it's all a plan devised by the Man, it's a conspiracy
Against fake shit, and anybody who can't make hits or ain't dope lyrically
So fuck what you heard and what you read about
We ain't ruining rap baby we're just trying to weed it out
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to rock the mic, right!
Still keep talking shit to me punk
'Cause your magazine's over in less than six months!

[Outro: Eminem]
Haha, Shady Records, still Aftermath!
And don't think we can hear you motherfuckers talking
'Cause we can't
We don't hear y'all
So we just gonna sit back for the rest of our lives
While you ride our dicks

[Intro: Pharrell & Snoop Dogg]
We do this in our sleep, nigga
Yeah
Ever been in love before?
I wanna holla at you, ma
You know it's hard for a player to admit that sometimes
But I'ma spit that sometimes, y'know what I'm sayin?
Ayy, P, give it to me one time nephew

[Chorus: Pharrell & Snoop Dogg]
There's something 'bout this girl man, from around my way
She from around the way
Ever try to hold back your feelings, but it just wouldn't stay
It wouldn't stay, wouldn't stay
But when I finally found the words to say
I wanted to run away (Run away, run away), simply run away, oh
You can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself, let me reason
Sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
That you're in love with the girl

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Yes sir, that's her
But it wasn't like that back when I met her
The lavish life from all the dough spun
Before the double R had to hitchhike thumb
Her friends didn't like niggas like us
But I arrested the coochie and her feelings got cuffed
Spider web sex must have got caught up
But there's more to it I remember once
Sayin' "Let's shit on the peons
Let's go to Vegas and watch Celine Dion"
Make 'em say "What we on?"
You say no like you was doin' it for eons
Fuck it I just hum and let the watch give off the neons
When it rains it pours, I laugh to myself when I change the score
You said my sex was a lot but my brain gave you more
And somethin' 'bout how your ex was a toy, I guess he played games
It's only diamond dice here not tryin' to justify
But when you shut your eye you can touch the sky
You in trouble ma, and you should pray about speed
But if that's 'bout you, what that say about me?

[Chorus: Pharrell & Snoop Dogg]
What you say, say, say?
But when I finally found the words to say
I wanted to run away (Run away, run away), simply run away, oh
Check it out, check it out
You can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself, let me reason
Sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
That you're in love with the girl

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
See I'm a crip in dark blue Chucks
And I does what I does yeah I might say "cuz"
It's really weird cause a nigga got love
Snoop Dogg's a crip and the girl was a blood
She told me that her baby daddy was a thug
Now it is what it is and it was not was
I'm hollerin' at lil mama like what
Monday morn stack tryna get my cheese back
All these memories breed seed to the rhythm rhyme pleaser
Lay back while we sippin' on a breezer
Fresh four pack sittin' in the freezer
Ain't that Kadija I heard she was a skeezer
She used to hit them licks wit' the visas
When I seen her wit the homies I was like "Jesus"
It's been a little minute since I seen her
Hope her man don't run up cause I'll have to pull the nina

[Chorus: Pharrell]
There's something 'bout this girl man, from around my way
Ever try to hold back your feelings, but it just wouldn't stay
But when I finally found the words to say
I wanted to run away, simply run away
You can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself, or try to reason
Sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
That you're in love with the girl

[Outro: Pharrell]
There's somethin' 'bout this girl man
There's somethin' 'bout this girl man
There's somethin' 'bout this girl man
There's somethin' 'bout this girl man

[Intro]
How's your son?
(All, all, all tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
He made the team this year?
Aight, they said he wasn't tall enough
(All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
Ma we here, we gon' cook this Sunday, OK? So come by 

[?]
That's your new girlfriend?

[Verse 1]
This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone, it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yo you heard the track I did man, "This Can't Be Life"
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why the guard had to look all through it?
As kids, we used to laugh, who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business

[Chorus]
And I don't care about (All, all, diamond ring, diamond ring)
They don't mean a thing
(All, all, all, tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight in gold
(All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
Now all I know I know all these things

[Verse 2]
This is family business
And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abi, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like, "See! That's my cousin on TV!"
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And they gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be Electric Slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photobook up
I got a Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eating her food
And you don't wanna stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousin
Fit three in the bed if it's six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

[Bridge]
Rain, rain, rain, go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain, go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say

[Verse 3]
I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using nines and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi is my family, dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family, dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me, dog
You can still love your man and be manly, dog
You ain't gotta get heated at every housewarmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Sheila always performin'?
Second she storm out then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't letting everybody in our family business, uh

[Chorus]
(All, all, diamond ring, diamond ring)
They don't mean a thing
(All, all, all tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
They don't mean a thing
(All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
They don't mean a thing, a thing
And I don't care about (All, all, diamond ring, diamond ring)
They don't mean a thing (All, all, all tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight in gold (All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
And all I know I know all these things

[Outro]
All these things...
CLK Mercedes Benz
All these things...
A whole lotta money
All these things...
Mommy and Daddy, can you please stop fighting?
All these things (and I don't care about)
All these things...
Let's get Stevie out of jail

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
Gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Extended Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

[Outro]
Hoo, hoo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana), hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, hoo!
(Man in the mirror) You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to move, shamone, shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah), stand up (Make that change), stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Aaow! (Yeah, make that change)
Go make that change, shamone (Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know (Change)
Make that change

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are on the ground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?
The world?

[Verse 1 : Lupe Fiasco]
Or is it something they can never believe?
Or is it something you can never achieve?
Is it beyond your means? Is it inside your dreams?
Can it never come out cause it's scared to, unprepared to
Too worried about the words of the people it's weird to
You don't want them to hear you
You just wish there was a door that would appear
That you can go disappear through
Well I'm feeling your pain
I was feeling the same, but I said I'd never feel that again

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are on the ground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?
The world?

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Man, I really miss my pops
Hope that God watches over him and that he's on top
That there is no more disease and that he's alright
That he's one of the generals inside the army of the light
And grandma, you know I had to bite something from you
So after every show it's "peace, and much love to you"
Auntie Tweetie's on the way, please look out for that girl
I know we'll meet again, so it's never me against the world

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are on the ground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?
The world?

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
I hope that God forgive us, all of us sinners
Turn us back into beginners, put us up where the winners go
Holy apartments in the gardens in which the rivers flow
Thank you for all your blessings and all of your miracles
I thank all my fans and all my supporters
Shout out to Bishop G, congrats on your new baby daughter
I tip my hat to all my family and friends
Now we just got one more to go, L-U-P-END

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are on the ground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?
The world?

[Intro: Choir]
All of the lights
Lights, lights
All of the lights

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Post-Chorus: Elly Jackson & Rihanna]
Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, all of the lights
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are (All of the lights)
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Somethin' wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights), lights
Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life every night (All of the lights)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Them courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights), lights
Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life every night (All of the lights)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Gettin' mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Gettin' right, babe
You should go and get your own
Gettin' mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Gettin' right, babe
You should go and get your own

[Verse 3: Fergie, Rihanna & Drake]
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
'Kay, okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time

[Chorus: Choir]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Outro: Alicia Keys & Elton John]
Woah, woah
(I tried to tell you, but all I could say was oh)
Woah, woah
(I tried to tell you, but all I could say was oh)
Woah, woah
(I tried to tell you, but all I could say was oh)
Woah, woah
(I tried to tell you, but all I could say)

[Verse 1: Tyler]
Drip drop, the angels made a pit stop
Pissin' on the demons of the Earth
What’s it really worth? Shit, now it's fuckin' pourin'
Wanted to go skate, can't, now my day is borin', damn
Snorin' in the bed with blankets cause my head spin
Probably cause I popped a couple purple Excedrins
It's a rainy day, so I'll skip the Led Zeppelin
And play some Sade "Love Deluxe" through my headset
On my way home I punched a bitch for an umbrella
Why? Cause I really didn’t wanna get my shit wet
Run through the puddles, playin' in the mud
Fun, sucks that I'm too tall for the tub
Or I would get my toys and make a lotta noise
While my mom is in the kitchen cookin' up a meal
Fire place is startin' up, dick is barely warmin' up
Sippy cup full of whip creamed hot chocolate

[Hook: Pharrell]
I can smell it when I go outside
Then it just pours
It gives us peace then all in the town is quiet
That's what rain's for

[Bridge: Pharrell]
All the kids see rain and scream "No, no"
Run off the bus and they will just stay in
Me I love how rain fills the potholes
Me and my sailboat, that's what we played in
Ever wonder exactly where the sun goes
Did it go or did somethin' shade it?
The sun gives light cause it is the window
The rain gives life cause it is amazin'

[Verse 2: Tyler]
Lightning is striking, water hittin' on my window like Ike
I am not Tina, buddy, do not give my window pain
Lights bulbs when wearin' that wig, flyin' kites
Here's an idea, why don't I go hiking
On a fuckin' mountain where the water fountains icing
Stand there in a tank top prop that's from Baywatch
And eat about four bowls of some frozen ice cream
Get sick and then I won't have to
Go to school today, tomorrow, the day after
Sit in bed, write a bunch of raps up
And I won't be lyin' when I say I’m a sick rapper
I might fail so I won't bother
The sun is playin' hide and seek like my fuckin' father
The only difference is it comes back, full effect
In the summer heats up, the thermometers erected

[Outro: Pharrell]
The inside of clouds
That's the window into the sky
Proves there's life

[Hook - T-Pain]
And I'mma talk, talk, talk, talk
And I'mma talk, talk, talk, talk
Now go and give me 50 because when I talk I spit and
If the haters keep hating, I'mma have to come and talk that shit

[Verse - Lil Wayne]
Happy ass Weezy, never in a bad mood
Boy I talk shit like I swallowed a bathroom
Girl give me vacuum, do it 'til her lips drool
The ice in your fridge never met a nigga this cool
Young money I’m richer than I used to be
I plant my seed in her garden now she root for me
Baby I’ma tell you truthfully:
I talk it and I do believe I walk it
Call me orthopedic Carter and I ought to be an author
Damn, man and I tell ya, it’d be a best seller
Tim on the beat and me Missy Elliot goes wherever
Ya dig?
You can ask the bank teller
But my money old like Nelson Mandela
Higher than a propeller
And baby I can show you better than acapella

[Hook]

[Verse]
They thought it was cool to burn crosses on your front lawn as they hung you from trees in your backyard
They thought it was cool to leave you thirsty and stranded, Katrina
He thought it was cool to carry a gun in his classroom and open fire, Virginia Tech, Columbine, stop the violence
They thought it was cool to tear down the projects and put up million dollar condos, gentrification
They think it's cool to stand on the block hiding product in their socks to make quick dime bag dollars
They think it's cool to ride down on you in blue and white unmarked cars busting you upside your head
Freeze
Cause the problem is we think it's cool too
Check your ingredients before you overdose on The Cool
"The international community struggles
To get help into Haiti following
The worst disaster in United Nations history
Amidst the frustration and chaos
Surrounding the humanitarian efforts on the ground
There have been some miraculous rescues"

[Kenna]
Like a phoenix
From its ashes
We will rise
Follow angels
Into heavens
We will rise
Nothing's gonna take you down
We are everlasting now
We are everlasting now, now

[Lupe Fiasco] + (Kenna)
Now I've been shaken
But I'm not broken
I won't be breaking
Anytime
I have fallen
But I'm not ruined
I'll keep on moving
Into my
Resurrection
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)
Resurrection
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)

[Lupe Fiasco]
Urgency, emergency's among us
Life is in the crisis, tragedy's upon us
And we won't leave you stranded
Rapidly we comin'
To take you out the darkness
Show you where the sun is
Cries from the rubble
Are the voices this is sung with
And those that have stopped singing
We can still hear you under it
Right up out your worrying
Right into the wondrous
Right up off the ground
Right to where the thunder is
And it's where your sisters
And your mothers and your brothers is
Aunties and your friends
And your fathers and your husbads is
Watching with the rest of the world in astonishment
Live from up above, us via news coverage
Seen even more than the misery that happens is
The love, the strength, the history, the passion
The courage of an impoverished people
That the world once abandoned
Shining, infinite everlasting now

[Lupe Fiasco] + (Kenna)
Now I've been shaken
But I'm not broken
I won't be braking
Anytime
I have fallen
But I'm not ruined
I'll keep on moving
Into my
Resurrection
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)
Resurrection
Into my resurrection
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)
Resurrection
Into my resurrection
Resurrection
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)
Resurrection
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)
We pray every prayer we know
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)

[Kenna]
We will rise up
We will rise up
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh
We will rise up
We will rise up
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh
We will rise up
We will rise up
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh
We will rise up

[Intro]
(Turbulence. Can you feel? Turbulence) Okay. (Can you feel?)
I need to spit something real for a second y'all. (Turbulence)
Just bare with me. Listen. (Can you feel? Turbulence.)

[Verse]
Skull and crossbones and death bandannas
A liquor store on every corner in Atlanta
Cops ridin' around tossin' niggas in the slammer
Tell me what's wrong, I could really use some answers
Now-a-days everybody wants to be a rapper
About two years ago everybody was a trapper
Obviously, money is what everybody's after
'Cause slavery ain't change; it's a modern day disaster
Now these are my words from me to you
Everything you do from your shades to your shoes
From your chains to your coupe came from the tube
Trust me, I would know, I was raised on it too
Okay, now just let me get your attention
I'ma turn the tables so you don't get defensive
I'ma put my bullshit aside for a second
'Cause I can't be fake 'cause God won't let me
I used to wear a grill, because it was the trend
Not because I liked it, I just wanted to fit in
Then I got "Eastside" tatted on my skin
And I tried to get dreads but my hair was too big
But I was lost, I ain't know who I was
What else was there to do besides look like a thug?
So in my senior year at Columbia High
I dropped out of high school when I got signed
B-dot-O-dot-B was the name
I ain't like Bobby Ray 'cause I was ashamed
But you can call me Bobby Ray from this day forth
And I could give a damn about the fame and fortune
Honestly, I don't even listen to rap
'Cause when I turn the radio on, out comes crap
And if you make good music that's okay
But on the radio, that they don't play
It's easy to see we created a beast
'Cause everybody wants to hear what they don't need
And now all the rappers got to struggle to give you
That bullshit music so they can continue to live
The position that I'm in
Is quite an interesting predicament, I will admit
But you can count on me 'cause I'm refusing to give in
'Cause I'ma give you music 'cause we need it to exist, bitch!
So I'ma play my guitar
Rap about aliens and sing about stars
'Til you understand that's what we are
So we ain't got to struggle no more so we don't starve
I swear to God I love you with every bar
We all got problems that need to be solved
So while I got the mic I'ma speak my thoughts
And I'ma keep it real till the day I fall

[Coda]
Turn my music up!

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport, they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off of this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, "Take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things, my Black balls

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Ayy, yo
I done copped Timbs, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Not for nothing, I've forseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Intro]
Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But ayy
What'd Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (Heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre  and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Momma's only gone for the moment

[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Post-Chorus]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)

[Verse 1]
Look, I'm so raw, turn the oven on
Chef Papa John, I get the parmesan
She want a yellow nigga, corn on the cob
Indian giver, slob on my knob
The bitch blow hard, harder than some Halls
Here, take 'em all, you'll be straight in the morn'
I'm two peace gone, I'm never gon' call
Fly nigga, I don't wear it if it's in the mall
Seen it on the blogs, these motherfuckers cost
Yves Saint Laurent, you can tell by the fonts
I do what I want, wake up when it's lunch
Walk like I'm drunk, uh, swagga so uh
Goyard trunks, go around, I got a bunch
Tell TSA, "Bitch, get up out my stuff"
I wouldn't recommend you to ever check 'em in
I started with the end so when do I begin?

[Verse 2]
I'm so raw, turn the oven on
Chef Papa John, I get the parmesan
Pocket full of paper, underage in casinos
You wanna see ID, oh? But I'm in the suite though
Here my room-key, go, room movin' slow-mo
Fans want a photo, but it's my turn to roll
Hold up, baby, hold those, you see I'm chillin', dolo
Lens with a logo, pinky ring, Frodo
I'm feelin' my self, no ho-h-h-homo
Hold that beat, poor that more ro-r-r-roso
Rosé, you bozos, couldn't speak what I'm on
You would need Rosetta Stone
All these niggas all clones, we be originals
Young Money Seminoles, tribe full of generals
Don't ask me shit unless it's in a interview, nigga
Unless it's in a interview

[Outro]
Ha, don't talk to me, I'm not your friend
I'm just a fan of a fan
Haha, I love all my fans though
Mmm

[Chorus]
One good thing about music
When it hits you (You feel no pain)
Whoa, whoa I say one good thing about music
When it hits you (You feel no pain)
Hit me with music, hit me with music, now
This is

[Post-Chorus]

Oh now, I said, you feel no pain, now

Feel no pain
Hit me with music now, oh now

Hit me with music, harder
Brutalize me (Hit me with music)
This is!

[Verse 2]

(Grooving) And then it's Kingston 12, uh!

[Outro]
Good God! Looky here now (You feel no pain)
Uh! Hit me with music

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

[Bridge: Rihanna]
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Chorus: Dev]
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right, gettin' slizard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6

[Chorus: Dev]
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard

[Verse 2: Cataracs]

Take that bottle to the head, and let me see you fly

[Refrain: Cataracs]
Hell yeah, drink it up, drink-drink it up
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk
They be actin like they drunk, actin'-actin' like they drunk
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk

Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6

[Verse 1]
Can I, can I save you from you?
'Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you've been sippin's not supposed to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do, yeah
'Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I must say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making a mistake I never learned from

[Hook]
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I believe in people like you

[Verse 2]
'Cause who am I to judge you on the past, girl
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
But it's too late, 'cause I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before

[Hook]
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I believe in people like you

[Verse 3]
Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and starting over
Girl, quit playing you just drunk. You just saying shit
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and shit
Oh, wait... No, I get it girl, I'm with it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson
It's feeling like the second chance and its the first impression
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
'Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
How reckless I have been
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in
Making all the same mistakes and I'm just trying to correct it
And I fall...

[Hook]
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I believe in people like you

Not looking for trouble
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it, motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks
Yes!
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
All I see is black roses, drug dealer poses
Shoveling that devil’s angel up they noses
Never let jail turn my Shyne into Moses
Couldn’t cleanse my soul with them Civil Rights hoses
Panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster
Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
Kélian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her
Photo-op is priceless, frame our wanted posters
The audacity, war brings casualty
Bitch, have my son before I face that tragedy
Ugh, I order hits, she orders mahi
R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the Shower Posse, gone!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I miss the misogyny, bad bitches massagin' me
Sometimes, we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please don’t judge me, ugh, for the following:
Fat bitches swallowing, skinny bitches modeling
Take off that Givenchy and let’s get raunchy
I'll have your face looking all Captain Crunch-y
The devil stay testing
'Cause when you chase the pussy, it’s a sin
But if it falls in your lap, it’s a blessin'
Soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressing
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers...

[Interlude: CyHi the Prynce]
CyHi!
Yeah!

[Verse 3: CyHi the Prynce]
Boy, we lookin’ for trouble
Maybe if we wasn’t Black, then we wouldn’t have struggled
Player, all I got is trap niggas and crooks in my huddle
They cook and I smuggle, got 20 pounds of kush in the duffle
So I’m running through them circles, boy, I’m lookin like Knuckles
Look at my knuckles, got the hook in, ’cause niggas was looking
I’ve tooken some whoopings, so trust me, dog, I’m good for a scuffle
Don’t be mad I whooped your ass 'cause I’ve tooken a couple
Feds asking niggas questions, but I wouldn’t rebuttal
'Cause I’m Jake Gyllenhaal, I’m in the hood with the bubble
With a tall model broad like I took her from Russell
Didn’t play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle
Huh, royal flush, so kiss my royal nuts
Ain’t nothing silver-spooned, I came from the soil, bruh
But now, I’m eatin’ off of Raffaello Gold
Exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes
But don’t get it confused when I rap these mellow flows
'Cause all my Titos got bricks like the yellow road

Marijuana mountains, drinks you’re not pronouncing
Three chains on, I don’t need no bouncers
Nothing less than a G stashed in my trousers (Boy)
New double Ds smashed in her blouses
Fuck a hotel, my nigga we rent houses (Houses)
My nigga, we rent houses
So many wedding rings lost in them couches
I’m just a Westside lover
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber
This is showtime, showtime, boy, I hope you set the DVR
Stacking money face to face, this shit look like CPR
‘Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne
So now I’m snappin’ like yo ass just finished the poem
Does he sound like 'Ye, Jay or Drizzy Drake? (Drizzy Drake)
Meanwhile I’m chillin’ with all these niggas, counting all this money you ain’t
Consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime
A killer before the crime, a B.I.G. before the dying
Greet me with a middle finger when you see me
It’s cool 'cause I can’t see yo ass from this side of the TV, motherfucker!

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
What you now hear is puttin’ fear in all the older ones
Downplayed me to downgrade me like they don’t notice him
Your shoes too big to fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in ‘em
Fucking hoes while teachin' niggas to hold your sons
This the rap Moses—scratch that, Mary and Joseph’s son
High as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
Never say I’m better than Hov, but I’m the closest one
Heard you lookin’ for trouble, what, I’m 'sposed to run?
Your bitch invited me inside her, ain’t I 'sposed to come?
Got niggas that’ll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
Now you outside of Heaven’s gate, frontin’ like you know someone
Talking hard, but y’all still ain’t push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain’t pussy
Hmm, fuck it, everybody can get it
When you’re this hot, everybody’s a critic
But when you’re this high, everybody’s a midget
All this mean-mugging from niggas that mean nothing
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from quarter to broke to half-past-rich
With my badass bitch
And you don’t want no problems, on some math class shit
So check the young genius out
Fuck the world, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiending ’bout
What you been praying for? What you been screaming ’bout?
Ironic, you been sleeping on the one that you been dreaming 'bout

[Refrain: Rihanna & Drake]
Oh na-na, what's my name?

[Verse 1: Drake]
I heard you good with them soft lips
Yeah, you know, word of mouth
The square root of sixty-nine is eight somethin', right?
'Cause I've been tryna work it out, oh
Good weed, white wine, uh
I come alive in the night time, yeah
Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio
Let it play
Say you gotta leave, but I know you wanna stay
You just waitin' on the traffic jam to finish, girl
The things that we could do in twenty minutes, girl
Say my name, say my name, wear it out
It's gettin' hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as you go, the text that I write is gon' say

[Refrain: Rihanna]
Oh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name?
What's my name? What's my name?

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Not everybody
Knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it
But, boy, you stay up on it
You got that somethin'
That keeps me so off balance
Baby, you're a challenge
Let's explore your talent

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you
Can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
Baby, you got me
And ain't nowhere that I'd be
Than with your arms around me
Back and forth, you rock me, yeah
So I surrender
To every word you whisper
Every door you enter
I will let you in

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you
Can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Ooh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over
Lookin' for a guy to put in work
Oh woah, oh woah

[Bridge: Rihanna]
You're so amazing
You took the time to figure me out
That's why you take me
Way past the point of turnin' me on
You 'bout to break me
I swear you got me losin' my mind

[Refrain: Rihanna]
Oh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe 'til I see what I wanna see
And what I wanna see is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently; you just being hurt
Just ain't gonna work for me, it just wouldn't be
Sufficient enough 'cause we are just gonna be
Enemies as long as we breathe, I don't ever see
Either of us comin' to terms where we can agree
There ain't gonna be no reasonin' speakin' with me
You speak on my seed, then me no speak-a Inglés
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin' unless
You're gonna agree to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face-to-face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me that you've never seen
And you're gonna see this gangster pee on himself
I see you D12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seein' you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close to see you exposed as phony
Come on, bitch, show me! Pick me up, throw me!
Lift me up, hold me—just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all of you, Ja, you'll get it too

[Chorus: Eminem & DMX]
Now go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close your eyes!
And go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Die, motherfucker, die!
Bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
Why? Die, motherfucker! Ah, ah, ah, go to sleep, bitch!

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
We got you niggas nervous on purpose
To hurt your focus, you's not MCs
You's worthless, you's not them G's
You's a circus, you's no appeal, please
Use curtains, you use words Kool Herc slurred
In two-thousand-third: you's perpin'
You's no threat, who's you servin'?
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseein' the Earth
Shady, mothafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold I become more cursed
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse
Is he who depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You's not the streets, you's the desk
Use not your chest, nigga, use a vest
Before tools choose your rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth

[Chorus: Eminem & DMX]
Now go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close your eyes!
And go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Die, motherfucker, die!
Bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
Why? Die, motherfucker! Ah, ah, ah, go to sleep, bitch!

[Verse 3: DMX]
Hey dog, I'ma walk like a beast (Yeah), talk like the streets (Yeah)
I'ma stay blazin' New York with the heat (Yeah)
Stalk on the beat (Yeah), walk with my feet (Ugh!)
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sleet (What!)
Peep how I'm movin' (Uh-huh), peep where I'm goin' (Uh-huh)
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin' (Woo!)
But I'ma keep growin', gettin' larger than life
Easy goin' with the same one that started the fight
He be knowin' how dog get when dog gonna bite (Ugh!)
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life (Ugh!)
Grand Champ, and my Blood Line is tight (What!)
'Cause it's all good (Yeah!), 'cause it's all right (Come on!)
Niggas tried to holla but couldn't holla back
Now they got to swallow everything in the sack
Blood Line, and we can go track for track
Damn, dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that?

[Chorus: Eminem & DMX]
Now go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close your eyes!
And go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Die, motherfucker, die!
Bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
Why? Die, motherfucker! Ah, ah, ah, go to sleep, bitch!

[Outro: Eminem & DMX]
All you motherfuckers, take that! (Ugh!)
Here, take this too, bitch!
Uh, uh, uh, uh, wahoo!
We're killing all you motherfuckers dead
All of you! Fake-ass gangsters!
No more press! No more press!
Rot, motherfuckers, rot! (Uh-huh!)
Decay, in the dirt, bitch, in the motherfuckin' dirt!
Die nameless bitch! Die nameless!
No more fame! Ahh, hahahaha
Yo, X, come on, man! (Woo!) Obie, let's go! Ha ha

[Intro]
Plain Pat, what up?

[Verse 1]
My heart thump
Not from being nervous
Sometimes I'm thinking God
Made me special here on purpose
So all the while, 'til I'm gone
Make my words important
So if I slip away, if I die today
The last thing you remember won't be
About some apple bottom jeans
With the boots with the fur
Maybe how I dream of being free since my birth
Cursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse
Have you ever heard of some shit so real
Beyond, from the heart, from the soul, you can feel

[Chorus]
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral

[Verse 2]
My mind runs
I could never catch it
Even if I got a head start
God please help me
I am feeling so alone, wait
I don't need to worry
'Cause I know the world'll feel this, nigga
Blessing in disguise, but
I am not hiding who I am, open your eyes, bruh
If I ever met you, I appreciate the love, yo
Girls that I dated, it's okay, I am not mad, yo
Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho
The shit is so ill
Play it back from the top if you recognize real

[Chorus]
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral

[Outro]
I'm ready for that
I'm ready for the funeral, hey-hey
I'm ready for the funeral, hey
I'm ready for the funeral
Hey, I'm ready for it
I'm ready for it
I'm ready for the funeral

[Refrain: Rihanna]
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo

Ladies, don't worry 'cause they got plenty more

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Men be fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Oh, it's rainin' men, girl, what you worried 'bout?

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Who you think you getting with that "Hi, let me freak ya"?
You got me mistaken thinking you gon' get it easy
First of all, you need to know that I'm not the one
Think you gettin' somethin', baby, you ain't gettin' none
All you need to know that I'm a two times five
Load it, cock it, aim it, baby, boom bye-bye
Set your standards lower, boy, you're aimin' too high
Matter of fact, your friend looks better, so goodbye

[Refrain: Rihanna]
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo
Catch a playa by the toe
If you want to, let him go

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Excuse me, but who are you fixin' to be?
Let them motherfuckers know there's plenty fish in the sea
And he sweatin' me just 'cause I got the tightest hole
But I couldn't find that-that thing with a microscope (Oh)
Give me dome, dome, da-da-da-da-da-dome, dome, dome
I ain't trippin' on your money, money, long, long, long
Want my own TV production company
So tell Harpo to hit me, Celie
Anyway, RiRi, what rhymes with your name freely?
Money got you vacationing in Chile
Do you wanna sit on the back while I wheelie?
Really? Really? No, for real, really?
Laid out on the beach, they be feeding me my catfishes
'Cause it's raining men, fat bitches

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Men be fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Oh, it's rainin' men, girl, what you worried 'bout?

[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]

Oh woah, woah, woah

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
I said ayy, outta my way, where my ladies?
Ridin' big, living good, doin' big things
Dancin' don't pay
Player, keep the money, I can buy my own drink
Up in the club (Ayy)
See men coming, dime a dozen
So it don't mean nothin' to me (Ayy)
And I ain't even worried about you, homie
'Cause there’s plenty more fish in the sea (Okay)

[Refrain: Rihanna]
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo
Catch a playa by the toe

Girl, come a bit closer, look in my eyes
Searching is so wrong, I'm Mr. Right

[Intro: Timbaland]
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: Ryan Tedder, Timbaland]
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say that

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder, Timbaland]
It's too late to apologize
It's too late (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I said it's too late to apologize

Woah, oh-oh (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2: Ryan Tedder]
I'd take another chance
Take a fall, take a shot for you, oh-woah
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new, yeah, yeah
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you say
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you, but I'm afraid

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder, Timbaland]
It's too late to apologize
It's too late (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

Baby, you summertime fine

Tryna get beside you like the number nine, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wonderin' what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me
'Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin' to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollerin', “Who was that?”
“Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?”
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little Patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, baby, you wintertime cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm tryna make the goosebumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women 'cause my aunt she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm jokin', I mean that thing is pokin'
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provokin'
I got bath water that you can soak in, things I could do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it
Yeah, when lights comin' through the drapes and we both yawnin'
I roll over and ask if I can hit it in the mornin'

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, the Sun risin' while you moanin', baby
Can I hit it in the mornin', uh?
Can I hit it in the mornin', yeah?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Hey, God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the woman that can hold Patron
God bless her homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you was clear
I'm learnin' not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear
Therefore you shouldn't judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here?
Just say you're scared if you're scared
But if you through frontin', we can do somethin'
And you know just what I'm talkin' about
Tomorrow you'll be callin' out
'Cause tonight we gettin' right into the wee morn'
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my own way, you think about me all day
That's just a warnin'

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin', yeah

Man, I swear to keep it one hundred
And if I ain't have it, then I'll be dead
My soul's been fed tonight
Everything that I choose, still can't forget Grey Goose
Converse covered with mixer juice
And all my niggas rolling up in the booth
Who got me on another one?
Someone please roll me another one
They tell me all good things must end
But those motherfuckers ain't have this friend
I keep

Oh, oh, oh, oh
And... 4:20

[Intro: Akon, Young Jeezy, & Lil Wayne]
Rubbing on that Italian leather
Them Konvict jeans on
You ready?
Yeah
Yeah
Geah! (Konvict)

[Chorus: Akon & Young Jeezy]
I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid
Number one hustler, getting money (Ayy)
Why you wanna count my money?  (Ayy)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
I'm so paid

[Verse 1: Akon]
I see police on that crooked-I
Doing a hundred on Interstate 95
My shawty leaning, blasting that Do or Die
Wishing that a muddasucka would, ‘cause we certified
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hope they never call off
And them snipers sitting on the roof already saw y'all
It ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
Rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than let them haters come and make a name off me
That's why...

[Chorus: Akon & Young Jeezy]
I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid
Number one hustler, getting money (Ayy)
Yo, Bu—I told you I had you, homeboy
Why you wanna count my money? (Ayy, yeah!)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
Yo, 'Kon, I got you!
I'm so paid

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
She said, "Young, why your voice so hoarse?"
I just sound like money, baby, I should've been a Porsche (Vroom)
Paint look like a sugar-free Red Bull (Woo)
I'm so paid, you know I keep a pocket full (Haha)
And that's before the taxes
Took my whole gross net and hid it under my mattress (Damn)
I used to get bored and count twenties for practice (What?)
Paper therapy, we let that money relax us (Yeah)
Gold chains 'round my neck just like Michael Phelps
I made a killing in the water (Oh), kill them with the water (Oh)
Against all odds, and I will not stop (Will not stop)
They try and keep me on bottom, but I prefer the top (Yeahhh)
And my project chick, I moved her next to Joc
She said the house was too small, I moved an extra block (Haha)
So, baby, get your ass up, I need an extra block (Ayy)
I told her, "Do the speed limit and no extra stops"
And that's why... (That's why)

[Chorus: Akon & Young Jeezy]
I get it in 'til the sunrise (Yeah! Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Yeah! Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid (Yeah)
Number one hustler, getting money (What's up? What's up?)
Why you wanna count my money? (Ayy)
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
You can't count it!
I'm so paid

[Verse 3: Akon]
I am the boss it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off, that's all
(Guess what?) I won't be taking that fall
Homie, I got cake, that's what I'm paying them for
Haha, ain't that funny?
‘Cause niggas, they want war but ain't got money
‘Cause I've seen them all talking until they start gunning
Quicker than Usain Bolt, the fastest thing running
Yeah, Akon, Weezy (Jeezy!)
Black Royals holdin' down Jersey (Jersey)
Devine making sure we getting it up front
My little brother Bu got that vision, baby

[Chorus: Akon, Young Jeezy, & Lil Wayne]
I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid (Yeah)
Number one hustler, getting money (Ayy)
Why you wanna count my money? (Ayy)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
I'm so paid (Sheesh!)

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Ah-em, Big Money Weezy
White wife-beater with the Sig underneath it
How do I feel? Bitch, I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers, disappear from the precinct, yeah
I'm ballin', we ball out
Ball 'til we fall until the ball bounce
I send some niggas with guns to y'all house
Only to find out you live in a dollhouse, damn!
But I thought you was tough, though
We carry choppers on our necks; call it "cutthroat"
We bury cowards on the set that they come from
We know magic, turn weed smoke to gun smoke
We! Bomb first when we ride
You! In a hearse when you ride (Ayy, ayy)
I put my shoe down, baby
And I'm holding down Young Mula, baby
That's why...

[Chorus: Akon & Young Jeezy]
I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid
Number one hustler, getting money (Ayy)
Why you wanna count my money?  (Ayy)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
I'm so paid

Okay, great. I heard you. Bye
Like a boss!

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Wolf with a T-Rex cock, less talk
While I invest stock in wet rock
Smoke with all the big bitches bumping "Bedrock"
Sub in the trunk, thumping up against the dead cops
And pop it like I tossed a match in the engine
And go harder than a fucking crack intervention
Clown of the class and the last to attend it
Big Earl make you fags stand at attention
Odd Future, I'm your motherfucking general
Catch 'em where them slap, slash, stab bitch ass niggas go
Girl, you ain't even gotta ask 'cause you finna know
Why this Playboy so sticky in this centerfold
Sticky what my niggas blow, icky Earl finish foes
Hit 'em low, riddle them with Chronicles of Riddick bows
Chronic in the spliff to the dome, got my system slow
So I'm walking out, ask them niggas what they sprinting fo'

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Black Ted Bundy, sick as John Gacy
Chilling with a possible victim, she was 18
A hitchhiker hippie whore, met her at the liquor store
She frequented to help support the habit picked up in the fourth
Grade A piece of ass, so I plan on screwing it
Slipped a couple Rufilin inside the bitch's juice and gin
Next thing you know, we're on Earl's burgundy carpet
She's kicking and screaming, begging for me to fucking stop it
Look, you know it's not rape if you like it, bitch
So sit down like a pretty ho and don't fight the shit
Or else I'll have to tie a pretty bow 'round your bloody neck
Hide the slices from the gashes given with a dull Gillette
Mop the blood up, put the body in the apartment
Stash it where we hide the marijuana and the condoms
"Hey, what's that?", don't touch it or even fucking look
You are Fantasia and the body bag's a fucking book

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt & Hodgy]
Yo, Vince, let me tell you 'bout these hoes I met last night
They thought I was cute till I asked what that ass like
Damn right, red light, ran right through it
"You don't even have your permit, what the fuck are you doing?"
Well maybe if you shut the fuck up, we'd be cruising
And you wouldn't be sitting, boohooing 'bout your bruises
But, no, you wanna be Miss Fuck-with-the-Music
I'm zoning on Relapse, she's sliding on Blueprint
Three seconds it takes for her to turn blue
With my hands around her throat, her arms stopped moving
Pulse stops too, in the back, look confused
As I turn to tell 'em both not to do shit stupid
Red, white, blue lights in the rear-view, shit
Swerved to the shoulder, tell 'em both no moving
Sit down in the back 'cause the windows tinted
As I rolled down mine to forge a new friendship
"Aren't you a little too young to be driving?"
Look, officer, I'm just tryna get home
"Get out the fucking car with your license and registration"
I ain't getting outta shit, you're starting to try my patience
Didn't have backup, I could tell by the Hummingbike
Reached to the glove, grabbed the motherfucking hunting knife
Stabbed him in his neck and hip, threw him in the trunk and dipped
Back to the fucking crib for some tea and crumpets, shit

[Outro: Earl Sweatshirt]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull ‘em like a tutor, in fact
A dead one in the front, dead cop in the back
And two live bitches screaming "Odd Future is back"

[Part I]

[Intro: Drake]
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, say baby, I had to mention
That if you were a star, you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like they're in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Tryna take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to, put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

[Chorus: Drake]
Shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—

[Interlude: Drake & The-Dream]
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you, Ki-Killa, Killa

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
Uh, girl you the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl he's out his mind
You the finest (Oh-whoa)
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, every time you come around
Shutting it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And let me put you in them Louboutins
What you want, what you need (Yeah)
I can be (Yeah) your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it
But if they had it, wouldn't know what to do with it

[Chorus: Drake & The-Dream, Drake & The-Dream]
And together, we shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
They know we'd shut it down
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) round (Aye) round (Aye)
And they'd notice (They'd know) they'd notice (They'd know)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
They know we'd shut it down
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
Every time we come around (Aye) round (Aye) round (Aye)
(And they're on it) And they'd notice (They'd know) they'd notice
They'd know you shut it down

[Bridge: The-Dream]
TMZ, Concrete Loop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Ice cream conversations, they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down

[Verse 3: Drake & The-Dream]
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets (Yes indeed)
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she look like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until ya find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she ain't got my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl, who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious—

[Chorus: The-Dream & Drake]
You shut that thing down, you shut it down
Down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You shut it down, you shut it down
Down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You shut it down, you shut it down
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
You shut it, oh, oh
And they'd notice, they'd notice

[Bridge: The-Dream]
You looking good girl, go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You looking good girl, go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You shut it down
You shut it down, down, down, down, down...

[Part II]

[Verse 4: Drake]
The way I’m feeling, things I say
All just happen, when you pass my way, oh
What can I do, to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl, I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I’m not tryna say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed, and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it’s worth it, girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me

[Outro: Drake]
Lay you down, down, down
I’m tryna lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
They'd notice, they'd notice
Let me lay you down, down, down
Tryna lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it

[Verse 1]
Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn and
I thought that you were here with me
If you could only see how much I love you
You'd want to trust me

[Pre-Chorus]
(I was really lovin' you, baby) Oh, in my dream
(I was really lovin' you, baby) I was loving you
(I was really lovin' you, baby) Every place
(Really, really lovin' you, baby) That you wanted me to

[Chorus]
(I'd like to do it now) Since I believe in dreams and fantasies
(I've got to give you everything)
I'd like to make love to you right there baby
Ooh, I've got this real strong need to love you everywhere
I won't stop until I find your passions flowing like wine
Baby, baby, please let me do it to you

[Verse 2]
(Oh no, I never gave up no head) I never, gave head before
But there's always the first time, you know
So I made up my mind (Come on baby, first time)
(Come on baby) Soon I'll be loving you
(Come on baby, come on baby) That's all I'm interested in
I've made up my mind
Soon I'll be loving you, girl I know what I'm gonna do

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't wait to touch you, to give you that feeling
Eat you up my dear so that your mood will be revealing baby
And soon as I know I've got you willing baby

[Chorus]
I'm going to give you some head baby
Giving up my life, keeping up the faith, that's what I'll do because I'm hung up on you (Gonna give you some head!)
I'm gone knock you right up woman

I'm going to give you some head, sugar, I know what to do
I want to give you some head, ah you big fine woman
Woo, I love to give it, baby, 'cause I know just what to do with it
Ah I'm going to give the ultimate love baby, the ultimate love baby
Don't you know I can handle you
Soon, soon, soon I'll be loving you, oh Janis
You're so fine, oh how I love you

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Dope shit like that, Jerm
Oh, hi
Welcome back to K.I.D.S., um
Follow your dreams
Yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Wanna get a mansion, a jacuzzi
A theater to watch my movies
Couple whips and lots of fancy things
The kids they call the Goonies
I see the future, crystal ball
Mirror mirror hangin' on the wall
Who the flyest white boy of them all?
Got your girlfriend screenin' all the calls
She bubblin', we fuckin', then you cuddlin'
Like, baby, where the fuck you been?
Don't wanna tell you she in love with him
So, so we ain't sayin' nothin'
You could probably tell she bluffin'
'Cause she kiss you with the mouth
She gave me head with my concussion
Yeah, she blushin', all red
Wanna rush and go to bed
You interrogate that bitch like you the feds
So she says she in love with a rockstar, rockstar
Wanna smoke my weed, so she asks me where the tops are, tops are

[Chorus: Empire of the Sun & Mac Miller]
Oh (Top drawer, haha), oh, oh (Yeah)
Honey, I need you 'round (Haha)
I know, I know (Just some motherfuckin' kids)
Oh, oh, oh
Honey, I need you 'round (Make money, fuck bitches)
I know (Yeah), I know (Pittsburgh, hey, Jerm, hey)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
These hoes is drunk, wanna come and smoke this blunt
Then let me take 'em home and do anything I want
I said, baby, I can ride you, just let me get inside you
I can take you higher if you hit this vaporizer
I got that dope dick, I'll be your supplier
You grabbin' on my sheets and hittin' notes like you Mariah
Obsessed with me
Undress a freak on ecstasy
I'm out and then she textin' me
Like, "What you doin' next week, next week?" (Yeah)

[Bridge: Empire of the Sun & Mac Miller]
Hear me now
I'm down on knees and praying
Though my faith is weak
Without you so please, baby, please
Give us a chance
Make amends and I will stand up 'til the end
A million times, a trillion more (Hey)

[Chorus: Empire of the Sun & Mac Miller]
Oh, oh, oh (Hey, I just wanted to inform y'all)
Honey, I need you 'round (I'm drunk as fuck)
I know, I know (Most Dope, bitch, hey)
Oh, oh, oh (K.I.D.S., what's up?)
Honey, I need you 'round (I'm high as fuck, yeah, yes, sir)
I know, I know (Oh, I graduated, oh yeah, I just graduated high school, haha)

[Outro: Mac Miller & Empire of the Sun]
Hey, homie
Don't be mad that your girl loves me (Don't cut anything yet)
It's not my fault (Yeah)
I'm just doin' me (Haha)
If your girl love me, let her love me, you feel me?
So, baby
Smile (Uh-huh)
Baby, don't cry
I will only fly
With you by my side

[Verse]
I don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
And blow the fee from my last four shows
I do one song and use four flows
She used to be a Christian before
Now, all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like, "Baby, those are cute, I adore those"
Me and the salesman build a rapport so
He understand the fact that I'm spending offshore dough
Cash-only transactions, homie
And please, no receipts—the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dont know I bought it
Been doing it for years, homie; thoroughly, I thought it...
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track
Admitting most of my currency’s imported
But too late now, it's too legitimate to hit 'em with...
A lawsuit, even if those are acts that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker playing in the whip
As they pull me over, "my sweet surrender"
I got a Jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A Menschkeit, as they say; he’s a legal bender
And ATF is present, every regal member
The coalition is so efficient
You have to be invited, or there's no admission
We know tradition, we spend money
So don't try to compete if you in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is just solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Used to record in the basement that Renny grew his piff in
When Pops turned over keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen
'Til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team-playing, no screen-setting
"Because I wanna win games, Coach, I'm through assisting"
The takeover, the break's over, nigga
And I'ma keep killing 'em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshitting, but I am equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality, so eager to hate something
And try to play it off like it ain't jumping
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased sound vacant
'Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinking what I could've done to make my first video groundbreaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
Aside from talking 'bout the D I'm throwing in your wife
I treat this one session as if it were my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life, like that!

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Bangladesh
No Ceilings, motherfucker
Hahaha, yeah
Uh-huh, all right
Uh-huh, all right, ugh

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Nice tires on the 'Ghini, you should wanna king me
Brain-dead flow: vegetable, zucchini
I live on the beach; she walk around in her bikini
Girls are like school, and I cut ‘em like seniors
I’m here to distinguish the bears from the penguins
Life is just a gap—get some money in between it
Glocks like police, pumps like Finas
This beat getting totaled: Pam, Keisha, Kima
S—Sitting on the world, thinking 'bout a girl
Pistol on my side, paint you like a mural
Digged in my pocket, pulled out a party
Be cool 'fore you get stomped and pulled out the party
H—Hollygrove shit, I'm on my Hollygrove shit
Looking for a bad bitch, I give her dinosaur dick
Big-bad-flow Weezy, fuck the polices
Church, like a choir and a couple of old priestses
Elevator in my crib 'cause it's five floors
I'm not expecting you to have one inside yours, haha
Vince Young, suicide doors, haha
Life’s a bitch; now, die for her

[Verse 2: Short Dawg]
I have the type of flow niggas don’t have to like (Why's that?)
My rhymes is ambidextrous so I don’t have to write
(Oh, you ain't know?)
The way I’m eating, niggas wish they had my appetite (Ugh)
Straight up out of Texas and I’m major like Applewhite (Haha)
I pour four; then, I hit the exit door ('Bout to...)
Take a trip to Macy’s cop the whole second floor (Gimme that)
Whores smell the scent of money coming out my pores (Smell it?)
Yeah, my pockets full of dead people like a morgue, boy (Haha)
I made it from a flyer to the Forbes (See me?)
Young Elvis Freshley, yes, he flyer than a stork (Damn)
Dropping babies off in your chick's cheek (Ugh), kicks neat (Fresh)
Got your son looking up to me like I’m six feet (Haha)
Your daughter need someone to save her (What?), not me (Nah)
I’m knocking hoes down like Laila (Who?) Ali (Yeah)
Try he, and I'ma put the toaster to your kidney (Uh-huh)
Then, I pull off in a Bentley, top open like a chimney (Goddamn!)
Yeah, it’s No Ceilings, like a coliseum (No Ceilings)
Candy slab, paint dripping like gonorrhea (That's nasty)
The way I'm leaning, I'ma nod if I stand still (Hold up)
Flow harder than an anvil, Short

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
OK, it's Gudda, ho! All about my bills like Buffalo
Your bitch under my sheets, I heard she was an undercover ho (Ha)
Purple got me moving slow, like I’m in a snail race
Pop, pop, pop, three shots to the head, then I pick up my shell case
Leave 'em with a pale face, yes, I am a Young Money goon
Your girl like a motion picture, she gon’ be coming soon
I do her something rude, I pop her like balloons
I pass her off to Millz, then drop her off to Tune (Ha)
Couple screws loose, you don't want to play with him
This is No Ceilings, bitch, roofless like a stadium
We shut down every fucking spot these bitches see us in
You want us in your club? Well, nigga, pay us then
All-grey BM, I’m getting it for my baby M
She told me get the money and count it for me when I rake it in
Don’t play no games, ho, you know my name, ho
G—G-U-D-D-A, propane flow

[Intro]
I said think of your future
You can't do that tomorrow
But you don't hear a word; you see that SLR

[Verse 1]
O ye tormented souls
My goal is to sit on the globe like North Poles
And thats the top mang, going hammer like a Glock can't
All flow and grammar, no shot drank
I'm so sober when I speak
I call it catching bullets with my teeth
You can feel it in your chest
Like Bruce Lee jumping on your vest
But I can't feel yours through my Superman 'S'
Yes, I'm Superman'd-out
Rare Cartier look like Superman house
Inshallah to my plan hope it super pans out
My life is like Italia doin 100 miles
And the top open like the roofer ran outta tiles
Walk right into Philippe's when I ran outta Chow's
Next up is crustaceans and fast food halals
The beef is all the same, its just how they kill the cows
Somebody tell Malcolm X that I'm tryna steal his style
And tell Cornel West that I'm tryna steal his fro
Go back in time, take the slaves plows, shovels, and the hoes
The masters get the "It Was Written" intro
SLR 10-4
SLR 10-4
Soundtrakk let the beat go
Soundtrakk let the beat roll

[Chorus]
In this world I'm so alone
In a category all on my own
Cause I tell the world what I want to
Yea I tell the world what I want to
Man I feel so alone
They treat me like an outcast
Cause I tell the world what I want to
But you can't tell me what you gon do

[Verse 2]
Cause nigga, I don't believe that
Like 9/11 came from Iraq
Mayweather on the speedbag
Automatic weapons keep the same rhythm he has
That's how the hood sound
Grew up in the hood town
West side ghetto, Windy City Cook Count
Black skies lookin' up, crack pipes lookin' down
Accused of not lookin back, blind nigga look around
City on my back, so the CHI go errywhere I'm at
Presence so shiny, Mercedes so matte
Cop that from Platinum, the color of my plaque
I memorize "Color's" off of Yo! MTV Raps
A nightmare walking in a psychopath's nap
Defeat your purpose like a weed stash in the rehab
Guess who's sneaking in the weed bags
That be me with my me ass
Not tryna be anything but free as
Flow is so nuts, the track is gettin teabagged
Just wanna rap nice, that ain't me - tag
If you wanna be mean, then you wanna be me bad
Call it being Pretty Lyrically Swag
Soulja call it Super Lupe Lyrical
You can't understand me nor mimic my miracles
All I see is me and I'm a mother lovin' mirror-full
Bein' dope is all in the muscle
It's more than just a pause and a chuckle
I bench press elephants, and bowlin ball juggle
So don't be scared to take the Super Lu route
Top 5 alive and I only got 2 out!
School ya on your history, I tell ya what you 'bout
Fight for all the right things and let the Huey New out
Pharrell, what these niggas talkin' 'bout?
2 man Big Pun, a 1 man Slaughterhouse
A 2 album Jay-Z, a 1 nigga Wu-Tang
Young and hungry Mos Def, a conscious rappin Lil Wayne
I don't care for similarities
Cause I'm a pioneer, not a parody
These ain't bars, this is barbarity
SLR... Clarity

[Chorus]
In this world I'm so alone
In a category all on my own
Cause I tell the world what I want to
Yea I tell the world what I want to
Man I feel so alone
They treat me like an outcast
Cause I tell the world what I want to
But you can't tell me what you gon do

[Verse 3]
Holy Shock and awing cattle prods
All up in the action with a fraction of the catalogue
Of my peers, I ain't doin' numbers like Anbesol
But I'm here, and I'm revered
Lyric boy, Based King, Master Chef, All City Chess moves Mickey Donny, Diggy, CRS fool
Carrera Era, Panamera, F-Tool, Emperor, Free Chilly nigga, FNF RULES!!!
'Ye, what these niggas talkin' 'bout?
A Jesus in the desert walking, Dundee walkabout
A self imposed exile, learn to let the awesome out
Even if I was homeless I would still have an awesome house
Cause the world is mine, Lupe to the rescue, the world is fine
Words and lines of mine, I feel. are better than every rap in the world combined!!
And that's how you do it
E'rything flow, errything fluid
Stupid with the raps, but the raps never stupid
Trakk on the music, SLR ruthless
And the next whip is that Ferrari cart
Game over - body parts

[Chorus]
In this world I'm so alone
In a category all on my own
Cause I tell the world what I want to
Yea I tell the world what I want to
Man I feel so alone
They treat me like an outcast
Cause I tell the world what I want to
But you can't tell me what you gon do

[Intro]
All aboard!
Okay, next stop, my basement (Ha-ha)
I'll meet you down there!

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say, "What if you went platinum?", I'd just laugh at him
"That's not happening, that I can't fathom"
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 1]
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touché me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Whoopsa-that-a-fucking-daisy
That's a no-no, even she knows Da-Da's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cuckoo, bananas, fucking-A, B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's 'cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep up on ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen, man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted 'cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters, turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I oughta just be honest, but

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say, "What if you went platinum?", I'd just laugh at him
"That's not happening, that I can't fathom"
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 2]
"Sorry, Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad when I call them both faggots"
All these fucking voices in my head, I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason, slash, Leatherface, and
Together makes 'em a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the Wiener Schnitzel up his ass, hopped away, some-
-body please stop the patient, get the cops to mace him
Homie, I'm the Scheiße, ask Doctor Dreson
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away, son
No, not a-now, not a chance, not today, son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussies queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stain, feck it
I'll just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say, "What if you went platinum?", I'd just laugh at him
"That's not happening, that I can't fathom"
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 3]
Elevator in my house, hah, smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in the microwave, I'm
Thinking 'bout an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbors step away, then I just pepper-sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hide out, drive by my house and beep
Like, now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down, fucker (Bah), try counting sheep
And you're tryna find out why now there's beef
Mace in your face, bitch, cry now, pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above 'em just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement, yelling "Stop!"

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say, "What if you went platinum?", I'd just laugh at him
"That's not happening, that I can't fathom"
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Outro]
You fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking-A, even got a bidet
To wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it, the shit's awesome
Yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
"Does he write his own rhymes?" Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
"Damn, is he really that caught up?"
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name "Porsche" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is "Minivan"
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—

[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say "Kayne"
Got family in the D, kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, "Pssh, we messed up."
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like "Amen"
But r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Outro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)

Gon' lock you up before too long, ah
Your lyin' eyes gon' tell you right, ah
So listen up, don't make a fight, ah
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man, ah
You're throwin' stones to hide your hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true, ah
But my friend you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through

[Chorus]

We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place, ah
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then won't you slap my face?

[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad, Shamone (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad)
You know it (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad)

You know it, you know it (Really, really bad)
You know, you know (Bad, bad)
You know, Shamone (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
You know I'm smooth, I'm bad, you know it (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know, you know, you know it (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
Come on (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now (Hoo)
Just to tell you once again
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, you know, woo (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad)
You know it, you know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?

Cool, I spend my time just thinking

For, for, for you and I
For, for, for, for you and I
For, for you and I (For you and I)

[Chorus: Fergie]
Meet me halfway
Right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay

[Post-Chorus: Fergie]
(Ooh, Ooh,)
I can't go any further than this
(Ooh, Ooh,)
I want you so bad, it's my only wish
(Ooh, Ooh,)
I can't go any further than this
(Ooh, Ooh,)
I want you so bad, it's my only wish

[Intro]
Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, and on the count of three, baby girl
Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, and on the count of three, baby girl
Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, hey
And on the count of three, Blow up, Blow up

[Verse]
Yeah, and that I will, nigga, that I will
I keep a checklist of rappers that I'mma kill
I used to play the bleachers before I had a deal
Now a nigga gettin burnt, just imagine how that feel
Hmm, ill, fantastic
Flip rhymes, flip beats, nigga, "Jam"nastics
Your style hot now, but they just can't last with
Something like the rap sand-castle
Gone with the tide, I'm here for the seasons
Bend yo' ass over bitch I'm here for a reason
Cold breezin', flow freezin'
This ain't spittin' ho, I'm sneezin'
Used to hit South Beach, stay at the Parisian
No fun nigga, low funds was the reason
Old school bed that the hoes got pleased in
Now them Lowes doors, is what I throw keys in
Man, talk about a come up
Niggas see me in the street they talk about 'The Come Up'
Or talk about 'The Warm Up'
Or "Nigga, when your album drop?"
And why these lil' rappers like to run their mouth alot?
And J. Cole, are you really from the south or not?
I see your jeans, man them thangs, must have cost a lot
Aye do you get a chance to hang out with the boss a lot?
Even them hating niggas like you at the barbershop
Cole.. Yeah, that's my muhfucking name
Nigga couldn't even watch the All Star game
Had to do the whole Valentines Day thang
Gotta play the game, so my lady won't complain
Three or four days, I be back on a plane
Do a couple shows, where the people know my name
Look man, the crowd full of pretty young dames
If you gonna do dirt, then you can't leave a stain, man!
Tiger Woods y'all
He like them white girls, I like them hoods y'all
She got her head straight, she got a good job
She give the best brain, she got them good jaw
I got that good game, that's cause I'm good, y'all
And J. Cole the lil' engine that could, y'all
And yeah I'm coming for the top, like I should, y'all
And bitch I never fall off, knock on wood, y'all
Cole

[Verse 1]
'Cause I'm the high plains drifter, and I'm the drifter
The high plains drifter, and I'm the drifter
They can’t catch me, they’re never going to find me
They're never gonna know that I'm the high plains drifter
Pulled over to the river, to take a rest
Pulled out a pair of pliers, pulled a bullet out of my chest
Fear and loathing 'cross the country, listenin' to my 8-track
I reached behind the seat and snatched a Kool from the pack
I'm long-distance from my girl, and I'm talking on the cellular
She said that she was sorry and I said, "yeah, the hell you were"
Check the rear view mirror, check the gold tooth display
Check the odometer, and I was on my way

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm the high plains drifter, the best that you can get
A strapped shoplifter, a pirate on cassette
Bust a Travis Bickle when I feel that I'm getting pushed
Don't step to me 'cause you could be getting mushed
I'm doing 120 plowing over mailboxes
Radar detector to tell me where the cops is
Spend another night at the Motel 6
It's five dollars extra to get the porno flicks
And then I concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter
I'm a kleptomaniac K-mart shoplifter
Cash flow getting low, so I had to pull a job
I found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob
I left my car outside and the engine still revving
Takin' care of business at 7-Eleven
And then I went inside to make my withdrawal
I saw what he had had, but I had to take it all
Knucklehead deli tried to gyp me off the price
So I clocked him on the turban with a bag of ice
Cause I'm mo-lello like yo-lello, cool like lemonade
I made my getaway, and then I thought that I had it made
I feel like Steve McQueen, a former movie star
Looked in the rear view mirror, seen the police car
Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap
I couldn't help to notice I was caught in a speed trap
Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, on the run from Dirty Harry
Stash the cash in the dash, but my gun I did carry
I'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night
I got my alibi straight, and I pulled over to the right
The cop knocked on my window and said, "Boy, where's the fire?"
"You got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire"
"Outta the car, longhair!" "Your goose is cooked"
Read me my rights, fingerprinted and booked

[Verse 3]
Making like a DT, driving a Gran Fury
Wherever I hang my hat's my home, and my past is kind of blurry
Every dog will have his day, mine will be in front of a jury
High plains drifter, you know that I'm never in a hurry
Read me my rights as if I didn't know this
Threw me in the tank with a drunk called Otis
With his 5 o'clock shadow he smelled of 3-day old beer
My man turned to me and said, "Why are you here?"
I said, "I'm charming, I'm dashing, I'm rental-car bashing
I'm phony-paper passing at Nix Check Cashing"
I went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn house of D
He said, "You behave, or we'll throw away the key"
Houdini'd out the cuffs, kicked the screw in the knee
I took the bailiff's wallet and went straight to OTB
I had a good feeling, easy come, easy go
I bet on one horse to win and your mother to show
And sure enough, that nag came in
Brought my ticket to the window and collected my win
And then I broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger
Hot-wired, hot wheeled and, "Suzy is a headbanger"

[Intro: André 3000]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Oh, yes, I love her like Egyptian
Want a description? My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can’t be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill boy because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that, man, fuck them niggas, I’m going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw 'em
With these old ghetto poems, thinking it's better for 'em
When they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call their body
Now everybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes, even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
They fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to
I’m willing to go the extra kilometer
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no girl ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it’s real Jazzy Belle

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
See what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
Having the very best of life: lobster, steak and Perignon
Smoking an ounce of weed
And every single day was personal FreakNik
Tricking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception, looking into your eyes
I see your weapon and it’s depressing
They're digging up in your thighs, leaving deposits
Keeping your closets open, knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds
Steadily calling me Antwan 'cause you thinking that you my lady
Bitch, don’t play me 'cause you’re janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee, for running that Southernplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame, a nigga don’t even know yo name
It’s a shame, you cracking 'em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up
I’m leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don’t get me
See, I gotta be feeding my daughter
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
'Cause you’ll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be Dumb
And Dumber, yeah, you know what I’m saying

[Verse 3: André 3000]
See me and ol' girl in the black-on-black 'Lac Northstar
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
Straps, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog-eat-dog world
Kitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to hurl, 'cause most of the girls
That we was liking in high school, now they dyking

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Having no mercy for the disrespectful ones, some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be asking me all about mine
How she doing how she be, I know she’s sipping that wine
Behind my back they squawk like vultures
Off and On like Trends of Cultures baby
Hey he faking it like these sculptured nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer
'Cause they burning anyway, Big Boi use her and abuse her

[Outro: Khujo Goodie]
Tricks hollin' they got rank
Tricks hollin' they got rank
Tricks hollin' they got rank
Tricks hollin' they got rank
Tricks hollin' they got rank
Tricks hollin' they got rank
Tricks hollin' they got rank
Tricks hollin' they got rank

And uh, like Noreaga say, it goes... ugh!

[Verse 1]
How your wife gon' say she never sold drugs a day in her life?
But she still wanna pump the 'Ye?
And y'all mad 'cause y'all not knowin
'Cause these canaries so yellow
When y'all pull up, whether to stop or keep going
I got Gs, rock rock 'n' roll tees with no sleeves
Tats showin', tucked in, strap showin'
How he get seven TVs in that ‘lac-‘lac?
Three in the front, two in the back, two in that back-back
While you in that hatchback
And try to sell work and don’t get shit from them packs back
And try to rap, the studios won't give you ya DATs back
And try to get publishin', all you get in your ass capped (That's all, nigga)
And that’s that

[Chorus]
I go to Jacob with twenty-five thou'
You go with twenty-five hundred (Wow)
I got eleven plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single—damn, nigga! (Wow)

[Verse 2]
Magazines call me a rock star, bitches call me cock-star
Billboard pop star, neighborhood block star
Chi-Town go-getting pimps, we mobsters
Gingerbread man even says, “You’re a monster”
Remember that? Uh-huh, that’s that Shrek shit
Remember back in ’92, niggas used to "catch wreck," shit
Remember that track I tracked for you 'bout three months ago?
Uh-huh, that’s the one—now cut my check, bitch
And I ain't feeling that Lexus
More that CLK; see me like, "Damn, a CL, K?”
Yeah, that’s how we eating and, keep us looking peace and then
"I ain't know he rap as good as he do beats," and then

[Chorus]
I go to Jacob with twenty-five thou'
You go with twenty-five hundred (Wow)
I got eleven plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single—damn, nigga! (Wow)
"H to the Izzo" did three thou' spins in a week
You did a thou' in a month (Wow)
Y'all niggas want credit, but y'all need to slow down
Kanye To The, killin' y'all from Chi-Town

[Verse 3]
Now, niggas forcing me to keep the heater
Black strap, white handle, I got jungle fever
You know the rules, five up close, one gon' leave ya
You don't know about Kanye? Son gon' teach you
What's the first thing that popped in your mind
While I was popping this rhyme?
You don't picture popping a nine?
See, you paralyzed from the top of the spine...

[Intro: Fridolin Nordsø]
God, I thought I loved you so
God, I thought I loved you so

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
They done let in the skinny jean-wearing
Fro-for-days in a old AA
Ball' so low, most fools couldn't price me
Silently stunt with a blunt full of P.E.
And I guess you know me
Been in NY so long, got Tri-State family
Especially Brooklyn—shout-out to the Madis
My bloodline runs deep
Nights, I don’t sleep
Figure it’s my pops keeping me awake
Help me keep my mind out the clouds for reality
These motherfuckers can’t fathom the wizardry
Slow-mo-brain, ass-backwards cowards
Take a shower, your attitude stinks
Wanna know what I think

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Fridolin Nordsø]
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Hey, my mojo so dope, bitch
My mojo so dope
Yep, we live it, live it
Yeah, we on it, on it
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucker lifestyle, 'cause, nigga
We, we live this shit
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucker lifestyle, 'cause, nigga, hey

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I live through words, not metaphors
So I passed to be the rest of the freshmen
Playful tough talk, often the fave
'Til I came like 'Pac art and said true things
A whole new legion of some niggas
Aiming high, past the idea of slanging
Praise Allah for keeping me away, man
Lotta of my niggas fell victim to the dope game
Some things will never be the same
Wish that I could tell my brother
Something for some motivation to get him out that gutter
He’s leaving behind a family and a mother
Damn, you must understand
What I speak about in song, this how I really am
Yeah, this is how I really think
You can see what I see, yes, I really blink
Yes, I really drink, I really do rage
My demons out the cage 'bout most of the day
Before I became the age to even rage
I was drowning my sorrows with some O.E., nigga

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Fridolin Nordsø]
Hey, we live this shit
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Hey, my mojo so dope, bitch
My mojo so dope
Yep, we live it, live it
Yeah, we on it, on it
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucker lifestyle, 'cause, nigga
We, we live this shit
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucker lifestyle, 'cause, nigga, yeah
Oh, oh (Oh, oh-oh, oh)

[Outro: Kid Cudi & Fridolin Nordsø]
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about your lifestyle, 'cause nigga
We live this shit, hey
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about your lifestyle, nigga
Yeah
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Here we go
On, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and
And we dream
Oh, oh-oh, oh
On, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
What up, how is everyone doing?
You are now in a world I am ruling
Take a minute to adjust for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of fun and enchantment
I promise you some "generation next" shit
Speak for the silent who are left with
Parallel levels in a dark, dark place
Tricked all you niggas to a dark, dark fate
And guided you all with a smile upon my face
As the sun kisses us on our foreheads gently
Gentle with the drugs, heavy with the love
And my speeches on stage rock mountains from a club
Money doesn't move me except on the literal
G4 flights, now we're off to Australia
I wanna see more of the world
These are more than just words, these are facts from a winner

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ayy
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
Then we can meet on the other side
On the other side

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
What up, how is everyone feeling?
I hope you understand what you're hearing
Take a minute to roll up for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of darkness and evil
I will paint the Yin and the Yang for you
And my jeans are Dior for the love of skinnies
Upgraded, faded aided to the T
Work hard, making sure I don't become a memory
Hard to press on when the memories remember me
And they always find the perfect moment
High speed, my momentum won't slow up none
Lost in the wind, I've lost all my friends
Maybe they were never meant to be acquainted
Money seems to make everything tainted
Everybody mad 'cause they stuck where I knew 'em last
Took what I wanted and I did it all blunted, oh oh

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ayy
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
Then we can meet on the other side
On the other side

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ayy
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
Then we can meet on the other side
On the other side

[Intro]
Yeah! Welcome, welcome you!
Hey! I am your big brother
What do I have to say to the kids?

[Verse 1]
Let go, life does get tough
No need to stress, hold you back too much
Let's go, I heard they found a solution
Where will you be for the revolution?

[Chorus]
Oh, whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Whoa, whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

Where will you be for the revolution?

[Chorus]
Oh, whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Whoa, whoa

[Bridge]
I'm so high up, so high up, and I like it, hey

Somehow I feel okay, somehow I feel okay

[Chorus]
Oh, whoa (I am your big brother)

Let go, life does get tough
No need to stress, hold you back too much
Let's go, I heard they found a solution
Where will you be for the revolution?

[Outro]
Revolution, revolution (Hey! Okay, okay!)
Revolution, revolution (We are—you are here!)
Where will you be for the revolution?
Where will you be for the revolution?
Where will you be for the revolution?

[Pusha T]
Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I’m just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
A birdseye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo’s got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands all is forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
Grants, Jacksons no room for George
Yeh, the Fear of God’s in you muthafuckers
This art imitate my life
You WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation hype
Eliminate the fools gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime made in his life more disastrous
Help my young bitch see her way through her Bachelor's
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it’s revealed
What goes around comes around, this is lifes ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parrallel park
Kentucky derby on the grill
The fact that I’m free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I’d rather talk fear
Villian like candyman, say my name and I’ll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem poll, what’s my only problem
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
I’m here now, watch how many nigga's plans change

[Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin’ for the love of ballin’
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
And sold your dreams, you don’t know who did it
I treat the cash, the way the government treats aids
I won’t be satisfied til all my niggas get it
I need more drinks and more lights
Hot American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
Told to take them glasses off and get in the pool
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
Its like a crip said: “I got way too many blues for any more bad news”
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don’t believe in yesterday
What’s a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I’m sniffing coke
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I’m got it
Play strings for the dramatic
And end all of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I’m going after whoever who has it
I’m coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowing up, that’s good, fantastic
That y’all, its like that ya’ll
I don’t really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

[Pusha T]
Uh, I let you into my diary to admire me
The making of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I’m drawing from both sides, I’m Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what’s inside this pinata
And rolling kilos in gymstrada is one saga
One chapter of black magic, I’m Harold Potter
Feels like I’m doomed to dealing with women whom
Relationships with their fathers won’t allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear this Vegas nights was awesome
But adios I blow my own dice before I toss ‘em, loss ‘em
Some other muthafuckers double crossed ‘em
Tryna snatch my nigga back I blew a small fortune
Russell with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I’m muthfucking Gorgeous, wooooooooo
As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smtih
Whiter than the coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss
But the devil red, tires double tread
I’m posting parks up. that gets me double head
Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind look what the devil did
Yeah

[Kanye West]
It’s hip hop, this is euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing to attention
As long as I’m in Polo’s they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever saw a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn’t sack me
If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is, on the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World’s game, this is my Olympics
We make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
And I assisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, fans can't resist it
Remember, remind of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever one of the greatest homie, I must have missed it!

[Hook 1 - Lil Wayne]
I got a lot of loot and I ain't lookin' for a lady
And you can never play me
I'm from Uptown baby
I wake up in the mornin' take a piss and wash my hands
Take a knee and thank the Man then get back to the money
You ain't know
I gotta go
Where ya goin'?
I gotta get back to the money
You ain't know
I gotta go
Where ya goin'?
I gotta get back to the money
To the money

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Nigga I ain't got a money printer
So for this paper chase I'm out runnin' sprinters
Yes the last two Cash Money members
Shout out to the new Cash Money members
Baby and Slim still point guard and center
So much money on my mind it's all I remember
And I just bought a gun wit' a extender
And that bitch hold me up like suspenders
Cut like a blender sharper than a bitch
They got so many pussy niggas I can make a list
Niggas wonder why I stress that I am the best
Cause even bobble heads tell me yes.. haha
Put it on the hood I'm Hollygrove to death
I'm already good I'm working on my left
A jungle on my wrist a circus on my neck
Don't forget the Baby no don't forget the F

[Hook 2: Lil Wayne - x2]
You ain't know I gotta go
Where ya goin'? I gotta get back to the money
You ain't know I gotta go
Where ya goin'? I gotta get back to the money
To the money

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Brush the platinum grab the straps homie make it happen
Comin' through my neighborhood with 4's on the Caddy
Limo tints out the pound and Uptown crackin'
Red bandanna duckin' feds and the money stackin'
Rest in peace to Miss Gladys like e'eryday
We on the grind for the shine and we gon' get paid
Spent a mill' on the wheels custom wit' the navi'
2 of the same whips we doin' it big livin' lavish

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
This is a Scott Storch and I'm a hot torch
And gettin' money is my sport
And understand the rap game is my court
So I shall walk and come forth like a Rockport
Or some sort of... matchin' slippers or yacht shoes
See I don't cruise control I control the cruise
Yes... I gets throat on a boat
And I vow to never fall like soap on a rope and

[Hook 1]

[Verse 4: Birdman]
Fresh wit' the hustle so we bounce back on them suckers
Blowin' big doin' gigs got it ran in hundreds
They reppin' layin' here we stuntin'
On the grind all the time homie gettin' money
3rd Ward soldier 13th gangsta
17th hustler known top ranker
Money go getter them clowns can't figure
Poppin' at the mouth like this cutter won't split 'em
Know how to survive hustlin' stayin' fly
My whole hood cried when my lil' brother died
Know I had to ride never let it slide
It's just the G in me and I'mma get it til I die daddy

[Hook 2: x2]

[Hook - 2X]
I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sipping on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slapping a nigga today (slap slap)
Slapping a nigga today
I feel like slapping a nigga today (slap slap)
Slapping a nigga today
Slapping a nigga today

[Verse 1]
This morning, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed (bed)
I'm sick of people putting lies in my head (head)
I don't really wanna work, I'm tired
I hate my 9 to 5
And I'm thinking bout killing my boss today
Killing my boss today
I'm thinking bout killing my boss today (it's just a thought man)
Killing my boss today (yeah)
Yesterday my best friend died (died)
Somebody came and took his life (life)
Now I'm looking up at the sky
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
And I'm asking why did you take him away?
Why did you take him away?
I'm asking why did you take him away? (why'd you take him?)
Why did you take him away? (hey)

I need some money please (please)
I can barely make it on these streets (these streets)
Cause I got a couple mouths to feed
My baby's in dire need
So I'm thinking bout robbing a bank today
Robbing a bank today
I'm thinking bout robbing a bank today
Robbing a bank today (real talk)

Baby mama's at home and fussing (fussing)
Calling up my mobile cussing (cussing)
Always yapping about this and that
But she really don't be talking bout nothing
Somebody take my pain away (Take my pain away)
Take my pain away (please)
Somebody take my pain away (hey)
Take my pain away (I can't take it)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Somebody just broke in my ride (ride)
Snatched up everything inside (inside)
Even got my 45
How am I supposed to survive
When I know that my stereo's taken away?
Stereo's taken away?
When I know that my stereo's taken away? (I need my music, man!)
Stereo's taken away? (hey!)

Gas prices are way too high
Rich people are way too fly
And I'm where I wanna be in my life
But why am I so behind?
Is it cause I'm wasting my time away?
Wasting my time away?
Is it cause I'm wasting my time away? (too lazy)
Wasting my time away? (I can't help it!)

My grandmama's nerves are bad (bad)
And everybody in the hood is mad (mad)
Cause President Bush could give a damn about our ass
So I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say (don't say nothing!)
Shit that he has to say
I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say
Shit that he has to say (woo!)
Troops gone and we still at war (war)
Nobody even really knows what for (what for)
Even more I'm scared to find what the world really has in store
Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (it's not promised, man)
Tomorrow's not promised today
Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (live like today could be your last, man!)
Tomorrow's not promised today (hey!)

[Hook 4X]

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Got all the Black bitches mad 'cause my main bitch vanilla
She tryna get her groove back like Stella, grab the umbrella
When it comes to your perception of my shit, I'm Helen Keller
When it comes to the perfection of my shit, I know you smell the
Rectum, I'm like a chromosome, I always X 'em
Like Wolverine's stepson, attacking a deadly weapon
I'm opening a church to sell coke and Led Zeppelin
And fuck Mary in her ass— Haha, yo
I'm fucking Goldilocks up in the forest
In the three-bear house, eating they motherfucking porridge
I tell her it's my house, give her a tour in my basement
And keep that bitch locked up in my storage
Rape her and record it, then edit it with more shit
Octopussy, special effect, direct
Bitches, we banging, and please never disrespect my set
With Canons hanging from our necks like it's a motherfucking circus

[Hook: Hodgy, Tyler, the Creator & Both]
You little niggas better check my French (My French)
Ugh, you getting money? Better check my French (My French)
Uh, what time is it, huh? check my French (My French)
If you got my shit, you better check my French (Motherfucker!)
I'm making moves, sh— check my French (My French)
I speak English, but check my French (My French)
Your ho be on my penis, she check my French
Bitch!

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator & Hodgy]
I guess I left my dignity up in the cupboard
'Cause every girl I'm digging
When I'm digging in her pussy, I'm never using (A rubber)
But fuck it, I guess I gotta stretch it out like it was flubber
And leave it dripping green and red like double cheeseburgers
Chewing on cum like bubblegum from Hubba
This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shrimp (Hahahaha)
Yeah
Yo, I'm seventeen, already sniffing blow
I tell my friends it's asthma every time I start to itch my throat
I got a new show for MTV: "Pimp My Boat"
Because some bitch said my semen was dirty, that silly ho
The most that they can do is fine me
I'm hiding, somewhere where Chris Stokes can't find me
"Oh no, Mr. Stokes, I don't like misters, no"
Don't tell R. Kelly where my little sister go

[Hook: Hodgy, Tyler, the Creator & Both]
You little niggas better check my French (My French)
Ugh, you getting money? Better check my French (My French)
Uh, what time is it, huh? check my French (My French)
If you got my shit, you better check my French (Motherfucker!)
I'm making moves, sh— check my French (My French)
I speak English, but check my French (My French)
Your ho be on my penis, she check my French
Bitch!

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Yo, you little niggas better check my French
I got all-stars, and you can check my bench
Left Brain, Super 3, Creator Ace
Put expressions in the music and create the face
Of the picture—punchline, figured out, "Ahh, I get you"
No, you don't, nigga, so why don't you go'n' figure?
You seem confused anyway, pressured enough?
You the type to do the choke when the pressure is up
The pressure is the pump, and the pressure is us
Bitches having eargasms, and the pleasure is us
Niggas wanna be O.F. and write letters to us
Competition's competition, yo, you better than us?
Digest what I'm saying? I don't think so
We sick shit, throw it up down in the sink, yo
These Odd niggas are beginning to spill these pink flows
We think sorta odd, so we think so

[Verse 4: Tyler, the Creator]
Crusing in my go-kart at Walmart selling cupcakes
Go 'head, admit it, faggot, this shit is tighter than butt rape
That involve Ballpark Franks and silver duct tape
Pornos, some hormones, and boxes of DiGiorno
You homos is loco, you probably drinking Cuervo
With some vatos, with the door closed, watching "Zorro"
You homos

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator & Dr. TC]
O.F.
Yes
So, are you dating anyone right now? You know, or...
No, I'm— I'm just playing the field, just for now
Ah, so... I'm guessing she's white, since she's "vanilla"
Haha

[Hook]
If you hear me 'fore you see me
I got King Kong in the trunk
King Kong, King Kong (What it is!?)
If you hear 'fore you see me
I got King Kong in the trunk (Yeah)
King Kong, King Kong (Drought 3)
King Kong, King Kong (Drought 3)
King Kong, King Kong (I got 'em)
If you hear 'fore you see me
I got King, I got King Kong

[Verse 1]
I pop my trunk and everybody get to runnin'
The Fireman, bitch, like my body in the oven
I'm one egg short, I'm just tryna get a dozen
My name like honey, got a lot of bitches buzzin'
The neck of the barrel so long and narrow
And it shoot a bunch, you just lunch and it munch, like Pharoahe
Bloodshot eyes on the sparrow
And I stay high, but on point like an arrow
Street nigga, baby, I'm in love with the gravel
Money gives me life, like a man with a gavel
I'm strapped at home, I'm strapped when I travel
I pop my trunk and made them bitches spread like cattle
(Moo), hah

[Hook]
King Kong, Ki-King Kong (I got that)
King Kong, Ki-King Kong (Yeah, I'm talking 'bout that)
If you hear me 'fore you see me (Blum-blum, blum-blum)
I got King Kong in the trunk (That Blum-blum)
King Kong, King Kong
King Kong, King Kong
King Kong, King Kong
(Yeah, choppers with drums, choppers with drums)
King Kong, King Kong
(Choppers with drums, choppers with drums, go!)

[Verse 2]
(I got King Kong in the trunk) And I feed him banana clips
And let him sing like Gladys Knight and the Pips
I'm just sticking to the motherfuckin' manuscript
Understand, I'm tryna get the chips and the dip
Better know I hold that gun with a Panther grip
My hollow bullets got tips like a dancer bitch
Where my money? Where my money? Need to answer quick
Gotta get back up on my ransom shit
And put you (In the trunk), so you lay on top of speakers
Holes all in you like an old pair of sneakers
Before I do a day on the edge, I will leap first
Bet you any money that I will land feet-first
Married to the Benjamins, battle all my enemies
Riding with Bigfoot, Harry and the Hendersons
Godzilla, King Kong, and if I have to park
I will open up my trunk, and it will be Jurassic Park

[Hook]
King Kong, Ki-King Kong (I got that)
King Kong, Ki-King Kong (I'm talking 'bout that)
(Blum-blum, blum-blum)
That blum-blum, that blum-blum
I'm talking 'bout that
I'm talking 'bout choppers with drums
Choppers with drums, choppers with drums
Drought 3

Falling for her like how safe is gravity
I'll make your girl about face and marry me
Hahahaha, yeh

[Drake]
But ahhh, the things I'm willing to do to her
I wish I could have a threesome with two of her
I would sing a love song if I knew the words
But I'll be damned if another nigga do it first
Cos you the one, damn I think I see the sun
I guess that mean you gotta run
Well holla at me when you done

[Hook]
Can I dig it
When you baby
Woop woop woop
My darling baby

[Drake]
Uhh
She nothing like every other dime
I think about her and couple things come to mind
Thoughts like if she end up my baby mother fine
Cos we only use a rubber like every other time
Oooh, I bet she so embarrassed
I had to take her ass to Paris
Give her the moments that she cherish
You know

[Lil Wayne]
Yep
She got it coming to her like an heiress
And anything she want I Will like Farris
Oops I meant ferris and in the coupe I tint very light
So them hating bitches can see me and you at every light
Oooh, and I hope its one of them long lights
I mean I hope its one of them long nights
No wrong turns, ain't no such things as a wrong right

[Drake]
Uh yeah
You make me feel so good
And every time we cut I swear it heals so good
Its been over a year that shit is still so good
No adjusting for you, you know just what to do and all
Yea, oh and I love it
See I'm trying to make it public
I think the glass slipper does fit

[Lil Wayne]
And yesterday I told her she a muthafucker
And how her new haircut is so becoming of her
Oh thats your girl, well I'mma make a women of her
Never do to another what we do one another
Now thats a numbers for ya, and i'll give up my summers for ya
Yeah I'll spend my winters and my springs on it
And put a ring on it, eyy

[Hook]

[Drake]
Uhh, just say yes not no
The club is overrated baby lets not go
Lets stay home and burn a couple calories
Fuck the house up and make the maid earn a salary
Yeah I cook you dinner if you cook me breakfast
They say that nobodies perfect but you look perfected
I really love to be the one you took a step with
So trust me when I tell you it'd be worth the effort

[Lil Wayne]
Shes unbelievable like a purple leopard
Just give me the formula watch me work the method
Hehe, Weezy F, I prefer the best shit
And babe you the fucking best
You deserve a trophy
You could be my four leaf clover
Her clothes aren't tight nigga their cosy
And when she turn around they say Whoa like Joey
Thats my baby
And I love it
Yeah, Young Money

[Intro]
I know you gotta feel this
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
I know you gotta feel this
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
(Let's go) Check it out
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
(One time, one time) I know you gotta feel this (Your boy Mac)
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
(Let's go)

[Verse]
I pull my hoodie down and take a look around
Sounds that shook a town, man, it feel good to smile
So I shouldn't frown when the night is lookin' down
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who the smoothest crook around?
Takin' some dollars and makin' away from Impalas
Shakin' the Jakes 'cause they chasin' the face of a robber
Actin' goofy, absolutely
'Cause my passion suits me, so blast the tunes, please
I see the world with four eyes, hip-hop tour guide
Hear the war cries, rap or die
Wanna get signed, drive a four-door ride
Be more fly, 'til then I'll just soar by with a wave
I'm a bat in the cave
Sit back in the shade when I'm passin' the haze
Misbehave, I'm a trouble-makin' teenager

[?] to please haters
Seat taker, three-term mayor
Gettin' re-elected just three terms later, uh
I've seen greater days, so let the haters play their game
Dreams fade away when you make the predator the prey
The ace of spades can make it's way to save the day
But from the start a club of heart was diamond
Now I'm in Zion flyin' through the skyline
The game on my back, I got five spines
Black cat with nine lives, time flies by
So I got one life to lose it, but how will I use it? Uh
I put it all in the music, 'cause y'all pussy
Fold away before they hand you cards
Broke-ass rapper, now you dancin' with the stars
I'm handlin' these bars like a simple situation
Bassin' on them cats who don't fit in the equation
Patience is a virtue, but fuck it, I want it now
Get my record deal ready, get Diddy up on the dial
Hello. what's up, Puffy? I'm on my grind and hungry
Throw me to the people, they gon' love me, trust me, ha
'Cause these older cats is gettin' a little rusty
It's time for a change like Barack said
And I don't care, hip-hop is not dead
Spit hot lead, but none of these haters get shot dead
They don't bother me, I'll even play 'em for my wife
Kick back, have a laugh while you complain about your life
Grr, you hate Mac and you say you gon' fight
It's all good, bro, you entertainment for tonight
Like I'ma be mad you hatin' 'cause I'm white
Do a lot of cryin', lettin' pain out on the mic
'Cause overall I'm iller than most of y'all, y'all pussy
Never ever goin' for it all, you scared of a little risky coachin' call
What happened? I thought you was a know-it-all?
I stay smokin' well, haze got a potent smell
It take me back to kickin' raps back in show-and-tell
I wanted to show people, all of my bro's peoples
Have a dude come up like "Yo, I know people"
The need for Dead Presidents, this dough evil
So lethal, police'll always try to beat you
Seat you down, try and have you run your mouth
Bring your mother out, "Look what your son is now," haha
See, my mom, she know her son is well
The youngest child, she been through it for a while
9-1-1 on the dial with a smile
'Cause I'm wild, foul child style, haha
Too focused on my grind to ever catch an "F"
My heart in it, down eight with five seconds left
I want the best, won't settle for nothin' less
And I always stay dressed in somethin' fresh
So keep your head on straight and show respect to the game
And that's what this beat messaged my brain

[Trey Songz]
(C'mon) I like a long hair redbone thick, with them legs long (YUP)
Shawty head strong, blow me till her head gone
Shawty scream loud, shawty gone moan
Call that music to my ears, headphone
After we get it in, you can head home
Then I'm a get your friend, in my bedroom
I often fantasize I could get all you in a ride
Get so much pussy I bet you I can guess yo panty size
August 4th, is you ready for me girl
I fuck you better than dem niggas in your world
Lick that kitty cat until she purrs meow
Beat it up so bad you wanna curse me out
If you top modeling, if ya twitter following
If you in a whip, who give a shit what kinda car you in
Every girl I just want your bodies, let me borrow them
Treat em like they need it, I'll massage, touch and fondle them
Paint your body naked on my wall and when you modeling
You bust it wide open like you always had it bottled in
Drizzy told G to throw his feet up on the ottoman
I'm starving, so I'm eating all the singers I go harder then
Pause, then I start again
Fall coming hard again
I just killed the summer and the shit ain't really started yet
All of my regards are in
I kill and send a card to them
Fuck what niggas think I hit the bank and start depositing
I tried to told them I'm a problem
You should bet the over not the under
Tho the odds have been in favor of these ugh niggas
You know they love trigga
Finger fuckin make em bust
Get it, they love trigga
You can catch me with the finest
Some age like my wine is or short like my time is
Let me tell you what a dime is
She make me, wanna tear it apart and eat it up like she was prime ribs
She knows just how to grind it
Make them boys lose it and I know just how to find it
Cupid said I'm stupid cause I show you where my mind is
Heads up, shawty lift your legs up
Oh, Oh I'm nasty, I'm nasty
Don't you be appalled shawty I got what your ass need?
Just kiddin I ain't tryna be inconsiderate
But next time you bring your girls with you, consider this

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I hit the weed, I told myself the last time would be my last
I don’t trust my own niggas, now my mind racing fast
Got my foot up on the gas, got a hundred on the dash
If the police run up on me, I ain't stopping for they ass
Boy, you know my L's dirty, if they stop me, I'm goin' to jail surely
I’ll be next to my brother in the cell, no bail for me
"Man, let me out, send me back to bitches that smell purdy"
And all I gotta do is call once and she there all ready
Yeah, buddy, can't you tell I'm goin' through hell?
I don’t even open my mail
I’m in the shower with a soap and the towel, I need cleansing
Bad bitches all on the prowl they need Benzes
Pussy niggas running they mouth and we ain't flinching
They names ain't even mentioned
I got dreams bigger than your whole team
You niggas so broke yet somehow you so green
I guess it's envy, started with a penny now I’m getting plenty money

[Chorus]
Huh, and one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh

[Verse 2]
Look kid, it's raining outside boy, fuck an umbrella
Niggas banging outside boy, they guns'll dumbbell a nigga
Tired of telling niggas that's deceased "Rest in Peace"
We tired of only having just a piece
And fuck policing, they killing niggas, what's the reason?
His daughter starving and she fucking freezing
So no wonder why he fucking squeezing
They out here bussin', leavin' niggas stuck and bleedin' on the flo'
Bullets wet you like a semen on a ho
Breathing slow man, I'm in hell
One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail
Lord knows he meant well
So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal
Some shit that’s darker than the tints up on the windshield
Uh, welcome to Sinville where niggas on base
Shit is looking like an infield, high as a Sprint bill
What you think? That's the reason why this ink in my pen kills
Phony niggas until they are extinct, bitch I’ve been real

[Chorus]
Huh, and one time for the city, hey, uh
And two times for you, yeah
And one time for the city, hey, hm
And two times for you, hey

[Verse 3]
Them old niggas sayin', "Cole the wrong one bringin' the city shine
All he ever doin’ is paintin' pictures of crime
Tellin' stories of pain, paintin' pictures of dope"
Bitch if you listenin', I'm paintin’ pictures of hope, huh
That boy in class embarrassed because he broke
Hopin’ today he won’t be the butt of somebody’s joke
See me I lived it all from dirt-poor in a trailer
Worried about my mother and never trustin' my neighbors
To middle-class with a backyard and my own room
To bein’ the only black kid in my homeroom
Academically gifted and followed my own rules
Was runnin' the streets, hey ma, I’ll be home soon
Was out chasin' hoes, was out hoopin'
Them niggas wasn't ballin' but yet they was foul shootin', uh
So meet the newest role model who don't know how to fake this shit
Never sold a rock and look, I made it bitch

[Chorus]
Huh, and one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey

[Outro]
Girl it's been so long, I've been gone from you
But you ain't gotta worry 'bout the thangs I do
It's hard but the thought of you would ease my pain
Girl I promise they gon' know our name, uh
Ain’t seen you smile in a while
But I been dreamin' 'bout you
Oh oh oh

[Chorus: Eminem]
Once you call my name out, things will never be the same
They should've never let us get our foot in this game

[Verse: Eminem]
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missing a screw like Bishop in Juice, I could lose it
At any moment, those who know me know it
So they probably told to go with the flow just so that
I don't explode, and- have another episode
Where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waiting for that next beef, I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad
I'm going bananas, my dick's so hard Anna
Nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with
Oh shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'd it (Heheheh!)
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name
It's a game, 'cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Every day it's the same thing, people in this game
Try to buddy-buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us, everybody just wants
To have something to do with that
They all trying to get that stamp, they after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally understand "How to Rob" fully
50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery
And the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers?
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered
That we had more in common than we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault?
'Cause we started thinking God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence, 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica
Queens, I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia
Two years later, me and Doc had to come, and, uhh-
Operate, that's when he popped up at number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye-to-eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit
I'm still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stomping, I been romping
Since Tim Dog was hollering "Fuck Compton"
I was whiling, freestyling
Back when they were still making Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even rap's Elvis yet, that tells us that
Any doubts in your head, that seals the shit
Ricky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc
And ya' don't stop

[Intro]
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier (la-de-dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah)
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo...

[Verse 1]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
If it's you—what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it 'til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 2]
I love pissin' you off, gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol-whippin' motherfucking bouncers 6'2"
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, 'cause I'm a—

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 3]
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity, I'm a—

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Outro]
Yo, left, yo, left, yo, left, right, left
Yo, left, yo, left, yo, left, right, left
Yo, left, yo, left, yo, left, right, left
Yo, left, yo, left, yo, left, right, left

[Chorus]
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 1]
I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
Which should've been a reason enough for me to get my stuff
And just leave, how come I couldn't see this shit myself?
It's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me; the minute shit was heated, she just bailed
I'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it felt
Turned around, saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground
So for now—

[Chorus]
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(So, how do you like my life now?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 2]
Bury my face in comic books, 'cause I don't wanna look
At nothing, this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol, I would
And end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood
I probably should, these problems are pilin' all at once
‘Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottomin' out, but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good
I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood ‘cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't wanna follow in the footsteps
Of my dad ‘cause I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had
Was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass
Man, if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em I'm

[Chorus]
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game, this fame, in real life, this is sick
"Publicity stunt" my ass, "conceal" my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whipped some ass
I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp
On the fact I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more than I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt
I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never would've rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no-one to seein'
Everything blow up, and all you did was just grow up emceein'
It's fuckin' crazy, ‘cause all I wanted was to give Hailie
The life I never had, instead I forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

[Outro]
Goodbye, goodbye Hollywood (Goodbye)
Please don't cry for me (It's been real)
When I'm gone for good (This shit is not for me)
So goodbye, goodbye Hollywood (I'm not a fuckin' star)
Please don't cry for me (No way)
When I'm gone for good (I'm goin' back home)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want the fans jumping
I want the fists pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't ya fill your cups?
Shady's come to feel ya up, are you a D or a C cup?
You could even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER, we are strapped with so much TNT
We may blow, no, not even CPR from the EMTs
Could help you to resuscitate, you busters must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard
What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
(Chkk-chk-chk) What's my name?
Shady came and just crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them
'Cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear his skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit's getting embarrassin'
The fog is thick and the air is thin
'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
La-dididi-dadada-didi
He makes it look so easy, girl, you just hit the lottery

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
This is when shit hits the fan like it just splattered on Stan
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolled in with Mathers
Now chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say at once, this song’s like a seance, it haunts
It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off of what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smoking something, you think I ain't smoking nothing, stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose
Loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose
A mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose
Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to retract the roof
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth
Girl, your man's back in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch
And this is when all hell breaks loose

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know you're feeling discouraged, but, homie, just mark my words
I'm murderin' the flow, liquid courage, I'm finna blow
As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit' your ho
With speakers knocking, it's three-o'clock, me and Doc then proceed to drop
E and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there?
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT, yeah, Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hatin' on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat
Dre fall off? That's news to me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Intro: Q-Tip]
Wow, we in stereo?

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Question for the ages: What's going on with my rap pages?
Rappers wanna be down, but listen-listen
You got to feel it within your body and your spirit
When you listen to the rhythm, come on
It's the Abstract, Will is on the beat
Women all around the globe, the world, you got to follow me
Change your history, categories
Different people in the same territories
Hip-hop in the form of Black Eyed Peas
So watch it, watch it, be marvelled of the speakers, please
'Cause they gonna rumble and shake the ground
Break atoms, break a sound
Thunder and bass'll pound, streets with the things profound
If you wanna do to help you out
Make it cool around your friends without smoking now
Play the song kinda loud, it can help you out
And you could work it out, yeah you could work it out
It's like that, and a—

[Hook: will.i.am & (Cee-Lo Green)]
And we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
It's like that, like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Yeah we got it like that (like that)
It's like that 'cause I got it like that

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
And I got it like that also
Got a style that's way out like Barstow
You know I'm known to cook a nigga like charcoal
Steady jumpin' round like it's heavy cargo
(Can I kick it?) Yup, really far though
From El Segundo to Toronto
I once hit a girl up in Chicago
But I'd never say who unless my name was Tonto
Yup, you know how the date rape go
Kobe showed the classic example
Now they know the Peas collect the dough
So they knocking on our door like we Wells Fargo
Yup, they see me in a Will.I.Am suit
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have the loot
And I don't smoke herbs but I'm still real nice with the verbs
So 

[Fuck] (Hey!) what you heard
'Cause we got it like that

[Hook: will.i.am & (Cee-Lo Green)]
And we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
It's like that, like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Yeah we got it like that (like that)
It's like that 'cause I got it like that
(Talib, just hit 'em like that)

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
I'm from the jungle, brother, and I got it like that
Yo, my life got me running through a maze like a white rat
I need a shot at Remy  like Mike Rap like to yack is the fights that got me spillin' on the right track
And I like this, Will, so I might get ill
On the mic somebody might get killed
So many dead rappers there's a cypher in heaven
My tongue is a weapon and plus when I bust, its the stuff of Legend
When this Brooklyn MC come after you
You be running like I herd o'cattle down Myrtle Avenue
Where we at ain't nothin pretty that's the attitude
To be at Fight Club, even Brad had to crack a tooth
Stare into the Sun, they try to copy
Let your eyes get used to the light because you gotta watch me
Sneak up on you like Sake
My lyrics get out a split atoms like Hiroshima and Nagasaki

[Verse 4: apl.de.ap]
It's the apl.de.ap in the lab with the rap
Demonstrate how we act, we attack any track
It's the Black Eyed Peas and we back with the facts
Start with the fat skills that rose in the past
We got it like how you know how to beast rocks
Entertain you, see you soon at the next spot
The crew got you bouncing and dropping your eye
Making nah hot shish and be shocking them out
Tss tsss tsss, I'mma roll with the hot
I'mma flow from the soul when you can't hold me back
Ke-ke-keep on keep on rolling the track
I'ma simply, simply always attach
Jeepny music from by apl.de.ap
From L.A to Philippines, we bridging the gap
We got it like that, you know we got it like that
We got it like— like, we got it like that, y'all

[Hook: will.i.am & (Q-Tip)]
And we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
It's like that, like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Yeah we got it like that (like that)
It's like that 'cause I got it like that

My man Shaheed's in the house
Taboo, You know I'm in the house
Black Eyed Peas represent signin out

[Intro: Bizarre]
Music, reality: sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Psych!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow, show love, or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smokin' crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground
'Fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryna smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off
Lid to the can of whip-ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shootin', I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap
Motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him escape with that
Man, I hate this crap
This ain't rap, this is crazy, the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
Ain't no gettin' rid of McVay, if so, you would've tried
The only way I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically
Arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessy
Got drunk then I finished him
I'm every nigga's favorite archenemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently
I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres (Bah)
I'll murder you, I gauge and have me turn into
A mad man, Son of Sam, bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dyin', you think not?
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I was happy havin' a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy
But it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you, dawg
And you ain't got nothin' left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with their hands out
Checkin' for your record when it's sellin'
When it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink 'til your car spin
You think, "Damn!" when you slam into the wall and you fall
Out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder would they even call?
When the music stops

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up lookin' for you with a pistol sippin' a can of Pennzoil
I'm revved up; who said what when lead bust?
Your head just explode with red stuff
I'm handcuffed, tossed in the paddy-wagon
Braggin' about how you shouted like a coward
Bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given a chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me
Just the thought of dyin' alone that really irks me
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playin' tug-of-war wit' your life
Fuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
Deliver that shit that coroners like
You hype poppin' shit in broad daylight, nigga, you're a goner at night (When the music stops)

[Verse 5: Proof]
Instigators turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors, wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark, my dogs all bark like, "Woof!"
Proof, nigga, I'm a wolf
Get your whole roof caved in like reindeer hooves
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breathe, shit, the more I moves
It's Hill Street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues, nigga
Or make the news, bet you all y'all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop

[Verse 6: Bizarre]
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
N.W.A said "Fuck tha Police," now I'm in jail
'93 was strictly R&B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson, who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Flyin' down Sunset, smokin' crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P. had me grimy and gritty
Marilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm goin' in shock
I'm reachin' for the Glock, but the music stops
*gunshots and crowd hollering*

[Intro: Fatt Father]
I told y'all motherfuckers I was coming back (Oh shit)
What now, nigga? What now? What? Brewster Projects, nigga

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm trying to run and get my motherfucking gun
(Nigga, what about yo' wife?) Nigga, fuck my wife
I'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life
Oh, shit! The shooter's coming
Bitches hollering, niggas running
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm trying to make it to the Saint Andrew's door
(Hey, man) ...That's the sound of the Glock
Even DJ House Shoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around, and forgot my TEC
I don't see nobody, but Fatt Father and Hex

[Verse 2: Kuniva, Eminem]
(Kuniva, you alright?) These niggas is tripping (Where's Bizarre at?) (I don't know, man)
I'm trying to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wylin'
Two minutes ago, we was all joking and smiling
This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing and sighing
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier, and she crying
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield and
She got hit, and now she's yelling (Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me!
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38, I hope it's not too late!

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 3: Swifty, Kon Artis]
(I been trying to call you all day, motherfucker, where you at?)
I'm on 7 Mile...what the fuck was that?
Damn, somebody hit me from the back!
(What with? They car?) With a gat, nigga, and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?) I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi (Shit, that's the clique we beefing with!)
Man! (I swear!) And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leaving a carcass today
And I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up!

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
Trying to get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three-thousand and some odd
Fans and some cum-wad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aiming for, six feet away’s the door
Into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, having a Mazel Tov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah, I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
God damn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again, I can't do it
I scoop Dee, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
Made it to the front door and collapsed
On the steps, looked up, and I seen Swift shooting it out
But I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his four-fifth

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Yo, it's Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left hand, Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although, I can't stay here to fight, 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right, bitches, I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (Bitch, bring me a bottle of Mo')
I just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 1: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah
She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
(Down)
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

[Verse 3: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun

[Chorus]
Happiness is a warm gun (Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, mama (Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)

[Bridge]
When I hold you in my arms (Ooh, oh, yeah)
And I feel my finger on your trigger (Ooh, oh, yeah)
I know nobody can do me no harm (Ooh, oh, yeah)
Because

[Outro]
(Happiness) Is a warm gun, mama (Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is (Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun (Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Well, don't you know that happiness is a warm gun, mama?
(Is a warm gun, yeah)

[Intro]
Psst, hey, listen
(Da da da da da da da da da daaaa)
Haha, I love my job (Woo!)
Makes me feel like...Superman! Haha
(Da da da da da da da da da daaaa)
Can you fly? I can, wannan see?

[Chorus]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place that you can't see but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

[Verse 1]
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
When lyrics are constantly took outta context
Failure to communicate with Congress has
Been a problem for the longest, I guess
But maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought, see how long it takes to digest
Feelin' good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really shoulda fell but I stood, see, I came
Like a flame in the night, like a ghost in the dark
There's a ray, there's a light, there's a hope, there's a spark
But when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set their differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe, because

[Chorus]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place that you can't see but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

[Verse 2]
My music can be slightly amusin'
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusin'
Tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid, ain't it? I get sick of tryin' to explain it
See, I could sit and argue with you, but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond
'Cause I came here to uplift, let your woes be gone
Tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin', constantly usin'
The Constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothin' less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone, rebuildin'
World revolvin', still evolvin', still Slim
How many kids’ll copy? Prob'ly millions
But I'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby till then, 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place that you can't see but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

[Verse 3]
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked-up young kids
At a alarming rate, common denominate
Add it up and you'll see just why I dominate
I try to stimulate, but kids emulate
And mimic every move you make, "Slim, you great!"
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
'Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it, but it's inhumane
For me to see you be influenced and pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I could be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure, every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but

[Chorus]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place you that can't see but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Yeah, what up, Detroit?
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh, no, he didn't
They didn't do it again (What-what, you what?)
You shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
Oh, fo' sho'
Uh-uh, naw, you smell that?
This is special right here (What-what, what-what-what?)
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie, baby, uh
To the boogie-oogie-oogie
Yeah, ya know, what's crackin', Dre?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
Just let me lay back and kick some old simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit, and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Best throw on "Guilty Conscience" at concerts
And watch mosh pits 'til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious (Watch out, nigga)
Some of these crowds that Slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard, when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw
Is niggas from Crenshaw, from Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again (Shit)
You and what army could harm me?
D.R.E. and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach (Westside)
Came a long way to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long Uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare just bein' Andre
But I…

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & Eminem]
Somehow, some way
Hello, nigga, you know about Dogg-ay (Snoop Dogg)
And let me cut these niggas up and show 'em where the fuck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin' from the shit that I be spittin', son (Yeah)
Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run (Watch out)
Got about fifty guns and I love
All of 'em the same, bang-bang (Word up)
Damn, baby girl, what's your name? (What's your name?)
I forgot, what'd you say it was? Damn, a nigga buzzed (Fucked up)
Hangin' in the club with my nephew Eminem (What's up, Slim?) What up, Cuz? (What up, Snoop?)
The Great White American Hope (Uh-huh)
Done hooked up with the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast, baby

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the façade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough, I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees
Come on

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 4: Eminem & Snoop Dogg]
Aw, naw, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls (What?), dick six-inch long (Mm)
Back up in the heezy, baby
He's Shady (He's so crazy!) (Ha-ha-ha)
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right
To say what I like and walk around flippin' the bird?
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That, somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here:
I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('Cause they know)
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door (The back door)
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (A .44)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Intro]
America! Ha ha ha! We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars
For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold… or so we're told
(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)

[Verse 1]
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on

[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Verse 2]
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby (Ooh, baby!) — Look at my sales!
Let's do the math: If I was black, I would've sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic! Show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
"Fuck it," until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was prob'ly his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped: sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's—

[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Verse 3]
See, the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms prob'ly would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too, because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like, "I don't like this note!"
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say "faggot", shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for—

[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Outro]
So to the parents of America, I am the Derringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the *galf*​​ and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you, Ms. Cheney! Fuck you, Tipper Gore!
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have! Fuck you!
Ha ha ha, I'm just playin', America
You know I love you

[Chorus]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty! (Ah!)
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!

[Verse 1]
Warning, this shit gon' be rated R: restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self-inflicted
Doctor slapped my mama, "Bitch, you got a sick kid!"
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses, and disguises
'Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
"Murder-murder, redrum!"
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
"How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?"
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out (RRRAH!), killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler (Ah! Ah!)
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring your bitch, I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her

[Chorus]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!

[Verse 2]
I lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons
With a bunch of crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippets, passed out like sampler snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Lace it up with cocaine, so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the rum
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke and left rich
Walking biohazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Dandruff's making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check, bitch!
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast (The fuck is this?!)
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, then probably one of us broke in

[Chorus]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!

[Verse 3]
My head's ringing, like it was Spider-Sense tingling
Blitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin (Allah, Allah)
Delinquent, choking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like, "Whoo, this is good! Who sings this?"
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit!"
It was predicted by a medic, I'd grow
To be an addicted diabetic, living on liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicking, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posin' stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying; God, is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip-hop
They say that's where it lives, the closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Set up for these white blue-collared hicks
It's to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
(Pssh!) For those who kiss ass and swallow dicks!

[Hook]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
The loser, microphone abuser
Feet hurtin', I just walked from Jerusalem
So you should get on the side with the movement
I'm the proof and I'll die just to prove it
What you wanna know? Anything, whatever
I can't tell you, I can show you better
Me-Me and my gun, we took an oath together
Said, "I will never die, if we both together"
Yeah, this is my testification
I'ma Wayne on their hands like precipitation
And in hell, you-you need justification
But-but for me, it was just a vacation
Heheheh, yeah

[Chorus: Shanell]
Somebody tell me when's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', run it all
When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Run it all!

[Verse 2: Shanell]
I lost all my money, I lost half my mind
Can't find my direction, where's the finish line?
Could I be that far away from it all? How far to go?
If I can stay for it all, then I shouldn't fall

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Shanell]
Uhh, but if I fall, I fall up and let the clouds hug me
And if I fall down, I bet I hit the ground runnin'
Bet you search and found nothin', looking for the finish line
Stop short cuttin', you fuckin' up your finish time
Shit, but every twice in a while
It feels like I'm runnin', and life is the miles
Yeah, but until the lights dimmin' down
I'll be runnin' 'round, runnin', runnin'
Oh, oh-whoa, will you tell me?

[Chorus: Shanell]
Somebody tell me when's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', run it all
When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Run it all!

[Verse 4: Shanell & Lil Wayne]
Counting all my pennies but it doesn't add up
At the mercy but somehow it ain't enough
Reading all the red lights trying not to give up
But I don't know how long it's gonna last, ohh
It's almost over now
I say it's almost over now
The end is gettin' closer now
Better do what you suppose to cause the world is oh so short now

[Chorus: Shanell]
Somebody tell me when's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', run it all
When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Run it all!

[Outro: Shanell & Lil Wayne]
When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end?
Runnin', run it all
Yeah! I'm runnin' out of time, I'm runnin' out of space
Feel like I'm runnin' 'round, but I'm runnin' in place
We all in the race, I'm just another sprinter
If there's no finish line, then who's the real winner?

[Hook: J. Cole]
Ay, one time (One time) one time (One time)
Ay, throw your hands to the sky tonight
'Cause I think I see the baddest little thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right, and girl you dead right
If your head right, I’ll be there every night
I just might change your life
'Cause baby you got it (You got it) you got it (You got it)
You got it (You got it) you got it (You got it, hey)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, real cold world
I watch you hit the floor and watch it drop it real low, girl
Last time I seen you, you was a lil old girl
Had a crush, now we grown and you still so thorough
Uh, clap for her, work it 'til you exhausted
I swear ain't nothing worse than a bad bitch that lost it
Brains off the chain, smart mouth with a dumb ass
Goddamn, your ex-man is a dumbass
When you was leaving, did he put up a fight?
Was he stressing you? Wasn’t fucking you right?
Well, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
One man’s pain is another man’s pleasure
One damn thing you can’t change is the weather
But even if it rain, we get rained on together, huh
It’s whatever, you shine, I shine
I know you got a 9 to 5, I’ll be your 5 to 9

[Hook: J. Cole]
Ay, one time (One time) one time (One time)
Ay, throw your hands to the sky tonight
'Cause I think I see the baddest little thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right, and girl you dead right

You got it (You got it) you got it (You got it, hey)

May this song reach your heart
Uh, man, I could hear 'em saying
May this song reach your heart
Ayy, yeah

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, go 'head and pop it like you do in the mirror
I’m picking through the crowd, tryna see a little clearer
High heel wearer, uh, hell of a body
First one to spot you and I ain't telling nobody
Nope, I’m peeking at your ass, winking at your ass
If I don't bag, I’ll be thinking 'bout your ass
For the whole week, no time for cold feet
She too bad to pass, so fine, I'm gon' speak
I tell her my name Jermaine, I’m tryna be lowkey
She tell me I got that flame, "Your rhymes are so deep"
Damn, girl thank you, shit, you so bad
Know your daddy wish he could still spank you, hol' up
'Fore these other niggas roll up and try and get ya
The ones that say they riders but never do ride with ya
I’m tryna vibe wit'cha so won't you throw me your phone number?
And let them lames get your old number

[Hook: J. Cole]
Ay, one time (One time) one time (One time)
Ay, throw your hands to the sky tonight
'Cause I think I see the baddest little thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right, and girl you dead right
If your head right, I’ll be there every night
I just might change your life

Roc Nation, Wale, haha

[Verse 3: Wale]
Look, Cole World, still a cold world
And a couple y'all is cool but we a little more thorough, huh
Whole time, a little more girls
You know I spit that sick shit and there’s still no cure
Hold up, loud packs like I got cancer
Choking on them white boys make a Black Panther
Love my women with high heels and high standards
And only cheat on my broad if I run out of answers
I got that vicious flow, Moncler winter coat
I ain't superstitious, I make all these broads split my pole
Ha, you dig it, this shit ain't for beginners
I’m something like a fetus, see, I'm not quite kidding
And there's something you ain't seeing like I block y'all vision
Like my Remy with no juice, you a lot like Bishop
Hundred K in twenty-two hours
See, money talks, you muthafuckers is Boomhauer
No check back, in debt, yep
Loud in my J, y'all smoke that Gallaudet
Higher than I need to be, flyer 'cause I need to be
Love our conversation but it’s late right now, I need to beat, haha
One time for the Ville that Cole rep
Another time for the city of the slow death
I don't understand why these niggas so vexed
I don't need no chains with no cross to know I’m blessed
Hold up!

[Hook: J. Cole]
Ay, one time (One time) one time (One time)
Ay, throw your hands to the sky tonight
'Cause I think I see the baddest little thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right, and girl you dead right
If your head right, I’ll be there every night
I just might change your life
'Cause baby you got it (You got it) you got it (You got it)
You got it (You got it) you got it (You got it, hey)

[Outro: Janelle Monáe]
May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart

[Produced by DJ Frank E, Kanye West & Mike Dean]

[Intro: Kanye West]
Whose fault?

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Bridge: John Legend]
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

[Chorus: John Legend]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
On the bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fuckin' self
'Til about 2 a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You weren't perfect, but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Grippin' you up, fuckin' and chokin' you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't gettin' this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be havin' mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other niggas is strokin' you
Lie and say I hit you, he sittin' there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm callin' your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money, that ain't right, girl
You gettin' blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, "Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls"
"All of the lights," she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied bein' in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything
How do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Chloe Mitchell

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much

[Outro: Kanye West]
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called, it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up, but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing, whole thing

["The Best Birthday": Chris Rock & Salma Kenas]
Oh my God
Baby, you done took this shit to another motherfuckin' level
Now, a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be gettin' no pussy like this
Goddamn, goddamn
Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?
(Yeezy taught me)
You never used to talk dirty, but now you goddamn disgusting
My, my God, where'd you learn that?
(Yeezy taught me)
Look at you, motherfuckin' butt-ass-naked
With them motherfuckin' Jimmy Choos on
Who taught you how to put some motherfuckin' Jimmy Choos on?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yo, you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now, shit
You done went all porno on a nigga, okay?
And I-I-I-I, I love it, and I thank you
I thank you, my dick thanks you
How'd you learn, how, how did your pussy game come up?
(Yeezy taught me)
I was fuckin' parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before
I was in there like, "Oh shit, I never been here before
I've never even seen this part of Pussy Town before"
It's like you got this shit reupholstered or some shit
What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all reupholstered?
(Yeezy reupholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
And when I see that nigga, I'ma thank him
I'ma buy the album, I'ma download that motherfucker
I'ma shoot a bootlegger
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Ah
I still can't believe you got me this watch
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted
With the bezel? This is the motherfucker I wanted
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in The Source
I 'member, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source
That's right, that's right
Yo, yo, babe, yo, yo, this the best birthday ever
Where'd you learn to treat a nigga like this?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yeezy taught you well
Yeezy taught you well

[Intro: Dirty Money]
So hard to breathe this air that we call love (ooh)
Ain't nothin' worse than the hurt we receive from love (ooh yeah)
When you get hurt by the one you livin' for
Pain can make you wanna love no more

[Refrain: Diddy]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 1: Diddy]
Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
I'm going through hell to convince she love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I’m ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I about to do when her parents do not try

[Bridge 1: Dirty Money]
So many tears I cried
But all for nothin' I’m afraid to say
Oh

[Refrain: Diddy & Dirty Money]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (I can't)
I love you more than I love myself (no, woah)
Lovin' you no more (I can't)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be loving you no more (no, no, baby)
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 2: Diddy]
I’ve been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is tryin' to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life, now it's changed
My life, ain't the same as you are
Heartbroke to the point sometimes wanna end it
If I can’t have what mean most to me

[Bridge 1: Dirty Money]
So many tears I cried (I cried)
But all for nothing I’m afraid to say
Oh, oh, oh

[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money & Drake]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (I can't)
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more  (I can't) (Diddy)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, no, baby) (Drizzy baby, uh uh)
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, tryin' not to over think
Only 'cause I drove and I've done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there’s pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that’s sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you’re suspicious I’m a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that’s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I’m gon' do?
Since everything that I’m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I’m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same, baby, then we’d be for sure

[Bridge 2: Dirty Money]
So selfishly, you can only show feelings
When you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh, time, oh, time has changed and I’m no longer willing
Can't you see how my heart is bleeding?
I guess I…

[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, lovin' you no more)
I love you more than I love myself (no, no)
Lovin' you no more (I can't)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, woah)
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more (oh, no)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (just wanna love you baby)
I love you more than I love myself (just wanna love you baby)
Ay
I promise we gone live how we want
I promise we gone get all we want
Split the bill, naw forget the bill, look
We gon' buy the whole restaurant
Remember way back when we had said back then
We will be the ones to have arenas packed in
Livin' big time
Yup big time
To the point where my name could've been Big Ben
No matter what they gave out I never gave in
Without sunshine I never caved in
I'm Finally Famous 'til the lights is faded
Then the crowd is jaded
When I hop on stages

[Hook]
Hey
You don't live for life
So live your life
When you live and die
Look back and say you did it right
When you get it right
I hope it lasts for life

[Hook x2]
Last for life
Last for life
Last for life
Man I wish that this could last for life
(Lookin' back) Lookin' back on all we saw
Who woulda thought we'd get this far
You search your life for Heaven on Earth
When you get it right hope it lasts for life

[Verse 2]
I promise they gone all try and be me
I promise they gone know who we are
I promise we that gon' be successful
With or without the college degree
Remember old head use to tell my momma
That boy gon' be something that there I promise
So they should not expect nothin' less than to see us set like dinettes, I guess
And we all waitin' for tomorrow
Sometimes without acting you gotta deal with drama
Hey to get these dreams I figure it's gon' take more than Nyquil and pajamas
But they know what's up
We hoppin' out, and they know it's us
When we get it right
Look back and say
That we did it right
And hope it lasts for life

[Hook x2]
Last for life
Last for life
Last for life
Man I wish that this could last for life
(Lookin' back) Lookin' back on all we saw
Who woulda thought we'd get this far
You search your life for Heaven on Earth
When you get it right hope it lasts for life

[Big Sean Talking]
Yo I remember I used to ride to school with my dog Tone
And we be like listening to Kanye, Jay-Z, you know like everybody, basically
And it's crazy now cause I do business with them
You know people always ask me like you know, "Why you ain't go to school? Why you ain't go to college?"
It's like man, I didn't go to college cause...this is what I want to do, you know what I'm saying?
This is my dream
You know the thing is you can go and ask Jay-Z who Big Sean is, you can ask Pharrell who Big Sean is, you could walk into Def Jam offices right now be like "Who is Big Sean?" and LA Reid will tell you who Big Sean is
You can ask Nigo who Big Sean man, and they know
I'm 20 years old man, I done been around the world. I done been around the world. I done been around the world doing what I love to do
Like, what more could you ask, you know? And that's real

[Verse 1]
I'm rolling down the hill, snowballing, getting bigger
An explosion in the chamber, the hammer from the trigger
I seen him get stabbed, I watched the blood spill out
He had more cuts than my man Chuck Chillout
24 is my age, and .22 is my gauge
I'm writing rhymes on a page, I'm goin' off in a rage
Cause I'm out on a mission, a stolen car mission
Had a small problem with the transmission
Three on the tree in the middle of the night
I have this steak on my head 'cause I got into a fist fight
Life comes in phases, take the good with the bad
You bought the coins on the street (Holmes), and you know you got had
Because it's all high spirit, you know you got to hear it
Don't touch the mic, baby, don't come near it

[Chorus]
It's gonna get you, it's gonna get you
It's gonna get you, girl, it's gonna get you

[Verse 2]
Looking down the barrel of a gun
Son of a gun, son of a bitch
Getting paid, getting rich
Ultra violence be running through my head
Cold medina, y'all, makin' me see red
Rapid fire Louie, like Rambo got bullets
I'ma die harder, like my kid Bruce Willis
I love girlies, waxing and milking
Coordinating trim is my man, Dave Scilken
Predetermined destiny is who I am
You got your finger on the trigger like the Son of Sam I am
Like Clockwork Orange, going off on the town
I've got homeboys bonanza to beat your ass down
Well, I'm mad at my desk, and I'll be writing all curse words
Expressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words
You're a headless chicken chasin', a sucker freebasin'
You're looking for a fist to put your face in
Well, get hip, get hip, don't slip ya knuckle heads
Racism is schism, on a serious tip

[Verse 1]
Why would she make calls out the blue?
Now I'm awake, sleep (Less in June) or (Missing you)

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, then play you will, I pray you will

[Verse 2]
Mrs. So Fly crash-lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you do
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, one day you will, I pray you will

[Verse 3]
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool then lose control

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, if you will, I pray you will

[Verse 4]
I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Please say you will, for real, I pray you will

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
This is a public service announcement
Lil Wayne, Weezy F. Baby, is the best rapper alive
Hit me
Haha
Good morning, New York
Good afternoon, New Orleans
Good night, America
Hahahaha
Yeah

[Hook]
Dough is what I got, lil mama
Dough is what I got, pretty lady
Dough is what I got, shawty
Dough is what I got, baby
C'mon, I'm paid, I'm paid
I'm paid, I'm paid

[Verse 1]
Hey! Give a woman none—uh-uh!
I already gave my brother some
It's my sister turn
Ain't it funny how the fish do bird?
But your boy just relax like a fresh, new perm
As the world, in the barrel of the pistol, turn
And we get it how we live, never live and learn
Gotta talk about the flow 'cause you is concerned
Only down-South rapper could've been in The Firm
Or The Commission or Wu-Tang, nigga
Tryna tell you I can kick it like Liu Kang, nigga
Got that Sub-Zero flow, how you want me, ma?
Make her "Get over here!" like Scorpion, and
When it comes down to this recording
I must be LeBron James if he's Jordan
No—I won rings with my performance
I'm more Kobe Bryant of an artist
Same coach, same game, been starting
Same Triangle Offense
I come through the lane like a Dodge, and
Referee niggas is lame, they call charging
I have no brain, I'm retarded
We are not the same, I'm a Martian
You can be my Jane, I'm your Tarzan
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison
I am magnificent like Marcus
You might wanna fall back like August
Or "late September," whatever you call it
I hit niggas in the head like Vonage
I am talking to no particular audience
But understand: I'm the guardian
And understand: There won't be no guarding him
You will just get played like an accordion
I don't give a damn if she's bossy
I keep pussy running like a faucet
She better catch like she Steve Largent
Because I'm "What's up!?" like Martin

[Interlude]
Hahaha
Woo!
Yeah! See—
I know y'all talking about me
And y—you don't like what you hear sometimes
But um... um, since I'm so bright
I'ma put the spotlight on you, baby

[Hook]
Show me what you 'bout, lil daddy
I know you need to stop, stop hatin'
I know what you not, whoadie
And that is Weezy Baby
Blunts up, now, blaze (Hey), blaze (Hey)
Blaze (Hey), blaze (Hey)

[Verse 2]
I'm working—Yeah!
Tell the world, "Take six"
Young Dictionary, make words make sense
Then, I make cents make dollars
Make the skinny girl holler, make the fat girl hungry
Make the ugly girls want me, put the pretty girls on me
Make the shy girls horny, make the fly girls corny
And only for me
Because of who I A-M, holla back in the morning
Hey! Now holla back if you own shit
The CEO of the moment
Bullshit: I don't condone it
Aww, baby, just hop on it

[Interlude]
Hahaha
Yeah, ha
You like that
I know!
Marley, what up? Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Hook]
Show me what you got, lil mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shawty
Show me what you got, baby
You rappers ain't safe, safe
Safe, safe, ahh!
Haha

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh, we got the black elite in the house tonight
Rosewood
I feel like I'm at the NAACP or something right now
The Essence Festival
Q-Tip on the beat too, uh, uh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They try to tell me my chain broke the levee
Maybe 'cause it's flooded
Why you walk around with a baby cross's cousin?
My teeth already white, y'all gon' make me floss for nothing
My teeth real diamonds, what's the cause of the frontin'?
Why y'all got all caps on?
Don Cheadle time, get extra black on 'em
Burn, Hollywood, burn
Take too long for niggas to get they turn
Probably be cremated before I get my earn
They try to tell me that aliens built the pyramids
I swear life's a bitch on her period
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
I make my jeweller add a few more links
You can look at me, tell I ain't fuck what nobody think
And my face always lookin' like somebody stinks

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Question:
What color was the skin of the man who beared the cross?
No matter how many lashes, they couldn't beat it off
How many Cassius' will we see in one lifetime?
That's why it's Miles Davis, Kobe, it's Mike time
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered
In the 1800s; y'all forget that
I got called "Nigga" on Twitter so many times, yo, I lived that
Now I'm just tryna find where to raise my kids at
'Cause they don't want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey, realtor, I'm lookin' for a nice park
Twelve noon, she said my family gon' make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
The bullshit they got us listenin' to, in this existence
Don't give up now, just a little more persistence
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
Keep 'em away, hanh! Something might happen
This is the makin' of a masterpiece
So we broke out the chains and told the master, "Peace!"

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Some wear a suit and tie, they don't wanna remain average
Some wear a suit and tie like a chain and a straitjacket
My chain heavy, stop in that traffic, coppers harass us
Then DA attack us, want us in chains like B.A. Baracus
So no major factor in my decision to be a rapper
Was rebellion; being anti-establishment was attractive
To a black kid from Brooklyn, flames got the thangs cooking
Land of the juks where them lames get them chains tooken
It ain't lookin' good for you if you're a tourist here
Sometimes I rhymes the sort of frequency that only purists hear
A couple rappers tried to beef with me, nobody's scared
Niggas was so fucking corny that nobody cared
Why I gotta battle rappers? I debate scholars
Question: do it gotta make sense if it make dollars?
Sick visions is living inside of brains
It's like we sadomasochistic, addicted to whips and chains
Figuratively, quite literally, clinically insane
Spit flames and then visit the higher plane
Try in vain to ignore it, don't buy the chain if you can't afford it
'Ye, them lonely-idled whores by the boards, trust

[Verse 4: Consequence]
That old ball-and-chain had me chained up for weeks
So of course I'm off the chain as soon as I hit the streets
And now when we link she saying the game's over
I drove her crazy and she became a chain smoker
Now the new dude she's saying that can stay over
Should be a chain, who goes by the name of Choker
That's what he did when she told him he should play the sofa
So the chains on the door, I'm on the way over
Now when I came over, his only response
Was, "You must be the owner of a chain of restaurants
'Cause I'mma eat your food for that chain that I wore
'Cause you be running 'round like the chain make the man"
So it's obvious the he don't know the chain of command
'Cause my chain commands, that kind of respect
And it's so chunky that it's a pain in the neck
But it came with a check, I remember on chaining day
It spoke for itself and this is what the chain would say
"Them chain snatchers are hoping that you ain't ready
So don't get distracted, keep your aim steady
Or there'll be a chain reaction since my chain's heavy"

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should

[Intro: Eminem + Hailie]
Hailie, what do you want to be when you grow up, baby?
I don't know, but I don't want to
Grow up to be like Ja Rule's little dirty-ass kids
Ha ha, yeah, c'mon
G-G-G-G-G-G-G Unit
Hailie, come here, baby! Bring Daddy his Oscar!
We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass

[Verse 1: Swift]
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
I'm quick to murder ink with lead
And I ain't talking 'bout a pencil
Look at what the fuck you done got into
I see you found your niche, you just a bitch with a menstrual
Claiming you a murderer, and you spelled it wrong
You put E before the D, ‘cause that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a replica guy
If he was still alive, you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch, keep it real
Life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins three deals
That another nigga got you? They didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover, ‘cause he need it
And all you niggas hating, shut your mouths!
It's just that real niggas ain't buying that shit y'all put out

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Doe, rae, me, but we don't sing, motherfuckers
So Murder Inc, do your thing, motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team
Who expects nothin' less than R&B coming from that regime
"Regime" is a little extreme
Neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing
Weave eye-witness team on the TV screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green
Don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a motherfuckin' actor, slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billie Holiday – how it happen?
Artist and repertoire saw him in action
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed him
Told him, "Reenact him, you go platinum!"
They seen it for sure, I know that Afeni Shakur
Don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins reenacting her boy
So I'm click-clackin' this toy, mash and destroy
Shady slash Aftermath and Detroit, motherfucker!

[Hook: Eminem]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me ‘cause you washed up, lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
Now, we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs
To the grievance and the crying and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious, nigga, you shook
You half of a half-way crook; get off X dick, go sing a hook!
Nigga, and you can't replace the late great one
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga, please stick to the script
Before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino, you ain't shit but a bitch!
Fuckin' old-ass, ignorant, innocent-lookin' senior citizen
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on: is it me, or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?
A bitch-made man; now, how you gonna connect
With them short ass arms, like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream, holler and curse
Go ahead and respond
And pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

[Verse 4: Proof]
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up, Gotti? And this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggas?
Roll like a boss, in the streets they still feel us
It's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept
You talking nonsense to walking bomb threats
Contact was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threaten at the boss, you gon' see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Word to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Cadillac Pac or that transvestite?
That dress like a Lil Kim fox
You're just like a little windbox
Press tight on the trigger of this Glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying mock Pac
You Mockaveli; get your own identity!

[Hook: Eminem]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me ‘cause you washed up, lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

[Over hook]
Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again
Fuckin' punk-pussy bitch! I'll fuck you up, boy! Never!
Don't you never in your motherfuckin' life…
I'll choke the shit out of you little motherfuckin' midget
Hailie'll whip your motherfuckin' ass

[Outro: Obie Trice]
That's right, motherfuckers
Shady records, what you know about it?
Fuck Benzino! Fuck Ja Rule!
Nigga, this Obie Trice right here talkin' to you motherfuckers
Ja Rule punk ass, yeah, fuckin' Soul 4 Real ass
Nigga, that's Soul 4 Real
That the nigga from Soul 4 Real!
Candy Rain-ass nigga, he got a deal, now he rappin'
You don't know what's, faggot-ass motherfuckers
Get money to all my real niggas, man
Obie Trice, D-12, G Unit, 50 Cent, Hailie Jade

[Outro: Hailie and Eminem]
Daddy, is Ja Rule taller than me?
No, honey, you guys are the same size

[Intro]
*Eminem pukes into the toilet*
*Eminem hocks and spits into the toilet*
*Toilet flush*
There I go, thinking of you again

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 1]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song, whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it, I'ma start right here, I'll just be brief, I'm
'Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now I'm sitting here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim (Shi-i-i-i-i-i-it)
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you've ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you (Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-hoo)

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 2]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter that you'd probably just shred up, yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece of
Paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle
You're a fucking cokehead slut, I hope you fucking die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut, I hope you die (Di-i-i-i-i-i-ie)
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack (A-a-a-a-a-a-ack)
But what else can I do? I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do is pu-u-u-u-u-u-uke

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Outro]
*Eminem pukes into the toilet*
*Eminem hocks and spits into the toilet*
*Toilet flush*
*Eminem burps*
Ah, damn!
Fucking bitch

[Intro]
I don't understand
Why are you being so mean?
You're a mean, mean man

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 1]
Alright, listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes, close 'em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes, we are going to explore
Into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
Now why did they make yoo-hoo? Pippity-kaka-poo-poo
Psych, I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening
Okay, now I need your undivided attention
Sir, I have a question, why do I always sense this undeniable tension?
From the moment that I enter into the room it gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itching at me, is it just because...

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 2]
Alright now I (Shit), I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again, you idiot, no, I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me is that I fucked up, ain't it?
But I can bust one take without looking at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay? You're drooling, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch?
A bunch of sweets or something? What, you munch a bunch of Crunch 'n Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum, your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
"Yes, I do, sir, what am I on?" You, sir, are on truth serum
"Marshall, I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying all these terrible
Evil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurities"

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 3]
Alright, now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, wanna check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror
How 'bout now? What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind, dying, there's no denying
That my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why are you even doing this to yourself? It's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this? This is torturous
My point is this
That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just as...

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Outro]
Fuck off my dick

[Produced By Syience]

[Intro]
Hey, I got a dollar and a dream
It's all a nigga got so it's about that green
And I'm all up in that spot, hey

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I fiend about
Ay, tell me am I wrong for visualizing material shit I never had?
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream
Why do we cling to the villains, knowing they kill 'em?
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily
At times I question God, can you blame me? They can’t tame me
My voice screech through the streets, I'm a beast on 'em
Oh no, he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him
But never will he run unless you call police on him

[Chorus]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap, sometimes I'm throwin' up the peace sign
It's two sides to a nigga though
I said it's two sides to a nigga, yo
Ay look, sometimes I'm feeling high then I'm feeling low
Lord, will I die? Will I survive? Let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
It's two sides to a nigga, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 2]
Yeah, some pussy niggas pulled out on me and my mans
Wasn’t for the pistol, we drop 'em right where he stands
But still we never ran, foolish pride made us stand right there
Not understanding we could lose our life there
And then it hit us, thinking 'bout the close calls from long distance
Uh, as lil niggas in the 'Ville, we was trippin
Type of nosy ass niggas to watch the fight until it's over
They ran when the gats came out, I moved closer
Foolish, what was I thinking? Wasn’t trying to be cool, it's
Just the thrill of the danger, get so filled up with anger
When a stranger get to violating
He sleeping on me wide awake, bitch I'll annihilate him
I'm tired of waiting on my ticket out this muh'fucker
Hope they don’t kill me before I get up out this muh'fucker
I gotta go, now can I be that nigga I thought I was? I gotta know
Will I make it like I thought I would? I gotta blow

[Chorus]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap, sometimes I'm throwin' up the peace sign
It's two sides to a nigga though
I said it's two sides to a nigga, yo
Ay look, sometimes I'm feeling high then I'm feeling low
Lord, will I die? Will I survive? Let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
It's two sides to a nigga, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I seen Heaven, seen Hell, the two faces of the Ville
One side dreams, the other side's real
One side schemes, the other side deals
What the pain brings, another mother cry still
Why the fuck am I here, God?
That nigga died, why the fuck am I still alive?
I feel ashamed 'cause the good Lord done brought all this success to me
And all I seem to focus on is all this stress on me
Blessed homie, we breathin', cold world got me sneezing
Wrote this when I was broke, so hey, I guess we even
Throwin' blows, fighting demons, tryna stop from bustin' semen
In an unfamiliar bitch, I know my niggas feel this shit
How could I fuck her raw? And I just met the ho
My dick took over, it ain't never felt this wet before
I'm stressing in my mind but its way to late to stop it
Make this shit so bad, I had a condom in my pocket
Lets change the topic, before I go berserk, I’m so alert
Riding down 95, nah, I ain't finna to go to work
I’m headed back home, ain't staying that long
I’m chasing dreams shawty, I'm paying back loans
I’m paying dues that a nigga paying tax on
I'm tryna blow like a nigga playing saxophone
I'm playing daddy to another nigga daughter
Don’t worry, even Jesus never saw his real father
It don’t bother me at all though
Yeah, say it don’t bother me at all
They got me thinking 'bout my mom though
Man, I can't wait to sing this song
I'll be like, I'll be like

[Outro]
Hey, don’t cry, hey, oh no
'Cause we ain't gotta worry 'bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry 'bout how the bills get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Don’t cry, hey, oh no
'Cause we ain't gotta worry 'bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry 'bout how them bills get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey, hey, hey

[Intro]
Yeah, farewell
Hey, farewell
All my niggas farewell
Fayettenam

[Verse 1]
Look, some niggas let their dirt out, some just keep it all in ‘em
So when a man dies all his secrets go with him
And fade, a part of history no longer known
Done did a lot of dirt I’ll bury with me when I’m gone
When my story’s told, how will they tell it?
Will they say I was a giver or remember I was selfish?
Will they say I was a sinner or pretend I was a saint?
Will I go down as a winner, what's the picture they gon' paint?
Wouldn’t say that I’m a quitter, that's one thing I know I ain't
Will they tarnish, will they taint? Glorify me, over-think?
Say they know me, say I’m great? Say I’m phoney, I was fake?
Say the things about me that they never told me to my face?
I was loved I was hated, just a nigga with a dream
I’m a liar, I was honest, I was all of these things
When I’m gone let em talk, they discussing who I am
When they bury me just know I wasn't nothing but a man
Wasn’t nothin’ but a man

[Chorus]
This for them niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
If I should die Lord this here is my will
Reincarnate a nigga send me right back to the Ville
Let me relive my younger days just once again
Reenact my memories from every friend to every sin
Keeping demons buried in my closet
But yet I put in work like a deposit on my bank account
My eyes lit while I think about my childhood now I'm blanking out
Those were truly my best days
The only thing I had to stress was how the hell to get laid
Gradually turn into me stressin’ how the hell to get paid
Been making songs so long, now how the hell they get played
Ok, I’m blowing up quickly, I guess the flow is sickly
But yet I can’t forget my past and hope it won’t forget me
Got good grades but A's can’t stop strays so pray for me
Pour liquor for my niggas but hey, don’t wait for me
'Cause I’m trying to cheat death, she out to bury my ass
You know the cliche “life's a bitch” well I’m gon marry that ass
And sign a prenup, think back to when we tore the skating rink up
Rapping and we scrapping, we got older hit the teen club
Gave mean mugs to niggas but we winked to all the girls
Then we went back to the crib thinking we had saw the world
No sir, came a long way from having momma chauffer
It's hard to think these hoes at some point were so pure
But now we play the game, when it's over send me back
I swear I’m not gon change a thing
I swear I’m not gon change a thing

[Chorus]
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah

[Produced by J. Cole]

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, ahem
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Partially functional, half of me is comfortable
The other half is close to the cliff, like Mrs. Huxtable
These boys got them holsters and clips they pack like Lunchables
Like white boys in grade school, while we ate school-made food
Just eyeing they shit, wish I was trying they shit
Knowing when mama hit the store, she wasn’t buying that shit
No, I ain't crying a bit, man that's just life, that's how that shit work
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt
Gotta learn when you get hurt, even if it's with Cupid
He beat you and you went back, you's officially stupid
Oh yeah, I understand, that's your man, you had a plan
You been together for some years, you sticking with him for the kids
So you overlook the tears, but we both know that's a bad look
'Cause 20 years from now, your daughter'll probably get her ass whooped
Look, if this too deep for the intro, I’ll find another use
But just in case it's perfect, let me introduce, Cole

[Chorus: Erykah Badu & J. Cole]
Time to save the world
Where in the world is all the time?
So many things I still don't know (Uh-uh, hey)
So many times I've changed my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes
But I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path (Yeah)
I know my heart will guide me back (Yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Man, is this too deep for the intro? If so, I’ll find another use
But just in case it's perfect, let me introduce
It’s Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move
A ill ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school
Still rap for hustlers and motherfuckers that hated school
Said, "That's for busters," then heard my shit and I made it cool
It's safe to say that I’m gifted as if I’m Christmas shopping
I got gangsta niggas lining up in admissions office
Ayy, possibly 'cause all the hoes a nigga scraped
A lot of shit up on my plate, so you know a nigga late
To my first class, I’d much rather sit up in first class
Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash?
Wasn't experienced, so nah, I didn't wear it out
Always thought my first time would be someone I cared about
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed 'bout
I used that ass for practice, so I wasn't scared out my mind
You call it rhymes, I call it clearing out my mind
Was just a young boy staring out my blinds
'Til I got free from my mama leash
Running loose through the streets like a stray dog in heat
And we looking for some freaks, can you play? Pardon me
What's your name? Don’t mistake me for no lame, no, not me
She knew I was on the team 'cause she seen how tall I be
In the club dappin’ niggas, eventually, R.I.P
Damn, you win some, you lose some, that's just how it happens
And if a nigga step up to you, then you gotta scrap 'em
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom
It's funny, I barely told nobody I started rapping
'Cause see, some niggas was haters that I just viewed as clowns
At fourteen, I knew I was the nicest dude around
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now
If they don’t know your dreams, then they can't shoot 'em down

[Interlude: J. Cole]
Ha, yeah nigga, hell yeah
I felt that one in my fuckin' soul, nigga
Haha

[Outro: Erykah Badu]
Ooh, hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
Ooh, hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere

[Chorus: Nicole Wray]
I’d never do it again, do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again (hey), do it again (hey)
I’d never do it again (hey)
Cuz this is the end

[Verse 1: GLC]
My brother told me a long time ago
Don't focus where you been, G, focus where you tryna go
I swear the game make you cold like abominable
Snowman, old man, when you trying to shine like gold
When it's my time to blow partner I'mma know
In the midst of getting dough I was hit with highs and lows
My Melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
Now I'm sittin here wishing that my guys didn’t know
They love a G, so they despise a soul
What they gon’ do to him, beyond my control
When the reaper calls, it's your time to go
Never play a nigga when you see that he is trying to grow
I'm Benny Blanco when he knocked out Carlito
And Pachanga so I'm watching every angle
Under the moonlight with the devil I've tangoed
Church on the move like Jesus in the manger
Better control the money, it's better to control the anger
So now I watch a friend the way that I watch a stranger
(Chu'ch)

[Chorus: Nicole Wray]
Do it again, I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again, do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end (uh), I’d never do it again

[Verse 2: King Chip]
Chillin', rolling up something to change my feelin'
Thinkin' about how I came up from nothing while I’m splittin'
This cigarillo, phone rings I get a call
One of my dogs tripping hard talkin about really killin them all
I say slow down, slow down, what the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran in your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I’ll be there in 20 minutes, but it only took fifteen
We wasn’t that tight, but cool enough for me to hit the scene
Not knowing this was all a set up, secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They fastest move was too slow for me
I pulled up, wasn’t no ambulance, there wasn’t no police
Something fishy going on, naive, kept pressing on
Nine gripped, thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door, they shot, I shot, someone dropped shit
The nigga with something to lose just almost lost it
Won't trust him again

[Chorus: Nicole Wray]
Do it again, I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again, do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end, I’d never do it again

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Cheese came through at 3
Salute, at ease, C had supplied the weed
Cause IBN had OD'd
It's me with a black rockstar steeze
Real rock tees, 300 a pop for these
Please, bummy? You don’t know me money
Day & Nite got flipped and I got blow for a grip
Sipping on a Heine with my Jamie-boo beside me
That's my fucking best friend
When I'm tweaking she be calming a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it
The feeling is something like a spiritual healer
That could end me, I think that’s the part I find intriguing
A little bit off, I am, I am, I am
I see that I'm caught, I am, I am, I am
It’s something like a spiritual healer that could end me
I think that's the part I find intriguing, I'm fiending

[Outro: Nicole Wray]
I’ll never do it again, do it again

[Verse 1]
I think I just fell in love with a pornstar
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what?
We headed to hell for Heaven's sakes, huh
Well, I'ma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah

[Chorus]
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby, we'll live a hell of a life

[Verse 2]
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin' from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing
Well, I guess a lotta niggas do gangbang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

[Chorus]
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby, we'll live a hell of a life

[Verse 3]
One day, I'm gon' marry a pornstar
We'll have a big-ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna roleplay 'til I roll over
I'ma need a whole day, at least roll doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day?
'specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, "Get away"
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck with the lights on

[Bridge]
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights on
With the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck, fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on

[Chorus]
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby, we'll live a hell of a life

[Outro]
I think I fell in love with a pornstar
And got married in the bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a life
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)
(Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm)
(Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm)

[Intro: Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road
And now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up where I started from

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know, between us, we was like mates of soul
Nothin' could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose
'Til more shows, haunted you nights, I suppose
That's how it go: with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire and—

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducin' you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall, I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked, I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'da even knew that? Who would'a even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them Goddamn darts at me?
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life-altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)

[Interlude: Stat Quo]
Ha, ha, yeah right, bitch
Spend some time on my dick

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
In most cases, Stat's attitude is, "Fuck a bitch!"
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic
We sufferin' because of this
Shawty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feedin' you the best of me, I should've fed you piss
We started off closer than close
But who could've predicted to know
Your trifling ways would'a stopped our growth?
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself: "Do I love these hoes?" — Nope!

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
(Yeah) Em introduced us: "50, this is Tanya, Tanya, this is 50"
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said, "You have very nice lips."
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
Why talk, when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit? (Ha-ha!)

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

[Intro]
I love you

[Refrain: Beastie Boys]
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Mike D, come and rock the sure shot

[Verse 1: Mike D, Ad-Rock, MCA]
I've got the brand new doo-doo, guaranteed like Yoo-hoo
I'm on like Dr. John, yeah, Mr. Zu Zu
I'm a newlywed, not a divorcee (yeah)
And everything I do is funky like Lee Dorsey
Well it's the taking of the Pelham 1, 2, 3
If you want a doo doo rhyme, then come see me
I've got the savoir faire with the unique rhymin'
I keep it on and on, it's never quitting time and
Strictly handheld is the style I go
Never rock the mic with the pantyhose
I strap on my ear goggles and I'm ready to go
‘Cause at the boards is the man, they call the Mario
You pull up at the function and you know I Kojak
To all the party people that are on my Bozac
I've got more action than my man, John Woo
And I've got mad hits like I was Rod Carew (yeah)

[Refrain: Beastie Boys]
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
You know you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Ad-Rock, come and rock the sure shot

[Verse 2: Mike D, Ad-Rock, MCA]
Hurra-, Hurra-
Cane will cross fade on your ass and bust your eardrums
Listen everybody cause I'm shifting gears
I'm fresh like Dougie when I get my specs
And on the microphone, I come correct
Timing like a clock when I rock the hip-hop
Top notch is my stock on the soapbox
I've got more rhymes than I've got gray hairs
And that's a lot because I've got my share (oohh, weee)
I've got a hole in my head and there's no one to fix it
I gotta straighten my thoughts
I'm thinking too much (yeah) sick shit
Everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes, takes
I'll have to step back, I gotta contemplate
Well, I'm like Lee Perry, I'm very on
Rock the microphone, and then I'm gone
I'm like Vaughn Bode, I'm a Cheech Wizard
Never quittin', so won't you listen

[Interlude]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, yes, indeed, it's fun time

[Refrain: Beastie Boys]
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
MCA, come and rock the sure shot

[Verse 3: Mike D, Ad-Rock, MCA]
I want to say a little something that's long overdue
The disrespect to women has got to be through
To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends
I want to offer my love and respect to the end
Well, you say I'm twenty-something and I should be slacking
But I'm working harder than ever and you could call it macking
So I'm supposed to sit upon my couch just watching my TV
I'm still listening to wax, I'm not using the CD
Well, I'm that kid in the corner
All fucked up and I wanna so I'm gonna (yeah)
Take a piece of the pie, why not, I'm not quittin'
Think I'm-a change up my style just to fit in
I keep my underwear up with a piece of elastic
I use a bullshit mic that's made out of plastic
To send my rhymes out to all the nations
Like Ma Bell, I got the ill communication

[Refrain: Beastie Boys]
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Keep on and rockin' the sure shot

[Outro]
B-boys, b-girls...
Tick-tock, tick-tick...tock-tock

[Hook]
One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

[Verse 1]
Feel like I lived for this moment
I see it in their eyes, them other guys don't want it
My style they can crown it, but can't dethrone it
I was aiming for the top and now I I I'm on it
What a powerful performance
I was in my zone, send flowers for opponents
Tell 'em "Get well soon"
Cause I ain't in the mood
So if you read that word backwards then it should spell 'doom'
I'm on fire, y'all can inhale fumes, as I zoom by ya
As you thinking, 'Who's higher?'
Fueled by a desire you should admire
That's why I'm what they aspire to be 'fore they retire
A livin' legend, with God givin' blessings
And game so cold they probably watching this in Heaven
Expecting the incredible, so baby watch me do that
And make the Angels say 'Lord, how he do that?'

[Hook]
One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

[Verse 2]
A champion's mentality
And so I'm scoring, ignoring the fact you're fouling me
And one, where I go you can't come
I was schooling your father boy, that make you my grandson
I've been around the block twice, now my shot nice
No referee but best believe out here I got stripes
Now that they finally consider me a legit scorer
Would you believe I started off as a bench-warmer?
Have me feelin' like Master Splinter
Now the haters and commentators say 'there's a winner'
Hey, hard work pay off, now I don't take a day off
I rest not, I guess that's why your best shot? Way off
These are the things that dreams are made of
The sweep, no time for sleep, when you're elite
If what you reap is what you sow, then what was you expecting?
Expect to come in second
While I become a legend

[Hook]
One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

[Outro]
Why don't you reach for the sky?
You don't believe you can fly?
I guess I'll see you when you get here
I guess I'll see you when you get here

Why don't you reach for the sky?
You don't believe you can fly?
I guess I'll see you when you get here
I guess I'll see you when you get here

[Hook]
One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

[Intro]
Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three!

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me and I love you more

[Verse 1]
It's sick, but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit?
We say we do it for our baby, but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck till we bust
And we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout
Till I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad, but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause—

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad, but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me and I love you more

[Verse 2]
'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways, but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one of us would have one up on the other, so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, till they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
If you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' — yeah, I would
'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm?
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact
And plus, I can bust in that, and that's why—

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me and I love you more

[Verse 3]
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh, why must we try? Is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?
Try to pull each other's legs until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
We both have, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's
"Someone else," problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric in every rhyme
All the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time, girl, I'm tellin' you what
You do it again, I'm fuckin' you up no matter what

[Bridge]
No matter what you say, or what you do
I'mma hunt you down till I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out you can't escape me, whore

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Intro]
Aye, Jim, you know the ol' sugar daddies?
They be trickin', they tell them girls
I said you could have whatever you like (If you like)
I said you could have whatever you like (If you like)
Yeah (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you could have whatever you like (If you like)
I said you could have whatever you like, yeah
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you could go wherever you like (If you like)
I said you could go wherever you like, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Anytime you want to pick up the telephone, you
Know it ain't nothin' to drop a couple stacks on you
Want it, you could get it, my dear
Five million dollar home, drop Bentleys, I swear, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I want yo' body, need yo' body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I'll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet

[Chorus]
Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you could have whatever you like (If you like)
I said you could have whatever you like, yeah
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you could go wherever you like (If you like)
I said you could go wherever you like, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Shawty, you the hottest, love the way you drop it
So good I swore you went to college
Hundred karat deposit, to vacations in the tropics
‘Cause e'rybody know it ain't trickin' if you got it
You need never ever gotta go to yo' wallet
Long as I got rubberband banks in my pocket
Five, six rides with rims and a body kit
You ain't gotta downgrade, you can get what I get
My chick could have what she want
And go in any store for any bag she want
And, no, she ain't never had a man like that
To buy you anything your heart desire like that, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I want yo' body, need yo' body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I'll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet

[Chorus]
Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you could have whatever you like (If you like)
I said you could have whatever you like, yeah
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you could go wherever you like (If you like)
I said you could go wherever you like, yeah (Yeah)

[Bridge]
I'm talkin' big boy rides, and big boy ice
Let me put this big boy in yo' life
You just be so fresh, and look so nice
Let me put this big boy in yo' life; that's right

[Pre-Chorus]
I want yo' body, need yo' body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I'll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet

[Chorus]
Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you could have whatever you like (If you like)
I said you could have whatever you like, yeah
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you could go wherever you like (If you like)
I said you could go wherever you like, yeah (Yeah)

[Intro]
I feel like hip hop
Used to be a voice for the voiceless
And now it's become, at least in the mainstream
A symbol of misogyny, gay panic, fiscal irresponsibility
So I figure
If you can't beat 'em
Join 'em

[Verse 1]
Hittin' the club up VIP
I got a fake mustache and a fake ID
I look like Wooly Willy
With a really wooly willy
And I bypass the bouncer
Pass by an ex and I flex and bounce her, wowser
Look at all of Bo's hoes
Looking for a ride on Bo's hose
And I spot a little Latino, booty so big call it Oprah's ego
We go to it, through it, she says, "Dios mio mi amigo!"
Pull it out, stick it in your mouth, and I bust in the back of ya
Swallow bitch, there's people starving in Africa!

[Chorus]
Single every single day
Do it every single way
Make the single ladies say
Oooh Bo
And if I were gay
Though I swear I'm straight
I'd make them fellas say

[Verse 2]
You're an ice cream sundae with a cherry on top
But careful, cherry, cause I'm the King of Pop
Pop pop pop goes my weasel
Now ya looking like Jackson Pollock's easel
My suggestion is you don't blow 'til you know what congestion is
Swallow when you know what digestion is
Follow Bo, the only question is
Have you been splattered before by the mad-hatter matador?
Cake-batter never more
It don't matter whether you're Spanish, French, Swedish or Cambodian
I'll slime you so hard you could be on Nickelodeon

[Chorus]
Single every single day
Do it every single way
Make the single ladies say
Oooh Bo
And if I were gay
Though I swear I'm straight
I'd make them fellas say
Oooh Bo
Oh Bo-o, ooh Bo, Bo
A-a-Oooh Bo, Oooh Bo, Oooh Bo

[Verse 3]
You think that you can handle me?
Girl, don't make me laugh
I said my junk is bipolar
It will split you in half (yea)
And if you're lucky, I might just bring you home
And I'll have you going down like you're growin' an extra chromosome
And when you grab me, don't grab me by the buns
Cause I got a bad case of the runs
I got the runs
I got the runs

[Chorus]
Single every single day
Do it every single way
Make the single ladies say
Oooh Bo
And if I were gay
Though I swear I'm straight
I'd make them fellas say
Oooh Bo

[Interlude]
I wanna break it down for y'all
I came from the streets, with nothin'
Now I'm makin' hit records
For my people still livin' in the streets
Still livin' in poverty, I wanna tell you
I'm doin' this for you
My success is your success
And I know you may be thinkin'
Hey, if you really believe that
Why don't you use some of your money
To help rebuild the neighborhood
Instead of putting spinning rims on a gold jet ski?
And to that I say (uh, chorus is comin' up):

[Chorus]
Single every single day
Do it every single way
Make the single ladies say
Oooh Bo
And if I were gay
Though I swear I'm straight
I'd make them fellas say
Uh uh!

[Verse 4]
You got a fume like a tuna
I'll smell ya later
I met a fat chick and I fucked her in an elevator
It was wrong on so many levels
It was wrong on so many le-le-le-levels
It was wrong on so many levels (uh)
It was wrong on, it was wrong on, it was wrong on

[Chorus]
Single every single day
Do it every single way
Make the single ladies say
Oooh Bo
And if I were gay
Though I swear I'm straight
I'd make them fellas say
Oooh
Single every single
Do it every single
Pop that single like a Pringle jingle
Oooh Bo

[Outro]
This song's almost completed
All this little ditty needed
Instrument that's double reeded:
The oboe
(Yea)
Oh, Bo, play that oboe

[Part I: What Goes Around...]

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Hey, girl
Is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end, but I guess I was wrong, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't wanna think about it (Uh)
Don't wanna talk about it (Uh)
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's endin' this way
Just so confused about it (Uh)
Feelin' the blues about it (Yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Tell me, is this fair?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breakin' my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're livin' a lie
But that's okay, baby, 'cause in time, you will find

[Refrain: Justin Timberlake]
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Yeah

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now, girl
I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were movin' on now (On now)
And maybe I should do the same (Maybe I should do the same)
The funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, baby
And now it's all just a shame and I guess I was wrong, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't wanna think about it (No)
Don't wanna talk about it (Hmm)
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's endin' this way
Just so confused about it (Uh)
Feelin' the blues about it (Yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Can you tell me, is this fair?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye? (Uh)
Should've known better when you came around
Should've known better that you were gonna make me cry
Now it's breakin' my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're livin' a lie
That's okay, baby, 'cause in time, you will find

[Refrain: Justin Timberlake]
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Yeah

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
What goes around comes around
Yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that
What goes around comes around
Yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't wanna think about it (No)
Don't wanna talk about it (Hmm)
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's endin' this way
Just so confused about it (Uh)
Feelin' the blues about it (Yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Tell me, is this fair?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye? (Oh)
Should've known better when you came around
Should've known better that you were gonna make me cry
It's breakin' my heart to watch you run around
(Now it's breakin' my heart)
'Cause I know that you're livin' a lie
But that's okay, baby, 'cause in time, you will find

[Refrain: Justin Timberlake]
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around, yeah

[Part II: ...Comes Around (Interlude)]

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Yep, yep, yep
Let me paint this picture for you, baby, yep

[Verse: Justin Timberlake]
You spend your nights alone and he never comes home
And every time you call him, all you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out that he's doin' to you
What you did to me, ain't that the way it goes?
When you cheated, girl, my heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without sayin' that you left me feelin' hurt
Just a classic case, a scenario
Tale as old as time, girl, you got what you deserved

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And now you want somebody (Hey)
To cure the lonely nights (Hey)
You wish you had somebody (Hey)
That could come and make it right (Hey)
But girl, I ain't somebody (Hey)
With a lot of sympathy (Hey)
You'll see, see

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(Take it to 'em, hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Outro: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Hahahaha
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, Take it to 'em)
See, you should've listened to me, baby
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Take it to 'em)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Take it to 'em, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey Girl)
Because (What goes around comes back around)
Hahahaha
No one on the corner have swagger like I
Too cool for school, fly boy high
I drop out like I fell, from the sky
Hold up, let me wipe the cloud off my eye
He has class, first in the lunch line
My lunch ticket let my eat rappers at lunch time
Swagger, shinin' brighter than sunshine
Misfit, duck in the fashion one time
No one on the corner has swagga like moi, Church
But I'm too clean for the choire
I require what I desire I earn my stripes, Adidas
Mami scream papi no mas
Run up in your house just me; no mas
Runnin this bitch like I got four thighs
No one like swagger like these four guys!

[Intro: Eminem]
Woo! Shady
Aftermath
(Look at that bitch!)
(Holy sh... damn!)

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Nate Dogg]
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk
Get fucked up, hit the strip club
Don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed, get fucked
Get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon, I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass, I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nate Dogg]
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

[Chorus 2: Nate Dogg]
(Now) Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, ah, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish, yeah
Me and Nate D-o-double-g
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna, finna have a

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nate Dogg, Eminem, Nate Dogg & Eminem]
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls, they act retarded (Man, I told you 

[?])
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no
(Now) Look at this lady all in front of me
Sexy as can be, tonight, I want a slut
Would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak, he said he wants a slut
Hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
(Now) Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, ah, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nate Dogg]
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

[Chorus 1: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control

[Outro: Eminem]
God
And I ain't leavin' without you, bitch!
Comin' home with me!
And my boy, and his boy
And his boy
And his girl
Haha, Nate Dogg!

[Intro]
There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phone line: can't dial out (Shit!)
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout

[Verse 1]
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail, but this time
When I get pulled over there's a Doberman Pinscher
And a pit bull in the seat, these pigs'll get bit
Foolin' with me, quit foolin' with me
Bitch, you're gonna see no pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me?
And which you're gonna see in the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass — where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right! They comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns; we as Americans

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 2]
I make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you-know-who, with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
Than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money! I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President 

[dead]
It's never been said, but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been "Bastard," the shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot — fuck that shit!
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time, they got the fuckin' automatic
Ain't no one gon' test this man — clack (*click*)

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 3]
(Shht!) I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two ninas under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run-in with the long arm of the law, I'm long gone
I'ma do five years — no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my weed back

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Obie the person that came up introverted
'Cause of nervousness, that was solely the only verdict
It was worth it 'cause he changed, became so observant
Servin' such of a purpose
If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
That's why it's curtains in this murder, if you get him worked up
I'm so assertive on these muthafuckas acting tougher
Had enough of isolatin' myself in a room
Writing poems and songs, doing the same in school
Now look what he became, a fool
'Cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
Livin' hard but still Julliard
A god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
Regardless of this I draw visual, pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I stimulate the brain, mimic, emulate the sane
Cynics keep on thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't
Clinically insane, brain is on Venus, up Uranus
Label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say
"He may seem as though he's plain normal" if you ever meet him
Greet him with a shake, see he ain't as mean as what they say
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
So he's vague, so they mistake him for bein' crazed
You part ways, your impression of him changed
You don't think he's strange, you turn around and tell him; "Peace and thanks"
You catch him flippin' you off, with his pants down
Hands around his scrotum, tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs

[Verse 3: (Verse 1 Repeated): Obie Trice]
Obie the person that came up introverted
'Cause of nervousness, that was solely the only verdict
It was worth it 'cause he changed, became so observant
Servin' such of a purpose
If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
That's why it's curtains in this murder, if you get him worked up
I'm so assertive on these muthafuckas acting tougher
Had enough of isolating myself in a room
Writing poems and songs, doing the same in school
Now look what he became, a fool
'Cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
Livin' hard but still Julliard
A god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
Regardless of this I draw visual, pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department

[Verse 4: Eminem]
It's all psychologic, why am I so maniacal?
Am I a psycho or some kind of psychotic shtick?
Or am I truly psychotic? Or my molecules just diabolical?
'Cause biologically, I defy logic, by golly, haul me off on a trolley
Probably want a quack, or I'm back on that whacky tobacca
I'ma step away from crack, Obie smacked the shit out of me
I'm so slap happy, man, snap me back to reality
I'm a walkin' art gallery, a science museum
Elephantitis of the nuts, you'd probably die if you see them
I pull them out, they hit the ground and probably crack the cement
I need an ambulance, I can't just put them back in my pants (Help me!)

[Intro: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, Bad and Evil is (back)
(Don't stop)

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
We 'bout to get into a tale of a gunner that details the dungeon
Just as the pale moon illuminates the hail and thunderin'
'01's the year where I fell from blunderin'
Shady lifted his wing, then I fell from under it
Now I’m freefallin’, my career is gone into re-calling
Regardless of who’s fault, I was speedballin'
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth
Then Marshall doubled back and got me from on top of the Hearse
I’m alive, nigga, Justin T ain’t got nothin' on me
'Cause I done cried Mary J. Blige rivers
I realized that God’s with us, soon as I decided
To put that bottle down and pick up my Todd Bridges
The writing's on the wall
Since niggas seen me at the baseball game
With Shady and Jay-Z, suddenly everybody calls
Like, "I’m just checking on you, dog!"
While I throw up this message on the stall

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
When them bottles stop poppin’ and them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop)
I made a promise to my momma, I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop? (don't stop)
I’m living proof, nigga, it's pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
It's the Worldwide American way, I’m living proof, nigga

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Your body language is sayin’ your confidence is gone
Well, pick ya ass up, lil' homie, come on
You just gon' sit there and take it or make 'em suck it?
Tell 'em where to shove it straight up
You gon' make love to the world or you gon' fuck it?
The last time that life kicked me in the ass
I pulled down its pants and put a foot up its ass
Man, what a catastrophe it’d be for me to be a bitch-ass pussy
And not open a can of whoop-ass, let you piss-ants whoop me
Will be the day I say I ate poop, shit, the day that
I don't straight shoot, I'll drop outta my anti-women hate group
Say I’m a sissy faggot, record it, play it back
And put it on straight loop, you haters look like you ate a grape fruit
To see me climbing back on that wagon, got my swagger back
I was dragging, hopped back on it, grab the reigns on that bastard
And came back on 'em without remorse man
Man, of course, I’m a one-trick pony
'Cause I’ll be screaming on these whores 'til I’m hoarse!

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
When them bottles stop poppin’ and them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop)
I made a promise to my momma, I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop? (don't stop)
I’m living proof, nigga, it's pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
It's the Worldwide American way, I’m living proof, nigga

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Nah, I ain't fading yet, I’d rather stay and rap
I might've made a debt but I find excitement in wondering what I’ma write next so I don't stay in debt
Me broke, you might as well cut the embryo
Out of my momma and play catch
With the baby with AKs with baby bayonets
I’ma get rich or I’ma die trying
That's why it's either kill or be killed
So call me suicide homicide Ryan

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There's a bomb inside my head, I’m a live wire
I am on the edge, teetering on it like a totter, I might
Get on a nut like a tire iron, I have no desire stopping
So why would I drop and roll? That's how much on fire I am
Rappers are fun and I’m the time 'cause I’m just flying by ‘em
Man, I’m laughing at ‘em the entire time, why am I up?
'Cause tribulations I have triumphed, bitch, I’m fired up
"So one time for me, just let your fuckin' lighters light the sky up"

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
When them bottles stop poppin’ and them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop)
I made a promise to my momma, I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop? (don't stop)
I’m living proof, nigga, it's pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
It's the Worldwide American way, I’m living proof, nigga

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
I see your homegirl tryna sway you
How you figure I would play you
Would you look at that?
The same one that caught her nigga with some freak
All in her sheets left for a week
Then what she do? Double back
Now I know we far from perfect
But I feel like this is worth it, do you disagree with that?
If not then holla back
Hey and tell ya girl you’ll call her back

[Bridge: Aaliyah]
My best friend say, she sick of me, crying on the phone
Telling how her man dogging me
My best friend say, don't tell her nothing 'bout me and you
'Cause she ain't showing me no sympathy
My best friend say, if she was me, she woulda let ya go
Home a long time ago
My best friend say
My best friend say
I’ll be there, I’ll still be there for you

[Hook: J. Cole, Aaliyah, & Missy Elliot]
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you
I’ll be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Now, now, now, now, know we be arguing
But ain't you riding with me?
We breaking, up we making up
Like Dwayne Wayne and Whitley
You throw things, you broke things
Use both hands and hit me
And right when you call the law
I’ll tell my boy to come get me
Then you, then you start listening
To friends, and then it gets tricky
They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky
So you ignore the hickeys, the pics of chicks in they vicky’s
That they sent me, is that real love
You’re the only one that I will love
Damn, damn

[Bridge]
My best friend says
I can stay with her
At her house, no doubt, anytime I like
My best friend says
Don't let you in my life cause you don't do for me and you don't act right
My best friend says
If she was me, she would let you go a long, long time ago
My best friend says, my best friend says

[Hook: J. Cole, Aaliyah, & Missy Elliot]
I’ll still be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you
I’ll be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you

[Outro: J. Cole]
Girl I can see it in your eyes
How you feeling? Let me know what's on your mind
We’ve been together for a long long time
Hey, girl I can see it in your eyes
I know to you it feel like I’m never around
Round, round, round
But if you leave me then who else gon hold me down?
Hey, hey, hey

[Intro]
Yea... Yea
Yes
Ima call this here... real rap
Cause this rap is real... ya know?
I hope you ain't too tired to cry
And I hope you know you ain't never too live to die
Listen

[Verse]
I grew up where them people called them people on us
Think we slangin, but we just got beepers on us
Grindin' all day like we got sleep insomnia
Livin' like the videos write a treatment on us
Stuck in the hood like they put cement on us
Ghetto birds still shittin on us, government still quittin' on us
Lost a few homies and the grief still sittin on us
So we got the names writtin on us
White folks still spittin' on us
And them bitch ass police canines, teeth still grittin' on us
But we smoke, ashes still gettin' on us
Older bitches still hittin' on us
I remember well, Beezy roll the L
Beezy ain't here... where's Beezy at?... Beezy got killed
And that was my nigga, I go way back wit my nigga
But I know thats how it happened my nigga
Shit is much deeper than this rappin my nigga
But now they all rappin, my niggas, so now I must make it happen
So I'mma play the captain, sail boat flappin my nigga
No fingas I'm snappin', happy for my nigga Lil' Tiggas
Cause even though we couldn't, The Lord saved him
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Found his body like a month later, Rest in Peace boy
He was a East boy, and so was Wesy West
He was a good nigga, so I know he blessed
And his daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But I'mma keep goin, and I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'mma keep on pumpin the flow
So if I cry dont stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped the beat
My nigga Lil' Derrick is quick to cop a key
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
And because of that he's just a name in a rhyme of mine
I pray his family and his mama fine
So much shit just sit on this mind of mine
I think about it all the time
I drink about it all the time
I smoke back to back
Cause if my thoughts got to me I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in the can, thank God I had dreams of being the man
Yea
And fuck a man with a badge
Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
The five o killed naughty good boy dead
Man you woulda thought they killed corn bread
Shot 'em up face down on the lawn
Not to mention with his handcuffs on
Not to mention they had plain clothes on
And the complaint goes on
But don't nobody do nothin' bout it
The jailhouse and the morgue is too fuckin' crowded
And haters at an all time high
Everybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin iPod
Shit and they tried to burn my phantom up
But I got my gun license, I got my hammers up
I'm ready to shoot like a camera
Stay still mothafucka I'mma have to write my will this summer
Cause if they don't kill me, I'mma kill this summer
Yea
And you can put that on my late father
Or my late grandmother, Ms. Mercedes Carter
Or my grandfather Larry Bosock
The old man hustle 'till his heart stopped
And all I know 'bout my real pops is that he had money
No bank account, that brown paper bag money
Yea he might hit me off wit a little brag money
But the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out I hope he glad for me
But thats why when I see him I acts mad funny -
Cause he's a joke to me
Don't message, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my mama how it's suppose to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope for me
And I don't ever want to see her mope for me
Hopefully, but truthfully there is a day that's due for me
But we gone pray it's as far as the future sees
You are listenin' to the future Wee-zy F. Baby
Amen

Stand up! ah
Stand up! yeah
Stand up! ah

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
How you ain't gon' fuck?! Bitch, I'm me!
I'm the goddamn reason you in V.I.P
CEO, you don't have to see ID
I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance
Like this

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Go on with your big ass, let me see something
Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawnna]
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?

[Bridge: Ludacris]
Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Damn right, the fire marshal wanna shut us down
Get us out, so someone can gun us down
We was two songs away from getting some cut up
Now we one song away from tearing the club up
Move over; Luda got something to say
Do it now cause tomorrow ain't promised today
Work with me, let's become one with the beat
And don't worry about me stepping all over your feet

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawnna]
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back

[Outro: Ludacris]
Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin'
Hey, chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was nine?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin', like, "What kind of doctor can we fly in?"
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now, she'd be okay?
But since she was just a secretary
Working for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here?
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse, "Did you do the research?"
She asked me, "Can you sign some t-shirts?"
"Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?
You don't see that we hurt?" But still–

[Hook: Bill Withers & Tony Williams]
I smile
When Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They outside of the emergency room, room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now, she 'sleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus, my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Klaye and Aunt Jean
So many aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just "1 Thing"
When they said that she made it, you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
'Cause with my family, we know where home is
So instead of sending flowers, we the roses

[Hook: Bill Withers & Tony Williams]
I smile
When Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

[Break: Bill Withers & Patti LaBelle]
'Cause Rosie brings the sunshine (Oh)

[Hook: Bill Withers & Tony Williams]
I smile
When Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

[Hook: Bill Withers & Patti LaBelle]
I smile
When Rosie comes to see me
And I'm sad when Rosie goes away
'Cause Rosie brings the sunshine (Say)

[Outro: Patti LaBelle]
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for
For a sunny day
Momma can't wait
For the clouds to break
Mm mmm mm mm-mm mm-mm
Oh-oh-oh-oh, no, no, say
Tellin' you the truth now
Said I can't wait, uh-uh
I won't wait, no

[Verse 1]
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

[Verse 2]
They took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

[Verse 3]
Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

[Verse 4]
Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
I said, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot

[Intro: Dr. Dre (girl)]
Hey, yo, whassup?
My name is Dre
Can I blaze some chronic witchu?
(Nigga, what? Fo' sho'!
Roll that shit up!)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Hell yeah, still always into something
Heart still in Compton
The comp can't oppose, dope Cali platinum classicals
Introduced you to my Doggs, that don't love hoes
And Firm Fiascoes—assholes
Fucked you up with my last video, tuxed up
Doing a tango
And cash, always in my grasp
Came up in the game wearin' khakis not kangols, stranglin' hoes
When asked about it in most interviews I just laugh
Now I vacate with hoes with a gang of ass
One feedin' me mangoes, the other lightin' my hash
Rap tabloids write Dre's light in the ass (What?)
Came home uptight, ready to mash
Like a gas pedal, get on that '64 Chevy level
AK-47 heavy metal
Who say Dre ain't ghetto? Just whistle like a tea kettle
I throw three at you, tell me if you see devils
'Cause we rebels over here, I smell chronic in the air
That means we takin' over this year
You hear?

[Bridge: Girl, KRS-One & Dr. Dre]
Chronic, 2000
"One!"
That means we takin' over this year, ya hear?

[Hook: Ms. Roq & Knoc-Turn'al]
Light Speed, blazin' Chronic through the galaxy
Hydro, doja, chocolate Thai weed
Or we might be sippin' on gin or Hennessey
Fuck that, where that new shit, The Chronic Iced Teas?

[Verse 2: Hittman]
I hang among hustlers, that slang and Hoo-bang Bronson
When bustaz roll through, can't fuck with my bold crew
We will hold you captive and bust
'Cause gangbangin' is the active, activity
Where I be livin', B, there ain't no Liberty Statue
Hope you got your gat, don't let them catch you
Slippin', without yours, it's warfare outdoors
Ambulance, violent uproars
Trash niggas takin' out like chores
I meet whores on tours
Jeanie`s hot as pepper so I sip, champagne on stormy shores
B on some hardcore, pornographic
Toting Austrian firearms that's made out of plastic
In these drastic surroundings, it be sounding like Lebanon
Makin' fools "Retreat!" like Megatron and Starscream
Oh yeah I scream on stars
That get loot then crossover like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
Get out your car son, that's how I came to bougie niggas
At Bar One, it's either that or make front page stardom
I'm the Golden Child, chased by Sardo Numpsay
But God's my bulletproof, it's hard to shoot me, you hear?
By the time you see him *Two gun shots*
That means it's real fuckin' hard to shoot me, you hear?

[Hook: Ms. Roq & Knoc-Turn'al]
Light Speed, blazin' Chronic through the galaxy
Hydro, doja, chocolate Thai weed
Or we might be sippin' on gin or Hennessey
Fuck that, where that new shit, The Chronic Iced Teas?

[Chorus: T.I.]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new, I seen it all before
But still, I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

[Post-Chorus]
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote (Yeah)
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote

[Verse 1: T.I.]
It's stupid how I go in knowin' everybody knowin'
That I’m sewin' up the game, destroyin' life, they hate me for it
Eventually, see they can't beat, and then with me, they join
Others sworn under oath or banished, left completely scorned
You tell lies, get cut, nigga, kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stop
I just laugh at nigga wishin' they were this hot
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on, I’m the Jetsons, you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high-steppin', Prime Time
Thought you niggas been known, ain't no blockin' my shine
Like my new Air Yeezys, you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off livin' life, you check to check, recitin' rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate? Have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey, my dough ain't in its right mind

[Chorus: T.I.]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new, I seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're starin' straight into a barrel of hate, terrible fate
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed–wait, Sarah, you're late
Your train left, mascara and eggs smear in your face
Night's over, goodbye, ho, I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothin' to cry over
Never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
She mistook me for some high roller when I won't buy a soda
Unless it's Rock and Rye cola (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya
Tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swolled up, I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay-ass teddy bear?
Bitch, you're already bi-polar

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
Still, I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[Verse 3: T.I.]
The credit roll, the curtain close, the movie over with (That's it!)
But don’t get mad at me, go blame the chick who wrote this shit (Nope)
Yeah, life is sure a bitch (Bitch), but she know I’m rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pourin' in
Peso, euro, yen, ah-ha, I’m paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearin' any chain
Never gon' see me totin' anything, all you gon' see is bang
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit
Yeah, I’m on another level, but you niggas still can't get it
It's all over ‘fore you finish—sorry, bro, this where we end it
Won’t give you the satisfaction of me givin' you the business

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Yeah, I guess life is a bitch, ain't it, Tip?
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn’t give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I’m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I’m sure you got that relationship memo by now, but in case you didn't
I'ma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So, I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin' it, double timin' it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
Man, I still say "K-Mart's" like there's an apostrophe "s" on it, dog
And they say McDonald's isn’t a restaurant, well I guess I’m wrong
But if you're gonna tell me that A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg!

[Bridge: T.I.]
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I’m as strong as they king, they were gone ‘fore they came
Now I don’t wanna hang, I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle, shawty, that's why

[Chorus: T.I., Eminem, Both]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
But still I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

[Post-Chorus: T.I. & Eminem]
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote (yeah)
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote

[Intro: Gorillaz]
Picture I'm a dreamer
I'll take you deeper
Down to the sleepy glow
Time is a low
Don't you know?
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Is there something in the air? Do you feel it?
Is it close? Is it far? Is it here? Do you feel it?
Are you happy? You sad? You scared? Do you feel it?
Is it right? Is it wrong? Is it fair? Do you feel it?
Is it real? Is it fake? Do you care? Do you feel it?
When he stopped and he paid for head, did he feel it?
With his wife when he laid in the bed, did she feel it?
When the police kicked in the door, did he feel it?
When he had to go to war, did he feel it?
When they hung and they swung from a tree, did they feel it?
Well I know when they come for me, will I feel it
When he blew all his money to ball, did he feel it?
When that bullet came through a wall, did she feel it?
When he stopped and he dropped when he died, did he feel it?
When his momma closed his eyes, did he feel it?
When she couldn't take the pain, did she feel it?
When the dope flows through her veins, does she feel it?
When she took off all her clothes, did she feel it?
When she slid down that pole, did she feel it?
Will it all be clear to see, will I feel it?
If God forgives me, will I feel it?

[Hook]
I ask my baby if she love me, she said she don't know
She said the game's got her heart, the streets have got her soul
I ask my baby if she love me, she said she don't know
She said the game's got her heart, the streets have got her soul
I said, "Wow"

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
When his food come out the trash, does he feel it?
When he sleeps under the underpass, does he feel it?
When she's pregnant and smoking weed, does she feel it?
When the jury just won't believe, do they feel it?
When this song come on in the club, do you feel it?
When a racist shows you love, do you feel it?
When he know he won't win the game, do he feel it?
When a preacher is driven insane, do he feel it?
Every time I write a rhyme, do I feel it?
When I'm running out of time, will I feel it?
When the liquor is poured on the ground, do they feel it?
If my music didn't make a sound, would you feel it?

[Hook]

I raise more fire to the man up higher

My dreads hang to let him know that I'm a lion
Represent the jungle when the others just tryin'
I represent my mother like, "Baby, stop cryin'"
I know my papa gone, but guarantee he see us shinin', yeah
Now you are looking at New Orleans' finest
Now you are bein' blinded by European diamond
And you are seein' two or three times and
Got your vision all fucked up, now you can't even find me
And I ain't even hidin', naw, I'm right here, baby (Right here, baby)
She wanna walk and shit, I'm like, "Yeah, baby" (Yeah, baby)

If I had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on 'em (Pss)

Just let them bums blow steam, radiator

But I'ma eat them rap bitches when the chef come

She ain't a Nicki fan, then the bitch deaf, dumb
You ain't my son, you my motherfuckin' step-son

Broke bitches so crusty (Disgust me)
Gave the bitch a ride, got the Continental dusty
Trust me, I keep a couple hundred in the duff'-B
Couple wet wipes case a bum try to touch me, ew

Bitch talk slick, I'ma have to terminate her
These little nappy-headed hoes need a perminator
You my seed, I'll spray you with the germinator (Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh)
Move back, bugs
Matter fact, you know the queen could use a back rub (Ah)
If you could turn back time, Cher
You used to be here, now you're gone, Nair

Yo

[Verse 1]
It was back in '07, did a couple of tapes
Did a couple DVDs, made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape
Now it's, "Which world tour should I go on today?"
See, you told me I would lose, but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choos just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me, Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney, out in LA with Lindsay
Got the eye of the tiger, the Lion of Judah
Now it's me and my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gon' see it in time
Tell 'em bitches get a stick, I'm done leadin' the blind
Got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham Palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie, no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money, yeah, I'm Universal

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say?
What the fuck they gon' say?
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best

[Verse 2]
I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch
Now I'm sitting at the closing, bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Micaiah and Jelani why I grind like I do
'Cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was crack
Now the whole album crack, you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin, you told 'em it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breathe 'til I motherfucking say so
To all my bad bitches, I could see your halo

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say?
What the fuck they gon' say?
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best

[Bridge]
It's okay, it's okay
Long as you know, long as you know
Long as you motherfuckers know
I'm the best, best, best, best, best, best

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me (I hope they comin' for me)
Because the top is lonely ('Cause the top is lonely)
What the fuck they gon' say? (What they gon' say?)
What the fuck they gon' say? (What they gon' say?)
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best (I'm the best)
I'm the best, best, best, best (I'm the best)
I'm the best

Hey, hey, yeah
Oh, oh (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Oh (Ooh)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin', feels like I'm–

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
How could it be, little me
Had the power to be the best B in the league
Yeah, inevitably, but could it be little me?
You was heckling me, now it's monotony winning regularly, yo
I catch rec on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
Bitches ain't got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em
The contract was signed, but I am the addendum
So-so where my dawgs at, Randy
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick, bitch, Andy
'Ca-'ca-'ca-'ca-'ca-'cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me now, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the bombs in the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I'm the best now
Anybody with some money should invest now
Soccer moms need to organize a pep rall'
Your game over, bitch, Gatorade, wet towel
Mothafuckers ain't ready, they never been
As long as I am in the game, you'll never win
I'm on that different type of high, heroin
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Kanye West]
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin' (Feels like I'm blazin')
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin' (Uh)
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin' (Yeah, uh)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This is the moment, grab your Kodak
While I'm flying with a flow that is
The greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter, baby, stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah
'Rari six hundred horses, that's my chariot of fire
Where we flyin', they can't find us, all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it, uh
I think I'm Marc Jacobs, I think I'm Lagerfeld
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell
I'ma grab your waist, then I'ma grab your face and
Then I'ma taste it, then I'ma blaze it
Hello all my bad girls, this just in
Yeezy hurt the beat like he fucked her best friend
And she let him back in, and he just did it again
He crazy, he blazin', he off the deep end
I'm blazin', I'm flagrant, I'm crazy, I'm sayin'
Too much for the world so they abbreviate him
His past is her fave, his stats is amaze
Her dress is just perf, uh, Prada colored beige
It's obvi we the ish and I'm rolling with my Brits
So real, you so trill, baby, everything legit
How you feel? They say we crazed 'cause our styles so diff'
They'll be jeal' when we in the mag lookin' magnif'
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch
Fuck these background niggas, I was tryna ad-lib
Add this, we blazin', Nicki, what you think?
I got two White Russians, but we also need some drinks

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin' (Feels like I'm blazin')
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'

[Bridge]
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin' (Feels like I'm blazin')
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire
In this very moment, I'm king
In this very moment, I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment, I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, yes
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, yes
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens, and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of (Yeah)
Put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they can think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

[Verse 2: Drake]
What I tell them hoes? Bow, bow, bow to me, drop down to your knees
Young Money the mafia, that's word to Lil' Cease
I'm in the Dominican, Big Papi Ortiz
Doing target practice, all these bitches just aiming to please
Shout out to the CEO, 500 Degreez
Shout out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends, how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year? We ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold
40 got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll
These niggas be droppin' songs, they ain't even cold
Weezy on top, and that nigga ain't even home yet
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers gettin' bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And all you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies, but not everybody lives, ah

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
This is my moment
I waited all my
Life, I can tell it's time
Drifting away, I'm
One with the sunsets
I have become alive

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

[Intro]
It's all bad now, man, it's all bad
But y'all done fucked up now
Yeah! Haha! New shit!
Ayo, I just want the whole world to know
That I did not start this, but I will finish it

[Verse]
Comin' up, it never mattered what color you was
If you could spit, then you could spit
That's it, that's what it was
Back when motherfuckers was straight backpackin'
Cipherin', fightin' for life in this rap
For the mic to get passed, and you psyched and you gassed
Then you hype, ‘cause you last
And you might whoop some ass; if you lost, then you lost
Shake hands like a man and you swallowed it
When the Unsigned Hype column in
The Source was like our only source of light
When the mics used to mean somethin', a four was like
You were the shit, now it's like the least you get
Three and a half now just means you're a piece of shit
Four and a half or five means you're Biggie, Jigga, Nas
Or Benzino—shit, I don't even think you realize
You're playin' with motherfuckers' lives
I done watched Dre get fucked on The Chronic
Probably ‘cause I was on it
Now you fucked me out of my mics twice, I let it slide
I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin' breath to get a five
Shit, I was right, I'da fuckin' died already tryin'
I swear to God, I never lie, I bet it's why
You let that bitch give me that bullshit review
I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit, we knew
You'd probably try and fuck us with Obie and 50 too
*Spit* Fuck a relationship! We through!
No more Source to street cred, them days is dead
Ray's got AK's to Dave Mays's head
Every issue there's an eight-page Made Men spread
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
That I am not afraid of this fuckin' waste of lead
On my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple
So, listen closely, as I break it down and proceed
This old G's 'bout to get smoked like rolled weed
You don't know me or my motherfuckin' mother
You motherfuckin' punk!
Put me on your fuckin' cover just to sell your little sell-out mag
I ain't mad, I feel bad, here's an ad
Here's a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad
You wanna talk about some shit
That you don't know about, yeah?
Let's talk about how you're puttin' your own son out there
To try to eat off him because you missed your boat
You're never gonna blow, bitch, you're just too old
No wonder you're sore now, lordy, you're bored now
I'm pushin' 30, you're kickin' 40's door down
Bitch, this is war now, and you'll never beat me
All you do is cheat me out of Quotables
But you know that you'll always see me on your TV
‘Cause you've got to stay up 'til three in the mornin'
To see your video played once on BET
So, hee hee hee, who has the last laugh? Aftermath, yeah
So, on behalf of our whole staff, kiss our asshole cracks
We'll never fold or hold back
Just know that Benzino's wack; no matter how many times I say his name, he'll never blow, jack
You're better off tryin' to bring RSO back
Look at your track record, that's how far it goes back
It's extortion, and Ray owns a portion
So, half of the staff up there is fresh out of jail from Boston
Bullyin' and bossin' Dave like a slave
They completely brainwashed him, and forced him to stay
Locked in his own office
Afraid of the softest, fakest, wannabe gangsta in New York
And it's pitiful, ‘cause I would have never said shit if you'd
Have kept your mouth shut, bitch, now what?
Hit it, Clue! Spit it, Slay! New shit, Exclusive
Yo, Lantern, yo Whoo Kid
You know what to do with this
Use it, I'm through, this is stupid
I can't believe I stooped to this bullshit to do this
And who you callin' a bitch, bitch? You owe me!

[Intro]
Yo, Dre, Man
Make my vocals sound sexy... woo!
Come on, man, come on, man, okay

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm that guy, man, shove a diamond up my hind end
And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals
Slut poke holes in ya shirt, jump in mud puddles
While I stomp mudholes in ya ass, girl, now let's cuddle
Blood curdlin', you're gurglin' on your blood, what'll
I do for my next trick? I'm feelin' wonderful
I think I might just do somethin' a little less subtle
Shove a fuckin' Tonka truck up a little kid's butthole
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador
Of the Valentine's Day Massacre slash assassin
I slash her in the ass with a icicle
And leave her layin' in a blood bath while I
Put a catheter in and jump in the bath with her
In my Spider-Man mask, man, just imagine the
Fun I can have with a strap-on
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon
Are those pistachios? Damn, I'd like to have some
Laying on the patio, man, rolling a fat one
Shady, drop the magic marker, put the cap on
Goddamn, man, are you that much of an asshole?

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm like Houdini, tuck my teenie eenie weenie between each
One of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie
Make the shit disappear like Tara Reid in a bikini
Believe me, homie, you don't know the meaning of a meanie
They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter, I'm tryna maneuver the
Hoover up in your poop chute, don't move or ya
Might get it stuck so fuckin' far up in your uvula
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus
Totally tubular, sniffin' glue through a tube in the studio
Now who do ya think is more fruitier?
Wiener smothered in peanut butter, puttin' on a tube of ya
Eye shadow and man, it looked nice, you should've seen it, mother
I think I'll put a piece of art on my Visa card
Then I'll go beat Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosey on over to Rosie O'Donnell's with McDonald's
Jump on her lap then watch The Sopranos

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Shady, what are you doin' chewin' on a human?
Grab an aluminum bat, hit Heidi Klum in the back, boom! And
Assumin' the fact that that dude's in the back room
Usin' the bathroom, vacuumin' a raccoon
Skewin' a rat, a cat screwin' a baboon
You shouldn't ask what is he doin' with that broom
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds
You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance, ooh
But they're afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair
And make her wear a bathin' suit and take her parasailin'
Shady, why do you gotta pick on the lady for?
Why you make her read eighty-four bedtime stories to you in baby talk?
'Cause I'm scared, there's monsters under my bed
Kellie Pickler hid my juice box under my bassinet
No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed
You like graffiti, dyke? Well, I can pee-pee and write your name

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Outro]
Fine, nobody wants to play with me?
Fuck you then, bitch!
You guys are always mean to me anyways
All you ever do is rub gum in my hair and stuff
You guys are gonna make me... make me sad, I'm sad
I'm gonna cry... I'm crying
I'm going to tell my mom... Mom!

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Welcome back to class, bitch, grab on to your glasses
Odd Future leaving even niggas in past tense
Style is patent, the measures is drastic
Either that or they 4:4, some call them fantastic
She called me fantastic, I called her a fat bitch
Still kill the pussy, put the cat in a casket
The funeral service was fucking worthless, so I said a couple words at it
Didn't know her but I'm confirming that she sure gurgled dick
The Odd nigga with a spoon in your Danimals
As hungry as a cannibal, trapped in a van of cantaloupes
Harder than granite, hoes know I'm coming
With the grand force of Van Damme's fist in a damn cannon, so
Fans catch us on Animal Planet, tracking hoes
And attacking faster than foes can change the channel, whoa
My dick hates sweaters so she jack it slow
The aftermath proves to be smoother than hair relaxer, no

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator & Earl Sweatshirt]
Wave high to the Ritalin regiment
Double S shit, swastikas on the Letterman, bitch
Hungry wolves at the door, bitch, let us in
Kill 'em all, O.F. is what I represent
Say hi to the Ritalin regiment
Double S shit, swastikas on the Letterman, bitch
Hungry wolves at the door, bitch, let us in
Kill 'em all, O.F. is what I represent

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Took the van, went snatch her
Oh, you wanna snap and scratch? Snap your fucking jabber
Wocky, she's a dancer, walkie-talkie Ace for back up
Like, "Fag, I got class and can't take this bitch to math, what
Tell the fucking teacher that this burlap sack is filled
With snacks for after class for the whole class to snack up?
Yeah, right, get over here faster
Cause Earl's a pro rapper but amateur kidnapper"

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & Earl Sweatshirt]
Earl, goddammit, I'm still in my damn pajamas
Waiting on mom to bring me the Aspirin from a trampoline jump
And if I pick her up, I'm humping and I'm fucking with no lubricant
I'm using spit, piss, vaseline or something, how old is she?
(Seventeen) This bitch is underage
But I'll have her face off tied and Nicholas caged
But anyway, give me cash fag, cause I'm low on gas
Aww fuck it, about to jack off, go catch a fucking cab
No I'm not lying when I say that brother's all I have
But if you're not dying don't fucking bother to call me back
I'm sleep...

[sound of Tyler masturbating]

[Hook: Earl Sweatshirt]
Say hi to the Ritalin regiment
Double S shit, swastikas on the Letterman, bitch
Hungry wolves at the door, bitch, let us in
Kill 'em all, O.F. is what I represent

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator & Earl Sweatshirt]
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Odd Future here to steer you to what the fuck's cool
Fuck rules, skate life, rape, write, repeat twice
Odd Future young enough to get your priest mouth drool
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Odd Future here to steer you to what the fuck's cool
Fuck rules, skate life, rape, write, repeat twice
Odd Future young enough to get your priest mouth drool

[Verse 4: Earl Sweatshirt]
I don't give a fuck, like a senior citizen
Shit and run back to the lab, need assistance from
Sister with the biggest bumbaclot girls
I'm around calves big cause they run a lot and scream, oh
Pay him some attention, he's smart and he's genius
He ain't touching me like Martin Sheen's penis
Y'all niggas ain't clean as my team is mean as
Hitting amputees in the knees-es, Jesus
Please, just peep the Crystal Method where
I take a fucking beat, strip it nah-ked then I wreck it
It's no question, Sweatshirt's OF
And you can tell by the chiseled horns on my forehead, bitch
Hammer-hat flyer than a bag of bats
And Jade's a fucking acrobat, I'll flip her on a mattress
Last straw, fuck that, I'm what broke the camel's back
Say you want that dope shit, welcome to Satan's cabbage patch, bitch

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Told you he can rap, dumb mothafucka

[Verse 1]
Ma said "Wake up son, good morning"
I rolled out of bed, greeted mama with a yawn, then
Paused to scratch and itch, and went down to the kitchen
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon, glass of OJ Simpson
Just as I was about to dig in
A thought jumped in my head, school was to be attended, shit
I paid my thoughts no attention 'cause I wasn't tryna kick it
With this bitch that just ended it with me
But mama wasn't havin' it, so I grabbed my bag
And split out the door and saw the whore that I'd rather kick
It seems kinda brash but it's the hash, I mean the harsh truth
She runs shit, she's the jock, I'm the horseshoe
She's gorgeous, when niggas see it jaws hit the floor so
When she left, it didn't break my heart it broke my torso
Making my eyes ache, stalking your MySpace
Posted a new pic, I mean it when I say that I fucking hate you
But
Maybe if you looked in this direction
I'd pick my heart up off the floor and put it in my chest then
Feel the fucking life rushin' through my body
But you got a guy that's not me, so my wrist is looking sloppy
Come on, let's cut the bull like a matador
You light me up like lamps, a chance is all I'm really asking for
Give me one, I promise I'll be back for more
Most wanna tap and score, I want a fam of four

[Interlude]
Not like a family of four, just like...
Fuck it
You'll never listen to this shit anyways
Fuck you
Bitch
Ugh...

[Verse 2]
She said "You rushing, you rabid son of a Labrador
But I'm attracted to you like teenyboppers to Apple Stores"
The basement light is darkened, the switchblade is sharpened
Her name on my arm and her face on a two-percent carton
See her face while you're fixing your breakfast
And know she's in my basement, objecting to sex with
Me, murder spree, surges on with the next bitch
Tombstones read RIP cause it's pieces they rest in

[Chorus]
Ow, ow, ow (Oh, goddamn!)
I'm gonna facking cum! (Oh, shit!)
Fack, fack, fack (Fuck, I am!)
I am, I'm going to cum (I'm cumming!)

[Verse 1]
(Oh yeah, God!) I never seen no chick like this
This bitch can twist like a damn contortionist
Condom on my dick? Of course it is
This bitch don't know what abortion is
So I can't cum in her, fucks like a porn star
Looks like Jenna, fack, I'm gonna
Cum, I think my rubber's comin' off
But oh, it's so fucking wet and soft
Fuck, I'm gonna start lettin' off
I'm squirting and she's not gettin' off
And she's on top, I'm gonna facking
Oh, God, oh, don't do that
Don't, stop, stop, don't, I don't mean "don't stop"
Ow, wait a minute, ow, ow, fuck
I, I'm gonna fucking cum! (*Squirt squirt squirt*)

[Chorus]
Ow, ow, ow (Oh, goddamn!)
I'm gonna fucking cum! (Oh, shit!)
Fack, fack, fack (Fuck, I am!)
I am, I'm going to cum (I'm cumming!)

[Verse 2]
(Oh, yeah, God!) Ooh, wow, boom that pow
Ooh, ow, I need a cigarette now
Ow, I'm so fucking hot
And you're so fucking hot
Oh my god, I wanna facking fack
No, not "fuck", I said "fack"
F-A-C-K, F-A-C-K
Fack, fack, fack, facking freak me!
Oh yeah, girl see, baby, they call me Mr. Freaky
Let's call your sister, three-way
Have some threesome, me so horny
And you're such a fucking babe
I wanna go down on you—fuck, you shaved?!
Oh, goddamn, here I go again
I'm gonna cum, I am!

[Chorus]
Ow, ow, ow (Oh, goddamn!)
I'm gonna facking cum! (Oh, shit!)
Fack, fack, fack (Fuck, I am!)
I am, I'm going to cum (I'm cumming!)

[Interlude]
I'm Slim Shady, uh, uh, uh
I'm Slim Shady, uh, uh, uh
I'm Slim Shady, uh, uh, uh
I'm Slim Shady, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 3]
Okay, I'm done, I already came twice
You ain't gonna make me cum
I'm all outta gas, not so fast
Uh, your finger just went in my ass
Ow, that hurts, take it out now
Oh, wait a minute, aw
Put it back in, in-in-in
This don't mean I'm gay, I don't like men
I like boobs, boobs, boobs
Now see that gerbil, grab that tube
Shove it up my butt
Let that little rascal nibble on my asshole, uhh
Yeah, right there, right there
Ahh, I'm cumming, oh, yeah
Fack, I just came again
Okay, pull it out now, enhh
Oh, fuck yeah
Wait, he's not out, he's still crawling around up there
Ow, fuck, I think it's stuck
Ow, but it feels so fucking good

[Chorus]
Ow, ow, ow (Oh, goddamn!)
I'm gonna facking cum! (Oh, shit!)
Fack, fack, fack (Fuck, I am!)
I am, I'm going to cum (I'm cumming!)

[Outro]
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Ew, ew, ew, ew

[Verse 1: Eminem]
It has been said that there has been known to be bloodshed
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money, power, respect, street cred, yeah
It's scary, ain't it? Picture yourself going out as a hero
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
We watched, so many piggybacked off of
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
These tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lives
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
To see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest must be the strongest
In this concrete jungle where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starving
Or it could just be somebody's aura, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
In his entou-rage that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Since B.I.G. taught us niggas to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencing the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rolling, going through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When Ready to Die was a sick part of my life
Palming that forty-five, plotting to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular, huh?
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I

[Verse 3: Diddy]
I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Into the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passing
All I did was build a dynasty off of his passion
And I'm addressing the adolescents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back
And I visit your grave 'cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yelling "God bless"
Regardless to critics yelling that East/West
I seen the game losing, I'm just pressing the reset
And when the resurrection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally
I'ma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest
Whether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, nigga (nigga)

[Intro: Royce Da 5'9" + Eminem]
What?
Uh
The Bad!
Yeah
The Evil!
The Bad, the Evil!
Put 'em together...

[Hook: Royce Da 5'9", Eminem & Both]
Yo, if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
I'm just fucking with you, 'cause I got nothing to do

[Verse 1: Eminem, Eminem w/ Royce da 5'9"]
I came in the diner with skateboarders and placed orders
Ate hors d'œuvres and hit the waiter with plate warmers
Let you inhale the Glock smell while I'm ripping your wallet off
And slipping a Molotov in your cocktail
Burning your contracts, punch your A&R in the face
Smash his glasses and turn 'em to contacts
I'm on some Suge shit; if it's missing, I took it (Whoops)
"Nurse, look at this straitjacket; it's crooked"
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (FedEx)
So how do you describe someone with a decapitated head
When the rest of his body's still alive running?

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Coming with five gunmen, waiting to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500, hide from it
For every hundred emcees rhyming about birds
Only about two thirds, I really said it without words
Yo, you ain't a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit
You would swear it's raining slugs (What)
I'm the hottest shit in the industry (Uh-huh)
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me, defending me
You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up
You get hit, ten down and ten up (What)
I take it if you run your mouth, then you wanna get sent up
Heat it up, you be leaking blood and spitting phlegm up
Now we rivals 'cause of a small name or title (What)
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and Bible

[Hook: Royce da 5'9", Eminem & Both]
Yo, if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
I'm just fucking with you, 'cause I got nothing to do
Yo, if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
I'm just fucking with you, 'cause I got nothing to do

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Forget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated
It takes six minutes to get applause (Yay)
And by the time you all catch on, I'mma end your career
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothing to fall back on
I'll throw you off of ten floors (Ahhhhh!)
Pull a fucking headache out of my head, and put it in yours (Take this)
I'm indoors, waiting for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This bitch wanted to blow me, I said, "It oughta happen—
You swallow cum, bitch?" "No, but I brought a napkin"
Getting skully while I'm autographing
Got my daughter laughing 'cause I sent her mother whitewater rafting
I'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my U-haul screaming "You ain't moving here"
Lorena Bobbitt—c'mere, want a souvenir?
I've been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
"Juvenile?" Same difference, I need some 'caine
'Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up to seven slain infants (Oh, my God)
Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same 'cause I traded brains with a chimpanz' (Ohhh!)

[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9"]
Walking in swamp water with an M-16
Out for the blood, shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces (What), you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places (What)
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, ice in my vein, blowing your hand off
Dancing with the Devil leading
I won't die, I'm never leaving (What)
I pledge allegiance to forever breathing
Street niggas with nuts, what? My meat's bigger
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a death wish, thinking I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the Tec lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil (What)
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through 'em, put the heat to 'em
Be careful—you might get what you ask for

[Hook: Royce da 5'9", Eminem & Both]
Yo, if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
I'm just fucking with you, 'cause I got nothing to do
Yo, if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
I'm just fucking with you, 'cause I got nothing to do

[Verse 1: Royce]
It's several different levels to picking up shovels
And dumping you in ditches under sea level
Front and you can witness
Let me refreshen you niggas, tell you my position in this
(Ch-chk!) Beef! Leave you under Venice, opposition finished
Here it is, we invaded, created a pyramid
Of a Haven of names, so blame Dre, and that ear of his
So (ah-ha, ah-ha) breathe, I'd rather reach for your neck
And I never heat you for respect, unless you greet me with less
I got a skunk in my trunk, I'm lying, I got a pump in my trunk
You dying, how many lumps niggas want?
Who's ready for y'all? We ready for y'all
We too incredibly raw for any artist that said he would draw
I stand firm, and it hurts to live it
You open up that can of worms
I hope you ready for the dirt that's with it
Slap a hoe, snatch a mic
Being brought to y'all in black and in white
(It's the new!) Joe Jackson and Ike
We renegades

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
‘Cause see, they call me a menace
And if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference
They're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Nah, nah, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned
And keep your ears glued to the stereo
'Cause, here we go: He's Royce, he's the King of Detroit
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a—

[Hook: Eminem & Royce]
—renegade!
Never been afraid to say what's on my mind
At any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?) Anything
'Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to say what's on my mind
At any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?) Anything (Anything)

[Verse 3: Royce]
I determine what time it's on, I call my nigga Proof
Hand him a pint of Limon and turn him loose
I'm tired of you new jacks, I'm tired of niggas that's like (I'm 'bout to blow)
'less you a bitch, we don't care if you 'bout to do that
Move back, youngster, the Glock gon' speak
Chew up your vest and turn your chest hair to taco meat
The street, continuous to pit, quick to smash ya
Or flash the clip, or give you the picture, develop the
Click clock, six shots blows through another door
And it gets hot, Hip-hop Quotable tug of war
Who did you niggas' beats, you bitches, who made it work?
That shit was *pfft* — I got harder two-way alerts
Just when I thought my dog couldn't get any meaner
You talk about his daughter, he probably go get you the nina
You talk about his momma, he won't even give you the finger
(He's crazy) Deranged, not media eaters, we renegades

[Verse 4: Eminem]
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the King of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
As a monger of hate and Satan, a scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's as easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie
While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers
'Cause I'm a motherfuckin'—

[Hook]
—renegade!

[Intro]
This the remix
I mean, I ain't really into rims and all that
If I'mma pay five, ten stacks of some D's it's gonna be some different kind of D's
You know what I'm saying? Hm?

[Hook]
Kanye's got stacks, ya'll already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Something feel different
Cute little college chick, lining up a scholarship
Just got a school grant, spent that on some new tits
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Ain't that a true bitch?
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you how to do this shit

[Verse 1]
Get you a cute chick, face got potential
Working with her little hips, waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you, but you know how 'Ye do
Says she love Beyoncé, let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain, asks "is that Jesus?"
If I'm unfaithful, blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift, they all up in
She ain't pregnant but about to have twins
Now, is it real love, I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon' finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them D's

[Hook]
Kanye's got stacks, y'all already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Man, that's a prerequisite
Cute chick living good, down here in Hollywood
Upcoming actress, but she got a flat chest
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
That'll give her access
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you what happened

[Verse 2]
Walking down Melrose, spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad, tell by the Chloe bag
She ain't no hoodrat, she ain't gotta prove that
I peep the McCartney's, Stella got her groove back
Hold on, lemme ask you
Why you spend your money on that shallow shit?
Why don't you buy some bigger tits? Something that'll last you
I couldn't tell you if Halle's really real
But I'mma let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I don't need no hands to know Lindsay Lohan
She on the same program as Britney, is you wit' me?
That's why I respect Alicia Keys
She say fuck getting them D's, I'mma just ride out with these

[Hook]
Kanye's got stacks, y'all already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Man, that's a prerequisite
Cute chick living good, down here in Hollywood
Upcoming actress, but she got a flat chest
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
That'll give her access
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you what happened

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream:
"Dre, don't leave us like that, man", 'cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
All around
The world there's an echo
As he takes
A bow, and they all know
All the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo
Echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo
Echo, echo

[Pre-Verse 1: Eminem]
It seems like no matter what I do, I just can't get away from them
Get away from what?
The voices
I can hear 'em callin', callin', callin', callin', callin' me

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I eat rappers, with the rhyme, consume 'em
The only fucking thing that you consume is time, I'm super human
My world is like a Rubik's Cube, it's too complex girl
You assuming, Cupid's looming, my mentality's caveman stupid woman
My life is Truman Show, all I have is music, ho
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago, so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
But you better put a fork in it if you think I’ma lay here just spooning, yo
Oh, you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful?
Diabolical to my last molecule, down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
Rotten to the core to the bone cold all the way down to my soul from my head to my toe
Ever since I was 13 I learned how to sew and sewed shut my own bootyhole
'Cause I ain't took no shit since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I’ma set this bitch on fire!
And this time I don't mean I'ma pour gasoline on some chick and light her
'Cause this time when I fuck this world I’ma put the whole goddamn dick inside her
I ain't even put my tip in that hole yet, I'ma go get Nickel and try to rip it wider

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
All around
The world there's an echo
As he takes
A bow, and they all know
All the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo
Echo, echo, echo
They will follow
The echo, echo, echo

[Pre-Verse 2: Royce da 5’9” & Eminem]
Shh!
Did you hear that? Somebody just said something
Is anybody there?
I can hear 'em callin', callin', callin', callin', callin' me

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Classical poems, battle my own demons, I need a glass of Patron
Bad as I need a horn stabbing my clavicle bone, I'm matador prone
First time I seen a desert eagle I was letting the .44 buss, the .44 pop
The first time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs, looking at Robocop
I am not a man, I'm a logo, I'm a such thang
In order to clean my veins you need Saleen, I'm never referring to the solution, I’m talking about more like the Mustang
Vroom! Get respect from the get-go, hello! Step to the echo, echo, echo
Pen got a mind of its own, got to write my rhymes with a timer
Otherwise I’ll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
As the echo follows the Maserati, as the petrol swallows
I'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton, check your Bible inside it
It'll say this guy's an elephant, I’m fly like I’m killing the scene like
I’m a villain with wings, I’ll sleep when I’m 6 feet deep
Right now I’m living a dream, though we may be reckless
The ladies check us, they whisper Shady Records, baby echo!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
All, around, the world, there's an echo
As, he takes, a bow, and they all know
All the girls, the boys, they chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

[Intro: Kobe & Slim the Mobster]
Hold up, wait a minute (Uh-huh, I see)
Let me put some kush up in it (Breathe with me now)
Hold up, wait a minute (I see)
Let me put some kush up in it (Breathe with me now)
Hold up, wait a minute (I see)
Let me put some kush up in it (Breathe with me now)
Hold up, wait a minute (Yeah)
Let me put some kush up in it (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Now, this that "puff, puff, pass" shit, Cheech and Chong glass shit
Blunts to the head, kush pillows, no mattress
Speedboat traffic, bitches automatic
Cross that line, fuck around and get your ass kicked
We roll shit that burn slow as fucking molasses
Probably won't pass it, smoke it 'til the last hit
Down to the ashes, Mary J. a bad bitch
Andre, 3001, another classic (One, one, one)
Go ahead, ask 'em— bitches 'bout how I be smoking out
(Party all night) Oh, yeah, it's goin' down
Order rounds, we smoke a quarter pound of that good stuff
Oh yeah, we smokin' all night
Yeah, puff puff pass that shit right here
Nigga, better than my last batch
Caramel complexion and her ass fat

[Bridge: Sly Pyper]
Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale, whoa

[Hook: Akon & Sly Pyper]
I know you tryna get high
Type of shit that have you leanin' sideways (Whoa, oh)
Take a whiff of this, suicide
Holla at me, ‘cause I got it all day (Yeah, ayy)
No need to fly to Jamaica
For the ganja, we can get the same thing
You want the bomb-bomb-diggy?
Holla at my niggy right here in L.A.
Inhale (L.A.), exhale (L.A.)
Inhale (L.A.), exhale

[Bridge: Sly "Pyper" Jordan]
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Hmm! Still, I am
Tighter than the pants on will.i.am
Black throwback Steeler hat, pound in my backpack
Next to where the Swishers at, smoking presidential
Got some bubba, I'll give you that, need it for my cataracts
Four hoes and I'm the pimp in my Cadillac (Where my money, bitch?)
You can tell them Cali back; matter-fact, they'll know
This ain't 'dro, get a whiff of that
No, it ain't no seeds in my sack, you ain't never gotta ask, dog
"What he smokin' on?" Shit, kush 'til my mind gone
What you think I'm on? Eyes low, I'm blown
High as a motherfucker, yeah, ain't no questions 'bout it
Niggas say, "Smoke me out," yeah, I really doubt it
I'm Bob Marley reincarnated, so faded
So if you want it, you know your nigga, homie
You can put it in a Zag or a blunt and get blunted

[Bridge: Sly Pyper]
Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale, whoa (Yessir)

[Hook: Akon & Sly Pyper]
I know you tryna get high
Type of shit that have you leanin' sideways (Whoa, oh)
Take a whiff of this, suicide
Holla at me, ‘cause I got it all day (Yeah, ayy)
No need to fly to Jamaica
For the ganja, we can get the same thing
You want the bomb-bomb-diggy?
Holla at my niggy right here in L.A.
Inhale (L.A.), exhale (L.A.)
Inhale (L.A.), exhale

[Outro: Blaqthoven & Kobe]
Need that kush, we blow on the best smoke
Inhale slow, no joke, make your ass choke
Hold up, wait a minute, you can go put it back
‘Cause what you got in your sack, boy, it ain't that
Need that kush, we blow on the best smoke
Inhale slow, no joke, make your ass choke
Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win (J.R.), to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo, yo
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that'd kinda make the pain go away
Tryna forgive you for abandoning me
Prayin', but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah, it's strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin' at me
But I become Neo when they aimin' at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow, they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start comin' and I start risin'
Must be surprisin', I'm just surmisin'
I win, thrive, soar, higher
Higher, higher, more fire

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo, yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocatin' every time it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures, then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nays become yays
Yankee stadium with Jays and Kanyes

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Verse 1]
I drove for miles just to find you and find myself
All these screams, all these voices in my head
You gave me strength, gave me hope for a lifetime
I never was satisfied

[Chorus]
This time, won't you save me?
This time, won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
This time, won't you save me?
This time, won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
Givin' up
Givin' up
Givin' up

[Verse 2]
It's not your fault, I'm a bitch, I'm a monster
Yes, I'm a beast, and I feast when I conquer
But I'm alone on my throne, all these riches
I came this way, all this way just to say, ayy

[Chorus]
This time, won't you save me?
This time, won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
This time, won't you save me?
This time, won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
Givin' up
Givin' up
Givin' up

[Bridge]
I'm givin' up baby, yes
I'm givin' up, baby
It feels like I've been drivin' for miles (Yeah)
I'm givin' up, baby
And I can't seem to silence these voices in my head (Yeah)
This time, won't you save me?
Come save me
This time, won't you save me?
Come save me

[Chorus]
This time won't you save me? This time won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
This time won't you save me? This time won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
This time won't you save me? This time won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up (Givin' up)
Givin' up

[Verse 1]
Why is it that you could only see the worst in me?
I swear, sometimes, it feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'ma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes
And I might pop a couple of them Percoce's
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules

[Pre-Chorus]
I am who I am
Ah

[Chorus]
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am

[Post-Chorus]
I am who I am
Ah

[Verse 2]
I swear to God, man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that changed is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife, I'ma fight your soul
'Cause the second time around, I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold 'til death do us part?
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe (I am)
Then you say I won't survive if I leave (Who I am)
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve (Ah)
I no longer need your attention, at ease

[Bridge]
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
Now it's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar (Here I am)

[Outro]
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am

[Intro]
Mmm, oh
Mmm
Yo

[Verse 1]
Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me where you at
I tried to channel you in hopes that I could steer you back
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin', tell me you ain't six feet under
And tell me that you comin' back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything, that was my mistake
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge
Your earings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW every time you came through
You was the brave heart, you stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up, you played the same part
But I needed to grow, and I needed to know
Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show?
So I just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

[Chorus]
You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that

[Verse 2]
Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour, money, fame, and power?
'Cause if so, that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me, gettin' at them nameless cowards
They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see, for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground and I was mainstream
I live the life now that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came, yeah, I tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit
And it's still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

[Chorus]
You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that

[Outro]
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that

[Intro: Natasha Bedingfield]
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo
I could've been had fame
Jump shot with a stupid-ass aim
'Cause you couldn't get around the last name
So my cross-over wins the last game
And it's ill, right?
Switched up the flow, but it's still right
Go back to that, yeah, I still might
I'ma just do me when it feel right
Uh, you could bring it any day
Natural bad-ass, NBA
That's my initials, that's why officials
Don't blow the whistle, bang-bang the pistol
A-a-and I'm bossy
Can't keep these hoes up off me
Damn, the flow nasty, coffee
Don't you do like the Pope and cross me

[Chorus: Both, Nicki Minaj & Natasha Bedingfield]
Yeah, this is my last chance (Oh)
Last chance (Oh)
Yeah, this is my last chance
Then shoot, I'm ready to shoot (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I'm ready to shoot (Ready to shoot)
I'm ready to shoot (Ready to shoot)
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot (Ready to shoot)
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot (Uh huh)
I'm ready to shoot (Uh, uh)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I get it in though
No sexual innuendo
Nobody that I could just depend on
Until I touch down in the end zone
And then they come out like roaches
P-p-pecking away like vultures
But little did they know, distribute the payroll
Pick out the outfit, pick out the single
Sadly, I'm so business savvy
Similar protocol, but the tidbits vary
Never been like me, ain't never been like this
My flow's a crisis, they screamin' high pitch
Uh, gun cock, pause
And I'm well aware of the gun laws
Tell 'em that I'm gunnin' for the top, Forbes
Headed to the top, dot org

[Chorus: Both, Nicki Minaj & Natasha Bedingfield]
Yeah, this is my last chance (This is my last chance)
Last chance (Oh yeah, yeah)
Yeah, this is my last chance (My last chance)
Then shoot, I'm ready to shoot (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
I'm ready to shoot (Ready to shoot)
I'm ready to shoot (Ready to shoot)
I'm ready to shoot (Ready to shoot)
I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to shoot

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj, Natasha Bedingfield & Both]
All the days of my life, I have been waiting for this time (Oh)
Could you believe now it's right before my eyes?
Anybody tryna stop me better not fuck with me this time (Oh)
Shoot, I am ready to shoot into the sky

[Chorus: Both, Nicki Minaj & Natasha Bedingfield]
Yeah, this is my last chance (This is your last chance)
Last chance (Oh)
Yeah, this is my last chance
Then shoot, I'm ready to shoot (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
I'm ready to shoot

[Outro: Natasha Bedingfield & Nicki Minaj]
Only one chance, one bullet in the gun (I'm ready to shoot)
This is my life and I only got one, yeah (I'm ready to shoot)
Running through there and I put on the stars (I'm ready to shoot)
Oh, stick 'em up, stick 'em up now, yeah (I'm ready to shoot)
Only one chance, one bullet in the gun
This is my life and I only got one, yeah
The safety's off and I put it on the stars
Oh, stick 'em up, stick 'em up, uh
I'm ready to shoot
Yeah, yeah, I'm ready to shoot
This is my life and I only got one, yeah
The safety's off and I put it on the stars
Get ready, ha
I'm ready to shoot

[Intro (Sampled): Billie Holiday (J. Cole)]
What can I do?
It’s cost me a lot
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here nigga)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here?)
(Shit homie) It’s cost me a lot (Shit homie)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here nigga)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here?)
It’s cost me a lot (Hey)
It’s cost me a lot (Hey)

[Verse 1]
Just one of them days, a nigga feel like flossin’
A Stone Cold Stunner, bitch, I'm Steve Austin
Cool as Drew Brees, I’m blowin' a few Gs
Just to hear them hoes say he’s awesome
He’s awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me
Pulled up beside me in that big body and stunted on me
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only
Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me
Well look, I’m back, bitch, back with an attitude
Buyin' out the bar, 'cause I feel like this the shit I gotta prove
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved
Now I’m tippin' the server a hundred to show my gratitude
Easy, told you I’d be back baby, I guess you ain't believe me
Now I’m living just like the niggas you see on TV
VIP feel like this club oughta thank me
I hit the bar so y’all can see me ballin’, HD

[Refrain]
It’s cost me a lot
Big chains, big whips with wood grain
It’s cost me a lot
My God, my watch make momma think someone might rob
It’s cost me a lot
Fast life and till the gas light
Copped the type of shit you couldn’t get at half price
It’s cost me a lot
Look but don’t touch motherfucker, think twice
It’s cost me a lot

[Hook]
Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that
Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that

[Verse 2]
Knee deep in the game, my chain heavy
Somebody get the pilot and ask is the plane ready
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we takin' off
Don’t wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can’t take it off
'Cause how I’m supposed to shine without the proper bling
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame
Felt naked 'cause the boy rocked about a thousand chains
Guess we rock a lot of ice 'cause we got a lot of pain
Thats five hundred years of swellin', I’m tryna tell 'em
Jacob the Jeweler is cooler now that he a felon
Jay put a stamp on the nigga but wouldn’t mail him
If he couldn't sell him, so what that tell him, huh?
My chain heavy and my bitches look very thorough
Must be the money like Deion with the Jheri curl
White Range, call that motherfucka Larry Bird
I got em hangin' on every word

[Refrain]
It’s cost me a lot
Big chains, big whips with wood grain
It’s cost me a lot
My God, my watch make momma think someone might rob
It’s cost me a lot
Fast life and till the gas light
Copped the type of shit you couldn’t get at half price
It’s cost me a lot
Look but don’t touch motherfucker, think twice
It’s cost me a lot

[Hook]
Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that
Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that

[Intro]
I know I may be young, but I’ve got feelings too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen

[Verse 1]
All you people look at me like I’m a little girl
Well, did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
Always saying, "Little girl, don’t step into the club"
Well, I’m just tryna find out why, 'cause dancing’s what I love, yeah (Now watch me)

[B-Section]
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, woah (Do you like it?)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
(This feels good)

[Verse 2]
I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy
What’s practical? What's logical? What the hell, who cares?
All I know is I’m so happy when you’re dancing there

[Chorus]
I’m a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it

[Refrain]
Baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me? (I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place
Oh, baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me? (Are you ready?)
Leaving behind my name and age (Let's go)

[Break]
Like that
You like it?
Yeah
Now watch me

[B-Section]
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, woah (Do you like it?)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
(This feels good)

[Bridge]
I really wanna dance tonight with you (I just can’t help myself)
I really wanna do what you want me to (I just feel I let myself go)
I really wanna dance tonight with you (I wanna see you move)
I really wanna do what you want me to (Uh, uh, uh)

[Refrain]
Baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me? (I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place
Oh, baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me? (Are you ready?)
Leaving behind my name and age

[Chorus]
I’m a slave for you (Like that)
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you (It just feels right, it just feels good)
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it, baby

[B-Section]
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, whoa
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
(It's just you and me)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, whoa
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh

[Chorus]
I’m a slave for you (Here we go now)
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you (Here we go)
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Like that

[Intro]
Heads up, nigga
Wale
Plain Pat
Emile

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Off jump boo, Cudi give you funk
Hit you in your head then it work it to your rump
Hatin' niggas can't hate, leave 'em all stumped
They gotta like a nigga, call me Obama
Not a hypebeast while you beast for the hype (no no)
Yeah I'm the underdog, story of my life (yup)
Matter fact I dreamed that I lived twice
Once as a slave who imagined being free
And made it all happen for his family and his seed
And now me, you can call me Mr. Friendly
One life to live, but no acting on my nigga Friendy
Can't stand evil bitches with they Fendi
All they do is envy and plot up on my loins
I give you options baby flip a coin
You get McDonald's, forget the sirloin
Hating my macking, they asking

[Chorus]
Is there any love
In this world?
Is there any love
In this world?
Is there any love
In this world of ours?
Is there any love
In this world?

[Verse 2: Wale & Kid Cudi]
Folarin, the muse of the hater
That music is greater, stupid nigga, bring your face up
Bamas surprised, deprived from attention
Pride of the district all rise so they listenin'
From where gorillas territorial for inches
When it come to pistols, these niggas don't John Lynch them
Off rip that's genius
You niggas so-so like seamstress
No more amore, I refuse to force you
Maybe I lack the fortitude to try to court you
Of course, they all hate
Early adapters agree they all late
So what that say about my watch?
To y'all minds I'm like a UK clock
Hours ahead, so wack niggas is sayin'
What they sayin', young?
They sayin'
What they sayin', young?
They sayin'?

[Chorus]
Is there any love
In this world?
Is there any love
In this world?
Is there any love
In this world of ours?
Is there any love
In this world?

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
I was born to do the damn thing
Story of Cudi, nigga getting out my dreams
Zero options to choose
Living in a box full of Cuyahoga blues, and listen
I stayed away from reading The Plain Dealer
Most of my niggas back in Cleveland were plain dealers, uh
Who whipped Supremes, the candy-painted eyes
But the love from the boppers had 'him watchin they rise
Wasn't no love for a nigga in the smug
Sipping out a cup, a concoction for cruising
High off life? My nigga, not even
I'ma go to war with the Devil 'til we're even
Bobbing and weaving, spiritual hymn singing
No commentary my man, I come out swinging
And this will be the song that we sing
Any young nigga with visions when he's sleeping

[Chorus]
Is there any love
In this world?
Is there any love
In this world?
Is there any love
In this world of ours?
Is there any love
In this world?

[Intro]
Yo, yo, fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Nah Right
And any other fuck-nigga-ass blog that can't put an 18 year old nigga
Making his own fucking beats, covers, videos and all that shit
Fuck you post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking, LA-Slauson rapping
Fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas, now back to the album

[Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself...
Well, look, if, if you don't talk, I mean, these sessions are going to go slower, so-

[Verse 1]
This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death, go 'head and fucking eat
My father's dead, well, I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano 'cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga, I'm Satan's son

[Verse 2]
My mother raised me, a single parent, so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important, I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple, but probably not, fuck em

[Verse 3]
I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls: the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot, like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
'Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this

[Verse 4]
I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like "Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?"
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs, I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school

[Verse 5]
Raquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made "Sarah" to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught, go to sleep

[Verse 6]
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
"Fuck me," the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal, play this shit in church

[Verse 7: Tyler, The Creator, Dr. TC]
I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother, my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton
Wearing some fucking Heelys

[Verse 8]
I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years
Impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug, oy
I’m bad for your kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it

[Interlude: Dr. TC]
Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say
Uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating

[Verse 9]
My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mom'll attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

[Outro: Dr. TC]
Wow, umm
So, Tyler, if you had the chance to tell him something
What would you tell him?

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is where the

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is where the fathers ain't livin', least not with us
Might see 'em round the city and won’t even say wassup
When niggas play tough, won't even smile in mirrors
And we learn to fuck hoes off trial and error
Just a small town nigga, big city hustle
Glued to the TV, Jigga, Diddy, Russell
These were our heroes, strictly for them zeros
For that Robert De Niro, niggas reload on them kilos, uh
Dodgin them people, mad at myself 'cause
I done seen some things that I’d rather not tell
Shawty smoke crack and her boyfriend too
And sometimes, he touch her daughter how them boyfriends do
Pull up to the club where my boys went too
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue
A nigga on a stretcher, and though I never met you
I'm thinkin', "God bless you, the city tryna get you"

[Bridge: J Cole]
Man, don’t let the city get you
Fuck the horoscopes, know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet you, bet your mama need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts, screaming, "We miss you"

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
Da da-da-da, da da da da
Come with me (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
Run quick see (Da-da da-da da-da)
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
Da da-da-da, da da da da

[Verse 2: Omen]
Yeah, now see God, I know you only do what's best for me
But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny?
They always tellin’ me it’s temporary
Then why it's feelin' like a cemetery? My dreams ain't got no obituaries
My city hurtin' and none of us well-equipped here
You heard me say I was ballin’, I probably meant tears
I’m tryna get clear
I’m tryna quit fear, who wrote the scripts here?
These kids live their whole life just killing time
Running the race with no finish line
They tryna noose us with they ropes, but I'm finna climb
I think my foolish pride might become my suicide
But I ain't tryna go, no, baby
And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope
'Cause I ain't dying, my words gon’ last forever
You can hold the treasure, look inside, see a diamond in my mind
I'm tired of seeing dope fiends wiping they nose clean
Is my neighborhood just a smokescreen?
I think I'm in the dungeon fam, I see low green
Sons raised by both queens but it's no kings

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
Da da-da-da, da da da da
Come with me (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
Run quick see (Da-da da-da da-da)
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
Da da-da-da, da da da da

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It seems like niggas either feel you or they tryna kill you
I face the sky and hope that God ain't acting unfamiliar
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar
They tell me that it's God’s will, I’m asking "God, will ya
Heal a nigga from all this pain?" Mama smokin' cocaine
As it rains out, am I to blame? Try to stay sane
So I came outside where they rock with them thangs out
To clear my mind, the same time they blew that boy brains out
But will it change? It's like niggas is free
But our minds still in the chains, brothers killing each other
The blood spill, it's a shame, will it ever slow up?
A lot of niggas getting older, but they never grow up
And do they sons like they fathers did and never show up
No need to cry about it, just another episode of
Life, watch the whole season, nigga, no reruns
The devil out here buying souls, nigga, no refunds, huh

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Man, don’t let the city get you
Fuck the horoscopes, know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet you, bet your mama need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming, "We miss you"

[Outro: J. Cole]
Another day, another song
A mother prays, another gone
But still we play, like ain't nothing wrong
Like ain't nothing wrong, 'cause ain't nothing wrong
I'm not as fast, I’m not as tall
But before I pass, I gotta ball
I gotta ball, I gotta ball
Nigga, I gotta ball

[Intro: Eminem + (Royce Da 5'9")]
What's your favorite scary movie?
Yo, Slim Shady (Yo, Royce 5'9")
Y'all wanna make a movie? (What, what?)
We got the film right here

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Yeah, I'm one of them pretty rappers
Buck if I really have to, I really slap you
King of Detroit, who they namin' the city after
Scandalous partners whose grammar hammers the hard shit
Into your heart with content, yo, who wanna start with?
Expert, Bad & Evil is comin' soon
MCs get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spittin'
Leavin' all of you cats shittin' kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggas be cockin' pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splittin' the profits with you
Six percent of y'all niggas is just pretend
Cliques with clits, pussy niggas stink with dicks
Niggas act bully and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggas packin' semi
Speak darts — yo, you get paid?
Rhymin' about it is the sweet part
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
5'9", a street nigga with deep feelin'
I keep illin', my steez willin' to keep killin'
Fuck rap! A lot of y'all all is just acts
Trust that, you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And I'ma spit thunder, stick to my guns
Niggas is finished before they gimmicks: one-hit wonders
What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls
I'm a pitbull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw
Split y'all, holler, "It's on!" – then I diss y'all
All of y'all niggas get pissed on claimin' you pissed off

[Hook: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin' in with their team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directin' and starrin' in it
Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin' in with their team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directin' and starrin' in it

[Verse 2: Eminem]
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin'
Any man plannin' to battle'll get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin'
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this — and you better inhale!
‘Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is gettin' taken advantage of, like Monica Lewinsky (Leave me alone!)
Came home in a frenzy, pushin' a ten speed
Screamin' to Aunt Peg
With three spokes stickin' outta my pant leg
Fuck a headache! Give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
You should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowin' you wack
You act up and I'm throwin' you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwin' you back up them
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em! The rap struck 'em
Harder than gettin' hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-fallin' feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left

[Hook: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin' in with their team and carry toolies

[Outro: Eminem + (Royce Da 5'9")]
Bad, the Bad (Uhh, when the Bad meets the Bad, yo)
The Evil (Take the Evil with the Evil)
Put 'em together (What? Nine-nine)
Two times, Slim Shady, Royce da 5'9"

[Verse]
I really don't know how long I been doing this shit
I guess 2010's the first year that you gave a shit
I was the underdog, so please excuse me a bit
I need some space so someone please make me some room in this bitch
'Cause I’m in beast mode, feast mode
Gimme those beats, I eat those
All day I don’t sleep, no, I don’t even know what I got sheets for
Them pillowcases and bed frames, oh no, take that, don’t need those
So high I don’t get high, I don’t even know what I got weed for
People, I’m in beast mode, why’d you think I got these teeth for?
Why do I rep that east side and why do they all call me B.O.?
But see, I knew this beat before anybody fed my ego
Back in the hood at east shows, so we take hood wherever we go
Please know, I am as loyal as loyalty is when it’s gave
Dedicated, determined, dependable
Yes, I committed myself to the game
Don’t be letting them tell you them lies
We make the industry real when it’s fake
So stay meditating so your head is facing
Into the direction that you aim, bitch
Okay then, know what my name is
Excuse my language but I’m fed up with the same shit
They say they love me, but it's really 'cause I’m famous, see
My momma told me this back when I was nameless
So fuck y’all, I’m shameless, I’m a beast unleashed, I’m raging
I’m living inside of this Matrix, this video game that I’m playing
I ride around and they praise me, I crack a smile and they waving
I guess you could call me David Ruffin
I’m circled in the temptations, huh
Or maybe I’m angry, maybe I just need a little more patience
Or maybe I’m crazy, maybe I just get a little too anxious
Sometimes I rhyme like I’m inside Einstein's mind
Look at the time fly by, plenty of times I died
Looking at these jive guys claiming they lost they mind
You ain't really seen shit, nigga
Till you had the whole world flipped upside down
Right side up from the DEC so the Eastside’s up
Fired up so you know
When I get to the booth I go ham, cause I gotta do what I can
So I’m like "kadoish, kadoish, kadoish, Adonai Tsebayoth" I chant
I’m kinda like a blur with these words
Guess I'm more absurd with these verbs
Running at a hundred kilometers, man
Pretty soon I’ma leave Earth
Earthlings, or whatever, human beings
I’m a beast, you're a feast, curly fries, onion rings
This is not a fucking game, ain't no referee’s involved
This is military combat soldiers standing guard round my yard
Entourage, ham squad to be exact
Smoking ham, smacking back
Take your girl, have her back
We don’t want her round my team
She’s a slut and she’s a freak
But you don’t know cause she’s discreet
I swear I see everything that's a bit
Man I’m fed up to my neck with the stress
I could use a wish; Hayley, where you at?
I guess the only exception to these girls is that I rap
But I only attack
'Cause I’m in beast mode, just beast mode
Everybody know that I’m a motherfucking monster
Monster... Energy Drink shoulda been my sponsor
But sometimes I wonder, what is this race I run for
I give a fuck about numbers so I do find it ironic
These niggas get mad at me
Talking all sideways with they eyes glazed
They mad cause I’m straight, what the mind sees, the eyes say
And they say that I went pop and the streets say I ain't hip hop
Well if it's not, then the shit stop

[Chorus: The Big Pink & Nicki Minaj]
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes (Uh-huh)
Dominoes, d-d-dominoes (Yo, ayo, ayo)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I'ma need sixty-nine real bad girls for my tour bus
Somebody get security to escort us
They go the long way, but we take the short cuts
Give me the blonde hair, long weave, short cuts
You know the flow sick, came in on the small bus
So give the D-cup, C-cup, small bust
They judge me like the girl's on trial
But every time that I come out, it's just girls gone wild
Got the domino effect, in the front row passing out
With little bikini tops, they got they asses hanging out
Say my shoe game nuts, so I call 'em cashews
Every other city, it's another Nicki tattoo
Steal Wayne girls, I steal Drake girls
You know the real bitches love me, fuck the fake girls
So if you pretty, I sign titties
I got the key to every muhfuckin' city (Kyuh)

[Chorus: The Big Pink, Nicki Minaj]
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes

Dominoes, d-d-dominoes (Yo, yo)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Okay, so when I'm in the hills, I hang with Kristin Cavallari
And when I'm in Miami, I'm with Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe
And when I'm in the A, I'm with Ciara or it's Keri
I'm feeling like a diva, then I hit Mariah Carey
I'm in the UK, I'ma see M.I.A
Superhero by night, r-r-rapper by day
And if I just wanna talk, I'ma hit up Monique
If I need a bad bitch, Angelina Jolie (Ooh)
Material girls like Madonna, model for Donatella
Ain't nothing you can tell her 'cause she get the mozzarella
She look just like Rihanna
She work with Wilhelmina, only rocking Galliano
She might be Filipino, be sipping Pellegrino
Be watching Al Pacino, she could probably sniff a kilo
Anyway, yo, hit up Grace Jones and tell her I said Strangé
I'm out in Paris, motherfucker, with Beyoncé

[Chorus: The Big Pink]
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
Dominoes, d-d-dominoes

[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
I know you like that, you want to try that
It's like a flashback, so shake your ass crack
I got the balls to rock the salsa
Funk the blues-a, any groove to
Make your move, ‘cause taking you to
Another landscape is my mandate
I'm highly animated even though I'm decomposin'
So if your feet is frozen, I'ma die to see you ropin'

[Pre-Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhyming and the DJ cutting
I want y'all to just get down
And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhyming and the DJ cutting
I want y'all to just get down

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, shake and bake, do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Gravitational pull'll have you making a fool
Out of yourself on the dance floor
Doing back spins, running man and more
Party down with vigor and candor
Coming to the jam or look like a landlubber
And do the aqua boogie, win lots of goodies maybe
Pop a Gucci wallet, turntables is talking to me
It's awfully groovy, seeing all the treasure and the booty

[Pre-Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhyming and the DJ cutting

[Verse 3: Del the Funky Homosapien]
I want to get down lower than Atlantis
Going toe to toe with an enchantress
Get funkier than Funkadelic wearing Pampers
While you eggheads is on the wall preparing answers
Sharing transcripts, while we over here
Dipping and dancing, rhythm romancing
Wallflowers, giving no action, no
All hours we chillin' and maxin'
So relaxin', opposites attractin'
I'ma toss my hat in, floss when the track spin
Like I'm on a crack bend, jigglin' and wigglin'
Freaking booties, speaking to the cuties so belligerent
No religion, just bump the feed on
You'll feel reborn, negativity we just dead it like decoy
Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
The pulse when it responds

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, shake and bake, do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)

Dirty South nigga, check it

[Ludacris]
Now I'm an honest ho and all my hoes is honest
Luda make you brace yourself like orthodontist
I'm hooked on chronic and Smirnoff twist
But know ass in spandex is a turn-off bitch
It's not right like chapped lips if you givin' some mouth
Niggas want me on a song so I give em' the South
Thirty a verse, cars just for sixteen bars
And that's before I did this, so it probably went up
Eighty thousand dollar bonds, I ain't givin' a fuck
Cause that's change in my pocket, 45 I cock it
Click before I spit then it's time to scram
Bought a Cutlass on dubs, colored candy yams
And that's bowling ball paint so I roll the lane
Keep a poker face bitch and I fold the game
On a come up, get done up and it's time to creep
Freestyle motherfucker, nightmare on Greg Street

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]

But I think I like him better when he dolo
And I think I like him better with the fitted cap on
He ain't even gotta try to put the mack on
He just gotta give me that look, when he give me that look
Then the panties comin' off, off, uh

Told y'all on Drake's shit, told y'all to fixate
Bitches want my old shit, buy my old mixtape (Oh)
I ain't fuckin' with you bum bitches no more
Always in the club lookin' like a bozo
Talkin' 'bout money, we could have a conversation
Top five tax bracket in the population
Hatin' and I know they got a reason why
I ain't gotta wonder if I want to lease or buy
And I dictate how I'm gon' piece the pie
I ain't talkin' about no mothafuckin' pizza pie
'Cause I keep a bad bitch, booty big and the waist thin
Seen his little weiner, but we don't like Nathans
Nah, homie, you gon' need a bigger cock-pit
'Cause when I fly, I be right behind the cockpit

I'm in the UK, but just for one day
Who's to say I won't come back again?
Materialistic, I'm narcissistic
My shoe game is mean, it's so sadistic
I took the Learjet to cop some lipstick
Yeah, I'ma risk it, I'm optimistic
I sip on Rosé, you sip your Mystic
My flow's a biscuit short of a picnic
Okay, Versace Pythons, Louis aviators
Balenciagas and they gotta be the Gladiators
Chanel lambskin, vintage Vanson
I'm on the bike, doin' wheelies in a mansion
A lot of bad bitches on the pole dancin'
Gucci bag, just to put the coke cans in

Hey, yo, Anna, hey, yo, Anna Wintour
I'ma need that cover, baby girl
It's Pink Friday, ya dig?

Bet I flow, bet I rip this beat, bet I feel that soul
Bet I go, bet I bench these niggas like Ray, sit down bro
Bet I know everything about this game, bet I know my role
But they know when I come to the court this is my sport, B-dot-o-B
So bet I'm gone, bet I'm on a brand new plane
Bet I'm in a whole different zone
I ain't really from this place, so I'm up all night long
Really I'm in outer space, really ain't got no home
Really I'm a saint, bet I'm blown, bet I'm thrown
Up to the sky, over the ocean
So I'll fly, wherever I'm goin'
When I'm by, bet I'm focused
If it's fire, you can bet I roll it
Matter of fact, you can bet I bust

[Hook: B.o.B]
Put me on anything, still I bet I bust
Put me anywhere on the map, I bet I bust
This is what I does so, please don't gas me up
Matter of fact, give me fifteen minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust
I bet I bust, I bet I bust
I bet I, I bet I, I bet I bust, I bet I bust
Matter of fact, give me fifteen minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Yeah, hey, gather round, front and center, the King finna enter
The room when the boom hit the booth, I deliver
The hottest, you probably too small to acknowledge, you
Impossible to copy like what everybody try to do
We cool as some dudes on them waves out in Malibu
I'm fallin' hard baseline, ball through the alley-oop (bang!)
Comin' through this thing like James
In the air, off the rim I hang
Nigga, this king
Pretend you forgot my name if you wanna
I'ma come hard like a boner, don't I
Make a nigga wanna rebound, turned up all the way
We amped, two or three tramp
With 'em in the mill, same Bentley
Niggas said they do it like us, you shittin' me?
'96, '97 in Atlanta
Didn't we have more blocks than Mutombo, Dikembe?
For those who can't hold water, need new kidneys
Put 'em down under Australia, Sydney
And I'm still representin'
For the niggas on the prison yard, tuned in, listenin'
I'm back to doin' big things
A sucker lookin' for me, start in your bitch's dreams
Or twenty feet tall standin' on the big screen
Get dough, big green, my flow sickenin'; it's the King, nigga

[Hook: B.o.B]
Put me on anything, still I bet I bust
Put me anywhere on the map, I bet I bust
This is what I does so, please don't gas me up
Matter of fact, give me fifteen minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust
I bet I bust, I bet I bust
I bet I, I bet I, I bet I bust, I bet I bust
Matter of fact, give me fifteen minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust

[Verse 3: Playboy Tre]
Yeah, back with a cup of that liquor, nigga
Y'all don't really know Tre
Really know me, really know the streets, no
Y'all niggas really ain't G, really ain't hard
Never really served no hard, y'all be playin' that role
Talkin' that pimp shit, never really pimp shit, nah
Y'all be savin' them hoes, but I don't and I won't
I'll get a bitch anytime I want
I'm that guy, spit that fire, shake the ground every time I stomp
Beat in the trunk, cup in the air
You can talk shit but I really don't care
Man I'm in the Cadillac
Gun go rat-tat-a-tat-tat but a nigga ain't scared
From that Red Clay, east of the A
Young niggas get locked up everyday
Cops ain't shit, so I drop that shit
Have it drop on 'em, make it through the day
Grindin' for my pay, it's that nigga Tre
Bustin' like a pistol best believe it when I say that I bust

[Hook: B.o.B]
Put me on anything, still I bet I bust
Put me anywhere on the map, I bet I bust
This is what I does so, please don't gas me up
Matter of fact, give me fifteen minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust
I bet I bust, I bet I bust
I bet I, I bet I, I bet I bust, I bet I bust
Matter of fact, give me fifteen minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust

[Verse 1]
She said she likes my watch, but she wants Steve's AP
And she stay up all hours watching QVC
She said she loves my songs, she bought my MP3
And so I put her number in my Bold BB
I got a black BM, she got a white TT
She wanna see what's hiding in my CK briefs
I tell her, "Wear suspenders and some PVC"
And then I'll film it all up on my JVC

[Chorus]
Scene one
Everybody get in your positions
Pay attention
And listen
We're tryna get this all in one take
So let's try to make that happen
Take one
Action

[Verse 2]
She pose for FHM, she like my black LV
We spilling LPR up on my APC
I'm in my PRPS and my Nike SB's
Raving with SHM, London to NYC
I got my visa and my Visa, a diva and her dealer
Bitch, I'm up on the guest list with the Swedish House Mafia
You can find me on a table full of vodka and tequila
Surrounded by some bunnies and it ain't fucking Easter
I'll wake up in the morning with a mild case of amnesia
With a girl that like a girl like Lindsay Lo and Queen Latifah
If you niggas are balling, then boy, I must be FIFA
And that's standard procedure from Miami to Ibiza

[Outro]
Yeah
From Miami to Ibiza
Yeah
From Miami to Ibiza

[Verse: Lupe Fiasco]
Career crookin' (Yeah catch him)
Watch me Watts, come here Brooklyn
Follow me Houston, see what I'm 'bout
Really South Philly Bank Head keep looking
Uh...You feel me I'm a product of pushing
That was red off whooping pull switches off trees
Pull of the leaves like she loves me...not
It's hot I couldn't tie a shoe
Move slow like Tai-Chi
Down the block, come kick it with me like Kung Fu
Where I hung like noose, they call me young bruce
I cop Jordans pull chickens with these
Please was not odd to work at pa-pa
Though I came with a biscuit
Just tryin' a make a mill
I brang in the bidness
Flow like chuch, pulpitted with ease
Pivot and pull from the lines like threes
Gain a better understanding
I'm just tryin' a make it real
Like a fisherman, pon da river fam
I'm pon my bank, deposit my thoughts
Till my mind draws a blank
And I withdraw from checking
I'll leave that with y'all for a second
Give you a minute to let it sink
Didn't I advise baptize?
For them dead presidents, I'll tie a bomb to your brakes
And burn money faster than you learn you ain't even conserve money
Gave you a second now I return hungry
Period young blood, I return monthly
To bogart like humphrey
Stern, gully, seldom, stumble
Welcome to the jungle like FernGully
Man it's gorillas here
Takes a village to raise a villain here
And you might have to raise his bail
Tryin' a free the whole cartel
I need to raise a million here

[Chorus]
It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Then she loves me not

[Verse 1]
Hey, I know that this ain't nothing that you used to
Out of the ordinary, unusual
I know you had your whole life planned out
So to watch this pan out I know this shit gotta confuse you
I know you wonder why I had to choose you
Don't wanna take you for granted or abuse you
So I’ma keep it honest
I think it’s a little ironic
If I hit another chick its gonna bruise you
Shit, staring out the window of this plane
Thinking if it crash, I’ll never see your ass again
Wouldn't that be a shame
Cause look at all the shit we overcame
Made it through the flame and never got cremated
I made it to the fame and never got too jaded
All them other couples we fuck with, secretly hated
Flash forward it’s been years, we the only ones that made it
Shit, remember I was straying from home
And "Where I Wanna Be" was my favorite song
Sometimes I still be on my Donell Jones
But I just can’t leave you alone

[Chorus]
It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Then she loves me not

[Verse 2]
She know me like a book, its too easy to read my ass
Unhappy stressed, yelling don’t mislead my ass
I mean I make it so easy to please my ass
The shoe was on the other foot and you would leave my ass
True that
My song all on the radio
Who Dat
Am I so far gone, used to see both sides like the Mohawk on
Now I know you wonder why this phone lock on
All this time that I’ve been with ya you ain't used to do that
I loved your ass way before I knew you could rap
The way you breaking my heart I should sue you for that
Call up my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that
We had a deal you ain't keeping up your end of the shit
In my mind I know she get the short end of the stick
Try to justify it thinking, man we finna be rich
Some bad bitch I barely know sending me flicks

[Chorus]
It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Then she loves me not

[Intro: Eminem]

[Chorus: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I get lifted and spin 'til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink, pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin 'til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash, whiskey, and ash 'til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me again and imagine this

[Chorus: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

[Verse 2: Bizarre & Eminem]
I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was sleep
Pissy-drunk, throwin' up in the urinal
(You fuckin' homo!) That's what I said at my dad's funeral

[Chorus: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

[Verse 3: Eminem]
That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin' idiots still (Still)
That's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit, he gets killed (Killed)
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville (Ville)
You can get capped after just havin' a cavity filled (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!)
That's why we're crowned the murder capital still (Still)
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger Hill (Hill)
We don't do drive-bys, we park in front of houses and shoot (Shoot)
And when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with 'em too (Too)
That's the mentality here (Here), that's the reality here (Here)
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here? (Huh?)
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibers here? (Here)
Plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year? (Year)
'Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen (Happen), when a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around you and they found you
And your family in it; goddammit, he meant it when he told you

[Chorus: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

[Verse 1]
Hey, this is the story of a youngin dreamin'
Left his city to see if he could be what he dreamin’
Big city on his own shit
But every now and then a nigga get homesick
Pick up the phone, holla at my partner he telling me, be warned
A lot of shit done changed in the time that you’ve been gone
Streets got meaner, the hoes got growner
And went and got babies the day they got they diplomas
Damn, gon’ be some niggas missing when you fly back
If you black, they sending you to jail or to Iraq
Old buddy that we hoop with, with the bad chick and a fly 'lac
And a gold chain? Caught him on the Merc, tryna buy crack
Damn homie! Shit, in high school you was the man homie
The fuck happened to you?
Used to beat niggas down at the buses after school
Now you looking like a motherfucking fool

[Chorus]
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I’ll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come let's get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, I wish I could stay
But I’m coming home for the holidays

[Verse 2]
Hey, this is a story bout some puppy love
But at the time boy, I was feeling like this must be love
Although now I'm on my grown shit
She bad as hell, a nigga still get home sick
I was fresh up off a scholarship
Dressed like a black man in college shit
Got a little knowledge now I’m following the politics
But I still gotta holla at my old chick
So sweet, so thick, girl pick up your phone, it’s me
She said “what, we ain't homies no more”
You go to college now you act like you don’t know me no more
Girl please, we got history, semester seem so long
The last time I seen ya baby you ain't have no clothes on
So if history repeats itself
When I get home, girl it's on, you ain't gon' need ya belt
Or your pants or your drawers, then we hit the rewind
Just don’t give it up in the meantime

[Chorus]
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I’ll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come let's get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, I wish I could stay
But I’m coming home for the holidays

[Verse 3]
Man I reminisce on them school days
I know you know them act a fool days
That missed the bus then hit the blunt and go to school blazed
Trying to get laid so I gotta stay fly
But a nigga hella shy you would have thought that's where the Bulls play
Was just a freshman could used a little Kool-aid (cool aid)
Crushing on them upper classmen but it was too late
Buddy she was dating, yeah, he had the freshest shoes
But the nigga graduated and he never made two A’s
Hey if you’re listening, we got in school
But who will pay our tuition man?
These niggas crazy
One year cost about same as a Mercedes (benz)
Four years cost wife, crib, and a baby
Ay maybe this ain't for me
Only if I could be LeBron and go straight to league
The worst part of growing up man: shit just ain't for free
Maybe I can be somebody people pay to see
And maybe I should move up out here to the place to be
To get from A to Z, aye what you think I'm crazy
If I told you one day that I'ma sign with Jay-Z
And will I make it man I guess we gotta wait and see

[Chorus]
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I’ll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come let's get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay
But I’m coming home for the holidays

[Intro]
I don't like the look of it

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
Okay, I'm sippin on the syrup, got a nigga movin slow
I'm all about the money, what the fuck you think I do it for?
Bitch don't act like you don't know, I'm killin all these rap niggas
Custom made caskets for yo' motherfuckin funeral
Keep the women with me, shit I gotta keep like two or more
Party everyday, like we won the fuckin Super Bowl
Chillin wit my nigga Mack, he keep bitches handy
White girl on the table, let 'em sniff the nose candy
When I'm walkin by, the women sayin, "Who is that nigga?"
I replied, "Hi, I am Gudda Gudda, that nigga!"
I was raised in the home of the cap splitters
Whip on 24's, watch it crawl like a caterpillar
I come with a toy boy like a Happy Meal
And you's a motherfuckin duck, Daffy-dil
I'm from the school of hard knocks, where we scrap and kill
Pick the knife or gun or you can get the package deal
I'm hot, nigga, burnin everything around me
I was lost for a minute, took a while but I found me (Gudda)
The streets say I'm king but the game'll never crown me (Gudda)
Realest nigga doin it just ask them niggas 'round me (Gudda)
So you cain't size me up or try to clown a—
Shark in the water, jump in and I'ma drown you
New Orleans nigga, gun out, I'ma down you
Put niggas to sleep like a muh'fuckin' downer (Gudda)
I'm a Great White, you's a flounder
Fish and a bitch, I tuna eveything around you
UHaul Gudda, movin everything around you (Yeah)
It's Young Money, bitch! At the top is where they found us, nigga

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, goons on deck, Marley don't shoot 'em
Silence on the gun, watch a nigga mute 'em
The coach in the booth, call me Jon Gruden
School these niggas, they all my students
All jokes aside, I ain't playin with ya
The weed broke down, like a transmission
Tha chopper spin him 'round, like a ballerina
Bitch I'm still spittin like I ate a jalape-na
I'm from uptown, my bitch from Argentina
My pockets on fat like Joey Cartagena
Stunt so hard, it's all y'all fault
And when it come to beef, give me A1 Sauce
I ain't worryin 'bout shit, everything paid out
You could catch me courtside in Dwayne Wade house
With a high yellow thick bitch wit her legs out
Cash Money president, but we in a red house
Who the fuck want it? Make my fuckin day
I blow your candles out, now nigga cut the cake
I gotta eat, bitch! Like a runaway
Y'all niggas ain't eatin, stomach ache
Okay, all these bitches, and niggas still hatin
I used to be ballin, but now I'm Bill Gatein
Fuckin with my iPhone, bumpin' Illmatic
I'm on the road to riches, there's just a lil' traffic
Hair still platted, thuggin is a habit
Keep my guitar, hip hop Lenny Kravitz
Bunch of bad bitches and I fuck 'em like rabbits
Dope dick Weezy, ya girlfriend an addict, uh

[Hook]
One Love! One Heart!

One Love! What about the one heart? One Heart!
What about the- Let's all get together and feel alright
I'm pleadin' to mankind! (One Love!)

[Intro (Spoken)]
Yeah, Revenge!
Now what we gonna do right now, a-ha! uh
Is gonna try a little experiment, just a little experiment
You know what I'm saying? A little "science project"
You know what I'm saying? I like to call it

[Verse 1]
(Switch!) You you you, yes let the words woo you
Till you woozy, let the lyrics subdue you
Massage and soothe you, move you, till conscience lose you
Lu now rules you, do what Lu do and you'll do beautiful
(Switch!) I'm the meanest! You the meanest?
I'm the meanest, and I mean this
Now I don't mean this to sound fiendish
But I'm a genius, you a genius?
And the cleanest, never seen this
As clean as my cleanest
From on top, from underneath
From behind, or in between us
(Switch!) I'm a hustler, creeping with my hat low
Niggas know I pack, so, what they gonna do that for?
Niggas got my back, though, like answering the back door
Catch you, I'ma slap you, leave you redder than the Batphone
(Switch!) With a little bit of this and a little bit of that
That, mixed with a little bit of pimp and a little bit of mack
And a little bit of limp, and a whole lotta gangsta lean
I can't be seen, I ain't the King
But a nigga is strengthening to paint the scene
And take the thing over like a soldier, colder than a polar
Got the hood like a cobra, nigga thank the team (Switch!)

[Hook]
Switch, nigga, this is how I got it
I switch like hydraulic cars
Switch like DeBarge, nigga (Switch!)

[Interlude (over Hook)]
Aight, now remember that
That's a, that was a part of the experiment
I had to set it up, so, so, don't worry
I know what you're thinking, I was thinking the same thing
Just, just follow me, okay? Watch, okay? Come on now

[Verse 2]
Murder niggas, step on my shoes, I hurt a nigga
Kill a nigga, fill a nigga with holes, call women hoes
Hold up niggas, hold up hoes, break the calm, detonate bombs
Blow up niggas, blow up hoes, turn around, smack they moms
(Switch!) Heal niggas, educate and build niggas
Instill in niggas, it’s real to respect women
Treat 'em like they real, they feel, nigga, watch the words
Watch Dr. Phil, nigga, chill, nigga, go learn a skill, nigga
(Switch!) Rims, Mercedes Benz, twenties, twenty-twos
Twenty-fours, rose gold, platinum watches, cases of Mo'
Gucci, rubies, mansions, models, VIP, Ferraris
Chinchillas, diamond rings, change, Range Rovers, bling bling
(Switch!) Niggas bust his trains, pocket full of change
Dimes, quarters, taking orders, delivering pizzas
Air conditionless, beaters, hand-me-down sneakers, silver
Wannabe models won't show me love and I can't get in the club
(Switch!)

[Interlude]
Ha, it's getting good right?
Yeah, aight, so check this out
Now go back to the first one, aight? Run back to that one
We're going to have a little bit more fun with that one, aight?
You ready? Aight, come on

[Verse 3]
(Switch!) Hey hey hey, it's coming back to you
Lu no longer rules you, you can do what you do
Back to your usual
(Switch!) It's official, it's official, I'm official
As officials, got the stripes
And the flags, and the whistles
(Switch!)And watch my niggas come from the underground
Just like Thriller, play Bambi and you gon' hear that Thumper sound
(Switch!) They can't touch the sound that I'm busting now
It's like a cloud tryna touch the ground
Tough and bound, ever since we're touching down
Jealous niggas catch your feelings 'cause I'm hustling now, what?
(Switch!) They be hating (Switch!) They be hating?
(Switch!) What? What? What? They be hating
Don't give them stage then
(Switch!) What's a nigga s'posed to tell 'em
When they up in my face then?
(Switch!)That you got a cousin that don't mind catching cases
Busting niggas' heads and slapping niggas' faces
(Switch!)And he-a do it, he-a do it
He-a do it, and I'll prove it
'Cause I done seen it, you done seen it?
I done seen it, he the meanest
(Switch!) Ho-ho-ho, wait, I mean it
I thought you were the meanest
See? That's why this thing is fiendish, right now
(Switch!)

[Hook]
Switch, nigga, this is how I got it
I switch like hydraulic cars
Switch like DeBarge, nigga (Switch!)

[Outro: Lupe talking]
Yeah, experiment done
I think that was a goody, I think that was a good experiment
I think that was nice, it's a nice little science project
Haha! Revenge!
Shoutouts to my homies at Asylum, what up? Yeah

[Intro]
Hey
Ma-ma-ma, ma-moon
Hey
Ma-ma-ma, ma-moon

[Verse 1]
When the days change
So does my attitude
I'm messy at home
I eat a lot of junk food
When the nights change
So do my nightmares too
I dream reality
Is my dream

[Chorus 1]
All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
Out there on my own
Yeah

[Verse 2]
When the weeks change
The rumors change too
I'm addicted to highs
Would you like to know why?
When the months change
So do my love point of views
I don't want what I need
What I need hates me
What I need hates me

[Chorus 2]
I know all along
All along
I know I'm meant to be alone
It's crazy
But all along
All along
I knew I was meant to be alone
Out there on my own, yeah

[Bridge]
Suppose somehow the lionhearted
Failed to win
Who will be the villain?
All the strangers voted for him
Suppose somehow the lionhearted
Failed to smile
Who will be the villain?
All the strangers voted for him

[Chorus 1]
All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
Out there on my own, yeah

[Produced By: Jeff Bhasker, Kanye West & Q-Tip]

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh
Hello, can I speak to, uh
Uh
Yeah, you know who you are, look
You had no idea what ya dealing with
Something on some this realest shit
Pop champagne, I'll give you a sip
'Bout to go dumb, how come?
Yeah, that's my bitch
That's my bitch
Sh-shorty right there? That's my bitch
That's my bitch

[Chorus: Elly Jackson & Kanye West]
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life, and live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I paid for them titties, get your own
It ain't safe in the city, watch the throne
She say I care more about them basquions
Basquiats, she learning a new word, it's yacht
Blew the world up soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called, told me I fell in love with her
Seat by actors, ball players, and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story, True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
I'm a freak, huh? Rockstar life
The second girl with us, that's our wife
Hey, boys and girls, I got a new riddle
Who's the new old perv that's tryna play second fiddle?
No disrespect, I'm not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money, I put Monie in the middle

[Chorus: Elly Jackson & Kanye West]
I've been waiting for a long, long time (Where she at? In the middle)
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life, and live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high, high, high, high

[Bridge: Justin Vernon]
Swilling little licks and mixes 'til mornin'
I'm yearnin', ooh, yeah
Could I maybe have a little dab of your potion?
Stop motion, ooh, yeah

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Go harder than a nigga for a nigga, go figure
Told me keep my own money if we ever did split up
How could somethin' so gangster be so pretty in pictures?
Ripped jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers
Uh, Picasso was alive, he would've made her
That's right, nigga, Mona Lisa can't fade her
I mean Marilyn Monroe, she's quite nice
But why all the pretty icons always all white?
Put some colored girls in the MoMA
Half these broads ain't got nothing on Willona
Don't make me bring Thelma in it
Bring Halle, bring Penélope and Salma in it, uh
Back to my Beyoncés
You deserve three stacks, word to André
Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in mo-seums
You belong in vintage clothes, crushing the whole building
You belong with niggas who used to be known for dope dealing
You too dope for any of those civilians
Now shoo, children, stop looking at her tits
Get your own dog, ya heard? That's my bitch

[Chorus: Elly Jackson]
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life, and live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high, high, high, high

[Intro]
Yeah, this is the... warm up

[Verse 1]
Okay, I roll up, hold up, look at how I showed up
I blowed up, had a hole up in my pocket, now it's sewed up
They feinin' for that crack, you know that rock, I got that product
You niggas tryna stop it, better load up, I hang my coat up
Aye, I'm gon' be here for a while so I smile, haters
I'm on that green like a flower, like an alligator
Now or later, I'm serving niggas; I'm a sound waiter
Just tell me what you want, I bring that back an hour later
Look how I cater, dog what you afraid of? Nothing
They talking gangsta without no data, they fronting
Jackie-Chan, Jean-Claude-Van-Dam, straight stunting
I wish a nigga would say something
I'm a Carolina nigga, boy I got it on my back
Piggy back style I ain't talking 'bout no tat
And I'ma rep the Ville in every city that I'm at
And I guarantee I'm bringing home plaques
Shoutout to my brother Zach, and my mother, I love ya

[Break]

[Verse 2]
Yea look ain't that about a bitch? This nigga on his own dick
They say I'm like the human body, I produce my own shit
And I toot my horns, a star when I was born
My name ain't James, my word is bond
Yea shoutout to Canibus, had a similar line 98-99
Damn, that was the times never mind dwelling in the past
You're listening to the future
The flows gets tighter, them hoes get looser
Then they wanna seduce ya like Medusa, be cool
I said I got a girl, she told me, "Me too!"
So that must mean you want a nigga to eat that seafood
Baby don't be foolish but call her I'll watch her do it

[Break]

Yea and this is only "The Warm Up" yea

[Produced by Kanye West]

[Chorus]
Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 1]
I'll never be picture-perfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet? He was black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'll never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Chorus]
Damn, here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 2]
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award
They'd rather give me the Ni-Nigga Please Award
But I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award

[Chorus]
Damn, here we go again
Bum-tu-bum-bum-bum
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 3]
I know people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets
Man, killing's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please, no more today

[Chorus]
Damn, here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 1]
I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait
I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner, we're making our fame
Bona fide hustler making my name
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner, we're making our fame
Bona fide hustler making my name

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is–, and a–
And take your money
All I wanna do is–, and a–
And take your money
All I wanna do is–, and a–
And take your money
All I wanna do is–, and a–

[Verse 3]
Pirate skulls and bones
Sticks and stones and weed and bongs
Running when we hit 'em
Lethal poison for the system
Pirate skulls and bones
Sticks and stones and weed and bongs
Running when we hit 'em
Lethal poison for the system

[Verse 4]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Hit me on my burner prepaid wireless
We pack and deliver like UPS trucks
Already going hard, just pumping that gas
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Hit me on my burner prepaid wireless
We pack and deliver like UPS trucks
Already going hard, just pumping that gas

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is–, and a–
And take your money
All I wanna do is–, and a–
And take your money
All I wanna do is–, and a–
And take your money
All I wanna do is–, and a–
And take your money

[Bridge]
M.I.A, third world democracy
Yeah, I've got more records than the KGB
So, uh, no funny business (Are you ready all?)
Some some some I some I murder
Some I some I let go
Some some some I some I murder
Some I some I let go

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is–, and a–
And take your money
All I wanna do is–, and a–
And take your money
All I wanna do is–, and a–
And take your money
All I wanna do is–, and a–
And take your money

[Verse 1]
Big on the underground, what's the point of knocking me down?
Everyone knows, I'm already good on the ground
Most of us stay strong, shit don't really bound us
Then I go on my own, making bombs with rubber bands
I have my heart down so I need a man for romance
Streets are making 'em hard so they selfish little roamers
Jumpin' girl to girl,Make us meat like burgers
When I get fat I'll pop me out some leaders

[Verse 2]
Protocol to be a Rocawear model?
It didn't really drop that way, my legs hit the hurdle
Protocol to be a rocker on a label?
It didn't really drop that way, my beats were too evil
Now I put away paper for later so I'm stable
A better something better come, gotta get cable
Ghetto pops, food drops, stored up in my stable
Pop 'em up, pop 'em down, eat 'em off the table

[Verse 3]
The village got on the phone, said the street is comin' to town
They wanna check my papers, see what I carry around
Credentials are boring, I burnt them at the burial ground
Don't order me about, I'm an outlaw from the badlands
Put away shots for later, so I'm stable
Live in trees, chew on feet, watch Lost on cable
Bird flu gonna get you, made it in my stable
From the crap you drop, on my crop when they pay you

Chinna girl is a little girl
From a town, that's all ya need to know

Clocked him like a taximeter
Fuck gold, she was platinum digger
Shakin-ass-making moves on a mover
Visa, then a plane ride to ya
Peace out, she'll kill you like Uma

[Pre-Chorus]
She skipped away to the shop

Chinna girl grew up to be a big girl
Had her sights set on a bigger world
Dial-a-Bride from Sri Lanka
Found herself a Yorkshire banker
Need a Visa? Got with a geezer
Need some money? Paid him with a-knees up
Year later, started to ease-up
Got her own way, shouted out, "See ya!"

[Pre-Chorus]
She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her
And sucked on a lollipop

[Bridge]
I like the way you touch me there
I like the way you pull my hair
Babe, if I don't feel it I ain't faking, no, no (Oh no)
I like when you tell me 'kiss you there'
I like when you tell me 'move it there'
So giddy-up, time to get it up
You say you a rude boy, show me what you got now
Come here right now
Take it, take it, baby, baby
Take it, take it, love me, love me

[Chorus]
Come here, rude boy, boy, can you get it up?

Love me, love me (Love me, love me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Take it, take it, baby, baby
Take it, take it, love me, love me
My chain is really stupid but my swag is real retaaarded
I'm shittin on all these haters like I'm rappin on the toiiilet
My wordplay is unique, its so sweet that I keep a cavity
So money is petite, my money defies laws of gravity
So quarantine the studio cuz gucci got a sick flow
Sicker than tuberculosis, I keep spittin these cancer verses
So please give me a cancer stick cuz I just fucked all over ya
My lunch they cost me half a brick cuz we ate in cambodia
Made seven million after taxes
Guess yall just have to practice
See the world through gucci glasses
Yep, I said gucci glasses
And if I had no daddy then that mean I'd be a bastard child
My pistol'll whip you like ya daddy
I'll smoke you like a black n mild

[Hook]

My flow so super-sweet, every verse I get a cavity
Drop meat so deep off in yo girl yo girlfriend wanna marry me
Mind so fuckin sick that they quarantined the studio
The diamonds in my ear clearer than a shot of julio
Gucci mane la flare got beef like Hardees
If grandaddy was livin I would buy grandad a harley
I am not a role model, like Charles Barkley
Yes I am a role model, everybody follow me
Follow me
Follow me
Everybody follow me
Obama called me yesterday and told me Gucci follow me (cool)
Follow me
Follow me
Everbody follow me
And if you wanna be a leader, I suggest you follow me
Nothing like a wise man
I'm fixed on the prize man
And if I told you you was dope than I would be a lyin man
Fire than the fire man
Hotter than the frying pan
And you would never see me homie, its like you a blind man

I started my own label cause I am my own man
You niggas are not a label
Yall too fuckin old, man
Go pick up some ol cats
Then pick up my ol facts
Then pick up my ol albums, study me and learn man
Gucci got a old soul
But he got that new swag
Jumpin out his rolls royce
Flexin on yall broke ass
I just got some mo problems cuz I got some mo cash
I just been out four months
Caught up with ya, blown past

[Hook]

My left wrist a hundred k, my right wrist two hundred though
My necklace cost 500 crack, earrings cost me 60 pack
20 on this pinkie baby where we at? 900 man
Hundred cash for pocket change so Ima rock a million
So icey's an army and you just a civilian
Seats are all reptilian, my girlfriend is sicilian
If I said I wasn't the best
I'd be lying to ya
If you asked me to be honest
I would say that I'm the truth
I'm the truth
I'm the truth
Just like my neice she snaggle-toothed
But still she so stupid-cute
You ask her she say unc the truth
Hear the verse so fuckin sick they quarantine the vocal booth
My auntie told me go home get rest, water and a lotta soup
Guuucciiii

[Hook]

[Intro]
Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ouh

[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

[Verse 2]
When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all and)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her: "I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world"
Ladies say: "I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
See, I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

[Electric Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else...

[Skit: Slim Shady, Eminem]

"Eminem..."
"No..."
"Eminem!"
"No..."
"Hahaha. Wake the fuck up, motherfucker."
"What do you want from me?!"
"Hahahaha. Remember me?"
"I killed you!"
"You thought I was dead, didn't you?"
"What do you want from me?!"
"I'm alive..."
"Oh, God..."
"Get up."
"No."
"Get up and look in the mirror."
"I don't want to!"
"Look in the mirror, it's just a reflection. Haha"
"Leave me alone!!!"
"Look in the mirror! You're nothing! You're nothing without me! Look in the motherfucking mirror!"
"Leave me alone!!! Leave me the fuck alone!!!"

[Eminem punches the mirror, breaking it.]

[Low Down, Dirty being scratched.]

[Intro]
—so, all of you Africans
All of you Africans that know how to do things that's working for other people
Y'all need to open your own business
Save your money, quit paying motherfuckers for jheri curls
Quit paying motherfuckers for perms
Save your money, start your own business
So these little Africans will have wa— places to work
This is our future right here!
This our future right here! (Right there)
This— (The new generation is goin'! The new generation!)
Hey, I'ma tell you right now
If— If— If I have to die today, for this little African right here to have a future, I'm a dead motherfucker! (You right! Respect!)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Wake up, jumped out my bed
I'm in a two man cell with my homie Lil 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
I'm only eighteen, so I'm a young buck
It's a riot, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck
But that's the life of a G, I guess
Eses way deep, shanked two in the chest
Best run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker
Uh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs
Getting that rep as a young hog
It ain't nothing like the street life
You better be strapped with your shank, 'cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots to do my time

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & Donny Hathaway]
Them say me grow up to be nothing
Look at me now and tell me what you see
I am what I am, it's only me
Little ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto street
Whatcha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Now I'm holding a dub, sitting on swoll
27 years old, up for parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money
That I'll be making soon as I touch the streets
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right
But it ain't no thang to me
'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed OG
The little homies from the hood with grip
Are the ones I get with 'cause I'm down to set trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what you wanna do?
Didn't know he had a twenty-two
Straight sitting behind his back
I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground with blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I used to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (For what?)
For trying to jack the little homies for they grip

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & Donny Hathaway]
Me learn many things from what me see from the street
The outcome of what I've come to be
Little ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto street
Whatcha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Something for the real OGs to get with
Some facts, made our made, now you runnin' but don't play
Like every single day, really, though
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamien, gaming them for my homie
No needing being calm if you pack right
And learning just enough to keep your sack right
Late nights, I wonder what they getting for?
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting for?
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a G ride, east side's where they swerve now
Not thinking about what's really going on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent four years in the county with nothing but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the Pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
'Cause you's a hustlin'-ass youngsta, clocking your grip

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & Donny Hathaway]
Now me finally grown as you can see, still an OG
For life and always remain to be
A little ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto street
Whatcha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?

[Hook: John Legend]
Take me to that old familiar place
Take me to memories we won’t erase
Take me to all that we had
Good and the bad
I’ll never forget you
I’ll never let you go
I’ll never forget you
I’ll always remember, I hope you know

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Let the record reflect the records we set
Best foot forward with every step
And let’s push towards it, never regress
And let’s remember, if ever we get
Down, the places that we came from ’round
And all the good times on the bad side of town
The upside of bad, flip it upside down
Came from the bottom but we up high now
Believe, and from this view we achieved
We looked back at the rules we received
And how we broke those, dismantled and rewrote those
And the ghost still alive in the photos
Sounds of the summer, day and go wise
Cold wind blowin’ through a city on fire
Moments of the past, came here to find you
Not to relive them, just to remind you

[Hook: John Legend]
Take me to that old familiar place
Take me to memories we won’t erase
Take me to all that we had
Good and the bad
I’ll never forget you
I’ll never let you go
I’ll never forget you
I’ll always remember, I hope you know

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And let the evidence show, the future’s so bright
It’s never been more, not like tonight
We walk into the glow, right into the light
The past all around us, the time of our life
The first love kisses, the broke heart disses
This is just like a first-class ticket
Back, to the first written rap
The crumbled-up paper and the pen with no cap
The hand-me-down clothes and the unturned hat
The hookers on the corner and the kids sellin’ crack
The needles in the yard where we used to play catch
Stories from the project we could never go at
Or to, these are shades of my youth
Trials of a child, everything truth
Moments of the past, comin’ back to find us
Not to relive them, just to remind us

[Hook: John Legend]
Take me to that old familiar place
Take me to memories we won’t erase
Take me to all that we had
Good and the bad
I’ll never forget you
I’ll never let you go
I’ll never forget you
I’ll always remember, I hope you know

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Everything cherished, remembered in my heart
So you will never perish, you will never part
I tell ‘em all about you, drummin’ in the park
We put you in the ground, but I see you in the stars
Go’n, take a bow, a round of applause
The best dad ever, always ready we are
Love always shines, that’s how I’ll find you
In case you forgot, I hope this reminds you

[Hook: John Legend]
Take me to that old familiar place
Take me to memories we won’t erase
Take me to all that we had
Good and the bad
I’ll never forget you
I’ll never let you go
I’ll never forget you
I’ll always remember, I hope you know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

[Verse 1]
I gave you honesty on my first joint
And y'all all came out
I showed you what change 'bout
Unroll your blunts, pour your champagne out
Dullers of the pain, so you can plainly see
The black man pain I campaign 'bout
God willing 'fore I wane, I take a champion route
Before I throw a bout: I'll walk out the game
While my fans in the stands is chanting my name out, Lupe
Uh, and it's going to be PPV, won't be back for free
Gone need scratch to see me rematch with me
My greatest enemy, is my inner me
So I take this urge and give you Revenge of the Nerd: Fahrenheit 1-15, uh
Yeah, and you know I fight the feeling
Box so I can shop, sometime it doesn't register
So I return to the ring, like Return of the King
With the habit of a hobbit it makes it hard to drop it
I'm a klepto stealing
And it gets the best
Just when I guess that I left those leanings
I be back on post in a trench coat scheming

[Chorus]
Much is more what we got in store
Just believe me, (than they can ever see)
Much more than they can see
Is how it'll always be, believe me

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, uh
So I get back into my stance, revert to my dance
With a shirt full of pants
And my accomplice got a purse full of pants
A pocket full of purses, with no intent to purchase in the plans
And we rehearsed it 'til it's perfect
Just to dodge the searchers of the man
Just to surface outside, then return of all the merch to stay
In the service of the perfect understand, uh, yeah
And I boost myself
So from the coal car to the caboose I'm felt
From the rear to the engineer
From the L to the Underground Railroad
From the redline to the TGV
A champion fighter for whom the bell tolls, L-U-P
Little engine from the hood, the hustler in me
Known to hit the track like John Henry
Just give me my glasses
My eight ounce Everlastes' and a Michael Buffer entry
Shoplifter, tag switcher
That's me, nigga I'm back with ya, uh

[Interlude]
Championship is here, yeah
F&F is here
1st & 15 is here
Madison street, we back in here
Chi-town is here
Lupe Fiasco
Fahrenheit 1/15
Revenge of the Nerds
Part II
Can we bring the hook back
Bring my girl Yummy back
Know what I'm saying, let 'em know that we still rolling
Know what I'm talking 'bout

[Chorus]

[Intro: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over, girl

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
I hear you knock, knock, knock, baby, come on up
I hope you got, got, got something in your cup
'Cause I'm three shots deep, and I ain't tryna sleep
Get your Redbull on 'cause I'm ready

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Posner]
You've been playin' hard to get with me all night
And we both know exactly what you want, right?
Don't tell me what you won't do, tell me what you gon' do
What you gon' do?

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this bow chicka wow wow, what you gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave but I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky-down, down, girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'ma make it sound like
I'ma make it sound like

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
You tryna make me wait, wait, wait 'til the second date
But I can't, can't, can't even contemplate
Waiting one more minute, let me jump in it
I brought you flowers and a teddy

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Posner]
You've been playin' hard to get with me all night
And we both know exactly what you want, right?
Don't tell me what you won't do, tell me what you gon' do
What you gon' do?

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this bow chicka wow wow, what you gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave but I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky-down, down, girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'ma make it sound like
I'ma make it sound like
Yeah, I can make it sound like

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
I got a leather couch, and a black mic
And we all alone, what it sound like?
The night was dead, we found life
I know I talk shit, but it sound right
You say you can't, but that's unfair
Gotta give something, something gotta give
I bet you love it, I win the bet
Now we laying up, hah, cigarettes

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
Now I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alright, girl, you know you like that
Oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa
Oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh
Say I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alright, girl, you know you like that
Oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa
Oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this bow chicka wow wow, what you gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave but I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky-down, down, girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'ma make it sound like
Yeah, I'ma, yeah, I'ma make it

[Outro: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over, girl

[Refrain]
Hello (Hello)
Allow me to introduce myself (Myself)
My name is Shady
It's so nice to meet you (It's so nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (Long time)
I'm sorry I've been away so long (So long)
My name is Shady
I never meant to leave you (I never meant to leave you)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You see that chick in the gym, checking me out?
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?
There's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man, I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh, jackpot, yeah—open sesame, mouth
Down the hatch, and the feeling—you can't match it
I rap-tat-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
Attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet
A knapsack packed with like forty-some Xanaxes
Shorty, come back, I'm tryna score me some lapdances
I'm 'bout to relapse, so, baby, pour me some Jack Daniel's
Formula 44D and 40s with bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back at ya

[Chorus 1]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
And are you menstruating, baby?
My little friend's waiting to say hello
The way your titties are wigglin'
And your booty's shakin' like jello
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello, yeah

[Verse 2]
My equilibrium's off—must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man—people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday, extra-curriculum
No reason in particular—it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
Fifty-one people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me, hun, but what is your name? Vivian?
I woke up next to you naked, and, uh, did we, um?
Of course, we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy, hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper, but there don't seem to be one
No offense, baby girl, I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package, and I'm cool—I immediately run
Like Speedy Gon-zales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of 3's—I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum

[Chorus 2]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
Do you happen to have anything on you
To make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello

[Verse 3]
Oh, those were the days—they certainly were
It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
Word-word, chk-word-word, chk-word, chk-chk-word
I second that and I third, rushed to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer getting them free—hundred bucks for these Percodans
Plus, it's getting to be where he'll lustfully search the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurtin' him
Tirelessly, on the phone trying to rustle up
Muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of Paxils
Now, he's doubling backwards, and he's stumbling back
Slipped and fell, hit his back, boom, heard something go crack
Now, he's up in the bathroom, like he's busting a nat
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm busting a rap
Resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it, I'm back!

[Chorus 2]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
Do you happen to have anything on you
To make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello

[Refrain]
And so I'm saying, "Hello" (Hello)
Allow me to introduce myself (Myself)
My name is Shady
It's so nice to meet you (It's so nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (Long time)
I'm sorry I've been away so long (So long)
My name is Shady
I never meant to leave you (I never meant to leave you)

[Outro]
Yeah, it's like starting over
Clean slate
Ha

[Verse 1]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never, never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, "No, no, no, n-nooo!"
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See, I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racin' time, where's the finish line?

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose

[Verse 3]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin', keep the loving goin'
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby, I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose

[Outro]
You lose, you lose
You lose, you lose

[Hook: André 3000]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
And I'm a star
Yea, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like hammers home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong
Oh, but you right if you just put a little ice on
And cut your mic on but you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra
I'm so not sober I'm high like a Hollywood
Coffee or soda, you can call me a roller
Hold up, your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different
What's the real sense of it?
Bling bling, I know and did you know
I'm the creator of the term, I just straightened the perm
They let it sit too long, they just makin' it burn
Make a movie of our lifestyle, but they earn
Like a dead body burned on the mantle piece
That's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease
And I be's the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze
Defrost on your window pane - Lil Wayne
But in Hollywood it's Litt-le Wayne, don't make me none
So that's why I got a pre-nup
I do

[Hook: André 3000]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Yeah, Yeah
A is for Adamsville
B is for Bowen Homes
See if I give a fuck if you like me you know I don't
If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve, I don't be on no curb
She ain't no junkie neither, I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep coming back three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap, she ain't know how to act
Now that I've got your undivided attention, I'm
Gonna say this and run under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest three fourth of it all
For what? So your kids, kids, kids can have some cheese
Can't get with it? Get, get, get, get, get on your knees
'Cause wealth is the word
Rich is round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? Shoot me a bird

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
(Starts off)
Tenth grade, the way was paved for me and Dre to create
Like Dr. Frankenstein of arts and crafts
Now could we make ah a difference
Antwan Patton and André Benjamin
Been jammin' for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed
Part two the sequel all new 'Kast
Just ain't the same gang of nerds on the internet
Slandering your name behind that screen name
They're lame and their life is pretty plain
M&M's with no nuts
Won't show up face-to-face straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin' to plot
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen
(Nigga please)
But even she can walk we'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes must be something bigger waiting

[Hook: André 3000]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
I do, love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, it's game time
Do you take this here as your lovely wife?
To love her and cherish her for all your life?
I solemnly swear to dare share and take you there
And me and you together, baby, we a lucky pair
It's been a long time, we walked a thin line
Others say they got you but you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence — is that right?
But you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growin' up, showin' up, blowin' up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me like a game of football
Used to feed me, need me, dress me
Now it's so messy straight cut out and left me

[Outro: André 3000 + Snoop Dogg]
Hollywood divorce
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talkin' about music
Everything else too
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over
But it's cool
We just keep it goin' and make new shit
Take our game, take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb that's a cold thang

[Produced by Mr. Porter]

[Intro: Eminem and Denaun Porter]
Denaun, what up, man?
What up, dawg?
You all right?
Chillin', cold as hell
Yes, it is. Hey, bus didn't come here, didn't he?
No. Hey look, you got 15 cent?
Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
We gotta go to the store. Alright, man?
Quick, ‘cause I'm short
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
Nah, look
You should just, how much you got there?
I only got 75, I'm sure I got a dollar, know what I mean?
Just throw it in there, they ain't gonna know. You know what? Ayy look, I'm sick of takin' this damn bus everywhere, man
You gotta make some moves or somethin'
I know, look, I'm tryna get rich
I got a baby on the way, I ain't even got a car. You know what I'm sayin'?
I still stay with my moms, 21 and still with my moms
Yeah, look, hey, we gotta make some hit records or somethin', you know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause I'm tired of bein' broke

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of havin' a turn to earn money to burn
Mappin' out my strategies to get rich, huh
My desire's like a scratch that needs to get itched, huh
'Cause, man, I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free
Nothin' is different to me, so what else is there to see?
I'll be the prisoner to flee from all of this misery
I'm not wishin' to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me for this and agree
You're missin' the key, you ain't even in the vicinity
Unconditionally, my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you, the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours, or a missionless course
When your shit is in the stores, 'cause you can be a star

[Hook: Eminem]
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh

[Interlude: Eminem and Denaun]
Em: You know what I'm sayin'? See what I'm talkin' about, man? ‘Cause that's it. Yeah.
A million dollars ain't even that far away, man.
De: Yo, we got to get the money, man!
I can't be broke for the rest of my life!
Em: Yeah, I hear what your sayin'. Look, there's got to be somethin' better, you know what I'm sayin'?
De: I can't live like this for the rest of my life, man.
Bummin' rides everywhere I go.
Em: Yeah, what's up with Lexus's and Land Cruisers?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yo, I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handlin' business
I'm cancelin' Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just
Choose the few that I trust
Them's the people that I still got
Fuck with gangsta Philpot, get your grill shot
The 5 Ela for life: my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through in the nine
My crew's true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or bein' wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man plannin' what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star

[Hook: Eminem]
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh

[Outro: Eminem and Denaun]
Em: That's what I'm talkin' about.
I'm not tryna be the player, I'm tryna be the mayor.
I want to be president.
De: Yo, forgot that president, man.
I'm tryna be king, makin' dead presidents.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Gettin' money any time I want, ownin' my own businesses and all that. You know what I'm sayin'?
Em: Yeah, I'm tryna be a millionaire, man.
De: Hahaha, but don't all, you know?
You only live once, '96, baby

[Intro]
As life goes on
I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
And I realize that everything I do
Is affecting the people around me
So I wanted to take this time out
To apologize for things that I've done
And things that haven't occured yet
And things that they don't want to take responsibility for

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry for the times that I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sitting home, just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect
I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I'm in the streets like every day
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl

[Chorus]
I understand that there's some problems and I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just tryin' to stay busy 'til you heard from Dad
When you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away

[Chorus]
I understand that there are some problems and I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me (Oh yeah)
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry that it took so long to see
That they were dead wrong tryna put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl tryin' to have fun
Her daddy should've never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage?
In a 21-and-older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame?
Verizon backed out, disgracing my name
I'm just a singer tryin' to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame

[Outro]
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you
And you can put that blame on me (On me)
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)
And you can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me

[Verse 1]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus]
Why she had to go? I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

[Verse 2]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Chorus]
Why she had to go? I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Outro]
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, hmm-hmm

[Verse 1]
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'ma set it straight, this Watergate
I can't stand rockin' when I'm in here
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fuckin' thorn in my side
Oh my god, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all, it's sabotage

[Verse 2]
So, so, so, so listen up, 'cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button
But, yo, I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now, I keep it on and on

[Verse 3]
'Cause what you see, you might not get
And we can bet, so don't you get souped yet
Scheming on a thing, that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage

[Pre-Chorus]
Whhhhhyyyyyy
(Our backs are now against the wall)

[Chorus]
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage

[Verse 4]
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm-a set it straight, this Watergate
But I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be – it's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage

[Intro]
(Oh no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no)
Haha, cut the music up please
(Oh no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no)
Hahaha, yeah

[Verse]
I play the bullshit from the backseat, champ
Yeah, I'm in the backseat, still got the seat back
Feet back, stay from where the fake be at
Niggas snitch for the shine, where the patience at?
Nigga make his own brother face his back
Give love, then take it back
Good grief, man, this world is quite heavy on my aching back
Cops killing for crack, you know the story, snakes eat rats
Face the facts, you can't change him
Can't shoot it if you can't aim it
Can't miss him, if he kill you, then you can't blame him
That's just how the dice roll when you can't fade 'em
Get too deep up in that water and they can't save you
Me, I come out of that water like I was just bathin'
And watch my step on the wet pavement, yeah
I'm from the hood, so I rep 'em where I can't take em
"Hollygrove, Hollygrove," was his last statement
So nigga, get that look off your face
And recognize you got a crook in the place
They call me W-E-E-crooked letter-Y, I'm so high
I skeet-skeet in any nigga dime like she's mine
Street-sweeper in the back of the hatch, make me pop the latch
Leave you bloody with the cops to match
Bullet holes in your speakers from the chopper blast
Like, haha, ah
That's bullet holes in your sneakers, got you hoppin' back
It all stop when they hit you in your top and back
No cockin' back, silly motherfucker, you ain't heard 'bout this
The clips hang down to the dick
That's an automatic shotty from a drum they call Tommy
Guaranteed to get you bitches from by me
When I hit every piece of your visible body, he leakin'
Mortimer is no longer leapin', he's sleepin'
While you pussy niggas is sleepin', I'm thinkin'
Deep in thought, the boy ain't even winkin'
Bob Marley got me stinkin'
Stackin' figures, I'm standing firm, life's a Slinky
Pipes is filled with crack cocaine
And the dope go inside of the veins
From where I came
Though I bear a name only one can live with
Coach, they won't knock me off my pivot, forget it
I'm sicker with it, pick a city, buy a condo
Find a fine ho, let some time go, chill
What you know about a bongo having her mind go
Over a convo about dough? Nothing
Man, the four-wheelers look so good on the sand
Tee or tank top, pocket fan
No pocketknife, no handgun in sight
Just that rat-tat, tat, tat-tat-t-tat-tat, boom
Haha, tonight, I might just boost my feature price
'Cause to each his own, and the lights is bright
And I'm feeling like Mike at a Tyson fight
I'm from Cita house, Big Mama's house
She told me to shoot you right after I knock you out
And he ain't gettin' up after them shots if you hit him in the right spot
Hold up, the beat might drop

[Outro]
(Oh no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no)
(Oh no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no)
Hello Brooklyn!

New York, New York - it's a hell of a town
You know The Bronx is up, and I'm Brooklyn down
Because they don't know my name - only know my initials
Building bombs in the attic for elected officials
I quit my job, I cut my hair
You know, I cut my boss because I don't care
You tried to get slick, you bust a little chuckle
You're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle
'Cause being as fly as me is something that you never thought of
You'll be stickin' up old ladies with the handgun or the sawed-off
I'm a buffalo soldier, broader than Broadway
Keep keepin' on, I don't care what they say
I play my stereo loud, I disturb my neighbors
I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor

'Cause I am the holder of the three-pack bonanza
If you open the book, then you will get your hand slapped
I am the keeper of the three-pack bonanza
If you ask a question, then you shall get the answer
Her breast, I saw, I reached, I felt
M, O-N, E-Y, the belt
I stay at home, just like a hermit
I got the jammy, but I don't got the permit (you know why)
You got a boyfriend, and his name is Nick
Annabelle caught with the shrimpy limp dick
I ride around town 'cause my ride is fly
I shot a man in Brooklyn ("just to watch him die")

[Verse 1]
Buffalo soldier, dreadlocked rasta
There was a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

I mean it, when I analyse the stench
To me it makes a lot of sense
How the dreadlocked rasta was a Buffalo Soldier

[Verse 2]
And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said it was a Buffalo Soldier, dreadlocked Rasta
Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America

[Verse 3]
If you know your history
Then you would know where you're coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the 'eck do I think I am

[Verse 4]
I'm just a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, in the war for America

Said he, woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!
Woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!

[Verse 5]
Buffalo Soldier troddin' through the land, wo-ho-ooh!
Said he want to ran and then you want a hand
Troddin' through the land, yea-hea, yea-ea

Said he was a Buffalo Soldier in the war for America
Buffalo Soldier, dreadlocked Rasta
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Driven from the mainland to the heart of the Caribbean

Said he, woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!
Woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!

[Verse 6]
Trodding through San Juan
In the arms of America
Trodding through Jamaica, a Buffalo Soldier
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock rasta

Woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!

[Intro]
Weed and syrup is the combination
And the inspiration is you pussy-ass niggas
I just realized y'all can't fuck with me
And you never will, bitch-ass niggas
Weezy F. Baby, believe that
Haha, yeah

[Verse]
I got them 24-inches, sitting on them Joe Buddens
And the trunk straight jumping, bitch, I can't hear nothing
Or I might do the Spurs, sitting on them Tim Duncans
And in that Lamborghini, I do donuts like Dunkins
How come every bad bitch with a pussy wanna fuck him?
But I just feed 'em drugs and just watch 'em fuck each other
My neck was a hundred, and my wrist was another
It make her pussy wet, I leave that bitch with a puddle
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I should rap with a muzzle
Peyton Manning flow: I just go, no huddle
Baby girl getting straight dick, no cuddle
You know I'm out this world, I just bought a space shuttle—
I'ma put some D's on that bitch
And these hoes starting to get like fleas on my shit
Have you seen her? Who? Nina, she's on my hip
Yellow-white diamonds, call it "cheese on them grits"
You niggas ain't balling
Real talk, you niggas can't guard me
Two niggas can't guard me, you looking at Jordan
From the side, like Spike at the Garden
I got the hardest bars, call me the warden
Yeah, excuse me, pardon
I break a bitch down like Tonya Harding
Bitch, I'm col', not dude off Martin
Pockets just fat like the Klumps and Norbit
Bitch, I'm fly like a magic carpet
And bitch, I'm fresh like a pack of Orbit
See, I'ma take it and go bring it back to New Orleans
And bitch, I'ma shine in the land of darkness
In which I'ma grind 'til my stacks is tall as a wall is
And I'm high, don't wan' know how deep the fall is
No, I can't come down
And every time I send my girl out of town—
I put some keys on that bitch
I'm a certified gangsta
Haters make me nauseous, the money make me anxious
Listen how my words are poetic like Langston
Dreads down my back like I come straight from Kingston
But I come from Hollygrove, seventeen, danger zone
So many C-notes, I can sing a song
T-top coupe, looking like a thong
Your girl love my dick, she treats it like a bong
I don't wan' be right if gettin' high is wrong
My eyes so low, I look like I'm from Hong Kong
Boy, I got more green than the Bishop Don Juan
OK, I'm not a rookie, I'm a pro... -methazine fiend
Make the homies say, "Ho!" and make all the girlies scream
I am a vegetarian, man, I only eat beats
Wear a lot of carats, and I smoke the best greens
No beef in my grocery bag
Just some Swishers and a whole bunch of cans of whoop-ass, ha
I'm strapped, like a bookbag
So anyone of y'all can come on and get a foot tag
D.O.A., ride all night
Sleep, no way—sleep when I lay
Six feet deep, and until that day
I'ma be living like it is that day
Yeah, I keep holding on
I said, "Bitch, I been hot; bitch, the stove been on"
If you don't like it, I roll over and roll along
Fuck you and the horse that you rode in on
Yeah, some cool shorts and my Kobes on
Looking slicker than the lane that you bowling on
If they ain't tell you I'm the shit, then they told you wrong
Bitch, I'm bubbling like soda foam in a Styrofoam... cup
You know what's in my styrofoam? "What?"
S-Y-R-up!
That's my car, yup—Vrooommmmm! Errr!
I'm gone

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
When I'm ridin', I'm high
Got my drink poured, my weed rolled
I creep slow, my bitch on my side and
Wherever that change go, this gang go
Some talk it, they lame though
Hoes on it, they want it, they say so
Whenever we roll by, So
Won't you jump yo pretty ass in my car, in my car (x4)
Girl

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
My car match what year it is
It's hard not to hear the shit
Just know I'm gone no matter what gear I'm in
Eyes closed when I'm steerin', blowin' O's out the window
Suede on the floor, doors plus the ceiling
And I keep it clean
Hoes wanna get in they gotta wipe they feet
Go over a few things then I'mma light this weed
Don't want no burn marks sweetheart
So hang it out the window
If you gotta fuck up once I get you outta here
Uh, I'm talkin' loud pipes and rally stripes
So much paper I mistake and have to count it twice
Yellow car come out at night, all the hoes be into it
Remote control starter, that bitch runnin' when I get to it
Watch yo bitches run up 'til they get to it
And girl there's only one you ain't gon' get two of it
So ride wit' the nigga gettin' high, sittin' 22 inches fly
Who the shit

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
When I'm ridin', I'm high
Got my drink poured, my weed rolled
I creep slow, my bitch on my side and
Wherever that change go, this gang go
Some talk it, they lame though
Hoes on it, they want it, they say so
Whenever we roll by, So
Won't you jump yo pretty ass in my car, in my car (x4)
Girl

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Smokin' on some taylor shit, lookin for a thirsty bitch
Ridin' on 26's, my pockets never empty
I'm high and always tipsy, ecstasy there plenty
Model chick, stripper bitch, I be fuckin' many
Every car paid cash, I don't pay no lease fee
But I get my dick sucked, Monica Lewinsky
Y'all niggas the toilet bowl, I do all the shittin'
Lamborghini flyin' doors, gone wit' the wings in
I pop a lotta pills, I pop a lotta seals
I pop a lotta pussy niggas that are not real
When you see my jewelry game, you gon' get the chills
Got hoes like Hilary and smoke like Bill
Bitch

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
When I'm ridin', I'm high
Got my drink poured, my weed rolled
I creep slow, my bitch on my side and
Wherever that change go, this gang go
Some talk it, they lame though
Hoes on it, they want it, they say so
Whenever we roll by, So
Won't you jump yo pretty ass in my car, in my car (x4)
Girl
She say “what’s happening?”
I say “wassup wassup”
She ask “whats up with me”
I say “whats up with us”
I say “what’s really good?”
I say “what’s really good?”
I put my love down
She say “it’s really good”
She say “it’s feeling good”
I say “I’m feeling better”
I make her say my name in Capital Letters
I’m a nasty guy
Dont ask me why
Just ask me how and I’ll show you proud
Her head is gone, she’s in the clouds
And when she rains, man she pours down
And I be the fella without an umbrella
Ma, you finer than a wine cellar

[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?

[Verse 1]
You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin', you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice I always hated
But lookin' back, it made me greater
You always told me forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I tryin'? Know you ain't buyin'
I tried to fight it back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yellin' at you and gettin' at you
Pickin' up dishes, throwin' 'em at you
Why are you speakin' when no one asked you?

[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you?

[Verse 2]
What are we doin'? Could you see through me?
'Cause you say, "Nicki," and I say, "Who, me?"
And you say, "No, you," and I say, "Screw you"
Then you start dressin' and you start leavin'
And I start cryin' and I start screamin'
The heavy breathin', but what's the reason?
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin', yo
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin' passive-aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay, you're right, just let it go
Okay, you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You could turn a free throw to a goal
Nigga got the peephole to my soul

[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you?

[Bridge]
Stop (Ooh)
Stop (Ooh)
Won't you just stop lookin' through me? 'Cause I can't take it
No, I can't take it (You see right)

[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
You see right through me
You see right through me, baby
You see right through me (Do that shit)
You see right through me (How do you do that shit?)
How do you do that? How do you do that?
How do you do that? How do you do that?

Now everything was gravy 'til yo' bitch came in
'Bout the same time that that thang kicked in
Now she ain't really pretty but she got a nice body
I'm geeked up thinkin this Buffie The Body
Ain't yo' name lil' Trina? Cause you look like Janet Jackson
I'm off three double stacks and I'm lookin' for that action
Gucci Mane, you stupid man I love the way you flowin
Ridin' in my drop but I don't know where I'm goin'
On two eighty five I keep ridin' in a circle
The inside of my ride smellin' like a pound of purple
"Gucci, show time!" Give me five mo' minutes
And a cold orange juice, cause I'm really really trippin'
Went to the strip club and requested "I'm Da Man"
The next thing you know I was throwin' rubber bands

But I wish I had a lie detector test right now
You say you married, well bitch you might be
But I bet your husband ain't icy like me
She stand on B.C. in my ashy black tee
With them dopeman Nikes and them Jordache jeans
I don't pay her but I still keep that thrax on me
I'm the shit in East Atlanta baby ask about me
Pop one pop two two halves that's three
Ain't no waffle house baby, hell I can't eat

Wearing Dolce's in the club cause you know the boy geeked
Drop the top on that thang let you see my seats

Sell kush by the bale so you kno might shit tight

I'm high like Fabo hood like Shawty
So tell me when to go like my name E-40
A rich rock star nigga I'm gonna party
Got a party pack of pills that's at least bout 40
I'll pour them in your hand like a bag of jelly beans
Take two of these pills, call me in the morning
Fifty thousand pills man I'm so real

Hey, what's up Gucci Mane, why you sweating so hard?

Shit, well, baby I might be...
But god damn, what is you doing? You jockin' a playa, you too chewy over here, right?
Look, I ain't K-Rab baby, you know what I mean
I'm not a piece of bubblegum, what I'm doing is not your business. But matter of fact, while you over here, is you a waitress or something? ’Cause the shit you got on make you look like you a waitress
So do what you do, aight. I'ma give you this hundred dollars. Go get you whatever you drinking, bring me and the clique about ten of them orange juices, five Crunk Juices and we'll be straight, how ’bout that
And is you straight? Is you single or is you married?

[Intro: Big, Lil' Kim]
Yeah, fuck you
Fuck you too
Fuck you bitch
Fuck you motherfucker
You ain't shit anyway, fuck you
You ain't shit, you fat motherfucker
Yeah, whatever whatever
Whatever
You wasn't sayin' that when you was suckin' my dick
You wasn't sayin that when you was eatin' my pussy
You nasty bitch
You a nasty motherfucker
Check it, uhh
(Crab ass nigga)

[Refrain 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue
You cut the hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (another bitch), in my life

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uh-huh, uhh, uhh
I know he don't treat you like I treat you
Time to explain your game is see-through
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try
Like this y'all, my girl sucked another nigga dick, y'all
Light skinned with the chromed out six, y'all
Thought they was creepin', took trips to V-A every third weekend
While you was sleepin', he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine code non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trial
Where I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you was my right thing
Then things got frightenin'
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold-digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man Jigga, my ace boon coon
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon
Now I'm like Brandy, Sittin' in My Room
Pissy drunk listenin' to Stylistics tunes
Or the O'Jays, thinkin' 'bout the old days
My nigga's like, fuck that bitch, go play
Baller, when she beep you, don't call her
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula
She was askin' 'bout ya whereabouts
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight
We'll be all fuckin' tonight, knahmean?!
(I'm fuckin' you toniiight..) feel me? Uhh

[Refrain 2: Lil' Kim]
What do ya do when your man is untrue
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new
I need another man, in my life

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Mmm, uhhh, uhhh!
'Member when you said you would die for me, shit
All of that was just lies to me
Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me
Now you cry for me, like Jodeci
It's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all
Black nasty and mad fat y'all; shoulda seen the ho
Nigga pack your shit, you out the do', ohh
What about the fight in The Mirage?
I seen ya Benz parked outside my sister's garage
Said it was your friend Rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin' up wit the bullshit
And still I, never sweat these bitches
Q.B. hang like plaques on the wall in your pictures
Scale them fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin' your heat in the passenger seat of the Nautica Jeep
We've been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin' to hold on
Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin'
Girls steady screamin', "Kim you need to leave him!"
When I testified in court
Couldn't think straight thinkin' 'bout the bitches I fought
Over you, nigga have the shit you bought
And fuck you, movin' is my last resort
You see, nine outta ten niggas ain't shit
One outta five niggas suck a dick
You're mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me
Shoulda kept the freak bitch off my canapé
Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine
Long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this
When I sucked your dick, it's like smokin' a roach
Uhh, why go from first class to coach

[Refrain 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue
You cut the hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (another bitch), in my life

What do ya do when your man is untrue
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new
I need another man, in my life

Atta girl gon’ wild, pop a bottle
Bow, bow, bow…

Bring the 1738 Champagne the boss
Watch you getting money make it rain buy a bottle
Pop a cork, dork

I pop bottles but I don't pour
Save the glass for guys who balling on a budget
Fuck it, let your glasses rise
I’m straight to the head with mine, why you acting surprised
Ask any ho who know me, all I do is smash and ride
Buckets of bubbly, shake it up and let it splash in the eyes
Ain't no subtraction, only cash to divide
We getting money, bank roll, super-sized
Whether rain, sleet, sunny
Let the good times roll and the bottles keep coming

[Chorus: T.I.]

Man, probation is a bitch but going back is not an option
We be sonning all these niggas, put their ass up for adoption

We be working all night, telethon shit
Roll a super skinny one, Chanel Iman shit
Oooh, that's that fire, that have you calm shit
You with a lot of dudes, that’s that Elton John shit
Ahh, To each his own, I like a freak that's grown

I know the sucker wish the judge threw the book at me
Cause I show up to the club, super cool, look at me
Everything brand new, you get money like who?
Spent 150 on my car and my Audemars too
When I walk up in the spot, ain't nobody saw you
They see me like “there he go”
Look at you like ” ahh who?”
Bought every bottle at the bar
Shortie you know how I do
I take them all across your noggin', I ain't finna argue
Still big shit popping, nothing changed but my clothes
Triple digits in my pocket, rubber band bank roll
Tell the bitch I take you places where your man can’t go
Can’t be, he ain't doing shit, if he ain't me
Can't you see the difference between us when I walking to the door
Your twenty thousand worth of ones, start letting money go
Let it fly, throw some twenty when my one running low
50 stack, I’m a show you how to ball: triple that
Rasta dem king of the jungle
Dread lock swing down me back like Repunzel
My bred'dren sling dem pack an' dem bundle
We'll take your tings, sell it back to your uncle
And we'll make it rain till your dances will come true
We'll make it rain so you betta bring a swimsuit
Alone when I came, but I'm leavin with them two
Gals give me brain, give me brain like temples
And him got the game, game sharp like a pencil
And if you want formage we can crash like a symbol
And Let prepare me window, on my new sports coupe
Twelve hoarses in the hood, sittin on hoarse shoes
Come from the land that Jesus walked through
Sacrifice me life, man I bleed for me uncle
Them no want to run, run with me them no want to
Murder them, and the family them belong to
Next ting them kno I run a street like a car door
You go after me, me I dearly depart you
Hip hop is mine now, Mine what you gone do?
I can jump on any nigga song and make a part two
Playtime for me, cuz see to me, they are cartoons
How come every joint be on point like a harpoon?
How come evry bar stand strong like a barstool?
How come every line is so raw you gone snort too?
Murder them. Man I murda them. Fuck a competition, man I murda them
Man murda them. Man I murda them. Fuck a competition, man I murda them
And that is why I'm hot
Its Da Drought 3, Welcome
Have fun!

[Hook: Karma & Lil Wayne]
Only once the drugs are done (Hahaha)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Heheh, C3, hello)
Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, hello)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Get lifted)
Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, I get lifted)
Yeah, yeah, so get lifted, yeah
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Yeah, haha)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Karma]
I am sittin' on the clouds
I got smoke coming from my seat
I can play basketball with the moon
I got the whole world at my feet
Playin' touch football on Marijuana Street
Or, in a marijuana field, you are so beneath my cleats
Get high, so high
That I feel like lying
Down in a cigar, roll me up and smoke me
'Cause (I feel like dying) hahaha

[Hook: Karma & Lil Wayne]
Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, yeah)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only once the drugs are done (Haha, yeah)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Hahahaha)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & Karma]
Swimmin' laps around a bottle of Louis the XIII
Jumping off of a mountain into a sea of codeine
I'm at the top of the top, but, still I climb
And if I should ever fall, the ground will then turn to wine
Pop, pop
I feel like flying
Then I feel like frying
Then (I feel like dying)

[Hook: Karma & Lil Wayne]
Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only once the drugs are done (Hahaha)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Psst!)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Karma]
I can mingle with the stars, and throw a party on Mars
I am a prisoner locked up behind Xanax bars
I have just boarded a plane without a pilot
And violets are blue, roses are red
Daisies are yellow, the flowers are dead
Wish I could give you this feeling
I feel like buying
And if my dealer don't have no more
Then (I feel like dying) yeah

[Hook: Karma & Lil Wayne]
Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only once the drugs are done (Hahaha)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying

[Si Phili]
"Yo. Yo. Yo."
Cause I'm this, Gorillaz from the mist lyricist and my thoughts be twisted
I spit the wickedest rhymes from a time that's never existed
My futuristic linguistics turn fools into statistics
I'm a lyrical misfit with the sadistic characteristics
I perform murderous acts on my tracks with a single breath
And if a boy wanna phi test, then I be stampin' upon his chest
Done makin' a mess - Not a man could conceive the weed I'm consumin'
And I transform from my cartoon pseudonym, turn to a human
I spit words from my mouth that be turnin' you inside out
And I tie knots in intestines just like I'm a boy scout
That's workin' 'em out - Now rearrangin' your whole skeletal structure
Then I find some nine inch nails to perform some acupuncture
When I punch ya, I rupture one of your rib cage in a rage
And I turn you into a cartoon toon and erase the page
I take you back to the stone age with Barney and Fred Flinstone
Get Dino to tear your Moschinos and then force you to limp home

[Life]
I'mma take off like a jet pack with the get back, rather step back
I'mma make the crowd react and nod they heads until they neck snap
I can flip raps while riding a skateboard and doin' a tic-tac
And leave your head in a spin like starin' at turn table skid mats
I'm a concrete lion, big cat - this is real talk, not big-chat
Did ya get that, cause I ain't no small timer - I rhyme on big tracks
Now fell the vibes I create, this heavy weight, I'm about to detonate
And demonstrate how I generate lyrics that supernaturally levitate
To the top of my lyrics escalate, accelerate and leave you panickin'
Take the ground from beneath your feet, leave you Skywalk-in' like Anakin
I'm sharper than the tips of Zulu spears and Olympic javelins
My style is totally buckwild and most definitely happenin'
To your brains I be tappin' in, to computers I be hackin' in
To me, I be out of this world like aliens who were time travelin'
I'm dabblin' in the Fists of Fury technique when I speak
Forget Karate Kid and these wooden blocks, I chop through concrete
Concrete, concrete, concrete!
Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha!

[Si Phili]
I been stoned; ever since the days of creation, I've been red
I'm a mad dread, causin' so much havoc in Russel's head
My lyricism is just like an aneurysm inside his brain
He plays the beat in a trance and he's never feeling no pain
I could never be a racist because I possess so many faces
I'm one of those beat-up bad wit' bags and a pair of braces
With lines longer than laces - I'm gracin' you with my presence
The lyrics went flippin', makin' ya bubble like effervescence
I pulverize and bamboozle, shake numb skulls like a boodle
I smashed the top of your head with a guitar I borrowed from Noodle
I'm as animated as Japanese animes causin' calamities
Some serious savory from my roarous rhymes of reality
At the speed of sound, I'm wanderin' around - The clown done tried to defeat us
Without tenacities it's an audacity that you ever thought you could beat us
Beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us
Beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us
Beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us...

[Intro]
Rollout, rollout
Rollout, rollout
Rollout, rollout
Rollout, rollout

[Chorus]
(Rollout) I got my twin Glock forties (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that
(Rollout) Twin Glock forties (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that

[Verse 1]
Now, where'd you get that platinum chain with them diamonds in it?
Where'd you get that matchin' Benz with them windows tinted?
Who them girls you be with when you be ridin' through?
Man, I ain't got nothin' to prove, I paid my dues, breakin' the rules, I shake fools while I'm takin' a cruise
Tell me who's your weed man, and how do you smoke so good?
You's a superstar, boy, why you still up in the hood?
What in the world is in that bag? What you got in that bag?
A couple of cans of whoop ass, you did a good-ass job of just eyein' me, spyin' me

[Chorus]
(Rollout) I got my twin Glock forties (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that

(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that

[Verse 2]
Man, that car don't come out until next year, where in the fuck did you get it?
That's eighty thousand bucks gone, where in the fuck did you spend it?
You must have eyes on your back 'cause you got money to the ceilin'
And the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin', the better I'm feelin', the more that I'm chillin', winnin', drillin' and killin' the feelin'
Now, who's that bucked naked cook fixin' three course meals?
Gettin' goosebumps when her body taps the six inch heels
What in the world is in that room, what you got in that room?
A couple of gats, a couple of knives, a couple of raps, a couple of wives, now it's time to choose

[Chorus]
(Rollout) I got my twin Glock forties (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that
(Rollout) Twin Glock forties (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that

[Verse 3]
Are you custom made, custom paid, or you just custom fitted?
PlayStation 2 up in the ride, is that Lorenzo-kitted?
Is that your wife, your girlfriend or just your main bitch?
You take a pick, while I'm rubbin' the hips, touchin' lips to the top of the dick and then, "Whew"
Now, tell me who's your housekeeper, and what you keep in your house?
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in your mouth?
What in the world is in that case, what you got in that case?
Get up out my face, you couldn't relate, wait to take place at a similar pace, so shake, shake it

[Chorus]
(Rollout) I got my twin Glock forties (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that
(Rollout) Twin Glock forties (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that

[Outro]
Get out my business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business, ah
'Cause these niggas all up in my shit
And it's my business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business
'Cause it's mine, oh, mine
My business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business
'Cause these niggas all up in my shit
And it's my business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business
'Cause it's mine, oh, mine
Ah, ah, Timbaland, Ludacris
Disturbing Tha Peace (Woo)

Yeah, uh, c'mon, what's up? What's up? Come here (Ugh)
Come here, go to sleep (Uh)
Go to sleep right now (Ahh), right now (Ugh)
Go to sleep, go to sleep
Go to sleep (Ah-uhh)
Go to sleep (Ahh)

[Chorus]
When a woman loves
She, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real

[Verse 1]
She took me back
After I broke her heart
About a thousand times
She gave her life to me
With no regrets, she followed me
And she, and she, the girl, she raised me
And I'm forever indebted
And I'm forever indebted
I'm forever indebted to her 'cause...

[Chorus]
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real, oh

[Verse 2]
She filled my soul
With the very touch of her hand
She really did
And she’s got more, more faith in me than a beach got sand
And I'd like to tell her, I'd like to tell her
That I’m forever indebted
That I’m forever indebted
I’m forever indebted to her 'cause...

[Chorus]
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
See, a woman's love, it will never die, no
Even when I’m dead and gone
I’m gonna love her from the sky
'Cause she’s given me
Something that no other woman has given me
Woo-hoo, when I think about the girl, it makes me sing

[Chorus]
When, when, when, when, when a
When a, woman, loves
She loves for real, oh
When a woman loves, loves, loves
I'm telling you when she loves
She, she loves for real, yeah

[Outro]
Woo-hoo
When she loves (when she loves)
When she loves (when she loves)
When she loves (when she loves)
Oh, When she loves (when she loves)
When she loves (when she loves)
When she loves (when she loves)
She (when she loves)
She (when she loves)
She loves for real
Thank you

[Intro]
Yeah, boy
Dem better ring the alarm, boy
Dem know what's comin', boy
Buck! Buck! Buck! Haha
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh my God, fuckin' bomboclaat
I'm hard as Kenard, the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire
Tie a whore up with barbed wire, you're nothing but a bra, boy
I'm the real deal, and charbroil her on the bonfire
And bon voyage, bitch, I'm like Chef Boyardee
In this bitch, send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for you, boy, you think you're Tom Sawyer
'Til I pull you out the fuckin' storybook and stomp on ya
Fuckin' fictitional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction, it's fact, boy, beware, it's real
Them lyrics you wield equal zero to a hero's shield
Mr. Fly-By-The-Seat-Of-His-Pants parasail
Fall, hit the trampoline, bounce and grab a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearin' zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no, nada
Like your father fuckin' your mother

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me

[Verse 2]
Boy, I'm the Real McCoy, you little boys can't even fill voids
Party's over, kids, kill the noise, here come the killjoys
Me and Dre the steel alloys, the Rap Crown Royals
Who scalp cowboys, now, how that sound for you?
Yeah, boy, you know we're 'bout to put it down for you
So kick your shoes off in the foyer, have a sound voyage
And sayonara, see you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&R and marinate in some marinara
And have a Coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar
Of whip-ass on ya, that's the last straw you're hopin' to draw
Yeah, you're fresher than most, boy, I'm just doper than all
Boy, I'm that boy, boy, them boys, them no up to par
I just show up, go up to the stage and blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do, boy, I'm a star
Boy, I told you, boy, I'm a soldier boy, I'm Deshaun
Holton in this bitch, I'm the proof, boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy you, boy, fuck around and blow you to sod
Oh my God, boy, you didn't go there, no, you did not
I got a whole storyboard for you, boy, you're the plot
You're gettin' got, whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology not accepted, boy, Detroit is a rock
We get to beefin', ain't no tellin' at what point it'll stop
All I got to do is point to the spot when the bomb drops
Boy, does it drop and when it does, boy, there's a problem

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me

[Verse 3]
Boy, don't jinx yourself, boy, I'm Micheal Spinks with the belt
Stringer Bell, boy, my name rings bells for itself
I'm sick as hell, boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringin' hell, boy, singin' telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy on them sedative meds who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy in a black and red little sweater
Back, better than ever, the cheddar shredder, the grater
The beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later
Givin' haters incubators, think you made a mistake
By sayin' Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin' place to Beirut in a day
So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit? Couldn't agree with you more
If you were to say that my fuckin' shit doesn't stink
Shady-fuckin'-Aftermath, boy, the ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fuckin' water 'til we fill up the tank

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me

[Intro: Travie McCoy]
Gym Class Heroes. Cool and Dre
This is. You silly for this one
Whats wrong with me? Its Travie
Why you doing this to me? Ha ha

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
I started rappin, back of the class, scribbling tracks in hopes
That one of my jokes a have the pretty young things laughing
A chubby little bastard with a nack for little debbie snacks
But what I lacked in looks I made up for it in passion
No advance and plus we make it happen
And ya concious more obnoxious in that laffy taffy snappin
Goodbye yesterday's rags, hello high fashion
Years before you's a man, then built a castle with sand
With no regards for tidal waves I finally established
Til water comes in gallon drums and wipes away my palace
But now I'm sitting lovely off in wonderland with Alice
With purple people passing me at the caterpillars chalice
Ha ha, you probably thinking I'm wrong right
Like I should quit writing these songs right
Tell you what, do it better I just might
Take it back to 86 you wanna lick sike

[Bridge 1: Travie McCoy]
Don't let the tv mislead you, me and you dude we are not equal
Fuck you this is for my people, fuck you this is for my people
Don't try to hide like I can't see you
Your parents must a been trans you so see through
Fuck you this is for my people, fuck you this is for my people

[Hook: Travie McCoy]
Put up ya peace sign put ya index down
Put up ya peace sign put ya index down
Put up ya peace sign put ya index down
Put up ya peace sign put ya index down

[Verse 2 :Busta Rhymes]
Before I utter words and before I start to begin
Let me make sure you clear I'm about securring the win
I puzzle up my words while I piece another concoction
Cause I'm stubborn with the thought that failure is never an option
I grinds like a carpenter til my calluses bleed
With the passion from my heart to the many mouths that I feed
That's why I look at most of you stupid I know its odd
Because you can't really do nothing to me unless you God
Well being that none of you ain't him
You can't fuck with me now watch me erase them
Now trust me see I'm so determined
I'm walking through the heap of gauntlets how the fire was burning
Or how the tire was turning on the rim of the V
I laugh and shake it off the shit they be doing to me
With all the yappin and talking and so and so
You think that you could ever stop the kid OH NO

[Bridge 2: Busta Rhymes]
So if you get in my way, you know you done son
You best believe what I say, you better run son
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
You better kneel down and pray, cause where I come from
We going hard everyday, that's how the fights won
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Put up the peace sign put the index down
Put up the peace sign put the index down
Put up the peace sign put the index down
Put up the peace sign put the index down

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
Look mom no hands (no hands)
Your little boys a man (god damn)
Everything you said is finally setting in
The training wheels fell off and I kept pedaling
Now I'm riding wheelies on this industry
Say the word and I'll ghost ride this bitch instantly
Good looking pop all the strength that you giving me
Wasn't for you GymClass would be history
I'm on my upstate shit
I was Brooklyn broke but now I'm upstate rich
Getting brain from two dames with french accents
I don't mess with local chicks I get em upstate shipped
Ha, you probably thinking I'm wrong right
Like I should quit writing these song right
Tell you what, do it better I just might
Take it back to 86 you wanna lick sike

[Bridge 3: Travie McCoy]
Now its a lot of y'all that can't stand me
Cause my resemblance to Prince is uncanny
But fuck you this is for my family, fuck you this is for my family
Upstate New York to Miami, Up late recording in my jamies
I do it for my family, fuck you this is for my family

[Extended Hook: Travie McCoy]
Put up the peace sign put the index down
Put up the peace sign put the index down
Put up the peace sign put the index down

Put up the peace sign put the index down
Put up the peace sign put the index down
Put up the peace sign put the index down
Put up the peace sign put the index down

[Hook]
Uh yea bitch I’m balling, bitch I’m balling
Bet you nigga, he ain’t balling (like me)
Yea, bitches choosing and they calling
Cause I’m balling said they wanna fuck a nigga (like me)
And my niggas paid, they ain't never gotta pay (like me)
Yea bitch I’m balling, bitch I’m balling
Bet you nigga, he ain’t balling (like me)

[Verse 1]
Uh, Tyga stripe, rally paint
I’m the shit, bitch let it stink (let it stink)
Rinse your eyes with my holy water, I ain’t gone take her
I know that’s his only daughter, nigga whatchu thinkin?
This that big bang rapper balling, huh
I don’t even drink, but she alcoholic
Baby sip it 'til it’s gone (yea I know it)
Uh, cash like coke, bitches gotta blow it
So put your number on this paper, I promise I’ll call
No, I can’t called bitch I’m lying, I don’t use my phone, shit
Shit is on silent all day long
I don’t need no interruption when I’m making you moan
Early morn, wake up, then you yawn
Breakfast in bed, waffles and a little head, Roscoe’s
Chickens and waffles instead, and right back to this balling shit
Cause I’m balling, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Uh, hotel suite, presidential
Fuck you bitching what you been through
I got two doors homie, one side for my clothes
Another side for my big shoes
Now that’s balling, don’t think that’s balling?
Motherfucker how would you know it, if you’ve never done it
I turned my engine on loud, wake the neighbor, honey
Life like chocolate when you getting money
Rain, rain dollar bills in my dreams
Bitches fighting for me like it’s Jerry Spring’
But this the Summer, Winter, they falling for me
Colder than a coca cola polo, 7 degrees
You know you watch T.V , separate your mind, please
If you’re the bomb bitch, why you tryna tick with me
Remove your top, time to pop
She said she like it rough, so I beat it up, pussy punch

[Verse 3]
King Lazareth, living on that lavish shit
Lose your mind, lose your sense
Pay attention, yea you feeling me
Fill my cup high as trees, relax feel the breeze
All jokes aside, got a mistress on the side
If you riding for me then you gone ride or die
Ruff Ryder Volume 2 my love
If you wanna party, got a party bus
Capacity us, full moon, brandy glass
So loosen your Gucci baby, lemme spank that ass
Taste so good, blueberry, Raspberry
Berry cherry, whip cream on that twat
You can applaud that, terminator, I’ll be right back
Say my name, Tyga man, screaming so loud, like I know you can

[Hook]

[Outro]
Sound so good; make you wanna slap your Momma
Young Money, Tyga Tyga, nigga

[Verse]
Now little Terry got a gun he got from the store
He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed the candy shop, told her lay down on the floor
"Put the cookies in bag, take the pennies out the drawer!"
Little Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist, a mask on his face
Prays five times a day and listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck into school in his black book bag
His black nail polish, black boots, and black hat
He going to blow away the bully that just pushed his ass
Little Joker got a gun he bought on the street
To go and kill the niggas that beat him up last week
Cause he don't let go of none of his past beefs
Bullets flying out the window, shells landing on the seats
Little Sarah got a gun from her Uncle Sam
She got armor-piercing rounds and her gun don't jam
She got laser-guided rockets, she killing to go to college
She thought it was an insurgent, it was some old man
Now, you can get guns on the internet
AK's, Glock nines, intratecs
So when you see shorty don't disrespect
Watch 'A Better Tomorrow' and play Grand Theft Auto
Hear a bang

[Verse 1]
I don't know if all boy scouts are gays
They could probably "tie the knot" in like fifty different ways
Got a safe full o' cherries, 'cause I pop it and lock it
A girl's like a fridge, once a week you should stock it
Girl, if you're into rimmin', it's only safe if you're swimmin'
But girl, don't sit on that couch, 'cause I treat my objects like women
I spit fire like I just blew a demon
My shit's so hot I'll leave your toilet bowl steamin'
I'm gonna tear it, like the cards of the gypsies
You'll bleed for so long you'll get monthly ellipses
And if your pants are loose, I'll replete ya
You're a first time vegan and it's nice to meet ya

[Hook]
I'm Bo yo
I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you're better, you're not
Don't need a sweater, I'm hot
I'm a real G, shawty, that can really find your G-spot
Whoa, yeah
Hey...what the fuck's a G-spot?

[Verse 2]
Go to a vagina orchard, count 1, 2, 3
Spin that plant around, you got a third world country
That's right, consider yourself warned
I'm offensive and creative like handicapped porn
You're playing with your breasts, excuse me, can I try it ma'am?
You're pushin' em together like a titty Venn diagram
Look at that crack! Excuse me can I buy a gram?
Right below your diaphragm, ass looks like you're hidin' ham
First base, we're makin' out
Second base, I'm gettin' faked out
I said, third base, I'm gettin' take out
And I'd try to take it home if I knew I'd take it out
But I just don't know, I said I just don't care
I said my flow's so cold I need a tampon from a polar bear
And you can spell and smell my stink
B.O. lingers and it makes you think

[Hook]
I'm Bo yo
And I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you're better, you're not
Don't need a sweater, I'm hot
I'm a real G, shawty, that can really find your G-spot
Whoa, yeah
Provided that you point me in the general direction
Well, get ready

[Verse 3]
'Cause girls are like donuts when I be bustin' Bo nuts
I can make 'em cream-filled or give them a layer of glaze
I'm like Doug's friend Skeeter whenever I meet her
Because I skeet her so hard people call her Patty Mayonnaise
(Oh! Nickelodeon and cum!)
(What?)
Yo, I'm blowin' up like I thought I would
I'm circumcised, 'cause I don't cum from the hood
My girl is epileptic 'cause she's the one I'm jerkin' with
Come on, you Asian child laborer, show me what you're workin' with... (ooh, large machinery?)

'Cause there's an inverse relationship between respect and sects
I'm talking about religious sects like a Mormon sect
That says you can't have sex with members of the different sects
But you can't have sex with members of the same sex
So if the sects can't be different, the sex can't be same
Then the only sex left is some left hand shame
And girl I left you 'cause you left the game
And if that don't feel right then you can write my name

[Hook]
'Cause I'm Bo yo
And I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you're better, you're not
Don't need a sweater, I'm hot
I'm a real G that can really find your G spot
Whoa, yeah
Oh, but I'm inadequate
Have I gotten that point across yet? (how original)

[Verse 4]
Yo, my junk's so long that it hangs and swings
So at the nude beach, people think I'm lookin for lost rings
Play the skin flute, your big boy sings
If you want to take it all wear African neck rings
(They make your neck longer, cause, um um... fuck it.)

Haters call me gay, but that ain't hatin'
Cause I'm not homophobic, my morals are straight, and
If I'm in the closet then you are below me
Takin' the b-a-t out of basement, homie, yeah
Yo, yeah, what

[Hook]
'Cause I'm Bo yo
And I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you're better, you're not
Don't need a sweater
I'm a real G, that can really find your what now?
Oh, yeah, well I'm Bo yo, yo, what
I'm representing you
I'm representing the people from the 01982, yo
Oh, yeah, what
Yo, motherfucker, tinkle
Yeah

[Intro: Kanye West & Lil Wayne]
I'm cold (Yeah)
I'm cold (Yeah)
I'm cold (Yeah, yeah)

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite, 'cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
Ooh, how did you get there?
'Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell, yeah

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I got my life and it's my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So good night, I'm headed out the door
Door, door, door, door
After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
And that, you know

[Chorus: Kanye West]
That, you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Okay, I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gon' do mine
You do you 'cause I'm just gon' be fine
Okay, I got you out my mind
And the night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well, now you know

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell everybody, everybody that you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite, 'cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
Ooh, how did you'd get there?
'Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell, yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Baby girl, I'm finished, I thought we were committed
I thought we were cemented, I really thought we meant it
But now we just repent it, and now we just resent it
The clouds is in my vision, look how high that I be getting
And it's all because of you, girl, we through
You think your ish don't stank, but you are Mrs. P-U
And I don't see you with me no more
Now tell everybody that you know, that you know

[Chorus: Kanye West]
That, you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know
That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know

[Intro: Mr. Fantastik & (MF DOOM)]
Yo! (Yo!)
MF DOOM (Mr. Fantastik)
Mr. Fantastik (Villain)
What up, nigga? (Ain't nuttin; what's the word?)
What's cracking, boy? (Same ol' shit, kid)
Man (Different day, you know?)
These rap snitches, man, shit is bugged out, man
What the fuck, man? (Shit, you telling me)
Niggas running their mouth, telling e'rything, e'rything (Critical)

[Chorus: Mr. Fantastik, Mr. Fantastik & MF DOOM]
Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
"Do you see the perpetrator?" Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years, uh
Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
"Do you see the perpetrator?" Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years

[Verse 1: Mr. Fantastik]
Type profile low, like A in Paid in Full
Attract heavy cash cause the game's centrifugal
Mr. Fantastik, long dough like elastic
Guard my life with twin Glocks that's made out of plastic
Can't stand a brown-nosing nigga, fake ass bastard
Admiring my style, tour bus through Manhattan
Plotting, plan the quickest, my flow's the sickest
My hoes be the thickest, my dro the stickiest
Street nigga, stamped and bonafide
When beef jump niggas come get me cause they know I ride
True to the ski mask, New York's my origin
Play a fake gangsta like an old accordion
According to him, when the D's rushed in
Complication from the wire, testimony was thin
Caused his man to go up north, the ball hit 'em again
Lame rap snitch nigga even told on the Mexican

[Chorus: Mr. Fantastik, Mr. Fantastik & MF DOOM]
Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
"Do you see the perpetrator?" Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years
Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
"Do you see the perpetrator?" Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
True, there's rules to this shit, fools dare care
Everybody wanna rule the world with tears for fear
Yeah, yeah, tell 'em tell it on the mountain hill
Running up they mouth bill, everybody doubting still
Informer, keep it up and get tested
Pop through your bubble vest or double-breasted
He keep a lab down south in the little beast
So much heat you woulda thought it was the Middle East
A little grease always keeps the wheels a-spinning
Like sitting on twenty threes to get the squealers grinning
Hitting on many trees, feel real linen
Spitting on enemies, get the steel for tin men
Where no brains but gum flap
He said his gun clap, then he fled after one slap (Pap!)
Son, shut your trap, save it for the bitches
Mmm, delicious, rapp snitch knishes

[Outro: Mr. Fantastik & (MF DOOM)]
You know what I'm saying? (It's terrible)
Crazy, man, I'm just analyzing this whole game
This is bugged out, man, niggas is snitching
Telling on they own self (It's a horror, yo)
Fuck around and get everybody bagged, man
(Atrocities) Fuck around and get yo mama bagged, nigga
You know your grandmama used to be bootlegging
Fake hustling nigga, heheheheh, haha
Perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here...

[Intro]
Hey, let's have some fun this time

[Chorus: Kid Cudi, Kid Cudi & Mary J. Blige]
Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please, please don't play this song
R-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right
Trying to get my mind, my mind, my mind, right, right
People think they really being helpful
By telling me please be careful, yeah right
R-r-right, r-right, right, right
Please, please don't play this song
Yeah, haha

[Verse 1]
Pain, hurt, sadness, and loneliness
Balled all that shit right up
Tossed it away to the bottomless pit
The part of my mind that slips
And the part of my mind so sick
I don't even like to take the trip unless I'm sloppy drunk
I pray for my mom, how a teach had a son
That never gave a fuck about a scantron?
All I wanted was to be a human being
And show all the world some new colors and scenes
Imagine all types of beautiful scenery
I remember when I first had trees
Smoked out a Black and Mild, so dumb of me
Now, I'm grape Cigarillo man
Any young black kid, guaranteed fan
Hold it down, humble pie on the humble
And I treat normal girls like models
Reckless and young, and my, my mom's calling
Think I should hit decline
I'm numb faced while I'm thinking 'bout suicide

[Chorus: Kid Cudi, Mary J. Blige, Kid Cudi & Mary J. Blige]
Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please, please don't play this song (Please don't play this song)
R-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right (Right)
Trying to get my mind, my mind, my mind, right, right
People think they really being helpful
By telling me please be careful, yeah right
R-r-right, r-right, right, right (Hey, whoa)
Please, please don't play this song (Yeah, hey)

[Verse 2]
Black Robin Hood, riding high just like we should
You know the saying, ain't no delaying
Gotta gets the getting while the getting's good
Yeah, demented, my brain was forced to transform
Wise up, I'm checking the gate
On humble tales and minimum wage
The blogs tell it, "Cudi's lame
Wearing a kilt? He must be gay"
Let's keep it trill, fuck being discreet
But some girls tweet how they miss my meat
Yeah, Cudders; HBO, that Vitamin Water
That's money to blow 'cause it's money for blow
Don't take no shit, you can blame my ma
I'm in the maze, I'm in a daze, I'm losing it
I'm locking in my rocketship
I'll be a blip on your radar, bitch
Feels like things can be covered
Until the day I'm above myself, hovered

[Chorus: Kid Cudi, Mary J. Blige, Kid Cudi & Mary J. Blige]
Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please, please don't play this song
R-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right (—ight)
Trying to get my mind, my mind, my mind, right, right
People think they really being helpful
By telling me please be careful, yeah right (Me)
R-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right (They thinking 'bout me)
Please, please don't play this song, aha

[Outro: Kid Cudi, Mary J. Blige]
Mmm (Ooh-ooh)
Yeah (Ooh)
Yeah (Ooh)
Mmm (I say ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ah)
Mmm (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ah)
Mmm

[Intro]
Ah-ahem
This something I did
Something I can explain how to
I can't speak for everybody, but, uh
Man...

[Verse 1]
There must be more good women than men, percentage-wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys
And mess with other girls part-time to improvise
I knew she wasn’t bi, no, I seen it in her eyes
But I'm like any other guy, trying to get in her thighs
She telling me 'bout how black people should enterprise
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by five
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her I had a girl, dog, fuck it, I didn't lie
Told her this rap game is alright, I'm just getting by
She had a lil' weed and we get a lil' high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe
Told me back in '95, she fell in love with the Tribe
Boo, back in '92, I was just like you
Please, don't be confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other nigga, buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think, "Yeah, Free's banging but she's no Rachel"

[Chorus]
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
But you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be alright
'Cause until the day a real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise

[Verse 2]
Was it something I did wrong? Yeah, I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet, looking for classes
Out of state though, man, that hurt, yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work, yo
And she don't call a lot
And when she do, she pouring out her heart
"You never listen to me," then the call drop, mm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal, I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal, I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges
Never had money, so I felt like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry
Tryin' to see, can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry?
Went from fifty G's to fifteen hundred in a week
Now I'm trying to call
One ring, two rings, seven rings, eight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like, "She in school and she don't stay here no more"
I guess there's more good women than men, percentage-wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys
And focus on school full-time to improvise

[Chorus]
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
So I would like to apologize
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
No, no, you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise
You can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise
You can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise

[Intro: Soulja Boy]

Tatted on my neck and throat and them girls lick me up
Lick me up 'til I pop, shawty swallow every drop

Fuck is the matter with yo' face, nigga?
What the fuck is you lookin at?
I will spin that motherfuckin' barrel at you, nigga
Try me, ooh, I want you to try me, nigga!

[Intro]
"Breaking news: Detroit rapper Eminem cancels his sold-out European tour to check himself into rehab after admitting an addiction to sleep medication
We'll have more on this story as it develops"
"Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently survived a gunshot to the head in what appears to be a random drive-by shooting
Meanwhile, Eminem is rumored to be alienated--"
"On again/off again relationship with..."
"This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's bus..."
"Updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire at an after-hours club, we've learned that the rapper Proof has been fatally shot"
"Shady/Aftermath recording artist..."
"Long-time best friend of Eminem and a member of the rap group D12"
"D12, back in the news again today..."
"Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation continue to swirl around Eminem
He insists he's just taking a break, but doubters believe he's retiring, leaving us all to ask, 'Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?'"

[Verse 1]
So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But somethin' changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit, then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite, concert after concert
I was rakin' in the dough, rollin' in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom, there was nowhere for me
To not go and be seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in-between, you either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a three, then three
Years later they go back and re-rate it
Then called The Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be Illmatic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk

[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold

[Verse 2]
I got a letter from a fan that said he's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every letter I get
But something told me to go ahead and open it
But why would someone pray for you
When they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you
At least a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watching it from a opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
Right now, on how to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for 'cause I got the shit

[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold

[Intro]
Just turn the beat down just a little bit
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1]
They say anything's possible
You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles
Chasing obscene profits so we ain’t stopping for the red lights
Look in my rearview, all I see is niggas' headlights
Catch me if you can ho, they try and sack me and I scramble
Look up in the sky you’ll see exactly where I am bo
Hey, don’t you see me man?
Making my wishes come true with no genie man
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beenie Man
I’m on these rich niggas' ass, no bikini man
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man
Never imagined that the kids would want to be me man
Ay, could it be I give the hopeless broke kids hope?
Caught me walking through the mall, looking like he seen a ghost
Simply had to approach, "What's up youngblood?"
Ay, ain't it strange?
A year ago today, my nigga, I was counting change
Yeah, hopping trains up in New York City
Know I gotta thank God, 'cause if you weren’t with me
Then I surely woulda died, you can throw the fork in me
This my New Year's resolution, dawg, no more pork in me
Uh, I ain't no Muslim though
Caron Butler, I’m a wizard if ya doesn't know
It's Young Simba, yeah, I’m ballin’ 'til the buzzer blow
You's tryna kick the shit I kick, man you gon' stub your toe
Boy that's just how tough I go, see this is my light work
This shit y'all callin' classic, I be like, "That might work"
Want you to feel something new, that's how a dyke work
They ask me 'bout pressure, they want to see my pipe burst

[Interlude]
Not tonight nigga
Ay, not tonight nigga
Yeah, hey
Man, man, hey

[Verse 2]
Man, I rap so vicious but I talk so politely
Never met a baby momma momma who don’t like me
Met a couple baby fathers though that wanna fight me
I hit it 'til she snooze like the news nigga, nightly
Send her back to you when she no longer excites me
Now she bitter with this nigga 'cause he ain't quite me
One thing's for certain baby girl, you are a wifey
Two things for fucking sure, I am not the husband though
So run back to him while you still can
He sticking with his wife and kid, yeah, that's a real man
I was ashamed all along and I still am
We let the lust interrupt something real, damn
Well girl we grown so you gotta play your own position
I wouldn’t say that you a ho, just made a ho decision
And you can blame it on the liquor like a prohibition
We both know that's what you wanted girl, I know you listenin'

[Interlude]
Hey
Girl, I know you listenin'
Uh, I know you listenin'
Hey, yeah

[Verse 3]
Shoutout to the bootleggers who supply my shit
The fans online tryna find my shit
And to them niggas listening but won't buy my shit
Then catch me in the street and wanna ride my dick
Y’all niggas is the worst, see me
Like, "J. Cole homie, could you sign my burnt CD?"
Nigga please, a album ten dollars, you act like it’s ten Gs
This food for thought cost the same as two No. 3s
So at ease with that broke shit
We all tryna get a dollar boy, no shit
You know I feel your pain, therefore I slang this hope shit
And give you lines that you rewind and think, "Oh shit"
These rappers talk a lot of money, cars and hoes shit
I give you that and then a whole lot more shit
That "got rich and still rapping like I’m poor" shit
You niggas think you know shit, man you don’t know shit

[Outro]
Ho bitch
Yeah, Cole, bitch
Uh, J. Cole, nigga
Hey

[Intro: Kid Cudi & Chip Tha Ripper]
Easy, ahh
This is Easy Sunday Morning
And we're right here on a beautiful morning
In Cleveland, Ohio, and it's chilly today
The kids are going to school, the grass is frosty
(This should be my) Let's take it on, on the ride-ide out
(Theme song) In the morning
(To life) Hello Cleveland
(Hahah) Yeah

[Verse 1: Chip Tha Ripper]
A nigga like me be so gone
Eyes so low that a nigga gotta throw his locs on
"Wonder what them folks on?" That's what they be askin'
Dumb kush we smokes on, smell it when a nigga passin'
We gettin' to the cash and, you can see a nigga shinin'
Just a little gold, a couple hoes, couple, two, three diamonds
Up in the hood where you find him
'Less he out on the road ('Less he out on the road)
Every show got a bag full of blow and Patron
All my niggas getting throwed like they 'posed to
Cause life is short and filled with lots of grief and doubt
So I just, pull that bag of colorful frosty leaves on out
And free my scalp, I need to free my mind a puff at a time
I'm up all the time, I'm up on the grind
So a Red Bull and a blunt would be fine
Just wanna feel fine, just wanna kill time
Just wanna relax and think of a rhyme
Don't really like sippin' cause I get to trippin'
My nigga, just roll up a heap of that pine
And only bring a little bit for the trip
Just in case we get blurped by 5-0
"Sir, you look high", I know, but I prefer my eyes low

[Chorus: Chip Tha Ripper]
And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, so higher
Oh-oh-oh, oh yeah, we get so high

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, they say, "Easy friend"
There he go talkin' 'bout weed again
Probably cause of all that weed in him, yes and no
Cause and effect is what most don't know
Doing bad or like Mike said could be doing wrong
Forget about the obvious context of song
Put your brain where it belong
Can't we just all get a bong and tag along?
And we float, we kids with hope
Better to cope when you smoke
Dawg, please don't miss
What a nigga tryna get you thinking 'bout
We outside because my mama in the house
Puff-puff-pass with your bitch-ass
Back in high school, smoked weed when I cut class
And now I'm an addict, tragic, stay rolling up while reclining
I be looking down, see my Jesus piece shining
Good look, Yeezy, now I stay blinded by that light
Somebody pass me that shell to the right
Yes, I'm going, I'll be outtie, and you can find me
I'll be chilling back, I'll be chilling, Jack
Let's go

[Chorus: Chip Tha Ripper]
And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, so higher
Oh-oh-oh, oh yeah, we get so high

[Verse 1]
The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong, baby
And you'll be sorry someday

[Verse 2]
The thrill is gone
It's gone away from me
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
The thrill is gone
It's gone away for good
Oh, the thrill is gone, baby
It's gone away for good
Someday, I know I'll be over it all, baby
Just like I know a man should

[Verse 4]
You know I'm free, free now, baby
I'm free from your spell
I'm free, free, free now
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's all over
All I can do is wish you well

[Intro]
Hello, yeah

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Uh, little homie, in the room
In-in the room, boy on the moon
(Had-had no-no one) No one to hang out with
Talk that shit to just my little homies
One year younger, they ain't get where I was going
Took a turn to the worse when my father left me lonely (Hmm)
Lonely in my room
I-I mean me, up on the moon
Entertained myself, laughed at myself
As I grew to be a teen, I disguised myself
Had the lowest self-esteem, especially with the girls
Tried every sport just to impress all the girls
Instead of all the ladies, 'cause they talked down
I was too artsy, known to be a clown (Hmm)
(Ah-huh) And now my Facebook poppin'
'Cause I told the same girls I would be the hot shit
One day

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Billy Craven]
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, yeah, uh, big homie, made the move
Made-made the move, flew off the moon
Still (Had no-no one) no one to hang out with
Talk that shit to just my Brooklyn niggas
All I would wonder is when will my time come
Had mad jobs and I lost damn near all of them
Thinkin' 'bout my bosses, yep I hated all of them
Studio at night had me hustlin' to most of them
Nigga, I was late damn near every day
But I'ma be on time when my stars align
When my soul was happy on my Ramen diet
Followed by a loosey, was the meal of grinders
If you knowin' the truth, all you think about is that thing
Always be a hater tryna shoot down any dream
Until you meet a kid like K-I
Niggas thought I was crazy, my mama know I stay high
We getting money, mom

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Billy Craven]
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
I was heavy-heavy-heavy on my grizzle
And none of y'all had a clue about me
And none of y'all had a clue about me
And none of y'all really knew about me
I was heavy-heavy-heavy on my grizzle
And none of y'all really cared about me
And none of y'all really cared about me
Now, guess what? I'm all you see, I'm all you see

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Billy Craven]
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world

[Outro]
Yeah-ay-ohh-ohh
Yeah-ay-ohh-ohh

[Intro]
Yeah, woah-woah, oh
Yeah, woah-woah, haha
Yeah
My name is Scott Mescudi, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Gotta get it through my thick head
I was so close to being dead, yeah
Life, live it, with nobody's help tips
Man, I'm just walking without being led
See the world is so crazy and filled with such risk and man
I just know I gotta dodge them, yeah
The beginning is always followed by an end
In the in-between time I'm not runnin' or hidin'

[Pre-Chorus]
See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things trouble me

[Chorus]
The people I've met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?
I'm most confused about the world I live in
You think that I'm lonely, well I probably am
One thing that still gets me
When did I become a ghost?
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, woah-woah, haha, yay
Yeah, whoa, whoa-whoa, yoo

[Verse 2]
Tried to fight it, but soon that gave in
Went down a road with no lights on
Can't describe it, and you don't move like them
You become their worst nightmare
You remember the things that your parents had said and well
Rather find out the hard way
You should tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend
I keep with my stroll, I'm not runnin' or hidin'

[Pre-Chorus]
See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things still trouble me

[Chorus]
The people I've met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?
I'm most confused about the world I live in
You think that I'm lonely, well I probably am
One thing that still gets me
When did I become a ghost?
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, woah-woah
Yeah, woah-woah

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh
I hope they understand that I really understand that
They don't understand
I hope they understand that I really understand that
They don't understand
I really understand that they...
I really think I, umm...
I hope they understand that I really understand that
They don't understand
Whow
Listen to me
Whow-whow-whow
Listen to me
Whow-whow-whow

Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

Well I’mma quit this crazy scene
Its funny cause this is what I waited to be
Being on stage was amazing to me
But now I'm in the game it ain't the way that it seem
Well I’mma quit this crazy scene
Cause being famous ain’t all what they make it to be
But back then y’all this was my favorite dream
But now, I wouldn’t hesitate I would leave

I’mma

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[Asher Roth]
And I don’t know how to feel
When this
Dream of mine used to be so real
I would anything just to sign a deal
But now I trade it all for a home cooked meal
I wanna

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[B.o.B]
Oh, what?
You say it could be worse?
Well step in my shoes, put yourself in my shirt
I’m only human y’all so we all gotta work
But sometimes I wonder why I even came to this earth
I’ma

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[Asher]
Look, cause they don’t care about us
They just use us up
Leave us in the dust
And it roughs me up
So much I could cuss
But enough’s enough
I want out of these cuffs
I’m gonna

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[B.o.B]
Sometimes I just feel hopeless
Pacin’ back and forth, man I can’t even focus
So I’m always smokin’ in the booth recordin’
Cause my mind races
Like Jeff Gordon
I’mma

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[Asher]
It ain’t supposed to be so hard
I always said I’d quit if it felt like a job
I’d rather be pissed than pretend that I’m not
And try to play along with the whole facade
I wanna

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[B.o.B]
It ain’t a question to me
Look at me
I know what I’m destined to be
This is spiritual y’all
I’m wrestlin’ beasts
But pretty soon
I’ll be restin’ in peace
I’mma

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[Asher]
And I don’t even wanna be famous
And all my close friends become complete strangers
Don’t try to tell me this is one of these stages
Man you don’t know me, you only know what my name is
I’mma

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[B.o.B]
But still it just ain’t enough
Cause the rest of the world still just wakin’ up
So all the real niggas can relate to this stuff
But those who asleep, still hatin’ on us
Cause I’mma

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[Asher]
It couldn’t be more fake
When they wine and they dine and they smile and wave
But when it comes time to decide your fate
They’ll sign you on the line right next to Satan
I’mma

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[B.o.B]
Come y’all, y’all actin’ like I can’t feel you
I can look in your eyes and tell you what you done been through
And I could give a fuck because I got bigger issues
So at this point in my life
How can I get through?

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[Asher]
Okay
Yeah, I’ll play yo game

And use it as a chance to provide some change
Just know I’ll walk away at the end of the day
Right when I

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[B.o.B]

But somehow, it became my stress for demons
So I get up in this booth and I’m heated
Like ‘Ye said
I’m turnin’ atheists into believers
I’m

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this

So by now, I got enough to drive to Venus and back
So I’ma

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

[Outro]
I’m gone. Peace

Well I guess I got problems
Dropped outta school ain’t think about college
So apologies to my mother and father
For being stubborn ever since I was a toddler

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

Well I’m a quit this crazy dream
Cause when I hit the stage all the ladies scream
And when I pass by they all waving at me
But I be getting tired, y’all pray for me

Well, I’ma make a lot of money
And I’m-and I’m gonna quit this, quit this

Waitress, bringin' 'em by the cases
For me and my real niggas, we not in the matrix

Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, even if they celibate
I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy than it's ever been
I'm married to that crazy bitch; call me Kevin Federline
It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money 'til the death of him
The ground shall break when they bury him—bury him?
I know one day they got to bury him
Better lock my casket tight, baby, so I don't let the Devil in
People, it's just me and my guitar
Yeah, bitch, I'm heavy metallin'
You can get the fuckin' Led Zeppelin
Niggas is bitches, bitches, I think they full of estrogen
And we hold court and take your life for a settlement
Yes, I am the best—and no, I ain't positive, I'm definite
I know the game like I'm reffin' it
This is Tha Carter, Tha Carter 3, the New Testament
And I'm the God, and this is what I bless 'em with

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you?
You're not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
Yeah, Junior

[Verse 2]
It's Cash Money over everythang
It's in my blood, I feel it runnin' in every vein
I'm from the mud, I am a missile like a Scud
What's really good, I'm 'bout that ruckus like Fudd
And I stayed on my flo' at Cash Money, like a rug
Tied to the fuckin' Birdman like a lug
And dear Mr. Ronald Williams
To you I shall forever give thanks like a pilgrim
Cash Money million-heir to the throne
Goin' at their heads, like hair in a comb
Sittin' by the window, I just stare at the storm
Know I'll make it through it like hair in a comb
Young Money over bitches, my niggas trust my senses
And I will take a dasher as the Lord is my witness
And you all have witnessed, but I am not finished
So keep your mouth closed and let your eyes listen

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you?
You're not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm still a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire, bitch

[Verse 3]
Last year they had the Grammy's and left me in Miami
Sleepin' on a nigga like I'm rappin' in my jammies
I'm rappin' when you sleep
I was rappin' when you were in jammies
Mel Gibson flow, Lethal Weapon, book 'em, Danny
I'm a monster, I tell you, Monster Wayne
I have just swallowed the key to the House of Pain
Now I'm stuck here to deal with the house's pain
Fuck with me, I will peel like the house's paint—let's go!
Niggas don't wanna see me ‘cause I'm better in bold
The only time I will depend is when I'm 70 years old
That's when I can't hold my shit within, so I shit on myself
‘Cause I'm so sick and tired of shittin' on everybody else
I try to tell you like I'm sayin' somethin'
I'm from the Dirty like the bottom of my pants cuff
And now nothin' gonna stop me, so just envy it
Hey, I'll accept a friendly quit, ha ha

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm me, I'm me, bitch I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you?
Fuck you , you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire, bitch!

[Outro]
The hottest under the sun (who dat?)
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, man
And you already know that, pimpin'
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true
(Who dat?) Somebody gon die tonight
And you already know that, pimpin'
Aye, it's Cash Money Records, man, a lawless gang

[Intro: Just Blaze]
Welcome to the House of Pain
Just Blaze, niggas

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
There's no way out, it seems I can't get free
Somebody tell me what's happened to me

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
The country bud got me chokin'
I'm on a mission to the point that motherfuckers think I'm smokin'
Yeah, that sick nigga Biggie with the 8-shot fifth
With the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that a killing is thrilling?
All the blood spilling is all a part of drug dealing
A born gangsta, my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 with the hollow point slug
So when he licked shots, niggas dropped
Quicker than a bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dues, while kids was on their one's and two's, huh
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the MAC-11 swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my momma through the strain
I'm livin' in the house of pain

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Is anybody listenin'?
Tell me, can you can see this darkness surrounding me?
Nights gettin' colder, heavy on my shoulder
And it's gettin' hard to breathe
Vision's gettin' blurry, I'm gettin' worried
'Cause it's gettin' hard to see
When you're livin' in the house of pain

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
The motherfuckin' dust kicker, who can you trust?
Do you have the heart to see a nigga, before you bust?
My name is spoken on the tongues of so many foes
Bustin' motherfuckers out the box, I ain't even go!
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame?
From doin' flicks to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers got 'em duckin' from my smokin' Glock
And bustin' niggas asses to stay alive
Skinny ass player watchin' bigger motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm livin', high, I'm a hustler
Buckin' busters 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto, you ain't heard?
Niggas got they AK's headin' for the 'burbs
Aimin' at them skinhead bitches, let it rain
Givin' 'em a wet welcome to the House of Pain

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Nas]
Is anybody listenin'? Tell me can you can see
This darkness surrounding me
Now it's gettin' colder heavy on my shoulder
And it's gettin' hard to breathe (MJB)
Vision's gettin' blurry, I'm gettin' worried (Be worried, niggas)
'Cause it's gettin' hard to see (Yeah, Nas)
When you're livin' in the house of pain
(What up, B.I., Pac?)

[Verse 3: Nas]
Wendy Williams say I stayed dusted, maybe I should
'Cause these rappers'll have your phone tapped like Savion Glove'
And on the West, yo, police corrupt, some are Bloods
But these Teflons I loaded explodin' some mugs
I'm like Furious in Boyz n the Hood, but at the drive-thru
I ain't runnin', I'm dumpin', crazy like a Piru
And loc'd up, know how Nas do
I'm callin' Henchmen and Concepcion, to organize a black truce
Then we party hard, party with Nas
Since there ain't no more - Mardi Gras
And Bush won't apologize
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize
And .45's for them suckers y'all idolize
Y'all yellin' my name, but y'all soon dyin'
Tryin' to portray real but they be lyin'
'Cause they want the real niggas to die so they could gain
But never that, this ain't Everlast, this the House of Pain

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Is anybody listenin'? Tell me can you can see
This darkness surrounding me
Now it's gettin' colder heavy on my shoulder
And it's gettin' hard to breathe
Vision's gettin' blurry, I'm gettin' worried
'Cause it's gettin' hard to see
When you're livin' in the house of pain

[Verse]
Give it a sec for the pain to start
This wreck right here, it ain't for the faint of heart
They thought they saw the worst verse
From the team of G men who seem like nerds at first
Once they get to know us people dig us
Leaders in the fight for equal rights for niggas
Inventor of the more dementeder flow, no bout a-doubt it
This go for if you're bout it, bout it or rowdy, rowdy
Whatever's clever, the master fold
Who every hooker heard of, but now ho know
If we see tomorrow, the next day classes
The Villain in the back with the x-ray glasses
Have no fear, the ninja here
Feel 'em like the tinge in your ear from drinking ginger beer
When it's on, loco head gon' lay low
And heat it like beef patty, coco bread kon queso
If you say so lace the whole case load
They say he wear a metal mask in case his face show
He told 'em they flows is bitch talk and ayo's
His whole crew walk with pitchfork and halos
Say, ho, if you never worked a J-O
And keep more cash in the stash than a peso
Okay, yo, y'all know who to follow
Tie 'em up in the crib and leave they place hollow
Oh, shoot, the goose is loose
So wild you couldn't chase it down with straight fruit juice
Frown like the first time you taste cous cous
Stash the deuce deuce, troops asking "truce, truce"
Today on intense wreck week
We have the super villain in his own defense to speak
It's all part of my mental techniques
Available to freaks and pencil neck geeks
Train a sane brain to an insane train of thought
On a campaign trail he came to gain your support
Charge cash for a autograph
Say some shit to make your daughter laugh then slaughter the ass
See 'em on the big screen like Steve McQueen
Do something and never be back once he leaves the scene
Keep more medicated pads than Stridex
For his own side wreck with no known side effects
Before you press charges use your noodle
So what when he grab the mic he crush your cute cuticles
Keep your mouth shut, everything will be beautiful
It would be awfully rude to you, now get back to your hooty hoo
Damn it, it ain't worth the drama, can it
From the calm bandit eat rhymers like pomegranate
Soon as he stepped in, he lit the room
Boom, reschedule my noon with Brit Hume
(Doom!) In love with Mary Jane, she's my main thing
Pulled her right from that web head, what a lame brain
Maintain and say it, don't spray it
You wanna see your girl again, you might as well pay it
If I had a dime for every rhymer that bust guns
I'll have a cool mil' for my sons in trust funds
When I was broker than a broke dick dog
I always kept a L to smoke in thick fog
When it rain, it sure do thunderstorm
I got more rhymes in the summer than musty underarms
One, two, microphone checker
First learned to neck off a Home Ec homewrecker
This is back when he was like crib age
When he hit the stage, it's like a gauge to the rib cage
Break the mic like a rock star break a guitar
And jump off the stage like "Yee haw!"

[Outro Skit]
(UN leader): We shall now vote for a new world leader. I nominate, DOOM. All in favor, say Aye
(Delegates (In unison)): Aye!
(Peter Parker): Oh no
(DOOM): DOOM, is master of the world

(Voice 1): We must hurry
(Voice 2): Wait! If you are really with us, prove it. Let me hear you say it. Tell me that DOOM is a tyrant and must be overthrown
(Voice 1): I-I have spent my life
(Voice 2): Say it! You have spent your life serving a tyrant. DOOM must be stopped
(Voice 1): I fear you're right, my friend

(DOOM Cronie): The President of the United States is on the phone
(DOOM): Mr. President, you're at the mercy of your deadliest enemy
(President): It is time you learned once and for all, DOOM. The United States does not barter with terrorists
(DOOM): You never learn, do you?

(Voice 1): Here, this is the address of friends in New York. They'll help

[Chorus]
Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that, I grab yo' ass

[Verse 1]
Why you actin' all shy and all?
Why is y'all lyin' for?
"I never did this before..." Stop that
What, you want some Patron? I got that
I mean, I promise y'all, you fine and all
And your girlfriend, she kinda raw
But she not like you
No, she not like you
Right now, I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talking is gon' give me a Tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of y'all
Right now, The Louis Vuitton Don is signing off

[Pre-Chorus]
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris' and some Mo'
And we about to let it flow, oh, oh
Had some problems before
But see, we let 'em go
Got an ounce of that 'dro
And we about to let it blow, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that, I grab yo' ass

[Verse 2]
See, you know my style, I'm very wild
And I vow that my child will be well-endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that your mama had a fattie
He looked up at me
Said, "Daddy, that's the reason why you had me?"
Yep, we was practicing
'Til one day, your ass bust through the packaging
You know what, though? You my favorite accident
So go head, pop some Cristal for my newborn child

[Chorus]
'Cause now y'all know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that, I grab yo' ass

[Post-Chorus]
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris' and some Mo'
And we about to let it flow, oh, oh
Had some problems before
But see, we let 'em go
Got an ounce of that 'dro
And we about to let it blow, oh

[Outro]
Oh, oh
We lookin' for some hoes, hoes
Oh

[Written by Otis Redding]

[Verse 1]
What you want, baby, I got it
What you need, do you know I got it?

[Chorus]
All I'm askin' is for a little respect when you come home
(Just a little bit) Hey baby
(Just a little bit) when you get home
(Just a little bit) mister
(Just a little bit)

[Verse 2]
I ain't gonna do you wrong while you're gone
Ain't gon' do you wrong 'cause I don't wanna

[Chorus]
All I'm askin' is for a little respect when you come home

(Re, re, re, re) Whip it to me

[Verse 5]
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, find out what it means to me
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, take care of T-C-B

[Outro]
(Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me)
A little respect
(Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me)
Whoa, babe
(Just a little bit) A little respect
(Just a little bit) I get tired
(Just a little bit) Keep on tryin'
(Just a little bit) You're runnin' out of fools
(Just a little bit) And I ain't lyin'
(Just a little bit)
(Re, re, re, re) Start when you come home
(Re, re, re, respect) Or you might walk in
(Just a little bit) And find out I'm gone
(Just a little bit) I gotta have
(Just a little bit) A little respect
(Just a little bit)

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
No, fuck the bitches, fuck all the stank-ass hoes
All my niggas know
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique, Gucci Don, you know how we play
Fuckin' scandalous-ass bitches
You know how it go, Gooch
I meet a bitch, fuck a bitch
Next thing you know, you fuckin' a bitch
You just pass around shit, pass the shit like a cold and shit
Fuck 'em

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G. & Lil' Kim]
Now when I'm fucking off gin I'm invincible
Don't love no ho, that's my principle
'Cause, uh, bitches come (And uh) bitches go (Uh)
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fucking door (You know)
They might be the one to set me up
Want to get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote TECs and stuff, to get them off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leaving
Bitches be scheming, I kid you not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One ho said, Big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?
Thug nigga 'til the end, tell a friend, bitch
'Cause when I like you, then you go and fuck my friend, bitch
And you know that ain't right

[Chorus]
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G. & Lil' Kim]
You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep them in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go
Yeah we know, drop the scenario
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knocking some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rapping to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me, see
You know that ain't right

[Chorus]
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine, uh

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with a female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gangbang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her 'cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets 'em pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass

[Chorus]
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine

[Verse 1]
Holiday, oh, a holiday
And the best one of the year
Dozing off underneath my sheets
While I cover both my ears

[Chorus]
But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear

[Verse 2]
Holiday, still so far away
Our republic on the beach
I can't forget just how bad it gets
When I'm counting on my teeth

[Chorus]
But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear

[Bridge]
A vegetarian since the invasion
She'd never seen the word 'bombs'
She'd never seen the word 'bombs'
Blown up to 96-point Futura
She'd never seen an AK
In a yellowy Day-Glo display
A T-shirt so lovely, it turned all the history books grey

[Verse 3]
I got wheels, I got Cutter spray
And a healthy sense of worth
Half of me is the gasoline
But the other half's the surf

[Chorus]
So if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear

[Chorus: The Dream]
There's no mercy on me
No crying myself to sleep
No mercy on me
Nightmares have become my dreams
No mercy for me
Good morning reality
Will I wake? We'll never know
I'm late for my date with destiny
Let me go
Let me go
You've got to let me go
Right or wrong
Let me go
I'm on my path
Let me go

[Verse 1: T.I.]
My mama loved me more than I do
She said, "ya pops was just like you"
Trapped in a vicious cycle
Jesus' youngest disciple
Tell the judge if he throw a book at me
Make it The Bible
Started calling myself "The King" for lack of a better title
Loyal beyond belief to my detriment
It's so vital I change or blow opportunities
Like a choir recital
Now while I do not care who telling
Meanwhile, selling powder puts food in the bellies
Well it's unfortunate
The orphanage couldn't keep up the mortgages
Kid go to school stupid, they teachers ignoring it
Sorta just doomed, forced into being a goon, selling kush in a jar
Mixing up the tar in a balloon
Consumed with the same way of life I left
Everything I know now, I learned by myself
All you see are the whips
The Maserati's, Ferrari's, so they don't sympathize
Don't nobody feel sorry
No mercy

[Chorus: The Dream]
There's no mercy on me
No crying myself to sleep
No mercy on me
Nightmares have become my dreams
No mercy for me
Good morning reality
Will I wake? We'll never know
I'm late for my date with destiny
Let me go

[Verse 2 : T.I.]
Everybody's standing and waitin
Chanting, they' hating
Gospels say they should forgive me
They'd rather hand me to Satan
Blatant, displays the day of hypocrisy
Boy you got to be kidding
Could it be possibly the second coming of Pac is me?
Remember that, when he was here?
And when he died you realized you need him here
God with me partner, ain't no one for me to fear
Hindsight: 20/20
Future not as clear
But I'm a rider 'till I die
Put bullets 'tween my eye
I just ask that I can make my peace with God and say goodbye
Fuck up the world like Lady Di
On the day he died, his wife and sons and daughters know that every day he tried
To be a better person, nah, they wanted better verses
They could market to the merchants
But when they' closed curtains
You could be for certain ain't nobody perfect
But when you're rich, nobody gives a shit
No mercy

[Chorus: The Dream]
There's no mercy for me
No crying myself to sleep
No mercy for me
Nightmares have become my dreams
No mercy for me
Good morning reality
Will I wake? We'll never know
I'm late for my date with destiny
Let me go
You've gotta let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go!

I'm having a relapse

[Verse: Eminem]
How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?
He's already got life in jail, man, what the hell is his problem?
Well, to be honest
The smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
They've compelled me to kill this elderly man
And I get these panic attacks, pop a Xanax, relax
Trying to stick my fucking dick inside a mannequin's ass
Then I get manic-depressed, see the orthodontist, get gassed
Man, it's kick-ass, the first thing I put on is the mask
Speaking of masks, man, it ain't too late to have a change of pace
And take it off and show my face, so you can see the things you face
And slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation
That's bacon souffle you making, ain't you? Well, thank you, Jason
There goes one more coma due to blunt force trauma
Just give me one more Soma and I'll be done for, mama
Go in the damn broom closet, another Valium, lost it
Shoving the vacuum nozzle, down the bathroom faucet
It seems like every day, I get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me that eighteen-month-old baby to shake him up
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
Breaking his neck in eighty-some places, baby, here Shady comes, lady
He's got the razor b-blades and the ch-ch-chainsa-saw, baby
You b-b-blundering, bumbling, m-m-mumbling dum-dums
Yeah, here I come-come, you hear the rumbling? Vrumm-vrumm
There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum-drum
A head and torso of someone; where'd it come from?
Who's it belong to? Maybe the girl with the long, blonde hair
Who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms
Clearly, there's somethin' wrong, 'cause she didn't come home
She's missing, where is she? Something fishy is going on
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
Now, everybody get your dance on to my damn song, come on!

[Intro]
I am Iron Man

[Verse 1]
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or, if he moves, will he fall?

Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

[Verse 2]
Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
K.I.D.S
(You know what? You know what? You know what? Yeah)

[Verse]
Hey, Kool-Aid and frozen pizza
It's a work of art, I ain't talking Mona Lisa
Dream of rocking crowds, see me filling up arenas
This weed got me laughing like a damn hyena
Yeah, I live a life pretty similar to yours
Used to go to school, hang with friends and play sports
Every single summer taking trips to the shore
And that was all gravy but I knew I wanted more
Ain't ever seen a young rapper like moi
Can't believe they eyes, swear it's just a mirage
Still got my training wheels in the garage
But I ain't gonna need those, I'ma go hard (Go hard)
So far I've done pretty well for myself
Couple trophies on the shelf, so what else
Could I want that I don't have yet?
Well, a little more cash and my own fast jet
So I can go anywhere, (Anywhere) anywhere (Anywhere)
Cali for the kush, 'cause boy I know there's plenty there
'Bout to be in music stores everywhere, but not yet
They can't understand my concept
I've been climbing up the great wall, haven't had a fall yet
These blogs gotta know I'm on next
Clean conscience, good Samaritan
Companies send me clothes so I'm wearing them
If you didn't know, well, I'm from the 'Burgh
Everything I drop recorded by Big Jerm
I smoke herb, then I make music
I don't even talk about it, boy, I just do it
Everybody got their own opinion, the reasons why they feeling him
You must admit he's killing 'em, running off adrenaline
Waiting for the game to wanna let him in, so open up
The boy a barrel of a smoking gun
Whether I'm old or young, the chosen one
I got a hundred billion flows to come
I hope you know the lyrics to every single song
So when I'm at a show everyone can sing along
My weed bag empty, bottle at its last drop
I'm feeling like this could be my last shot
But many more songs to make, cousin
So why the fuck you bugging? Haha

[Outro]
Yeah
Just some motherfuckin' kids
We just some motherfuckin' kids (What?)
We just some motherfuckin' kids (Ayy)
We just some motherfuckin' kids (Shouts to all my fans, man)
We just some motherfuckin' kids (Holdin' me down)
We just some motherfuckin' kids (And all the homies)
We just some motherfuckin' kids (Most dope)
Just some mo—just some—we just some motherfuckin' kids
(You know what? You know what? You know what? Yeah)
(You know what? You know what? You know what? Yeah)
(You know what? You know what? You know what? Yeah)
(You know—)

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now

[Verse 1: Drake]
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the Earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like 

[Andreena harmonizes]
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
And say "My baby's famous and I knew it" (yeah)
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out

[Drake Talking]
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF (uhh)
Miss Andreena Mill

[Chorus: Andreena Mill]
Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video
Which made everything right with X (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Far too many rappers and not enough ___
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the Artful Dodger
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And "Hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest"
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home

[Outro: Drake talking]
Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
(Sing it to' em 'Dreena) lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah man
(Yeah man)

[Chorus: Andreena Mill]
Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Cut the music up please

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I shall never leave Hip-Hop
Controlled by my two hands, they go tick tock
Around the clock, yes it’s my time, my throne
Better know the time of day in any fuckin' time zone
I’m feelin' like I’m on top of the rhinestone
Pullin' the ladder from heaven, about to climb home
Mental thoughts are sharper than a pine cone
In this world of numbers, I keep my nine on
And I don’t go to church because the lyin' long
And the preacher, he be gettin' his shine on
But I know my Lord — I am God’s own
Back to my hands, tick-tick; a time bomb

[Chorus: Jay Sean]
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
I’ll be here cause I won’t quit yeah
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Tryna stay afloat on my inner tube
When they turned my city into a swimmin' pool
Before that, it was a livin' cesspool
We gotta get on our shit, like gnats do
Polices be on my tip, like hats do
But I stay strong like blacks do
Never saved by the bell in a black school
And I stay in trouble like Zack do
And in this game, nobody’s on my plateau
Therefore my name remains, like a tattoo
Yes, I take giant steps in Shaq boots
B-I-R-D-man Junior, or — Weezy F. Baby, baby

[Chorus: Jay Sean]
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
I’ll be here cause I won’t quit yeah
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me

[Bridge: Jay Sean]
That ain't me
See I won’t stop, that ain't me
I won't quit, that ain't me
No, I won't stop, that ain't me
Cause that ain't me

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
Alright; alright, alright, alright
I’m in their conversations
The title's up for grabs, I’m into confiscation
Punch, shot, and stab; now you're the doctor's patient
Wild like an Arab from the Islamic nation
I get money 'round the clock, ain't got no time for hatin'
And these niggas ain't shit, like they're constipated
I get the coupe with the kit, watch me lobster red it
Drop the top at the light, that's when I be headed
So far ahead of them I feel outdated
But I feel electric like I’m Rayden
Used to play Mortal Kombat when I was a couch potato
And now I’m coming out the faders, no homo

[Chorus: Jay Sean]
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
I’ll be here cause I won’t quit yeah
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me

[Intro : J. Cole]
Yeah, keep following me
Keep calling me
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Ay

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Believe in God like the sun up in the sky
Science can tell us how, but it can't tell us why
I seen a baby cry then seconds later she laughs
The beauty of life, the pain never lasts
The rain always pass, the sun don’t always shine (Yeah)
When it's gone I'm lonely, but when it's there I'm fine
I hate the wintertime because the nights come quicker
The light make them whites think I'm a nice young nigga
But at night they think twice and walk a little faster
It's funny, hunnid-years-ago I'd've called this nigga, master
How the tables turn but still the fire burning huh
I feel the heat the world is a dryer turning, turning
Im looking for some higher learning, learning
Girl you what I desire, yearning, yearning
You say I'm easily distracted
I think the problem is I'm easily attracted by the darkside
The temptation got me questioning where my heart lies
I'm tryna separate myself like apartheid
But ay the liquor keep swallowing
I swear I walk with God but the devil keep following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following

[Verse 2: Omen]
Uh
Feel like I'm riding on a chartered plane of broken-hearted pain
Turbulence is constant my pilot has gone insane
If I can find a parachute to parasail
Maybe these parasites of paranoia won't prevail
Character dope as hell, but where is my parallel sweetheart
Deep thoughts lost in my brain so I sleep hard
Nights with no progress
Mane I'm thinking like I'll probably find a Loch Ness
In the projects before I find this
Object of my love, this object of my heart
Guitar strings have strum in search of my counterpart
Bound to start drinking or smoking, sink in this ocean
Leaping through the badness hoping I'm reaching for closeness
Feel like the devil keep following me
Feel like the devil keep following me, uh

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Look at her she could be ma super boo
In a room crazy, sexy, cool
Intellectually sexy, her body is sick, her face is dope
Somethin like a eye candy photo
Hope to God the broad ain't a ho though
The way she walks is in slow-mo
Yep, ma mind got Tee-Vo
Every punk truck around
Plotting and scheming, wishing and dreaming
Jus for a little nano second to holla at her quick
Tryin' to holla for her name
Yellow bone with a tan like damn
Smile at me, so I smile right back
She move so effortless complimentin' her looks
I be commentin' up in her book

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
You can be my super boo-oo-oo
You can be my super boo, I need you
To come and chill wit me c'mon
One, Two, Check it

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Mad views on her myspace shit
Just stoppin by, showing her love, while she sits
And all her friends are hot, but not like her she the number one spot
All I wanna do is really introduce Scott
Let her know my dreams and struggles to the top
Show her, that it feels good in a drop top
Rollin down sunset niggas can't stop
I can tell that she really got her mind right
Let me make that move when the time's right
Hope she don't mind a little limelight
You can't go wrong let's get right
And we gon let them other niggas stomp it out
Next step ye we gon' talk it out
I hop hotels 'til the next flight
I think about you cause your so right

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
You can be my super boo-oo-oo
You can be my super boo, I need you
To come and chill wit me c'mon
One, Two, Check it

(Lalalaalaaalaaa)

[Interlude: Kid Cudi]
I know you probably like a lil stand offish
But just take my hand though
And save my world baby
Come ride with me

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Let me get it, okay I got it she's so hot move so erotic
Take her to Cancun fly supersonic
Grown and sexy love Gin & Tonic
Askin questions like where you from?
I ain't gonna tell you you should just come
Take that journey beyond the clouds
Let's leave reality truth be told
Yeh baby girl this the code
Come be ma roadie backstage at shows
I can tell that them other niggas did you cold
But am a hot nigga with the heat for sure
I ain't fittin like a scarf in the summer
Am misemplyin and I need you in the summer
Layin on top me enjoying your company
Am runnin out of issue (Can't understand) when I kiss you

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
You can be my super boo-oo-oo
You can be my super boo, I need you
To come and chill wit me c'mon
One, Two, Check it

[Spoken Interlude: Lil Wayne]
My favorite TV shows, man, is SportsCenter, ESPN News, Pardon the Interruption, um, Around the Horn, uh, Quite Frankly, um, Outside the Lines, uh, yuh, uh, Baseball Tonight? Y’er’me? I watch sports, dog.  That’s basically—that’s what I’m tryna say. I watch sports, man. That’s what I’m into. Sports, sports, sports—every sport. Hockey, golf, basketball,—football, of course—baseball, y’er’me? I got a favorite team, a favorite player in every single sport. I’m not gon’ answer those questions. Let’s go—

[Intro: Lil Wayne, DJ Drama, & DJ tags]

[?], what up?
That was my phone
Shout-out to Boogie Brown! (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Janeice, I see you!
I ain’t cut it off, I just hung up
It’s Gangsta Grillz, you bastards!
Yeah

[False Start: Lil Wayne, DJ Drama, & DJ tags]
Cover my tracks like butter, so where the bread be?
I see beef as dead meat
Who that?” (Yes!) The president— yeah, me; no one scare me
And you ain't gotta double-dare me, hear me?
(Gangsta Grillz, you bastards!) Oh!

[Verse: Lil Wayne, DJ Drama, & DJ tags]
Cover my tracks like butter, so where the bread be?
I see beef as dead meat
"Who that?" The president—yeah, me; no one scare me
And you ain't gotta double dare me, hear me—
Loud and clearly? rats aren't near me
Wire-tap niggas get blood in they earpiece
I'm from New Orleans, nowhere near peace
Pure beast, fear-free—"Dear grief!"
Catch up, bitch, I'm in gear three
Zoom, gone, see you, peace! Drop one finger (Gangsta!)
Yeah! Fuck 'em and whoever made 'em
I will hurt whoever love 'em, 'cause I hate 'em
Lookin' for a lady, high and sedated
Got her to the pad—I don't know how a nigga made it
She gave me relations, so, now, we related
The morning comes; the picture faded
I waited on my turn to burn—can I get a light?
Little dog: bigger bite; Jackson Five: Little Mike
Can I get a mic or a mic and a half—
That the Source owe me? Shout out to the editing staff, yeah
I'm all grown, so much better with math
I need a spread in the "Forbes" taking a Benjamin bath, yeah
I'm serving this track, like Steffi Graf, yeah
Roger Federer; there's no competitors
Niggas know my rhetoric; bitches know my preference
Young God, baby—all them other niggas reverends
Sittin' in my big house, surrounded by my weaponries
I keep them away like I got leprosy
Chopper right next to me, loaded up with pepper seeds
Got an extra clip, but that's only for my especiallys, yeah, yeah
(Dramatic— Dramatic—) This is especially for you
Just respect a nigga game—what kind of referee is you?
Swallow your whistle—make a nigga ride with the pistol
'Cause the fakest niggas ride with the pistol
Even if I die old, I'ma die with the pistol
If you stand over my body, I'll prob'ly kill you, yeah
Now, I feel it: Weezy the realest
I wear a lot of Bathing Ape, 'cause I be with gorillas, yeah (Gangsta— Gangsta—)
He what they talking 'bout: topic of the conversation
Product of determination, yeah
Stop playing—you are not up in my situation
I get money like a Caucasian
The car red, so the car Cajun; stop hatin'
Y'all ballers; I'm a sports agent, yeah
Wait a minute—let me translate it: It's—
"Weezy Not-The-Father Motherfuckin' Baby"
Hey
I remember da way
We would both say
We be together
Forever and a day
Well I guess dat day
Came sooner den late
Cus now
We're apart and away
And it feels so stray
N.G.E. wouldn't you say
I use to
Call u bay
And u use to obey
And I just wish we could

"do it again" (X3)

Hey
I got my business together
Wish I could get together
But timing is an error
And I
Tell a lie
To you like ever
If I was even ever
Given another chance to
"do it again"

Like I died
And gone to heaven
Climbed inside a treasure
Died inside of pleasure like
Wow
Your smile is but of essence
Your child is so precious
I wish
It was paternally mine
But karma is a message
But I'mma try to test it
And scream for a blessing
So loud
And I hope that you would catch it
And one day you would come fallin
Out of the most highest cloud

Then ill be there to catch you
Yes
Ill be there to let you
Do da things
We didn't do before
Now
Next time we have to stretch it
Do it never forget it
I never forgot
I wish dat we could
"do it again" (X3)

Hey
Im just trynna talk to you
If I could talk to you
Den I would talk
Forever and a day
Yes I remember
So vividly
How we would be
When we lay
And my then blue skies
Were no longer gray
She so brightened up my day
Put it on a scripture
She would be a picture
If perfect had a face
I promise you homie
Dat u would be hungry like me
If you had a taste
I put it on my momma
Cus baby girl is a flower
A flower without a vase
No water needed at all
She continues to grow
More beautiful everyday
And I love her somethin vicious
And im just wishin
We could
"do it again"(X3)

[Hook]
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
That's all I can do mama
The love I'm sending
An't making it through to your heart
I hope you hear me

[Verse 1]
Pain! Since I've lost you, I'm lost too
Nigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horseshoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to
Be prayin' for the day you come back to me
Sayin' that you forgive me, give me another chance
I'm needin' it like a kidney, I don't wanna advance
Give me back her hands, give me back her touch
I don't ask for much, but I fucked up
I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up
But everybody fuck up, now this other nigga lucked up
Tell him me and my clique don't give a fuck
'Cause, um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster... BANG!

[Hook]
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control
I see you hidin' it, mama
You got it down, and you're well on your way to the top
Keep doin' your thing
But there is something that you forgot

[Verse 2]
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love, right after the fights
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me, you are the brightest star under sunlight
See, take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
Give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
See, this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin' she be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me is what I mean to rap

[Hook]
You've been hiding (Y'know)
Never letting it show
Always trying (I see you hidin', it mama)
To keep it under control (But I know you know)
You got it down (I know you do)
And you're well on your way to the top
But I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness, shawty

[Verse 3]
But I hope you haven't forgot about me—
Up in the living room, watchin' SportsCenter
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver; you know, they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma, you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me "butter," I called you "babe"
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me, and let me say:
Please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, damn!

[Hook]
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart

[Produced by: Emile Haynie]

[Intro]
Yup
Yup

[Verse 1]
Shades over my eyes
Make the creepers look back at themselves
Sittin' stuck, in emotional bliss
The skinny model girls rub coke on their gums
Tap my knee, I'm keepin' the rhythm
The young and wild take chances together
They all jump up, twist and groove
But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin' mood

[Chorus]
No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood

[Verse 2]
There's a hunger in the night
The moonlight kissing the nips on a model frame
I kissed her inner thigh
Closed my eyes, she began to make me fish
She like to go the mile
All the while I could see her tear a bit
I forgot her name, somethin that sound like Penelope
Maybe a French twang to it
Her tongue was quick, she was French I knew it
A lovely foreigner, foreign to racism
She like that young nigga vibe
My brown skin, my shagged out 'fro
I'm king to her, and she will please her friend for me
So funny how the starvin' are guardless
Naked is always honest
Her hands all over my privates, lost in the mood

[Chorus]
No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood

[Bridge]
But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin' mood

[Chorus]
No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood

[R. Kelly]
Ay, listen to my demo, oh!

That's the sound of the bed when it's tweakin' with you and me in it
The passion, the sex, girl, sex like a clinic
Especially when we put on that bump 'n grind
That 12-Play get that boy some pussy every time
There's something about that shit when we put that shit on
And not to mention when you mix that shit with some Patron
That's why she keep pursuin' it
She love how I'm doin' it
Cause shorty scream like, "Aaah!" like I got two in it

And you don't have to wonder
Twelve's the magic number
Just count from one to twelve, and I'll be going under
Making your body shake like a horror movie (Hit it, hit it!)

It ain't no secret why I be king 'til I die
12-Play deserves a Grammy, because I believe I can fly
I believe that your mommy and daddy laid it down, and they did it
To Kelly's 12-Play

[Hook: The-Dream]
You can't ruin it
From doin' it to Kelly's 12-Play
Like a DJ we screwin' it
While we doin' it (ooh-ooh-in' it) to Kelly's 12-Play
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh!

[The-Dream]
We gon' come up off that bed, push up to the dresser... yeah, yeah, yeah
Now we're all up on my CD player up
Skip, skip, skip-skip, skip-skip back to seven
And we both sweatin' it out like it's a fire up in here
Reach my hand up to the remote, gotta play that one more gear
As we repeat steps 1 through 12
She's like, "Thank you, Dream!"
I'm like, "No, thank you, Kells!"
So I stunt like my daddy up in here
Girl, you got my lips hangin' off your ear
Clean the CD, check for scratches, get up on my mattress
And now we doin' it to Kelly's 12-Play

[Hook]

[R. Kelly]
Ah, ah, I say we doin' it... k-k-killa! (Killa!)

So close the door and let me show you
I got my tongue all up in it like (leetle-leetle-leetle-leetle-leetle)
Now, I'ma make you change your notes like (leetle-leetle-leetle-leetle-leetle)
Do you like that? Do you like this?
Then tell me how does this feel?
Girl, my only aim's to please your body
I'ma sing to that puss, make it sing right back to me
We can be a duet, we've got that kind of chemistry
And if I smoke grass, baby, I'mma light one up cause that was by far the greatest... (fuck)
'Bout to get that ass up to bidness up in here, 'bout to get your man fired up in here
Because... are you fiendin' for it? And I'm 'bout to run up in it!
So don't hate, listen to my mixtape
And if you wanna know, my favorite's number four on Kelly's 12-Play
Hey, Dem 30/30 Boyz, Soulja Boy and Arab
We got somethin' new for y'all

Just on your nerves, talkin' shit

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about the life
And how you live when you is a star
Every single place you go
The people run up to your car
Everybody wants to talk, and everybody wants to jive
Everybody wants a handshake, or want a high five
And these ugly girls always got a friend
That wants to talk to you
(Bitch, Yahhh, Yahhh, Trick)
(And your friend, Yahhh, Yahhh Too!)
Ain't got time for chitchat
I'm tryin to get this money
So get up out my face

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Dawg, get out my face, I'm startin' to get mad
Walkin' up
(Soulja Boy, Can I have your autograph?) Bitch, Yahhh, Bitch!
Leave me alone, let me get some peace

Leave me alone ho, before I have to knock your ass out
(Hey, Soulja Boy, when that new 30/30 boyz cd coming out?)

[Section 1]

[Verse 1]
A diamond necklace played the pawn
Hand in hand some drummed along, oh
To a handsome mannered baton
(Bygone, bygone)

[Verse 2]
A blind class aristocracy
Back through the opera glass you see
The pit and the pendulum drawn
(Bygone, bygone)

[Bridge]
Columnated ruins domino
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping?

[Verse 3]
Hung velvet overtaken me
Dim chandelier awaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn
(Bygone, bygone)

[Verse 4]
The music hall a costly bow
The music all is lost for now
To a muted trumpeter swan
(Bygone, bygone)

[Bridge]
Columnated ruins domino
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping, Brother John?

[Section 2]

[Verse 1]
Dove nested towers the hour was
Strike the street quicksilver moon
Carriage across the fog
Two-Step to lamp lights cellar tune

[Verse 2]
The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne
The glass was raised, the fired rose
The fullness of the wine, the dim last toasting
While at port adieu or die

[Verse 3]
A choke of grief heart hardened, I
Beyond belief, a broken man too tough to cry

[Verse 4]
Surf's Up, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Aboard a tidal wave
Come about hard and join
The young and often spring you gave
I heard the word
Wonderful thing
A children's song

[Section 3]

[Refrain]
Child, child, child, child, child
A child is the father of the man
Child, child, child, child, child
A child is the father of the man
A children's song
Have you listened as they played
Their song is love
And the children know the way
That's why the child is the father to the man
Child, child, child, child, child
Child, child, child, child, child
Na na na na na na na na
Child, child, child, child, child
That's why the child is the father to the man
Child, child, child, child, child

[Intro]

[The-Dream]
Radiokilla

[Travie McCoy]
You know what it is
Gym Class Heroes, The-Dream
It’s hard to look innocent when I got cookie crumbs all over my face

[Hook: The-Dream & Travie McCoy]
I like girls
They like me
They look so cute in their 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar
My hands, my hands, my haha... my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
You see I got this problem
I need help trying to solve it
'Cuz meeting after meeting
And I'm still a cookie-holic
You can hide 'em, I'ma find 'em
On the counter, in the closet
And I'll say I ain't do it
With my face covered in chocolate
My girl be setting booby traps
To catch me eating Scooby Snacks
I left crumbs in the bed once
But I told her I was through with that
She still don't be believing me
And I guess that I'm cool with that
But I got a sweet tooth
That'll never come loose
And the truth of the matter is

[Hook: The-Dream & Travie McCoy]
I like girls
They like me
They look so cute in their 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar
My hands, my hands, my haha... my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
I got a thing for Milano biscotti Italianos
And I'll never turn down some Oreos if you got them
Butter pecan Puerto Rican
Or them oatmeal raisin Asians
Hazelnut Brazilians, macadamia Caucasians
Double Stuf or Thin Mint
It don't matter, you gettin' it
'Cause I got a sweet tooth
That'll never come loose
And the fact of the matter is

[Hook: The-Dream & Travie McCoy]
I like girls
They like me
They look so cute in their 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar
My hands, my hands, my haha... my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
I'm a monster for these cookies
I'm a beast for their treats
I'm an animal for they're crackers
Head to feet, they so damn sweet
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

[Chorus]
I wake up early in the morning 'round the crack of dawn and
Wave to my neighbors like what's up? (Say what's up?)
And I’m all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer-bammer-bammer

[Verse 1]
My speakers out of space like ET
Cops watch me all day like TV
SOD hit the club, we be so deep
Mayne I'm deep in the game I grind like a OG
I got 12 diamond chains like a OZ
Follow me like the Wizard of Oz
Girls love my style cause it is so neat
Ask about me in the streets I spit so heat
Ain’t nobody in the game messing with my clique
Style swift hot like it’s July 10th
Fly chick in my whip with nice tits
Her boyfriend paid for it, I didn’t
Ice game, cold as a polar bear
Sun hit my chain, watch it make a solar flare
We gettin' money over here hands in the air
Y'all making it too easy, it’s not fair

[Chorus]
I wake up early in the morning 'round the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like what's up? (Say what's up?)
And I’m all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer-bammer-bammer

[Verse 2]
I remember back in the days, man, I was broke
These days Soulja Tell 'Em run a hundred spokes
No joke, mayne I’m balling out the atmosphere
Say you ball harder then me, man get 'em outta here
I gotta my speakers going ham in my Lamborghini
Two door coupe, girl in bikini
Passenger seat and she five star she so swag
She so Fabolous, they way she throw it in the bag
Its young soulja soulja mayne I swear I’m popping tags
Back then, you could catch me in a Pontiac
These days drop top Phantom with a 100 stacks
Yeah they buy this album but they want they money back
Girls wet like they living in a fish tank
I’m getting money man what the fuck a bitch think
Young Soulja got my speakers going MC Hammer
Like Rick Ross bitch I think I’m MC Hammer

[Chorus]
I wake up early in the morning 'round the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like what's up? (Say what's up?)
And I’m all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer-bammer-bammer

[Intro: Etta James]
You make me smile with my heart, oh

[Chorus: Kanye West & Etta James]
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop, man, I tried the best I could
But you make me smile

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Etta James]
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs
(You make me smile)
Just let me peek now, I mean, damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja, Henny and Co-Co-Coca-Cola
(You make me smile with my heart, ohh)
Then I'm co-coming over 'cause it's ne-never over

[Chorus: Kanye West & Etta James]
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop, man, I tried the best I could
But you make me smile

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Etta James]
I see the emotion in your eyes, that you try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blown
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed (You make me smile)
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and Co-Co-Coca Cola
(You make me smile with my heart)
And I keep co-coming over 'cause it's ne-never over

[Chorus: Kanye West, Strings & Etta James]
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop, man, I tried the best I could
But you make me smile
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop, man, I tried the best I could
But you make me smile

[Outro: Kanye West & Etta James]
I just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to um, let me, how would I put this, uhh
Let's say, all your friends, remember the one
You said, if you ever, she would be the one
Okay, okay, okay (You make me smile with my heart)
Well, I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean, don't take this seriously
Don't take me, I mean, just, uhh, not credibly
I'm feeling incredibly, I mean, let's let it be
I just let it be
I mean you, her and me (You make me smile with my heart)
I mean you, her and me
Maybe, baby, baby
You know I was just kidding
Unless you gon' do it (You make me smile)

[Produced by Jon Brion, Kanye West & Warryn Campbell]

[Chorus: Really Doe]
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up, and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff-puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser
Turn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior
Best things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper
High off the ground, from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Feeling better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say "Yes" too soon
Until you have a daughter; that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects tore up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes? Just to blow up?
Get they first car and then, IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that nine
Nigga come through flicking and he had that shine
Put two and two together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend, "Was the strip clubs cool?
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school?"
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me

[Chorus: Really Doe]
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up, and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser
Turn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior
Best things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper
High off the ground, from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major

[Post-Chorus: Nas]
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major

[Verse 2: Nas]
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line—should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Four-fours or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
"What this verse sound like? Should I freestyle or write?
He said, "Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, still"
Looked at the pad and pencil, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now, I'm a free agent, and I'm thinking it's time
To build my very own Motown
'Cause rappers be deprived of executive nine-to-fives
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
And I love to give my blood, sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasted longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way, my change came like Sam Cooke

[Bridge: Tony Williams & Nas]
Ba-dop-ba-ba (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never; it's orientation
Still, we can make it better, throwing all your cares away
Oh, oh, oh, ooh!

[Chorus: Really Doe & Tony Williams]
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up, and (Ba-dop-ba-ba)
I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff-puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser (Oh, oh, oh, ooh!)
Turn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior (Ba-dop-ba-ba)
Best things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper
High off the ground, from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major

[Hook: Kanye West & Nas]
We major? (C'mon, homie, we major)
We major? (C'mon, homie, we major)
We major (C'mon, homie, we major)
We major

[Bridge: Tony Williams]
Oh, oh, oh, ooh! Ba-dop-ba-ba
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
But better late than never; it's orientation
Still, we can make it better, throwing all your cares away!

[Spoken: Kanye West & Tony Williams]
Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again?
I can't believe I'm back up in this motherfucker
I'ma be late, though
I gotta figure out what I'm finna wear
Yeah
The Roc is definitely in the building
G.O.O.D. Music's definitely in the building, ugh
I gotta say "What's up" to Tony Williams
On the vocals!
Sings—He sings quite beautifully, don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Ugh
And Jon Brion on the keys right now
And Warryn Campbell on the keys right now
So they asked me:
"Why you call it Late Registration, 'Ye?"
'Cause we takin' these motherfuckers back to school
La, la, la, la-la-la-la la
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along
La la la la la, la-la-la

[Outro: Tony Williams & Kanye West]
Ba-dop-bop-ba (Oh)
Feeling better than I ever felt before today (If you feeling good)
But better late than never; it's orientation (It's orientation)
But we can make it better, throwing all your cares away
We want you to get used to this
Oh, oh, oh, ooh! Ba-dop-bop-ba
Ugh, they can't do what we do, baby
Uh-uh, uh-uh! They can't do what we do baby
Uh-uh, uh-uh! They can't do what we do, baby
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh, ooh!
Yeeh
It's young Khalifa man
I know I say that before every song
But that's really, actually who the fuck I am so

Uh uh
Damn it feels good to be a Taylor
To rock camo shorts, chuck-t's and smoke papers
Weed comin' in all flavors
Fall up in the spot as long as the champagnes there
Couple pretty hoes I don't know their name here
Smell the weed, see two fingers know my gang near
Yeh you ballin' but they ain't cheer
I guess they tired of rootin' for the same players
Real niggas run up on me at my shows, hoes show me love, promoters give me plane fare
I'm somewhere at the top I'm planning on stayin' there
Mouth full of kush ridin' in my favorite pair
And this is for anyone who seen a nigga vision from the begining realize that you made it clear
Laugh now fly later, damn it feels good to be a taylor

And that's what it is man, taylor gang or die
Damn it feels good to be a taylor
So ya'll just catchin' on it's all good
You know I fucks with all my taylors
Taylor gang world wide
You know I had to do something strictly for the fans
I'm workin' on my album right now
I made kush and orange juice go through the roof
I'm smokin' some sour kush
I'm smokin' one got another one rolled
(it's really good sour)
Seein' tickets to every show so
They won't sleep till we let them know
(so roll up, you know)
Now they repin' taylor gang everywhere we go
(do what we do)
I'm smokin' one got another one rolled
(keep it Taylor man)
Seein' tickets to every show so
(2010)
They won't sleep till we let them know
(this years almost over so next year)
Now they repin' taylor gang everywhere we go

We just gonna' be doin' the same shit but like on a higher level
And that was a weed joke
(na-hahahahaha)
Let's go
Jerm I see you
Yah you thought I was goin' in the song without sayin' whats up to Jerm
That nigga Taylor Gang
Whaddup Bill

[Verse 1]l
Yeah! What they talkin' bout Fee? they ain't saying shit
Nigga, we could hold court like Stan Smith
Or Judge Judy, you niggas better shoot me
Cuz I bought my mans a Glock, and I bought myself an oozi (brrr...)
Don't confuse me
No, they don't amuse me
I come after the money, like wednesday come after tuesday
I told stunna I'm wildin', he say 'don't worry I gotcha'
He told me 'cut they heads off, and bring them back to papa
Yeah! Them niggas getting scurred! Wurrd?
All that talk was just a whole bunch of verb
Pussy ass nigga got a whole bunch a nerve
I have em puttin' your picture on a bunch of shirts
Cuz I smoke a lot of weed, and drink a whole bunch of syrup
I like brain, so I fucks with a whole bunch of nerds
(Hehe) I am number one, cuz two is not a winner and no one remembers third

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Money is the topic baby
See I'm a giant, all these other niggas mocking baby
They microscopic baby
Big crib, I can't even hear em knocking baby
Headed to the top, like I'm tied to a rocket baby
To all the foreign women, lets make a tropic baby
I got so many bitches, I could make a compilation
I'd like to thank the haters, for your cooperation
I got that doctor chopper, if you want operation
Niggas this is my crusaders, kill for confirmation
We all got on masks, we bout to toxic waste em'
I hope they mama's raised em', (why?) cuz they got bitch ways
If they don't pay for you, they get you back dead
Real talk, stop walking on your back leg
Step into the lime light, bullshit backstage
I used to tote a 32 up in my crack days
I tote that AK47 in my rap days

[Hook]

Yeah! Come and get it (tell em), anyone can get it
But since I'm the president, I be a little more politic ha
I chillin' in the clinic
And guess how many nurses I got working on my dizick
Snakes in the grass, rats, and lizards
But round here snitches don't exist like wizards
Ho this ain't punch, I'm sippin' on some syzurp
I roll a fat joint and do my fingers like scissors
The game so cold, I done had my share of blizzards
And now I got that big money running like rivers
Nigga, I'm here to get my shit straight
Burner on the hip waist
Leave a nigga street full of bones like a fish plate (aow! )
Yeah I'm from the hood, but now I'm living in a rich way
That's why I got on my knees and thank God for this day
So say watchu wanna say, I need to throw a cup of water in my face
First place I

G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down

If it don't stank like they stank, then they can't swallow that down
Your battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us—

Find a way to get out, a-without a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out

Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?

[Verse: Big Boi]
Hot tub, bad to the bony, I'm Tony
Ask my Grandmama Edna Mae Kearse—she showed me
How to be the smooth operator, dominator
In the state of Georgia, hip-hop standard destroyer
Leave a motherfucker open like a foyer
"He from the Dirty"— now here come the paranoia
A lawyer couldn't object or disrespect the technique
Sweat me, wipe off the sweat
Fight off the shit, and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Find my purpose on the surface of this Earth
This planet's standards trust and the purpose
Campaign in vain for the same lame fame you've obtained
You ought to be detained
By the Hip-Hop Sheriff, locked up, no possibility
Of getting out because the shit you make is killing me
And my ears, and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear, we disappear
Then reappear again in a fresh, new light
I hope it's peaceful and cloudy, 'cause if it's not, we gotta fight, like

[Pre-Chorus: André 3000]
G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down
O-U-T-K-A-S-T, just know that we won't wait 'round
If it don't stank like they stank, then they can't swallow that down
Your battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us—

[Chorus: André 3000]
Find a way to get out, a-without a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out
GhettoMusick
GhettoMusick (Woo)
Find a way to get in, to fit in, to get on
To get out, without a doubt
GhettoMusick
GhettoMusick

[Post-Chorus: Big Boi & Patti LaBelle]
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you, you?
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?

[Intro]
(Bring it)
Wooooo
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Haha, haha
What, what, what, what
Uh

[Verse 1]
On your mark ready set let's go, dance floor pro
I know you know I go psycho (Woo)
When my new joint hit, just can't sit
Gotta get jiggy wit it, ooh, that's it
Now honey honey come ride, DKNY
All up in my eye, you got a Prada
Bag with a lot-a, stuff in it (Ugh, ugh, ugh)
Give it to your friend let's spin, everybody lookin' at me
Glancin' the kid, wishing they was dancin' a jig
Here with this handsome kid, ciga-cigar
Right from Cuba-Cuba, I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it
Illway the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay (Haha)
Give it up jiggy make it feel like foreplay (Woo)
Yo my cardio is infinite, ha-ha
Big Willie style's all in it
Gettin' jiggy wit it

[Verse 2]
What? You want to ball with the kid?
Watch your step (Woo), you might fall trying to do what I did
Mama (Ugh) mama (Ugh) mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, uh
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad 'cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty-yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali—he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off, a-go off
Ah, yes-yes y'all (Woo), ya don't stop
In the winter or the (Summertime), I makes it hot
Gettin' jiggy wit 'em

[Chorus]
(Na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na na na)

(Na na na na na na)

[Verse 3]
Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from South Street to one-two-fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
C.R.E.A.M. to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill, but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me?
Don't be silly
Gettin' jiggy wit it

[Outro]
(Na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na na na)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na na na)
Gettin' jiggy wit it

(Na na na na na na)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na na na)
Uh uh

[Intro: Protestor]
I'ma say this and I'ma end mine
If you ain't down for the Africans here in the United States
Period, point-blank
If you ain't down for the ones that suffered in South Africa from apartheid and shit
Dammit, you need to step your punk-ass to the side
And let us brothers and us Africans step in
And start puttin' some foot in that ass!

[Bridge: All]
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die

[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger]
Dem wonder why mi violent, dem no really understand
For de reason why mi take mi law in mi own hand
Mi not out for peace and mi not Rodney King
De gun goes click, mi gun goes bang
Dem riot in Compton and dem riot in Long Beach
Dem riot in L.A. 'cause dem no really wanna see
Niggas start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricade us like Beirut
Mi don't show no love 'cause it's us against dem
Dem never, ever love me 'cause it's sport to break dem
And kill, at my own risk, if I may
To lay, to spray with my AK, and put 'em to rest

[Interlude: Reporter]
Yes, we have—there have been riots, ah, uh, rioting
Well, I don't wanna say rioting, but there's been looting downtown
But right now, Bree, what I want to show you is
They have started fires down at the end of the street

[Refrain: All & Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
How many niggas are ready to loot?
Yeah, so what you wanna do? What you wanna do?
I said, how many niggas are ready to loot?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9

[Interlude: Interviewee]
That's what they told us today, "In other words, you still a slave"
No matter how much money you got, you still ain't shit!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Sitting in my living room, calm and collected
Feeling that gotta-get-mine perspective
'Cause what I just heard broke me in half
And half the niggas I know, plus the niggas on the Row is bailing
Laugh now, but cry much later
You see, when niggas get together, they get mad 'cause they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles
They found that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
With the Ese's helpin', nigga, it's time to rob and mob
And break the white man off something lovely, biddy-bye-bye
I don't love dem so dem can't love me
Yo, straight puttin' it down, gettin' my scoot on
It's jumping off in Compton so I gots to get my loot on
And come up on me some furniture or somethin'
Got a VCR in the back of my car
That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
'Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
'Cause I'ma cock my Glock and pop 'til they all drop

[Interlude: Reporter & Reporter 2]
Yes, on the videotape we seem to have the, uh
People in the crowd throwing things at the officers
And swinging at them as well
As there was a, uh, young woman there, you see, took a swing at—
At an officer with some object in her hand

[Refrain: All & Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
How many niggas are ready to loot?
Yeah, so what you wanna do? What you wanna do?
I said, how many niggas are ready to loot?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die

[Verse 3: RBX]
One-time trigger happy, no nigga love
One-eighty-seven time, time to grab the glove
Can't get prints on a nine I throw away
Or get prints on my Uzi when it spray
Pop-pop, pop, another motherfucker drop
And I get relief like, plop, plop, fizz
Smash, I crashed his head like a window
I ain't Nintendo, I'm high off the indo
Creepin', with the quickness to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on a donut
And crack-up, so now he best to back up
I guess I gots to pack up, filling the clip up
I zip uptown but motherfuckin' cops are all around
Helicopters flyin', these motherfuckers tryin'
To catch me and stretch me on Death Row
But hell no, the poor blacks refuse to go

[Interlude: Reporter 2]
This now covers a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these fires have been, uh, ignited
I mean, from here to the, uh, to the south end of South Central is a long way

[Bridge: All]
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'

[Verse 4: Daz Dillinger]
The outcome of this is destruction, so them all fall
Niggas don't give a fuck, so them bust and them fall
The description of three blacks
Shows no justice, so, pick up it's your right
If you riot again, mi, turn the other cheek
We, be too many, mi got, mi nine to my side
So mi bust, flick, 'cause he don't give a fuck
And mi don't give a fuck
And all my problems end with that buck-buck

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Blam, blam, blam 'til dem fall
Listen to the shots from a nigga Doggy Dogg, biddy-bye
Dr. Dre, him bust gun shots
Diggidy Daz and RBX, dem bust gun shots
Come again

[Skit: Warren G + Woman]
*Dial tone, dialing, television in background*
Let me call this old bitch, see what this bitch doing
Call this bitch, raggedy-ass, shit, man
Hello?
What's up?
Nothing, what you doing?
Nothing, just kicking it
Are y'all done?
Nah, what you gon' do today?
Um, pick up my clothes from the cleaners, I think I'll  go get my nails done
Serious?
Why? What's up?
Ay, did, did what's-your-name done get at you yesterday?
Who?
Deez nuts!
Aw, shut up, nigga

[Intro: Rudy Ray Moore]
"I wanna ask you one question
If I had some nuts, hanging on the wall, what would I have honey?"
I said, "Darlin', you'd have some walnuts"
She said, "Well, daddy, if I had some nuts on my chest, would those be chestnuts?" I said, "Hell yeah"
She said, "Well daddy if I had nuts under my chin would those be chin-nuts?"
I said, "Hell no, bitch, you'd have a dick in your mouth!"

[Chorus: Dr. Dre + Snoop Dogg]
Chicky-check, microphone check one
Chicky-check, microphone check two
Chicky-check, microphone check three
Check game from the notorious Compton G

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Back with some shit that gots to bump
As you pull up in the park, you pops your trunk
Just to floss it like a motherfucker, clowning and shit
Got your Dana's on your hooptie and your fly-ass bitch
Throw off, go off, show off, I take that ho
If she proper, I'ma pop her, the ho hopper
Is back on track
With big money, big nuts and a big fat chronic sack

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg]
So Daz, step up on they ass
And give these motherfuckers a blast from the past

[Verse 2: Dat Nigga Daz]
Diggidy Daz out of the cut with some shit that I wrote
With my nigga D-R-E, so you know I must be dope
But, uh, rat-tat-tat-tat that ass
Starting static with Dre, make way for the AK
That I bring as I slang like cavi
Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy
Had he not known about the city I'm from
(Long Beach, tic-tac, grab your gat, watch your back)
Here I come, stomping in my khaki suit
B.G. from the hood, kinfolk Eastwood
God damn, I ripped up, flipped up, and skipped up
On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg]
But could you raise up off his nuts?
'Cause Dr. Drizzae's about to rizzip shit up

[Chorus: Dr. Dre + Snoop Dogg]
Chicky-check, microphone check one
Chicky-check, microphone check two
Chicky-check, microphone check three
You're tuned to the sounds of the D-R-E

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Now check me out, it's back to the old school
Where the niggas get they scrap on, don't nobody cap on
Slap on some D-R-E
Or some funky-ass shit by the D-O-double-G-Y D-O-double-G
Real G's who drop ki's
Protect these N-U-T's, so nigga please
Peep out my manuscript
You'll see that it's a must I drop gangsta shit (Biatch)
So recognize game from the gangsta
Things will remain the same until I change 'em

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg]
It's real easy to see
So you can check sounds from Nate D-O-double-G

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin' street
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin' street
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin' street
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin' street
I heard you wanna fuck with Dre
You picked the wrong motherfuckin' day
Here we go, toe-to-toe, blow-for-blow
Let me know if you think you can fade Death Row
I heard you wanna fuck with Dre
You picked the wrong motherfuckin' day
Here we go, toe-to-toe, blow-for-blow
Let me know if you think you can fade Death Row
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin' street
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin' street

[Skit: Dr. Dre & Man]
*"Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')" plays*
Yeah, nigga, what's up with all that motherfuckin' shit you was talkin', nigga? (Hey, why you trippin'?)
Huh? (Hey Dre, why you trippin', why you trippin'?)
Fuck that, nigga, what's up with all that shit you was talkin', nigga? (I ain't say nothing, why you trippin'?)
You're a motherfuckin' liar, nigga, that was you (Nah, that wasn't me!)
That was you, nigga (That wasn't me!), hey—
Hey, check this out, motherfucker
What's wrong, nigga? (It wasn't!)
You can't talk with a gun in your mouth? (Nah, it wasn't me, Dre!)
You can't talk with a gun in your mouth? (It wasn't me!)
Listen up, nigga, you know Lucifer? (Nah)
Well, you're about to meet him, motherfucker

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & The Kay-Gees]
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Forty-four reasons come to mind
Why a motherfuckin' brother is hard to find
He been walking on the streets and fuckin' with mine
Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind
See, I never take a step on a Compton block
Or L.A. without the AK ready to pop
'Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight
I think it's better to be tellin' the facts than cuffed up
And jacked and fucked up
What you niggas looking at? You going
"Goddamn!" 'Cause it's the city
And for you to survive, a nigga gotta be a gangsta
And I'm a nigga you can't remove
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin' to prove
To they homies that they can hang by dealin' with me
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D
I never did time on a murder yet
'Cause I relax, sit back, do a job and jet
Yo, I know you understand my flow
So here we go, and Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & The Kay-Gees]
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
D-R-E, a motherfucker who's known for carrying gats
And kick raps that make snaps, adapts to
Any environment that I'm located at
If you see me on the solo move believe that I'm strapped
Four-four, tray-eight or AK-47
'Cause slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
And lay a punk motherfucker flat
As he wonder what popped before he got popped
I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop
Now I know you understand my flow
So here we go, and Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & The Kay-Gees]
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun

[Bridge: Dr. Dre]
I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, yeah
I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, yeah

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
I breaks 'em off, but I ain't speaking about between the thighs
I'm talking about cocking a gauge in between your eyes
It'll make you drop to your knees 'cause you realize
That a gat'll make any nigga civilized
Old buster-ass nigga talking bullshit
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the doctor
A nigga that breaks 'em off properly
Real G so don't doubt it
I'm the one who's doin' it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my forty-four Desert Eagle to his motherfuckin' dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name is Dre Eastwood when I'm packing a gun
You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try
And if you die, you's a buster, 'cause real niggas don't die
But some still don't hear me, though
You're too near me not to hear me, nigga, yo
So now you know

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & The Kay-Gees]
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun

[Intro]
This should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential area

[Verse 1: The Lady of Rage]
Now I'ma kick up dust as I begin to bust
On the wick-wack, fucked up suckers you can't trust
When I kick up, I lick up, your face get smacked up
When I rack up, so all you mothafuckas just pack up
Or get slapped with the swiftness
If you think you're swift with the gift, Merry Christmas
Now stuff that in your stockin'
I'm knockin' 'em out the box and
Knockin' 'em out their socks and 'cause Robin is rockin'
Breakin' 'em down to the slab
Takin' 'em down on their ass
Now what you wanna do? Ya wanna battle? Uh
Send you up shit creek without a motherfuckin' paddle
Rattle that brain, I'm not the same old plain Jane
Roll on you like a boulder, you're nothin' more than a grain
Or a pebble, take it from the real rap rebel
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to that other level
You think you got pull? Then pull it, uh
I got the trigger so I figure you'll bite the bullet
Then bite the dust and wipe the fuss
Do what I must, and what I must is bust
A bubble or two, some trouble for you
So skip to my Luger, Lady of Rage is comin' through

[Interlude: B-Real]
Some cool shit
Some cool shit
Boo-ya, spittin' out buckshots

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
I fears no one, I makes 'em cool off like the polar cap
Clenchin' as the hits misses the roller's back
Pushin' packs to make a profit
Diggy dope duck on the topic, so stop and give me my props, kid
I'm livin' large like a fat bitch
So get back, bitch, I'm hard to bogart so the fact is
This young black kid a mercenary, merciless
Murderin' millions of niggas, so who's first to diss?
They say I'm bad, so you'll find none worse than this
Chewin' motherfuckers up like a Hershey's Kiss
Put to sleep, loving the lyrics I leave in the minds of each
Rough when flex, too complex, wrecks your mental piece
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half, niggas
You're quick to talk shit, I whoop your ass, nigga
Then watch me blast, nigga, 'cause I'm the last nigga
You wanna fuck wit', so up your cash, nigga
I make 'em stagger, I'm scandalous as Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a good tracker, scopin' your girl then watch me tag her
Pullin' steel like a stunt
Shown like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so
Here to torment, I put track on crack
And I'm strapped with a semi-tone milli-ten Mac
Yo, I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, chief
Deadly as Jason on Friday the 13th

[Interlude: B-Real]
A to the motherfuckin' K

[Verse 3: RBX]
Back in the days, niggas, they use to scrap
But now in '92, niggas, they pull their strap
'Cause, um, police, them come wicked then them shoot niggas
So niggas retaliate and start to loot
Execute, boot stompin'
Black soldier here to teach and mold ya
The innovator, dominator, narrator
R-B to the motherfuckin' X, flex wicked
Stylee, bump and be found and do bleed by a
Maniac with a gat
See, nowadays, niggas is like that
I pull my trigger back, the bullets go
Buh-buh-buh, now I'm on death row
Fuck it, niggas goin' wild
Every night they shoot, it's like Beirut
Maybe you should get a Kevlar vest for your chest
Anytime steppin' through my hood
But that'll do you no good
One slug to your face, don't hate
You're gettin' smoked like wood
Nasty nigga, bloody pumps, face flat
On the concrete, here comes the white sheet
Mr. Coroner, caught with some yellow tape
But the murderers escape
Audi like five G's
Lyrical gangbang but it's just a G thang

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yo, yo, what's up?
Yo, man, give me some of that old, gangsta-ass shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
Some shit I can just kick back, smoke a fat-ass joint to
You know what I'm saying? Haha
Hell yeah, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
I like that old gangsta shit
'Cause you know it's a lot of niggas out there
Woofin' all that bullshit, talkin' 'bout they got this and got that
Talkin' louder than a motherfucker but ain't sayin' shit
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, nigga, I see your lips quivering
But you ain't sayin' a motherfucking thing
But my niggas, I got my niggas in the motherfuckin' house
And they gon' tell you what's really going on
Got my motherfuckin' nigga RBX definitely in this motherfucker
I got my nigga Daz in this motherfucker, ready to kick some real shit
Know what I'm saying?
And that little shit you hear in the background?
That's my homegirl Rage
So, RBX, kick this shit

[Verse: RBX]
Seven execution style murders
I have no remorse 'cause I'm the fuckin' murderer
Haven't you ever heard of a killer?
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
So now I walk around strapped
One-time bust they caps and watch niggas collapse
Snap, adapt to this, but you need no adapter
This is just the first chapter
In a book from a crook
You get caught slippin', your ass gots to die
Nigga, tell me what the fuck you figure
Trigger happy, RBX to cap you
Pump, pump, and I can't wait to bust a round
Pump, pump, my hollow point smacks the clown
'Cause what I said split his head
And now they got me running from the feds
But I refuse to go alive
It's kill or be killed, that's how real niggas survive
I'm high powered

[Outro: Dat Nigga Daz]
Yeah
It's Daz, that mass-murdering motherfucker
So, what, you feel like you wanna get caught up?
Fool, you better recognize
Death Row came to chastise
So if you cross the Row
Remember the first name is Death
No love for the other side

[Intro: Bushwick Bill]
"Yes, it is I," says me
And all who agree are more than three 'cause they're we, haha
Yes, yo, I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within them?
But let's take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this path called

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Stranded on death row, so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggas know the flow that I kick, there's no equal
I'm murderin' niggas, yo, and maybe because of the tone I kicks
When I grip the mic and kick shit niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore and slam
'Nough respect like a sensei, whoop ass like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin'
Why don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson?
Take a walk through the hood where we up to no good
Slangin' them things like a real O.G. should
I'm stackin' and mackin' and packin' a ten so
When you're slippin', I slip the clip in, but ain't no set trippin'
'Cause it's Death Row, rollin' like the mafia
Think about whoopin' some ass, but what the fuck stoppin' ya?
Ain't nothin' but a buster
I'm stranded on death row for pumpin' slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone, feel the shotgun
Kurupt, inmate, cell block one

[Verse 2: RBX]
No prevention from this lynchin' of sorts
You're a victim from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braille
From a lunatic, I'm death like arsenic
When I kick a wicked rap, Dr. Dre will hit the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it many storms
When I'm vexed, I fight leg, necks, and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor, and the tormentor
Deranged, like the Hillside Strangler
Emcee mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do?
The narrator RBX, cell block two

[Verse 3: The Lady of Rage]
Rage, lyrical murderer
Stranded on death row and now I'm servin' a
Lifetime sentence, there'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead, I plead guilty
On all counts, let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck 'em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame, there's another dead, bang
Laying lame, put to shame, who's to blame?
Me, the Lady of Rage, a woman comin'
From the D-E-A-T-H and R-O-W, takin' no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped
It's 1-8-7 on motherfuckers, don't stop
Handcuffed as I bust, there'll be no debate
It's Rage, from cell block H

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Ayo, steppin' through the fog and creepin' through the smog
It's the number one nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg
Making videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Bustin' raps for my snaps, now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homie, little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shootin' at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row 'cause I wanted to make a grip from servin' my rocks
And I'm still serving for mine
Peace to my motherfuckin' homies doing time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbin' with your blues on, mad as hell
And you're sayin', "Fuck the police"
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's driving the cops crazy
But ain't nothin' but a black thing, baby
Uh, I'm not flaggin', but I'm just saggin'
I bet'cha don't wanna see the D-O-double-G
And you can't see the D-R to the E
Or my motherfuckin' homie D.O.C
You know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin' DJ
That's my homie and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break 'em down with the motherfuckin' Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat 'em, man
We gotta smoke 'em then choke 'em like the motherfuckin' Peterman
It's like three and to the two and two and to the one
Cell block four, peace, Doggy Dogg's done

[Outro: Bushwick Bill]
Yo, now you know the path I'm on
You think you're strong?
See if you can travel on
'Cause only the weak will try to speak
Those who are quiet will always cause riots
There's three types of people in the world
Those who don't know what happened
Those who wonder what happened
And people like us from the streets that make things happen

[Verse 1]
Yes sir is Bobby Ray, aka A. B.o.B. (O)
I can't be eco-conscious, I'm always burning trees
And this that fire, fire, call it that third degree
And call me supersonic I shake the earth beneath ya
Hell yeah you heard of me, quite an emergency
The way I take the game and I beat it so un-unmercifully, yeah
Ladies with curly features, wait at concerts to see you
They can roll home with B.O., and maybe service me up
But if you wanna work for me then girl you need your working visas
And if you ain't working then you just should not converse with me
That's not that serious, don't take it so personally
Plus currently I prefer the girls who prefer the three C.P.O
C.P.O. I think I think I'm Neo
I'm caught up in her Matrix and I think it's time to reload
And if this were a court, then girl I would have to appeal
I think that the defendant have some things that she must reveal
Heels ha, heels ha, tell me what's the deal, ma
Got me chasing you to see if I could cop a feel, huh
I gotta keep it real, kosher, kosher, kosher
Cause she don't want that bullshit, no sir, no sir, no sir
Her thighs go round like roller-coaster motors
And like a minute bundle, I had to roll them over
Had to connect the headset into her Motorolla
This bout to get scary like the end of October

[Hook]
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold

[Verse 2]
So cold like a hobo wearing no clothes in a snow globe when the temperature is below froze
I mean below freezing and there's no reason to be so cheesy, got my own team and my own league
My own lane and my own speed, it's a long road so I don't sleep
If I don't know you I don't speak, it's a small world and it's gonna shrink
If you're full of shit, then you're gonna stink
I'm a realist I'm gonna think, with a pair of eyes so I'm gonna see
I'll be whatever the fuck I wanna be, I'll be everything except a wanna be
I'll be everything you ever wanna be, if you're clever enough you can corner me
But what's a corner to me, I'm geometry
So tell me who gave you the authority? Who the fuck are you? The authority?
What am I supposed to be orderly? pardon my honor you're charging me?
Saying something I oughta be but I got some much heart that my arteries will always be partying like a camaraderie
Man I'm already famous historically so my story is already glorious
Just like P Diddy victorious to the B.I.G. Notorius
I'm a champion, I'm a warrior, I bring war to ya
So if you got beef that's unfortunate, we'll hang ya'll out like portraits

[Hook]
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold

[Verse]
Yes, I feel the end, the end is close
The same thing happened eons ago
To know exactly you have to read up some more
Everyday technology speeds up some more
As is above, so is below
Some feel the heat, yet some feel the cold
We are the souls, yes, we have been chose
Some roll with angels and demons and ghosts
But shh! Hold up, Bob, don’t go there!
You know that they watching, the all-seeing stare
But they can’t stop me, I’m already there
And y’all ain't seen shit but y’all already scared
I’m gone, high like fructose, fructose
You wanna know the truth? Really, you don't, you don't
It’ll blow you out your mind, like a UFO, UFO
I’m basically a resident of Pluto, Pluto
You know, but you’ll probably be the same one hatin'
Sayin' every rapper is in the freemasons
While the cops giving out free mace to your face
Now how do that taste? I’m outta my mind
These videos tellin’ y'all lies, bruh
Tellin' y'all we holding evil hand-signs, bruh
Last time I checked I’m from the Eastside, bruh
So do your research and make your own mind up
’Cause us musicians have influence on this mic
But they don’t like that, so they conquer and divide
Double-H N-D, hip hop never dies
So shoot all you want, but we fly
Because, you know, no one man should have all that power
Obviously ‘cause it’s only one power
But nevermind, y’all keep worshipping Towers
While the clock keeps handing y'all hours
But pucker up because the truth gets sour
More sour than the sour diesel I devour
Hear me by the hour, I give you 50 vowels
When I brain storm it's like a shower
So pull out your towels, and don't let 'em play you
Do your own thing, fuck what they do!
And if you good at somethin' make sure they pay you
And if not, take a thankyou
Whether they praise you, or whether they hate you
It’s all about the attention that they pay you
Y’all on that grape drink, try this grape juice
Shouts to Grand Hustle, we got that break through
And, yes, it’s evident we better than
The rest of these competitors
Really there ain't no one else ahead of us
Yeah, I bust these verses off, et cetera, et cetera
‘Cause they watching y’all like the Federers, owww

[Outro]
Kadoish, kadoish, kadoish
Adonai Tsebayoth
It’s B.O.B. and I’m out. Peace!

[Verse 1]
If I tell you, if I tell you now
Will you keep on, will you keep on loving me?
If I tell you, if I tell you how I feel
Will you keep bringing out the best in me?

[Chorus]
You give me, you give me the sweetest taboo
You give me, you're giving me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me

[Verse 2]
There's a quiet storm and it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm that is you
There's a quiet storm and it never felt this hot before
Giving me something that's taboo
(Sometimes I think you're just too good for me)

[Chorus]
You give me the sweetest taboo
That's why I'm in love in with you (with you)
You give me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me
(Sometimes I think you're just too good for me)

[Verse 3]
I'd do anything for you, I'd stand out in the rain
Anything you want me to do, don't let it slip away
There's a quiet storm and it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm, I think it's you
There's a quiet storm and I never felt this hot before
Giving me something that's taboo

[Chorus]
You give me the (you give me, you give me the) sweetest taboo
That's why I'm in love with you (with you)
You give me, keep giving me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me

[Outro]
You've got the biggest heart
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me
Every day is Christmas, and every night is New Year's Eve
Will you keep on loving me
Will you keep on, will you keep on
Bringing out the best in me

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go 'bout your day, baby
While I hide from the sun

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
It's better if you don't understand
'Cause you won't know what it's like until you try

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

[Verse 2: CeeLo Green]
We would live forever
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted
But baby, what for?

[Pre-Chorus: CeeLo Green]
It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you try

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just got to decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

[Verse 3: B.o.B.]
If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland, it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line, you can't change your mind
Yeah, I'm a monster, but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly, I've been feelin' insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was, you would run and hide
Many have tried to go into the night
And cross over the line, and come back alive
But that's the price we paying when we living on the other side

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

[Outro: B.o.B]
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand

[Sample: Notorious B.I.G]
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see ya picture
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see ya picture
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya

[Intro]
One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

[Verse 1]
Up so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl, say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm, the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
'Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it

[Verse 2]
And I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'ma sip this drank until that muhfucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on

[Chorus]
I don't give you the time you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight, I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow
But I do it to her

[Bridge]
Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end

[Outro]
Ayy, yeah
I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation, you know
I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 PM and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like, like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone
O Death, where is thy sting?
O Grave, where is thy victory?
O Life, you are a shining path
And hope springs eternal, just over the rise
When I see my redeemer beckoning me

Oh row my ship over the waves of your sea
Let me find a safe port now and then
Don't let the dark one in your sanctuary
Until it's time to pack it in

O, row, row my ship
With the fire of your breath
And don't lay a broadside on your ship as yet
Blow ye warm winds
When it's chilly and wet
And don't come to soon yet
For collecting my debt

O Death, where is thy sting?
O Grave, where is thy victory?
O Life, you are a shining path
And hope springs eternal, just over the rise
When I see my redeemer beckoning me
Oh let me sail on
With my ship to the East
And keep my eye on the North Star
When the journey is no good for man or for beast
I'll be safe wherever you are

Just let me sail into your harbor of lights
And there and forever to cast out my line
Give me my task
And let me do it right
And do it with all of my might

[Verse 1]
Well, I saw it advertised one day
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way
"Come along and take a trip
We'll bring you up there on a ship
Bring the wife and family
Bring the whole kids"
Yippee

[Verse 2]
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
To this thing called the Bear Mountain picnic
Little did I realize
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise
Had nothing to do with picnic
Didn't come close to a mountain
And I hate bears

[Verse 3]
Took the wife and kids down to the pier
There was six thousand people there
Everybody had a ticket for the trip
"Oh well," I said "it's a pretty big ship
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier"

[Verse 4]
Well, we all got on, and what do you think?
That big old boat started to sink
More people kept a-piling on
That old ship was a-going down
Funny way to start a picnic

[Verse 5]
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife
So many people, I never saw in my life
That old ship was sinking down in the water
There was six thousand people trying to kill each other
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming
Women a-yelling, men a-flying, fists a-flying
Paper flying, cops a-coming, me a-running
Maybe we just better call off the picnic

[Verse 6]
I got shoved down, got pushed around
All I remember was a moanin' sound
Don't remember one thing more
All I remember is waking up on the shore
My arms and legs were broken
My feet were splintered
My head was cracked
I couldn't walk
I couldn't talk, smell, feel
Couldn't see
Didn't know where I was
I was bald
Quite lucky to be alive though

[Verse 7]
Well, feeling like I just climbed out of my casket
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket
Took the wife and kids and started home
Wishing I'd never got up that mornin'

[Verse 8]
Now, I don't care just what you do
If you want a have a picnic, that's up to you
But don't tell me about it, I don't want to hear it
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit
Stay in my kitchen, have my own picnic
Have a picnic in the bathroom

[Verse 9]
Well, it don't seem to me quite so funny
What some people are going to do for money
There's a brand new gimmick every day
Just to take somebody's money away
I think we ought to take some of these people
And put them on a boat, send them up to Bear Mountain
For a picnic
Some see life as a broken promise
Some see life as an endless fight
They think they live in the age of darkness
They think they live in the age of Light

It's an angry world
And everything is gonna be all right
Yeah it's an angry world
Yeah it's an angry world
Some see life as hope eternal
Some see life as a business plan

Some will go to hell's inferno
For screwing up their life in freedom land

It's an angry world
For the business man and the fisher man
It's an angry world
And no doubt everything will go as planned
Yeah it's an angry world
Yeah it's an angry world

[Verse 1]
I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Whoa)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah"
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 

[Verse 2]
Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like, "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town"
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah"
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 

[Bridge]
Feel like hopping on a flight (On a flight)
Back to my hometown tonight (Town tonight)
Something stops me every time (Every time)
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright (Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up
They're playing my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah" (N-n-n-noddin' my head)
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah" (Ooh, yeah)
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay (Gonna be okay)
Yeah (Na-na, na-na), it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
So I put my hands up
They're playing my song, the butterflies fly away (Flying away)
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah" (Noddin' my head like, "Yeah")
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah" (Movin' my hips like, "Yeah")
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay (I'm gonna be okay)
Yeah (Yeah), it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah (Ha-ha-ha-ha), it's a party in the U.S.A. 

[Verse 1]
Walking up to me expecting
Walking up to me expecting words
It happens all the time

Present company excepted
Present company except the worst
It happens every night

[Hook 1]
Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company excluded every time
Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company, the best that you can find

[Verse 2]
Talking like a jerk
Except you are an actual jerk
And living proof that sometimes friends are mean

Present company expect it
Present company, just laugh it off
It's better than it seems

[Hook 2]
Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company excluded in every way
Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company, makes me wanna stay
Go

[Verse 3]
Killing it with close inspection
Killing it can only make it worse
It sort of makes it breed

Present company accepting
Presently we all expect the worst
It works just like a need

[Hook 3]
Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company excluded in the night
Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company included in the fight

[Interlude]
Ah-ahhhhhhh
Ah-ah-ahhhh
Ahhhhh
Ah-ahhhh

[Verse 4]
Don't you want me to wake up
Then give me just a bit of your time
Arguments are made for make-ups
So give it just a little more time

We've got to bring the resources
I wanna play it 'til the time comes
Forget your string of divorces
You go and throw your little hands up

[Bridge 1]
It's late
Oh
Honey, it's late
Oh

[Verse 5]
I miss the way the night goes
With friends who always make it feel good
This basement has a cold glow
Though it's better than a bunch of others

[Chorus]
So go and dance yourself clean
Go and dance yourself clean
You're blowing Marxism to pieces
Their little arguments to pieces

[Bridge 2]
It's your show
It's your show
It's your show
It's your show
It's your show...

Put your little feet down
And hang out

[Breakdown]
Every night's a different story
It's a thirty car pile-up with you
Everybody's getting younger
It's the end of an era, it's true

[Bridge 3]
And you go
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop

[Verse 6]
Break me into bigger pieces
So some of me is home with you
Wait until the weekend
And we can make our bad dreams come true

And it's a-go
Yeah, it's a-go
And if we wait until the weekend
We can miss the best things to do

[Chorus]
Go and dance yourself clean, ah
Go and dance yourself clean, yeah
You're blowing Marxism to pieces
Their little arguments to pieces

[Outro]
We should try a little harder
In the tedious march of the few
Every day's a different warning
There's a part of me hoping it's true

[Verse 1]
It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Verse 2]
'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Verse 3]
So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

[Chorus 2]
So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say

'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

[Chorus/Outro]
And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Chorus: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Can you imagine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot motherfucker, watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross water smugglers tussle to burn weed
It meets that pressure to success in the South
Niggas watching what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk, I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holding the torch
When the skin rebuilds, it grows tougher than leather
So we can keep on hold it forever
My name's Kardinall

[Chorus: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 2: Drake]
Jealousy is something I haven't felt in years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
Dawg, I'm incredible fuckin unforgettable, but when it comes to records I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always for-seen
That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em' cause he won't let no other niggas write for em'
And even when its quite warm, the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The name's Drake and I don't take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage man

[Chorus: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 1]
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 A.M
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone."

[Chorus 2]
You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (See it now)

[Verse 1]
Wouldn't ever gag you with a spoon, my only true love
Never really heard you speak that way, it's unworthy of
Funny how that little college girl called language corrupt
Funny how the other private schools had no Hapa Club
Someone took a trip before you came to ski in the Alps
Your father moved across the country just to sunburn his scalp
Contra Costa, Contra Mundum, contradict what I say
Living like the French Connection, but we'll die in LA

[Chorus]
Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English

[Verse 2]
No one sits inside a freezing flat and stays there 'til May
Leafing through a stack of A-Zs to surf the UK
Waiting with the wind against your face and gel in your hair
Shivering in little undershirts, but don't seem to care

[Chorus]
Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English

[Bridge]
Sweet carob rice cake, she don't care how the sweets taste
Fake Philly cheese steak but she use real toothpaste
'Cause if that Tom's don't work, if it just makes you worse
Would you lose all of your faith in the good earth?
And if it's all a curse, and we're just getting worse
Baby, please don't lose your faith in the good earth

[Chorus]
Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English
Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English

[Intro]
Okay
Fuck it, I don't care
The appeal
When I fuckin' came to this fuckin' country
All I had was a dollar and a dream

[Verse 1]
We need more Rosé
My bitches gettin' thirsty
My words like New Years
Christmas came early
Got these bitches urling, my earring's perfect
My left pinky finger rollin' like George Gervin
My name ain't Ervin but call me Magic
Abra cadabra, top off the Phathom
458 Italia, first in the states
Out of town plates, just to make it look great
I need a haircut plus a carwash
I get out the car and they take their bra's off
See I fought the law and the fuckin' law won
Came back on appeal wanna new outcome
Overload your eardrums, hear it hear it come
Income income, go and get you sum
Say bye to the Bad guy
Wave bye to the Bad guy
Gucci Mane the bad guy
Yes, I am the Bad guy
Wave bye to the Bad guy

[Refrain]
I came to this country with a dollar and a dream
And a choppa and a team full of killas, what you mean
I'm a bad guy, bad guy from start til the end
Say hello to my little friend
I could've been a doctor, should've been a lawyer
I go to court so much I could've been my own employer
I'mma die a dope boy, always been a hustler
Started off custom now I say hello to my little friend

I got sixty racks layin' on the floor in Magic City
Like Samuel L Jackson I think it's time for killin'
I touched his wife titty and the nigga start trippin'
That ain't proper etiquette you see the bitch strippin'
AR-15 ripped his ass into pieces
Don't get it twisted think it's all about the pieces
And all about the bracelets
I'm still fighting cases
Ten thousand for the glasses
Diamonds in they faces
Your own blood taste it
We stomp you till you tasteless
My t-shirt ain't tailored
You read what is said, bitch
Brick squad bossman off with you head, bitch
Run for the exit
They shootin' inside here
Parking lot gun fight bodies outside here
Police best bet come with the riot gear
Soldiers down to die here
Move to America
Dollar and a dream and a donor picture, tear it up

[Verse 1: Bobby Womack]
On the cloud of unknowing
My world seems open
Every satellite up here is watching
But I was here from the very start
Trying to find a way to your heart

[Verse 2: Bobby Womack]
All the days of forgetting
They've gone out with the tide
Lost at sea somewhere, waiting
Like setting suns at the rodeo
Trying to find someone you'll never know

[Verse 3: Bobby Womack]
Oh, sinking love
On the cloud of unknowing
Every satellite up here is watching
Waiting to see what the morning brings
May bring sunshine on its wings

[Intro]
Yeah
Tay you know, you know I told you, many times you my favorite rapper right?
So I'mma start this off like you would do it
Uh, shout out to DJ Wristpect
October's Own!
Drizzy, haha
Here I go!
Uh

[Verse]
Look, I stands out
Don't think this ain't some shit that I done planned out
And life is beautiful as ever when it pans out
And girls are beautiful until they want a hand out
But, hah, ask Apple how I get it though
I'll be on the phone with a bitch that you will never know
So you can son me never
I don't get bitter, I just get better
And a verse is just a verse for me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
If I was in a room and someone yelled, "Hey bitches!"
I would never turn around cause I just don't fit the description, hah
But that's just me though
But don't mind him girl, that's just Freako
Please don't cuss girl, that don't suit ya
His name 40 and his name Future
Oliver's here and you know me ho
I'm the cash cow front man of OVO
I am not doing features now, no means no
And the hate starts building the more we grow
Damn shame am I over-expressing the game
Should I hold back on addressing the lame?
Cause they becoming obsessed with my name
I'm trying to clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my progression insane
My engineer is the best in the game
And ever since I've been messing with Wayne
People getting jealous I can see they expressions have changed
They seemed to love me when this shit was going nowhere
And now they got a bunch of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the fuck it I'm broke stare
And Drake was at the club and he balled like no hair
Living life from a whole different angle
Only see the road through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve
And I know this shit is hard to believe
You gone have to get over it

[Hook]
And all you talking ass niggas, get over it
And all you people that be hating, get over it
And all you women that I fucked, get over it
And yeah, I'm turning 22, get over it
You know you got to hear my records, get over it
My whole team getting rich, get over it
I got the city on my back, get over it
Get over it, get over it

[Outro]
Hahaha, DJ Wrispect
Little Brother
Pooh, 'Te
Big doe I see you homie, yeah

Thank Me Later coming soon, yeah
Just let me live man

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Clear the runway baby
I get money from Sunday to Sunday lady
Ohh behave I'm young, rich famous
Grinding, keep my pockets on Schwarzenegger
O.G in my Swisher so my blunt taste flavored, don't it?
Y'all niggas can get if you want it
Tryna catch a flight?
I'm in the back seat playing Xbox, car service just chillin'
Burners in the wall, money all through the ceiling
And Spitta on the phone, tell my dawg that we killin'
These fuckin blogs, they love a star and I'm flashin'
Life just like a movie
No casting. Ask if
The game been kinda slow but I'mma treat it like a Ashton
Pedal to the metal I'm mashin'
All we know is big money, medical weed, and fashion
So, try your best to imagine
Bro

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm rollin up another one
Starring out this window, window, window, windowwww
They tellin me to change how I'm livin', but it's all I know
You see me in every city on my way out to another one, another one, another one, another ooonne
You find me anywhere that paper go, go, oh, oh, ohhhhh

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Bong rips
Double S's with the floor shift
Windows 20/20 clear
Peep the 20's on the rear
Order the car service
If I feel as though I don't want steer
Bitches freeze in the Xenon headlights like a deer
But not out of fear, she looking cause its money over here
Shine from above these land lovers I'm a chandelier
My girl gotta pocket bubbler in her purse
She keep it G and pack the bowl with weed and let me hit it first
Ain't tryna be a hogg, dawgy all I want is what I'm worth
80 days, 80 stages baby all around the earth
Amazing race for the paper you suckas eattin' dirt
Chew some orbit gum, brush your teeth and scrape your tongue
Fresh as they come, second to none
Pretty woman flirt
Batting eyelashes they need guidance
Lace em up like my New Balance
And keep flyin'
The closest that you lames ever came
To the planes was a Palm Pilot

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm rollin up another one
Starring out this window, window, window, windowwww
They tellin me to change how I'm livin', but it's all I know
You see me in every city on my way out to another one, another one, another one, another ooonne
You find me anywhere that paper go, go, oh, oh, ohhhhh

[Intro: Lil Wayne]

Tell the story

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Born in New Orleans, raised in New Orleans
I will forever remain faithful, New Orleans
I thank you New Orleans, thank you Hollygrove
That's been my hood since a snotty-nose
I come through the hood, suicidal doors
I used to come through the hood on the handlebars
Gat in my draws, money in my pocket, crack in my jaws
I hope it don't dissolve
And you know I'm ducking Five-O and my moms
Young'un quick to go off like car alarms
Now, the young'un keep his mind on the Parmesan
Them other niggas ain't eating, like a Ramadan
Spit the shit that make you feel it in your chromosomes
Got some money, put my whole damn corner on
Young Carter, part three, I'm the cornerstone
Eagle Street, keep it going 'til homies home
And I'm just lightin' up my...

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Sample]
La, la la la la la la (Yeah)

La-la-la, la (Yeah, yeah)
La, la la la la la la (Can I kick it?)
La-la-la, la

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Can I kick my story to y'all?
My glory in God, my faith in my flow
I pray that I go where no other rapper has
And when you're rappin' as
Vivid as I, your limit is the sky, so I
Study B.I., I bang 2Pac
I hum Aaliyah, and Soulja Slim was a leader
Who am I not to follow greatness?
I give these MCs hell like they all atheists
Tell them hatin' niggas, "One!" like they in The Matrix
And tell the cops I can buy my own bracelets
I'ma keep the paper running like a pair of ASICS
Used to sport the Gucci Bucks, nigga, no laces
Striped Polo, five-pocket Girbaud
Mama got her tubes tied and rocking dolo
I used to have the starter jacket with the logo
And the hat—me, myself, I had the N-O: that's the Saints, nigga

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Sample]
La, la la la la la la
La-la-la, la (Yeah, yeah)
La, la la la la la la

La, la la la la la la (You know)
La-la-la, la (You know)
La, la la la la la la (Weezy, baby, yeah)
La-la-la, la

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
It's Lil Wayne, I'ma shine in the rain
Now, nothing gets cleared without me signing my name
I'm just headlining the game
Won't quit until I'm A-Rod in the game
They riding the bench, they not in the game
I misplaced the key to the lock and chain
My spot remain, like a bleach stain, or cranberry
It's Murder She Wrote like Angela Lansbury
I remember being small, man
New toys when my mom would win the card game
Got my gifts before Christmas—didn't have to wait for them
I had a ten-speeder, scooter, and a skateboard, haha!
Then we moved to the suburbs
Me and lil' Toya Johnson was lovebirds, aww, man!
And I swear, I feel born again
I'm in the building like the audience, just lightin' up my...

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Sample]
La, la la la la la la

Word to my mama, I'm gon' continue bombin'

What the fuck you niggas telling me? (Huh?)
You pups can't keep up with the pedigree (Get back)
Catch me where the weather be (Hah)
Somewhere in the seventies (Yeah), call myself settling
Palm trees, promethazine, but what's new? (Tell 'em)
Sometimes I can't cut through that rough loop (Yeah)
Get fucked so many times 'til it's fuck you (Fuck 'em)
So, how you wan' do it? Baby, we can get it
All you gotta do is say it and I'm with it
Money or murder, you my nigga (Yeah), my jelly preserver
I'ma ride, baby, 'til the judge give me a verdict, yeah
Hear me or heard me, I get it and serve it, 'cause (Yeah)
Every time I did it, I hit it and hurt it, yeah
Now I kill it, the mission accomplished, yeah
The niggas abolished, the bitches astonished, and (Yeah)
Then they pay homage, when did they find it? But
Now that they know, it's a must I remind 'em, so
They don't forget it, I underline it, and
I'm in the sky when the thunder's cryin', youngin
I been through all that, I done done what you sayin'
I put it down when the others was playin' (Yeah)
When the jungle was open, I rolled in with the riders
Stole food from the bears, and brought it back to the lions (Yeah)
Hold court with the apes, I'm a gorilla, but lighter (Yeah)
Got the eye of a tiger, the heart of a fighter, yeah
Start 'em, ignite 'em (Yeah), I walk through fire
Watch the flames start multiplyin', woo, yeah
Alter a nigga, nina talk to a nigga (Yeah)
Take a chunk out your body like a shark bit a nigga (Damn)
I'm awkward like Cartwright, fuck with a nigga
Shot ugly, but my arch right, come on, dawg, bark, bite (Nothin')
Fork in the road, I'm always going right
Nowadays, knowing life, ain't no more road lights (Woah)
We can't see, but we gon' make it to the finish line
It's right there, the goal line right behind the scrimmage line (Hut)
Touchdown, check the scoreboard, give me mines (Yeah)
Semi nine fit me fine, hit a nigga twenty times (Bah-bah-bah-bah, bah)
Damn, then one more to the face (Bah)
Just so they close the casket like I pay to close the case (Yeah)
I'm made, straight mafia shit
Front line, top rank, ready to die for my shit (Yeah)
And the obvious shit?
If I talk about my rivalry, they probably get rich
So fuck 'em, I'ma let 'em sit (Yeah)
And I ain't ducking 'cause I'm right here (Right here), I'm chestin' up
I don't care who at the top of the stairs, I'm steppin' up (Woah)
See, you fucking up the money, baby
And that ain't good business
You starting to look like a witness (Fuck 'em)
And this is for the gangsters and the bitches (Yeah)
The hustlers and the hoes (Yeah)
Crossover? Whatever, mainstream? No
'Cause Wayne thinks silent (Ah), Wayne'll never fold (Uh-uh)
You heard it right here if the game was ever told (Nigga)
Lift up your toes and look under a rug
Trust me, that's history under all that dust
So deep down in the dirty, there lies us (Who?)
Yeah, Cash Money Records, and I'm still upfront (Yeah)
Stunna, pop a bottle, baby, peel us a blunt
Let's eat and talk about all of the niggas we cut
But, you know what? Let's not fuck up our lunch
That's real shit if you ever seen such, church

[Outro]
Tha Mobb
Nigga

[Intro: Earl Sweatshirt]
I know everyone has their own fucking version of this
But no one did it justice, so
Here we go
Ugh

[Verse 1]
Tell your bitch to stop complaining 'bout her achy tits
Her body is a temple—I don't give a fuck, I'm atheist
Make me stop, make me, bitch, she mad because I taped the shit
And sent the tape to Ace and Taco—helps 'em fucking 'bate to it
Master, master, pretty bitch basher
Black and white bitch, mixed like she moo and chew grass or somethin'
Sorta like the shit, I guess I'd kinda like my bitch
If she wasn't a dyke motorcyclist with Tyson lisp
Wolf Gang on that "drive without a license" shit
On that "take Shake and Meka necks and fuckin' slice them shits"
Oh, how nice—now, you wanna say you like the shit
Because you bruised up, your neck sliced, and I ain't icing shit
Show me a rapper my age that say he nice as this
And I'll show you a faggot that say he hate Barbara Streisand flicks
Ha! Me and Berman swervin' in the jeep
I'm a nice guy in person, but a pervert in the sheets
And I'm magic with the words, murder Merlin over beats
Make the competition kiss the fuckin' curb, and then they weep

[Hook]
And then they drop, haha
Drop, bitch
Drop, drop
Drop, drop (Yo), bitch

[Verse 2]
The lambs get silenced and the fans get violent
Droppin' lines grimey like the hands of Odd Toddlers
Fucking Awesome arsenal of wolves in the pack I travel in
The battle ram, ramming 'em, rats get to tattling
Limbs swinging axes at you antonyms-of-savages
And praying that it damages, your hobby's what my passion is
Fuck that faggot shit, my niggas on that savage shit
Fucking the game and shoving daggers through the ass of it
I said, fuck that faggot shit, my niggas on that savage shit
Fucking the game and shoving daggers through the ass of it
Moving on to a Jessica, plannin' to make a mess of her
After a couple drinks and a session of anal sex with her
Like, "Hey there, intestines! My cock is erect next to you"
We the shit, like what you make—them niggas still ain't fresh as us

[Outro]
Eat a dick, bitch!

[Intro: Syd]
Hi, welcome to Fuckey Foods. Umm, this lane is open if, if you need, if you to check out. Uhh, you're buying uh, donuts and a pack of Diet Pepsi? Sweet, okay makes sense

[Tyler]
In this fucking line at Ralph's buying granola bars
Left my member's card
And now this shit gon' have an extra charge
This old bitch in front of me buying a color printer
TV dinners, tampons, soy milk, paint thinner

[Domo]
So here I am at the store for some chips
That I'mma pay for with dimes, nickels and quarters and shit
And I'm still high, so I'm tryna dip
But I'mma cut through the line to get outta this bitch

[Tyler]
What the fuck, who the fuck's this gay nigga in fake Gucci?
Jordan numbers, whatever, wood chain with a Jesus
Hey you, what the fuck you think you doing?

[Domo]
Nigga, fuck you, I'm just eating Ruffles and gotta lotta stuff, fool
So, why don't you fucking wipe that stupid look on your face

[Tyler]
Don't make me shoot up this place with lightsabers and guns
And shoot caps at kneecaps to make it harder to run
And put your ankles in some boards and pissy water for fun, ugh

[Domo]
Nigga, I'm a samurai, cut your skinny ass in half
Look up at the aftermath, blow some fucking hash and laugh

[Tyler]
I'm a fucking ninja and a jedi and I'm from Compton
Better pick a better option 'fore these Nikes get to stomping
Chomping at your oxygen cords, you fat fake Kenan Thompson
Like a virgin, cherry faggot, we could get it poppin'

[Domo]
I bet you lock and drop it, faggot bitch, you ain't from Compton
Dumbo ears, you Mary Poppins, with the piece that Kel was rockin
I will fucking beat your ass, box logos through the glass
I'll hit you hooky like you skipping class, Lee would get the math

[Tyler]
Oh, really? You're silly giving tip drills to Nelly
Get them Ruffles no Lays cause Kiara might kill me
Aw, fuck this! I'm grabbing two kitchen knives
And stabbing this Ice Cube look-a-like
To show you a nigga with attitude

[Domo]
Wait, I heard about you from that other nigga Earl
How you traveled to Milan and now it only likes girls
I'll roundhouse you into a fucking basket
Push you into an old lady bagging plastic
Hope you get the message, I will stomp you into potholes
And fill you up with shells, but you're used to eating tacos

[Tyler]
Oh, a Taco joke?
Domo smoke, I heard your album
Sound like some shit a fake Wiz Khalifa poppa wrote
I'm insulted, shit, damn, somebody grab the Charmin
Never mind these messages, Monica her nigga arming

[Domo]
Swift-made switch blades made a big incision in him
Red dot his forehead ‘cause Riley's into Hinduism
And hipsters who happen to be your listeners
Doobies roll your booty, ho, Alexis know the truthy, bro

[Tyler]
Oh, a Lexus? I drive all that around
The western hemisphere like all of Kiara's exes
And bet this, I'm a mothafuckin' monster
Fuck talking, I'll stab you with this fucking rocket launcher

[Domo]
When I cock the beam back, I'm aiming for Supreme hats
Go to Hell, I mean that, burn you like greenbacks

[Tyler]
You don't mean that, you faggot, I'll get your back
And I'll snap it, and strangle you with that fucking leather jacket
Fall, bitch, give me everything, I'm taking all this
And fleeing the scene on Rufus, my evil walrus, bitch
Fuck you, I'm out

[Domo]
I'm high as fuck and I didn't call for all this
I'mma get on my zombie shit, wait, here's my carcass

[Outro: Syd]
Sir... sir... sir, in the green hat, sir. You... you... you have to pay for that. You have to, the Arizonas, you have to pay for those. I fucking hate this job... Fuck, clean up on aisle six

[Verse I: Akon]
So soft and slow
Never knew, a girl could be so goddamn cold
I know the way she move got me spendin' my dough, and yo
If you would have seen what I seen on that pole, just know

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
That I was wrong for fallin' in love (love)
I was wrong for fallin' in love (they always said don't love a ho)
Said I was wrong for fallin' in love (love, don't do it yo)
I was wrong for fallin in love (they always said don't love a ho)
But I just went against the grain

[Chorus: Akon]
It was a feelin' I can't explain, and it felt like harmony
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it around me everyday
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de

[Verse II: Ray Lavender]
Look at me, I'm stuck
The bubble in her pants got me caught up, I never had no luck
Thinkin with the wrong head got me jumpin' out there with no glove
It feels so good, had me sprung out on that stuff, now I'm stuck

[Pre-Chorus: Ray Lavender & Akon]
That's what I get for fallin' in love (love)
That's what I get for fallin' in love (they always said don't love a ho)
That's what I get for fallin' in love (love, don't do it yo)
That's what I get for fallin' in love (they always said don't love a ho)
But I just went against the grain

[Chorus: Akon & Ray Lavender]
It was a feelin' I can't explain (woah), and it felt like harmony (harmony)
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de (uuh)
I don't want it to ever go away (I don't)
I want it around me everyday (Uh, oh yeah)
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de (Woah, yeah)

[Verse III: Akon]
So thick, so raw
That oil all over her body stole my heart, I'm cold
The way she dropped down won't allow me to close my jaw, cause I'm
Already in love and I knew better from the start, oh no

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
That I was wrong for fallin' in love (love)
I was wrong for fallin' in love (they always said don't love a ho)
Said I was wrong for fallin' in love (love, don't do it yo)
I was wrong for fallin in love (they always said don't love a ho)
But I just went against the grain

[Chorus: Akon]
It was a feelin' I can't explain (explain), and it felt like harmony (yeah)
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de (do-da-de)
I don't want it to ever go away (I don't)
I want it around me everyday (everyday)
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de (yeah)
It was a feelin' I can't explain (can't explain), and it felt like harmony (harmony)
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de (uh yeah)
I don't want it to ever go away (away)
I want it around me everyday (everyday)
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de (he)

Life is a motherfuckin' gamble, Peter Rose
Momma taught me well, kush and the L
Paper everywhere like books just fell
More money to make, more pussy to smell
Like yeah, I'm a Libra, life or death on a scale
New Orleans nigga with my dick up in my right hand
Young Money nigga, money longer than a lifespan
Still go to sleep with my Bible on my nightstand
Flyer than a bitch and you ain't even got your flight plan

[Verse 1]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "awe, awe, awe,"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "awe, awe, awe"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "awe, awe, awe"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "awe, awe, awe"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Bridge]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "awe, awe, awe,"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "awe, awe, awe"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Outro]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Put that shit in the air, O.G. got me feeling rare
Flashy nigga, I don't care, pre-rolleds in my Domier
Louis shit for hoochie chicks who gon' flock in here
Cause they hear I'm the hottest shit that's gonna drop this year
Stop in fear, Domien the Genesis
Put flames to any shit, chiefing like I'm an Indian
I don't think I'm a quit this shit, like I invented it
Salute me gang apprentice-ship where you can't get no membership
Simple with sentences, soft spoken like bitches lips
Scathe yours, but here to take 'em back like we rented this
So where my mental is, higher than the sky is
The flyest, the flyer bitches wanna fuck a pilot
Ignite it, the weed, the medicator supplied it
The more doobie I smoke the more heavier my eyelids
Exactly what fly is, coming from the tip-top
Everybody wanna hate me like Chris Rock
Catch another O of weed at the pit stop
Wipe me down I'm blowing paper cause my shit's hot
Did you catch that? I'm scribbling outside the lines
Copped a couple G-Shocks, my bitch said I should buy some time
It's such a movie, this little exciting life of mine
Bomb main bitch and a half-asian concubine
Genesis, what is life like for you?
Raps, nice shoes, girls times two
Fly shit, recognition of my whole crew
I'm that nigga right now, watch me redefine cool, cool, cool

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my—

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying "I do")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, girl, my love, my love

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure (That, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for (Just say it, "I do")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, my love, my love

[Interlude: T.I.]
Aight, it's time to get it, JT
I don't know what you hesitatin' for, man
Ay, ay, ay

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again (Ay)
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When they wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (Why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean? You can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-uh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man...)
Well, baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
St. Bart's, Anguilla, anywhere I chill (Nice)
Just bring with me a pair, I will (C'mon)

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (Love)
My love (Love)
My love (Love)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (Love)
My love (Love)
My love (Love)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, love, my love, my love

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Well, me and her were the two
Me and her were together like glue
But we lived packed in a shack
Like the old lady who lived in a shoe
And we ain't really know what to do
Till one day she got her a job at WaMu
I said, "Baby, if you been thinkin’ what I thinkin’
Then all of our problems are through"
So we got together with the crew
And planned everything with the T
We got gloves and guns and bags and masks
And anything we would need
So we scoped out the facility
Really we waited a couple of weeks
Till it was time to kick in the door
"Everyone down it's a robbery"

[Hook X2]
You’re as cold as ice (you’re as cold as ice)
You’re willing to sacrifice our love
And now you got me (Froze)
I said you got me (froze)
Because you’re so c-cold
You left me cold tonight

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
So I went to my girl and said “quit playin’ and give me the cash”
But nobody suspected a thing
It was quite a spectacular act
So we get to the safe out of everyones sight
So I take off my mask and ask
“did your partner remember to cut the line for the panic button in the back?”
And she paused
The look she had on her face was cold as ice
Before she could she could say the next word I heard the sirens pull out outside
So I tried to grab her and run, she pulled away and said she would be fine
She was on the clock so I guess nobody would think she was in on the crime

[Hook X2]

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
So I realized it was over
When the SWAT team kicked in the door
So I dropped my gun and the cash, and then I got bummed rushed to the floor
And they took me into the station
And they started the interrogation
And I said, “I ain't sayin’ a word ’till I get appropriate representation”
So as I get escorted out, to my surprise what do I see
Thats my baby sittin’ in cuffs
Tellin’ the officers everything
And I stand there in amazement
Trying to find an explanation
And the cops come in and restrain me
And they mace me and the taze me
I said, “baby why baby what did I do to forsake you
How can you turn your back on me you’re selfish I hate you
All I ever wanted to do was love you, were you faking?”
So I snatched the gun from my officer
And I cocked it and I aimed it
And said, “this is for all the pain you done put me through you’re ungrateful how could you
All I wanted to do was save you”
And here I am day 55
With 55 hundred to go
When you love a girl who is as cold as ice
Eventually you’ll get froze

[Hook X2]

[Bridge]
32 degrees below zero
You’re like 31 flavors you’re oh so cold
Feels like 30 straight days of falling snow
I’m so cold and alone, alone
You’re like 32 degrees below zero
Or like 31 flavors you’re oh so cold
Feels like 30 straight days of falling snow
I’m so cold and alone, alone
You left me cold tonight

[Hook X2]

[Verse 1]
Yeah, hey!
Hey, I'm just a Carolina nigga goin' hard for the 'Ville
I ain't seen six figures but I feel like a mill'
Cause I'm fresh up off the deal, will I chill? Never that!
I'm the hottest nigga out and you could tell the devil that
Got that crack! Went from pebble to that Roc, pedal that
So much bass, I mean niggas can't tell where the treble at
On the track, niggas can't keep up, they look, they trailin' back
Now these bustas couldn't catch up even if Id pedal back
Won't lose, bet on that! or be in debt forever
Plus whatever Jigga say, I'm hot
That's like the pot called kettle black
Now these industry niggas like damn, "Jay said all that? "
Same niggas could've signed me, now they gon regret all that
Bet on that! Bitch, this my beat, look how I get on that shit
I'm on it like I own it cus I sewn it
Needle and thread, hip-hop heads know them drums express youself
Aye look, I tried to school these niggas, they need extra help
I mean they just don't get the message dawg, no text could help
And now I'm on some 'fuck you niggas', go molest yourself
I'm tryna ball til I fall, catch myself, then ball again
Fall to the floor, dust myself, do it all again
Pardon him, sick nigga, never been a bitch nigga
Spit it for them ones like me who never been a rich nigga
Had the dream to make a team and get up off the bench nigga
You fuckin' with me, ya odds is slimma then a stick figure
Get bigga nigga

[Hook]
Hey, blood, sweat and tears, I paid my price
Hey, so come and get this good game
Aye you should come and get this good game

Hey, so you can come and get this good game
Think you should come and get this good game
Hey heeyy

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I'm just a down south nigga, lil' east coast flow
From the concrete jungle where the trees don't grow
From the 'Ville, where the motherfuckin' streets so cold
Nigga I could show you streets where police won't go
We just tryna get a piece, my nigga we so po'
Why you lookin' at him, wonderin' why he sold dope
Or why she smoke crack? Or why he tote gats?
Gotta stay up on your toes cus if your feet both flat
A nigga heat gon' clap, your heartbeat go flat
The Lord giveth and he taketh, well he repo'ed that
They don't quiver, they don't shake, man they just reload gats
So much beef for a nigga to have a feast on that
Now a nigga like myself ain't had to keep no gat
But nowadays mo'fuckers is weak, won't scrap
So them OG's tell a nigga, "Please, roll strapped"
It's fucked up a nigga man it be's like that
It be's like that (Hey) and it be's like that (Hey)
Them boys from the 'Ville and yeah it be's like that

[Hook]

[Hook: Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
Bet you would think I got it made, better look again
I got a butler, got a maid, and a mansion
The belief is that I'm living out a millionaire's fantasy
With phantoms and ferrari's in the driveway
But you see the fame's in exchange for the same man's sanity
Your vision jaded by the Grammys on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony
Apparently, it's damaging the man you see before you
On the canvas, he may seem alright but all the disadvantages his family
Encounters overshadows his extravagance
Walk in my nines a while I dare you, would it scare you
While it surely seem like King's life ain't glamorous
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
Because the camera doesn't see beyond the walls of the smiles
Only counts until it falls in the pile

[Hook: Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Honestly to me, I think I'd lose every benefit of all that I've accomplished
If my kids never win at shit
Me knowing this, why should the verses I have laid
Be more important to me than the persons I have raised
I guess I'm saying that to say that opportunity
But they just don't equate to all the time they take away
From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake
If Deyjah end up a stripper and Major slinging yay
How could I ever consider myself a great
If Messiah ain't paid and Nique Nique ain't straight
Would your favourite song about the whips, money and shit
Be relevant if you found out, Domani wasn't rich, nope
So me being the G.O.A.T. shouldn't mean more to me
Than seeing to it King go
From a badass kid to a man with some dough
Otherwise I may as well have stayed poor
So while they stay focused on me beefin with Flip
Shawty Lo, Gucci or Ludacris
Or if I'm fucking with a ho
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense
Internally I'm dealing with this conflict
So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand
That slap me in the face, ay I'm just a man
If they saying I ain't the best at making hit records
It's cause this my life these ain't just rapping
Shit, you think of that deep, did you dawg
See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls
Bitch ain't thinking with the deep, did you dawg
Cause see you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls

[Hook: Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]
Nobody knows I'm all alone
Living in this castle made of stone
They say that money is freedom, but I feel trapped inside it all
And while I sit so high up on a throne
I wonder how I can feel this low
On top of the world, it's beautiful
But there's no place to fall

[Verse 3: T.I.]
For the record ay, I give a damn if I never said shit again
My career was meant for me to come and tell it
Honest interpretation of how affected I'm faced with
Matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement
But the day that I walk away I ain't saying that I'm amazing
Downplaying the way I kept fellas from catching cases
Won't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying
And when I say what I mean even when I'm surrounded by the fakest
From one of the greatest sinners, blessed with most of God's graces
Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places
So next time you rating royalty, I'm always being given to recordings than the level
Of your loyalty, obvious you've been ignoring me
Who else you seen make it through the storm, unharmed disjointed
While all the critics was looking for Prince Charming
Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt
Even though he made a castle out of what used to be a house
He did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about
But most of y'all don't see the castle through the walls
And the smiles till it falls in piles so while

[Hook: Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

[Intro: B.o.B]
Drug boys' steady shooting
The streets don’t give a damn
They’re filled with such pollution
The kids don’t stand a chance

[Chorus: B.o.B]
We’re trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hands
We’re filled with so much hatred
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Well, since I was planted at birth
I abandoned my own planet and I landed on earth
As a kid I never understood what I observed, and
Some of it was strange, but most of it disturbed me
Always in detention for the lack of my attention
You can call it deficit, really I just didn’t listen
And I was always missing, the teacher’s like "where is Bobby Simmons?"
But trying to get a record deal is all I can remember
It’s funny cause looking back to the past that I had
All my days in the streets trying to prove that I was bad
I still elevated to the level that I’m at
Still elevated to the level that I’m at

[Chorus: B.o.B]
We’re trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hands
We’re filled with so much hatred
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance

[Verse 2: Janelle Monae]
Sometimes it’s hard to grow
While living in fear of the unknown
How can he ever give love
When no love is in his heart
A child can barely sleep at night
Too worried about tomorrow
And what it behold, he drowned himself
Deep down in his sorrows
Will you run or will you share your life?
Tell the stories, live and try
See it when we’re given hope
That we know that we can grow

[Chorus: B.o.B]
We’re trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hands
We’re filled with so much hatred
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance

Stashing for my unborn

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Yeah J.E.T.S., nigga
As if I had to say it, Spitta
In the middle of every bad bitches playlist
ITunes bangin' from my hotel room
Nothing but beats bitch
Fuck it when I die I could sleep, bitch
My momma need a bigger crib so I need this money Jake
King Kong ain't got shit on me
My face is a coupon
I don't know them but they know me
Bitches pitch it, like pitchers
But I'm smart not a wild swinger careful at what I'm hittin'
Burners in the sofa cushion careful where you sittin'
Ain't into nothin' crazy
Keep it for them crazy niggas
G fizz fly, holla at Wiz, catch the Steelers
Smellin' like high-time at the fifty-yard line
Ushers bugging wanna check our tickets

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And um, my niggas the planes back
Gettin' full off of dinner but save scraps
Never know when a rainy day may hap-
-Pen pictures out of my life and bitches, I Taylor gang that
Me and spitta, spend a grand at the bar
Buyin' drinks for my niggas
Hoes sellin' they souls just to be with us
On the road with winners, champions
Ride smokin' weed to myself the only reason they stress
Because I'm on the level you can't be in
And I flick the middle finger to fake friends
We live like when the loyalty is strong you can't bend
We the planes and all of my niggas stamped in
Billionaire clothes out in Vegas fucking millionaire hoes
I'm in the air solo
You nowhere near close
Went and took the road this young'un here chose
Smokin' it by the O

[Verse 1]
You came along when I needed a Savior
Someone to pull me through somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So I'm counting on you now

[Chorus]
Somebody already broke my heart
Somebody already broke my heart

[Verse 2]
Here I am
So don't leave me stranded
On the end of a line
Hanging on the edge of a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So be careful and be kind

[Chorus]
Somebody already broke my heart
If someone has to lose, I don't want to play
Somebody already broke my heart
No, no I can't go there again

[Verse 3]
You came along when I needed a Savior
Someone to pull me through somehow

I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So I'm counting on you now

[Chorus]
Somebody already broke my heart
If someone has to lose, I don't want to play
Somebody already broke my heart
No, no I can't go there again

[Drake: talking]
I don't even need a note pad for this one right here man
Shut the lights off
Let the mind work ya know
I'd like to ummm
I'd like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
Guess I'll call her my most recent addition to my collection to female disappointments

[Verse 1:]
Deceiving you are the reason that
I don't believe in finding the love that I need and
I'm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
So I guess that makes you Aunt Viv
Until you take from me till the point that you can't give
And when I see you out I pass by it's offensive
But what you expect though
Kinda direct yo
Cause all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive
I told ya
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasn't tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldn't utilize none of the things that I taught her
So I was just tryna upgrade you
I ain't ya understudy thats tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Get to know the people that surround you
Funny to think that I woulda white gowned you
Cause now we sit around the studio and clown you
Oops did I let that slip
Oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick

[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

[Verse 2:]
Deceiving you are the reason that
When it gets cold in November seems like it's freezing
And I fit every stereotype that y'all believe in
Cause when I say I'm serious you claim you're only teasin
I planned a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when I'm speakin you only in topic when I'm pissed
And in a couple years I guarantee you'll be thirsty
And by then I'll be lookin like Tropicana twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me I'm just here workin' waitin' patient
For her to be ready for to love and leave her drama
Cause I don't really wanna fight no more
And I don't wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I don't wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now I'm losing a feeling
You losing appealing
You need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick

[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

[Verse 3:]
My first reaction was damn girl
How did I swing you?
I wanted you forever now I'm something you cling to
But you was my angel, Seems like ya wings grew
Unaware you was outta state doin' ya thing too
Sayin' to my self you deceiving
You are the reason that I don't believe in finding the love that I need
In fact I know you always be lyin' when u be leavin'
Goin' to visit family promise me you ain't cheatin'
A sure thing just might fail you
Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that you a soft nigga
How you think cuddling with is cute
They laugh at how you think you last when you really don't
And make u think u get the ass when you really won't
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin' it
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin' it
So sign your name on a prenupt and then initial
She only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick

[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

[Drake: talking]
Feel like uh
I feel like we back man (yeah)
It's like See, see the problem with these other brothers is that they makin love songs
We makin beyond and above songs you know what I'm sayin
We sayin real stuff we not bitter it's life you know
If ya'll females would pull it together
Maybe we would have something better to talk about

[Intro]
Let's rock! 1! 2! 1-2-3-4!

[Verse 1]
I'm a feminine Eminem, a slim shady lady
But nice, 'cause I texted Haiti
90 lady cops in the road
And I'm arrested for doing 80
Like Hamlet, all about "words, words, words"
Divide a whole into thirds, thirds, thirds
I'm a gay sea otter:
I blow other dudes out of the water
I'm the man muffin, diving, muffin'
Cold and fly like an arctic puffin
Puffing whacky tobaccy
Hating other rappers like I'm Helga Pataki
And I've been rocking this mic before electricity
Way back in 1000 BCE -
That's before the common era (era, era, era, era, era, era, ah)
I can't be stopped
Flow so sick that it should be mopped up
Chick's got a dixie cup
I gotta dick full of helium; I'll fuck you up
A boy, a girl, a middle aged bitch
Botox in the third person
I give the perspective a switch and
Bo talks in the third person
Ooh, just relax; if you wanna know me, here's two facts

[Chorus]
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypo-crite
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite

[Verse 2]
Met a girl named Macy, had sex with her all day
But she was dyslexic, so I ended up doing the YMCA
We ballin', Asian, Wii bowling,
Prostate cancer semi-colon
Find that hole like I'm Stephen Hawking
Atticus Finch, killing, mocking
Cry like a child would
You raped my childhood
Just stroll in, roll in your pole into Rolie Polie Olie's colon
To relax my mind
I take a walk by the clock and I pass the time and
Rhyming, mathematical timing
Syntax impacts the intact hymen
I'm an internet provider
Came from the web like a horny spider
Fucked a girl in an apple orchard
Then came in cider
I thought AIDS was a butt virus
Like conjunction junction conjunctivitis
I spit gold bars 'cause I was
Molested by my uncle Midas
Gay dads blow pops, another sucker
Oedipus was the first motherfucker

[Hook]
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite
Hungry hungry hippo-crite
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite

[Verse 3]
We the people of the USA
José, we're not talking to you, esé
We got a border in order to keep you out
It's what my NYU essay's about
'Cause we're, xenophobic warrior princess
Molested by my Uncle Sam, is that incest?
"I WANT YOU" to smell my finger
Does my nephew's scent still linger?
South of queers, north of hell
The queer ones suck and the brown ones smell
We guard the border and we guard it well
But some slip through the cracks of the liberty bell
Did I say liberty? I meant taco
Paco, hey I better let that rock go
'Cause in real life Goliath wins
And then sells all the silk that the widow spins
One more time!

[Hook]
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite
Hungry hungry hippo-crite
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hyBreak it down now! What!
Pocrite

[Outro]
Bitches and hoes, Bo's hoes, oh
Bitches and hoes, bitches, hoes
Bitches and hoes don't exist
Because the hoes know Bo's a feminist
Bitches and hoes don't exist
Because the hoes know Bo's a feminist
Take off your bras and burn 'em
Or you can let me burn 'em
Take off your bras and burn 'em, oh
You can let Bo Burnham burn 'em
Take off your bras and burn 'em
You can let me burn 'em
Take off your bras and burn 'em, burn 'em
Or you can let Bo Burnham burn 'em
Ugh
Ya’ll already know what it is man
If they wanna know my name, they look up and see the gang
Ugh, its not a problem, we spending change

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]
Got the pedal to the medal when I pull up out the garage
Ain't feelin ‘em at all, these niggas a mirage
Handling my biz like a full body massage, hands on
Niggas gon hate, hoes wanna menage
Cops fuck wit me hopin to get a charge
Hoes leaving their man, fucking us cause our cars
If its one thing I know, its smoking and living large
Got me speedin down the interstate
See what I’m eatin, wanna piece up off my dinner plate
Hey she fucking me cause how I win a race
Plus I ain't cheap, I roll the reefer counting bigger cake
Wait I’m talkin fast car, big estate
Money come in cash plus in the bank
Nigga don’t believe me, throw it in your face
Bitch I'm in the building like real estate

[Hook]
They say I’m still the same
You know it ain't a thang
Besides the zip code, ain't a damn thang changed
I’m gettin money, keep the champaigne coming
Might crack a smile but ain't a damn thang funny, no, uh uh
I’m straight, when you gettin money muthafukas gonna hate
Find the baddest bitch and get her number
I dont even call her (call her, call her)
Feel like a million dollars

Dollar bill, dollar bill
Cause thats how I feel yup

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 2]
Ballin’s not a hobby, its my occupation
Hoes on my dick, thats my confirmation
Couple stars with me, thats a constellation
Jacksons, Grants, Benjis, thats my conversation
Touch the pedal once, it look like I’m racing
Eyes Chinese, smoke like I’m Jamaican
V.I.P rollin’ doobies up and facing
12 bottles of Rose, I’m on some gang shit
Gettin all the shit, cake crumbling
Ain't nothin, told them lil niggas I take from ‘em
Laughing my all the way to the bank
Tried to talk but they can’t
They just stand ther,e when they starin
Hatin, mumblin
What you make a year, I guarantee I spend it clubbin
Started kinda hot, now its safe to say we bubblin
400 on a zip, blow it all day
Another city, state, another mill to make

[Hook]
They say I’m still the same
You know it ain't a thang
Besides the zip code, ain't a damn thang changed
I’m gettin money, keep the champaigne coming
Might crack a smile but ain't a damn thang funny, no, uh uh

[Bridge: M.I.A]
Rock it, rock it to the stars
Rock it, rock it to the space
Rock it, rock it to the bar
Rock it, rock it off your face

[Verse 1: M.I.A]
Johnnie keep walking, Jack does too much coke
Jim Beam and Jameson, they just give me joke
When I see Pernot, I say "oh hell no"
Kahlua's a turn-off, tell him to Smirnoff
Captain Morgan shot the sparks
When we hang out, he shoot arrows through my heart
Blue Tattoo, chilling up in Malibu
He got 99 Bananas, but he's not my boo

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed

[Verse 2: M.I.A]
When I met Seagrams, he sent Chivas down my spine
Got me on the dance floor and we start to wine
His ex Sambuca, she just a hookah
I put it on a chilla, but I want Tequila

[Interlude]
I got you off your fucking face
I tell you what to do you want your mother, your something-or-other
I got you off your fucking face
You wound up in another place your brother, you fucking nutter

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed

It's going d-d-d-d-d-d-d-down
Everything slow-mo in the background
When I pull it, pull it, p-p-pull it, pull it
Yeah it's sticky and I get it by the pound
Hey-o, Maya, your shit is on fire
Real talk, yuh nuh know seh man a liar
That's why I never ever take 'em to my mattress
I tell 'em "meet me in the sky, yeah that's my address"
I said I got this bad bitch Margarite
And when I see her I say "si, señorita!"
Okay, she make me feel like I love, love
I'm like BRRRRRRR, yo, I'm fucked up!

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed

[Chorus: Harry Belafonte]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ahem, excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish

[Chorus: Harry Belafonte]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
(I'm goin' back in…)
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
‘Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? Gunna
Day-o, day-ay-ay-o
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day-ay-ay-o

[Chorus: Kurupt]
Now this, this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what? You found you a ho that you like
But you can't make a ho a housewife (Wife)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I mostly sold dick while I packed a gold clip
Worked my money-maker, she got paper, she 'bout to trip
(Where the fuck is my money?) I cannot G guilty
You pimpin' strong, but comin' home to sheets that be filthy
She on the dillzy, I take advantage
All up in them panties, I got this bitch speakin' Spanish
I'm mannish, get yo' nails out my back
Slut, I'm 'bout to nut and get up, go scrub yo' cat (Get the fuck out of here)
Learn the player rules, this is how a player do
Might not be a freak, but she got on the choosin' shoes
Dollar signs are folded, I can't control it
Tryin' to leave her, beeper just exploded
She sweatin' me, won't let me, broad turned fraud
Now she on this dick, huh, got her turnin' tricks, huh
Man, it's a trip, I don't trip, I'm in yo' Lexus flexin'
I left her up in Dallas, Texas, ass naked

[Chorus]
Now this, this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what? You found you a ho that you like
But you can't make a ho a housewife (Wife)

[Verse 2: Hittman]
Naw, "ho" ain't short for honey, almost had to wail her like Bunny
Tellin' tales of bein' pregnant, catchin' Nordstrom sales with abortion money
I spotted her, seen her with my nigga when I shot at her
Now we got beef, he caught up in the ho's erotica
Exotic, she's psychotic, rockin' his Nautica
Soon he'll need antibiotics (Sucka bitch)
Name a sexual disease, she got it like Sam Goody
You be like, "Damn, how could she hit me off with chlamydia?"
Fool, I pity ya
We live in the city of ballers
With more bounce and in a Zapp, she will doo wa ditty ya
The prettier the grittier, the wittier can get her
To the Hotel, Niko, on some Sauve shit like Rico
That's when I caught a Vision like Coleco
A high-post ho, a perfect way for me to keep dough
Huh, have her sellin' ass on Bronson Ave and Pico

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
At the hotel, motel, or the Holiday Inn (Say what, nigga?)
I said if that bitch keep fuckin' up (Beotch) then we'll fuck her friends
I said I dip, dive, what can I say?
Niggas need to stop fuckin' with O.J
Some niggas bang Blood, some niggas bang Crip
And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
I had a dream of hoes, I had to screen my hoes
I seen my hoes in all kinds of clothes
Lil' Almond Joy, I truly enjoy
If you blew my balls right through my drawers
Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot
From the way she was blowin', I know she does it a lot
I have a eight-and-a-half, nine-and-three-quarters
The ho started callin' when I started boss ballin'
Gimme some head, gimme some ass (Uh-huh)
Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz
Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate
See hoes eat dick like eggs and steak
It ain't shit new, I thought you knew (What?)
I knew you would, you wish you could
Break a G down, break me down
But I'ma see you on the rebound (What what?), D.P. style

[Chorus]
Now this, this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what? You found you a ho that you like
But you can't make a ho a housewife (Wife)

[Outro]
Half-dead
Lil' Half-dead the one who jumped out to see ol' Snoop Dogg on lookout boys
He's going to be more than half dead if he don't fill my motherfucking drink up
I'll fill your motherfucking mouth up
Hahahahaha
I don't think so

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin' the good life
Yeah, though it's forty below the wind chill
And we wipin' snow up off the windshield
It's still wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I'm so happy I'm with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin' for the mall, don't trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that "You the star at the top of my Christmas tree"
My only question is, "Where my presents?"
She said, "Shhh," she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in your drink, mami
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said, "It's Dee-ricious"
Hahahaha, yeah

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Kanye West]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls (Uh, uh)

The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 2: Vado]
Merry Xmas, Santa Claus cherry X6
They ain't hear my rain, dear, make it snow on the next chick (Yes)
Got enough toys, wonderin' what's my next pick
Before my exit, it get diamond Rolex reckless (Huh)
Big bags, got everything on the checklist
Necklace, baguette wrist (Uh-huh)
Pockets fat, they precious (Uh-huh)
Give Ma a peck kiss, look and tell her she precious (Mwah)
Lightin' up the sour, this tree give me the best gifts (Vado)

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
And I remember when I couldn't play Santa Claus (Uh)
No reindeers, just horses and a Panamera Porsche (Vroom-vroom)
We on two fifth shoppin', what the damage cost? (At most?)
I got your fam while you biddin' in the can up north (I got you)
Whoops, I'm at Neimans, I hope they still got em (Word)
You want the thigh-high spikes with the red bottoms (Size 37)
Err, let's make a toast 'cause Christ is born
We gon' party all night 'til the lights come on (Amen)

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem

[Verse 4: Cyhi the Prynce]
Yeah, Mom and Dad, I won't be home for the holidays
Ha, I'm over 800 miles away
In the city that's so pretty
Where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I'm sorry that I gotta stay
I'm with Ye at the Macy Day Parade
Lettin' the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I'm in New York, I'm still reppin' for the A
Cyhi!

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Pusha T]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feels like we bought it all (Yes, it's G.O.O.D. Music, y'all)
The mistletoe's right here (Check it, uh, uh)
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 5: Pusha T]
On the stoop of that Brownstone, shovellin' the brownstone
Santa's on a diet, gotta get the pounds gone
Downtown got me feelin' like it's Dow Jones
But uptown got me feelin' like its down home
Snow like sugar hill, chains on wheels
We turn our two doors into snowmobiles
We got our own style, no Soho feel
Put on your play clothes, how that logo feel?

[Verse 6: Big Sean]
Oh, pose for them photo stills
You don't wanna miss a moment, where's your NoDoz pills?
I caught her lookin' at my Rollie as my mojo spills
Snowflakey on the bezel, hope you know those real
Okay, my white girl Veronica, black girl Monica
Got me celebrating ChristmaHanuKwanzaakah
Rock-rock-rock-rock-rock-rock-rockin' dashikis with a yarmulke
Where the Christmas tree at? Let's design it up

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 7: Cam'ron]
Uh, Lenox Ave to Saint Nick, never seen Saint Nick (Nah)
Just niggas sellin' the same nicks, the same bricks (What up, y'all?)
Same hustlers running' up to Broadway
That's where the snow's at, taste it, foreplay
No turkey or greens, just Jimbo's (Jimbo's)
Christmas lights in project windows (Yes)
Shouts to the coldest on my barometer
Berkman, Shapiro, Kalina, Hanukkah (My lawyers)

[Verse 8: Teyana Taylor & Musiq Soulchild]
All the flashin' lights up on a tree
The house lit up nice
With your family is where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don't that make you feel good?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
Let's have Christmas in the hood

[Verse 9: Teyana Taylor]
All of the flashin' lights
Yeah, them things shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you're Christmas Eve
If you like what you see
Won't you come sit on my knee?
And tell me everything that you want
'Cause, baby, I'm your Santa Claus, yeah

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feels like we bought it all

Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
Ok I'm leanin' to the left, flag in my right pocket
Star Trek fly, unidentified flying objects
Extraterrestrial, I'm all about my decimals
Retarded in the booth, they say I got a special flow
Sicker than your average you rappers is ass backwards
Gudda spit crack and you niggas is crack addicts
It's simple mathematics; you cut the check
And I rake in the green like I'm rakin' the grass in
Pretty bitches damn near faint when they passin'
Call my whip Martin, but the first name Aston
Potatohead niggas get mashed when I'm spazzin
Think you fuckin' with me? Put your cash in
Nah, I doubt it;
I was young and reckless when P say he was about it
You niggas is Ducks, Howards, Cowards
Kill the competition and shower niggas with flowers
This rap shit is ours, Gudda, bitch~!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, Uptown back in it, Hollygrove black menace
Black clothes, black tennis', black semi'
I've never sat in the Hemi, that will offend me
Try Maybach or Maybach, bitch I got stacks
Yeah, Paychecks on paychecks and I still want payback
I still don't play that, I kill on ASAP
And we don't do shit but get money all day
Put some shoes on my bullets now they runnin' your way
YM, Young Mula, Young Money all day
Where the drugs so sweet like honey on yay
Which one of y'all say you want drama? I'm honored
I blitz yo' ass like a mothafuckin' lineman
Stack of paychecks with a whole bunch of commas
Still wear red like an old 49er
Fuck shittin' on ya, dump the whole toilet on ya
Weezy F baby, bitch I'm hotter than Uganda
Uggh!

[Verse 3: Jae Millz]
Let-let go
Mo-momma ain't make me to make homies, she made me to make history
So doin that my extra-curicular activity
Bulldozer boy and my target is the industry
Two things in the world I love - good head and victory
You ain't doin' it big, I'm grown, stop kiddin me
Your whip ain't up to date and your hoes look like Mr. T
This is Misery, no Kathy Bates
Come at me sideways my money'll slap you straight
Yeah, I'm a big joker so you know I'll smash your ace
Leave the club with ya girl send her home with a ashy face
Love is a gamble, but it's my casino
And tonight you're the loser, I hope she got Aveno
I hope the game got life insurance cause I'mma kill it
And all you whack ass rap niggas dyin with it
I'm so Harlem, eatin but still starvin'
Po-pockets fat as fuck like all they do is eat margarine
Millz!

[Verse 4: Tyga]
Say, put the flow
Say, put the flow in the pot, crank up the notch
Burn the song from a stove top, this finger lickin hot
His pick flip cause the nigga flopped
My shit hit like the pitch was soft, niggas cottonballed
She dropped drawers cause she poppin off
Her pussy crossed guard but, I don't stop at all
I smash in the car, like fuck the fuckin law
Her baby daddy gone, who wanna meet the Don?
That Rocky shit up on the arm-arm
Shittin on 'em like hay in the barn
Hey wait they say Money talks and, man you don't speak at all
You shop at mini-malls
My style two thumbs up like using analogs
Ha ha~! I wreck shit for the recognition bitch
Jesus as my witness, Saan vision
Eyeball you niggas, flame flicker
I melt pictures, Tyga skin ain't drippin

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
My diamonds are casted
Rims wrapped in plastic
I'm in outerspace
Chillin with the Jetsons
My flow is perfected
My goons over-protective
Smoking presidential
My weed is elected
I am well-respected
I am well-connected
I am in the hood
In the hood nigga section
You girl is my food
I had her for breakfast
And after we sexed man
I left that bitch breathless
This is not school
So please do not test this
My flow is illegal
My vocals arrested
You don't want beef
You must know the police
Your girl sucked on my dick
And it felt like she had no teeth
Soulja Boy Tell Em'
Yeah I am a beast man
In hip-hop I go ham
Now let's have a feast man
I am a dog
A dog off the leash man
If you feel like a frog
Than go ahead and leap man
I'm on my green shit
My football field team shit
You're on your wack shit
That you have no swag shit
I might fuck your girl
Or I might just fuck that bitch
Or that bitch, or that bitch, or that bitch, or that bitch
After I fuck make her make me a sandwich
I am so random
Girls think that's handsome
Haters hate mad throwimg temperature tantrums
Soulja Boy killed them
Fucked them
Downed them

[Verse 2: Arab]
Arab!
Call me Arab but I'm not pakistani
Sprunt to your granny
Cause that ho cand stand me

That's why I demand money
Hop on the track so fast
Call me Arab Bunny
Scratch that Arab Money
Laughin, Arab Stutin
In you hors face and I keep on cuming
Song after song
I continue to be bumping
I'm right and your wrong
You continue to be nothing
I got bars, I got cars
I got hors I'm a star
I got mars on my side
The aliens are down to ride
It took me two nights to do What I did tonight
I'm so high
Why the fuck do I catch a Flight?
You're girls leaking problem Just got handled by the pipe
Me and you are the same, really, sike!
Bitch I go harder than a Train on full throttle
Followed by Godzilla
Followed by you and salt Rockets
My money so fire
Give you real hot pockets
Tryna hate on S.O.D
Aw bitch stop it!
My watch still tocking
Saying that it is my time
The crowd rocking
Arab, they screaming
It took a lot of grinding
So you better keep on Dreaming
Or better start thinking
Of a master plan
I throw away the cats
And I collect all the cash
Of course I am gorgeous
I collect all the facts

[Verse 3: Lil Playboii]
I pull up in Lamborghini's
Stuntin through your city
You can never see me
'Less your looking through a TV
The cheese like I'm Mickey
The brain like I'm Pinky
Lil mama going ham on my Dick like bigly wigly
Her boyfriend want to be me
Cause I'm the one she cheat With
Thinking she a virgin
But I fuck her evry weekend
My fuck is on them cheeses
American to Swedish
I dare you talk shit
Before your
The pound on that green tip
From A-town to D-Sip
I stay on the hustle like T.I
So free Tip
Free world, free pimp
Take off, my brim
Moment of Silence for my boy
Dolla Bill

I' back on this track
Like the white chick on Superman
Think I'm dong hair
The way I'm popping these rubberbands
Stackz On Deck standing Taller than a rubberman
Swagg Super Clean
Like a bathtub bubblebath
Fucking with a rat boy
Call him ninja turtle man
Messing with my money
Get jacked up like Urkel's pants
Playboii on the beat
Call me the murder man
Pokemon ice
Pikachu Squirtle man
Reppin' for the cat like
Allison in Wonderland
East Atlanta's own
Six Decater I put on man

[Soulja Boy] Yeah Goddammit!

[Chorus: John Mayer]
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet

[Refrain: Kanye West]
See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
And you talk about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say, "Motherfucker, your momma's a bitch"
You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
I'd never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit out of you
But I'mma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like Jigga man
Oh, I guess I figure it's

[Chorus: John Mayer]
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you, hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet

[Refrain: Kanye West]
See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking
And this relationship, it even got me back to drinking
Now this Hennessy, uh, it's gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
'Cause every time that I'd try, you would question me
Saying, "You fucking them girls, disrespecting me
You don't see how your lies is affecting me?
You don't see how our life was supposed to be?
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be"
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me

[Chorus: John Mayer & Kanye West]
Bittersweet (I fucked up and I know it, G)
You're gonna be the death of me (I guess it's bittersweet poetry)
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time

[Refrain: Kanye West]
See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says

See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says

Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
(Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you
...very same time)

[Verse 1]
Extracurricular, parallel to none, I am perpendicular
Hit 'em with the, "Oh, now, that's just ridiculous"
We coulda cleared up all these particulars
That coulda been the homicide, vehicular
You wasn't in no state to speed off
You was buggin' out, yeah, you was peed off
We was just chillin' up at the ski loft
Thinkin' we was on, you tellin' me we off
Your whole vibe changed when you got the phone call
That's the effect they call a snowball
Next thing you know, I was runnin' down the hall
Sayin' "Please come back, I have given my all"
I have given my all
Funny how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all
Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall

[Chorus]
My mind is made up, I'm waitin' for ya
I'm waitin' on you, waitin', boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin' on ya
I'm waitin' for you, waitin', boy
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me?
I am waiting on you to catch me (Catch me, catch me)

[Verse 2]
You wanted oh-so bad to prove points
But your game always makes me lose points
And your game always makes me concur
That maybe I shoulda never taken you from her
But with all of the aforementioned
I am still trapped in your dimension
So I will be on the mountain waiting
'Cause I am in need of more attention
Coulda called back just to say sum'
I'ma fall back in the bass drum
Please come to destination
I'm not doin' well, exclamation
You succeeded at your attempts to make me
Need you desperately to vindicate me
It's funny how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all
Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall

[Chorus]
My mind is made up, I'm waitin' for ya
I'm waitin' on you, waitin', boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin' on ya
I'm waitin' for you, waitin', boy
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me?
I am waiting on you to catch me (Catch me, catch me)

[Bridge]
Okay
Oh, oh, oh, okay
Oh, oh, oh, okay
It's, it's whatever you say, ayy, ayy
It's whatever you say, ayy, ayy
I am at your disposal

[Chorus]
My mind is made up, I'm waitin' for ya
I'm waitin' on you, waitin', boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin' on ya
I'm waitin' for you, waitin', boy
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me?
I am waiting on you to catch me (Catch me, catch me)

Look, I never fold
Man, I just take my chance
I let life deal
And I just play my hand
Protection off safety
I look straight ahead
"I got them niggas, Weezy"
That's what the .380 said
You gotta play in the field to get paid
And then you gotta go lay
In that bed that you made
It's Cash Money
This the army brigade
And I'm spittin' like I ate a grenade
I'm dippin' in the 8 with the fade
With the wing in the butt
Yeah, put the wings up
And straight show 'em my guts
Yuck
Ain't my swagger so mean
And I know how to operate that machine
Brrrrrtt

[Hook]
I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga

Me and every single nigga
That got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me alone
So I'm ridin' everyday with every pistol
Everyday with every pistol
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Aim at his brain
Make a nigga learn
And if that's chopper bullets
Then they supposed to burn
And if you've been in jail
I never saw a cell
But I come from New Orleans
Yeah, right there under Hell
I tell my gal "Don't you worry 'bout nothin'
But see, these niggas want me dead
So hold me tight when ya fuck me"
I told her
"I'm strapped, I'm a rider, girl
And I'mma shoot from every side
Like Around The World"
Believe that, and you can tell 'em bring the whole gang
I'm gon' get you with that automatic touchin' errthang
Nigga, it's the Birdman, JR. — Pure Pain
You just a curb stain

[Hook]
And tell them boys
I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga
That got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me alone
So I'm ridin' everyday
With every pistol that I own
Tell 'em I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga
That got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me alone
So I'm ridin' everyday with every pistol
Everyday with every pistol

You could chill, I'm the one who get it, not the one who sellin'
All grind every day, I'm ballin', I can't help it
Niggas on that bullshit, my pockets full of Celtics
And them niggas hatin' on us, get our best wishes
In the club you ain't even on the guest list, bitch
Sound like you need to get your weight up
Go to sleep rich and count another million when I wake up
They wonderin' how I do my thing
Two words: Taylor Gang
Remix, G-shit

[Intro]
Let's peruse the essentials of Cool
A brief study on the things so instrumental to Lu
That make me feel flyer than lobbies of Ws
A disclaimer, just a rhymer, no credentials from a school (now)
Let's peruse the essentials of Cool
A brief study on the things so instrumental to Lu
That make me feel flyer than lobbies of Ws
A disclaimer, just a rhymer, no credentials from a school

[Verse 1]
In my Fall of Rome jeans, my Head Porter wallet
My Neighborhood shirt and my Eddie Chen CLOT
Shit might not go to college but my street smart polished
Like the black fingernails of that punk rock logic
Do the knowledge: man, you can't be punk from projects
Firm disbeliever in your punch clock promise
Was trading off my comics, I was taking them to school
One of Jay-Z boys, now I'm skating in your pool
Not to be rude, I'm just hating on your rules
Like a young 50, I'm on my world tour
Good morning, Singapore, I'm bringing the sun with me
From the Robert Taylor homes to Africa's slum cities
I am American mentally with Japanese tendencies
Parisian sensibility, so stay out the vicinity of...

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, yeah, them niggas over there, it's just
Yeah, yeah, now look at what I wear
Got my gold watch and my gold chain
With my fancy car and my diamond ring
With my fancy broad and she foreign
So it's no words and it's no slang
And I'm no trick and I'm no lame
It's just so slick that she's so game, and it's
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, and it's

[Verse 2]
I like Diptyque candles and Maharishi sandals and
Dita sunglasses, Purple Murder Service samples
I like False T-shirts Dover Street is off the handle
Such a good designer, Junya Watanabe, god damn you
I like Yohji Yamamoto and a Max Roach solo
Leather Gucci belts and Guilty Brotherhood polos
I like Montblanc pens and Moleskine paper
I like Goyard bags and green Now & Laters
Monocle magazine and Japanese manga
Futura Nosferatus and HTM trainers
I love Street Fighter 2, I just really hate Zangief
Only Ken and Ryu, I find it hard to beat Blanka
Keep a Wee Ninja hanging and an UNKLE album banging
If you negative in energy, then stay out the vicinity of...

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, yeah, them niggas over there, it's just
Yeah, yeah, now look at what I wear
Got my gold watch and my gold chain
With my fancy car and my diamond ring
With my ghetto broad and she's so plain
Got a couple scars and one of those long names
She-a fight a nigga and cusses with no shame
And her ex-man had her baggin' up cocaine, but she
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, and it's

[Verse 3]
But my most coveted thing is a high self-esteem
And a low tolerance for them telling me how to lean
See, the most important parts are the ones that are unseen
The wings don't make you fly and the crown don't make you king
Now, God don't like ugly, ain't too happy 'bout pretty
I am ignorance's enemy so stay out the vicinity of...

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, yeah, them niggas over there, it's just
Yeah, yeah, now look at what I wear
Got my gold watch and my gold chain
With my fancy car and my diamond ring
With my ghetto broad and she's so plain
Got a couple scars and one of those long names
She-a fight a nigga and cusses with no shame
And her ex-man had her baggin' up cocaine, but she
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, and it's

[Talking]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, 1-5 who's more crooked than One-Time?
Say 1-5 who's more crooked than One-Time?
Yeah, yeah check is my mic on? As I twilight zone?

[Pre-verse]
My mindstate rewinds wakes
And fast-forwards bullets makin'a B-line for my face
My mindstate
My mindstate

My mindstate rewinds wakes
And fast-forwards bullets makin'a B-line for my face

1-5 who's more crooked than One-Time?
Say 1-5 who's more crooked than One-Time?
Check it, is my mic on, as I twilight zone?

[Verse:]
My mindstate rewinds wakes
And fast-forwards bullets makin'a B-line for my face
Then they stop like Neo
Laugh at me throw some cash at me then fly pass me
But one ricochets off the wall to come back and ask me
Am I scared of him or the "nigga that blast me"
Or maybe just the hammer that goes to be a hole in an innocent bystander
My eye's a camera my ear's a microphone
My mind is Pro Tools my head is a stool
Whats recorded in my dome gets reported when I zone
My mouth is a speaker I'm anchoring the misery
There's no friends the enemy of my enemy is my enemy
Beakers and test tubes full of memories
In my labatory I create stories
Doze off then wake up surrounded by Forties
Wit Glocks tucked in they labels
And they caps is baseball hats
Playin poker at a table
Cigarettes massage they shoulders in belly tops showin off they navels
A dime sack side bets, a tech is runnin' for president
Jesus pieces walk around with niggas hangin' from they necks
Monopoly is playin' chess
I just picked up an obituary of a bullet proof vest
Put the headphone on my mouth speak into my ears
Yea microphone check, check, check, check, check
Check, a pair of Air Forces told me Rims've been extinct for years
Been ethnic cleansed by Jersey's tryna take over the set
And Television is on deathrow for killing BET and MTV over a dice game
And paralyizing CNN by knifing him in the neck
I hear Clear Channel's been fightin' him in the rec
Who's in for givin' grape Kool-Aid laced with strychnine to mixtapes and arm robbin' cassettes
Dope told me Weed was a crack fiend but Crack told me that Dope was a base head
Hi-hats told police he was just a soldier he did what the Bass said
The Snare and the Kick didn't make it out alive
The Sample made it out with some money but he died in the ride
The 808 got caught wit some work (He ain't never comin' home)
So the MPC's and the MP3's is fightin over his turf
Sean Don just gave birth
But she's thinkin' bout leavin it on the doorstep of a church
Cristal can't have kids she plottin' to kidnap it that she orchestrated with a purse
But Gucci told Fendi and Fendi turned and around and told Henny
And Henny is Moets baby's father
But she tried it anyway disguised as a nurse
In the newspapers it says "Hip-Hop called Rock n Roll racist"
The Six ripped the Five and the Maybach taped it
A Hundred dollar bill just signed a record deal
But he blew all his money on the Braceletes
And givin' the Gold Dollar a face lift
A Button Up just drove by in a 6-4 Impalla
All the Rolex's is hatin' you see the smirks on they faces
The Havatampas is defending the Dutchess they keep catchin cases
But the judge is a Swisha he just give em iBonds and community service with the Papers
So the Newport's is gettin mad at the ZigZags then out come the razors
See the Kool's is killers on the creep
Rush up on the Philly, leave his guts spillin on the street
Some Gold Grills burned down the building of some teeth
Some Sharpened Tooth Brushes is holding the trampoline cuz some children finna to leap
I just seen Rocawear rock Sean John to sleep with the same heat that Baby Phat carried
Sprint is pimpin Nextel she just gave head to a Black Berry
I heard she go two-ways
But he was skeetin on her face as it was beepin on my waist
This is the mind of Lupe
Just make sure my mic's on when I Twilight Zone, Zone, Zone, Zone

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I am absolutely, positively on my grizzy
Even though I'm sick and I'm tired, I gets busy
Started a 62, but it ended up a frisbee
And me, I like to stand at the stove until I'm dizzy
Ball so hard it's like I brought the game with me
Left my glove so white you thought I brought Jermaine with me
'Bout to paint a perfect picture like I brought the frame with me
(I'm fed up, I'm fed up)
I give it all up before I let the fame get me
I got niggas tryin' to sue me, bitches tryin' to do me
Way these niggas actin', you'da thought they never knew me
But these niggas know me and half them niggas owe me
I'm fed up, it's why I'm actin' like the old me

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm sick and tired of you suckers so now I'm fed up
Somebody catch the chain, I'm 'bout to tear his head off
Shawty bendin' over knowin' I'm 'bout to tear it up
Before you let your top back, get your bread up
Made history, but now we claimin' victory
Get ya out the White House, go back to your efficiencies
Suckers feel me and I know you haters hear me
(I'm fed up, I'm fed up)
Like the IRS, you wonder what I'm makin, yearly!
With them brown bags circulate, so I perpetrate
We shinin' than the bottom cause we're down to twerkulate
Lookin' at the parking lot; better get your mind right
I hope you fed up being broke because the times right
Ross!

[Hook: Usher]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uhh, me and Wayne was gettin' high on 'em
He leaned over and told me, "Just don't retire on 'em
And when they give ya they shoulders, never cry on 'em
And when they love you to death, just never die on 'em"
And the question still remains
Have I counted all the money that I've managed to obtain?
Niggas dedicatin' overtime to damagin' my name
And somehow I'm still the hottest motherfucker in the game

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
(I’m happy to be back man!) I’m tired of these haters
That’s why I go hard like A.C. Slater
Weezy Baby here, y’all pre-natal
I just get the beat and murk it out like Fredo
Uhh, I’m sick of bein' criticized
That’s why I’m higher than the Star Trek Enterprise
I do it big, don’t get mad cause you minimized
I keep a red flag in case I get penalized
Uhh, it's Young Money like you didn’t know
Stop playin', I hit Drizzy with the give-and-go
It was all a dream, now we the dream team
Who trying to see us? You seein' things
Hustle like I still pay rent man
Got a chest full of heart, no Tin Man
Uhh, Kha-Kha-Khaled I’m fed up
Flow wake the dead up, Weezy

[Verse 5: Usher]
Yeah, hop out, I been in this, been breakin records since '94
So I ain't gotta brag about records that I’ve broke
Records that I hold and records that I’ve sold
And I’m fed up with these niggas relieving my lingo (yeah)
Don’t bite the hand of your provider
You sayin' I ain’t influenced you, you a liar

You need to wake up and realize

[Hook: Usher]

I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

[Verse 1]
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, "Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if ya hundred proof"
I asked her her name, she said: "Blah-blah-blah"
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said: "How do you like the show?" She said: "I was very amused"
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, "Do ya have a man?", she tried to pretend
She said: "No, I don't, I only have a friend"
Come on!
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 2]
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named "blah-blah-blah" that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time, so we can build a
Relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say: "Yo, who was that?" "Oh, he's just a friend"
Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that!
Jus' bust this

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 3]
So, I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl, that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
"Yo, could you tell me where is door three?"
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So, I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock, my heart went down south
So please, listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend...

[Intro: Ice-T & Brother Marquis]
Yeah, last year a lot of motherfuckers asked me
Why I didn't do no old sex nasty shit
But this year I went down to Miami and got my nigga from 2 Live
Brother Marquis in the house! (Yeah I'm the motherfuckin nigga)
Yeah, we gonna answer the question about girl problems
All these niggas is havin girl problem, Marq
(Huh, tell them man, tell them how it is)
Lemme tell you what time is it..

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
I got a ho from the East, got a ho from the West
Got a ho that likes to jack it off and rub it in her chest
I got a ho from the North, a ho from the South
A ho that likes to suck it long and hold it in her mouth
I got a bitch with hair, a bitch with none
A bitch with a knife, a bitch with a gun
A bitch with a ass big as a TV set
And there's a bitch over there; hey, the one I'm gonna get
But yo but maybe not, she might not like me though
No sweat to a vet; I'll slam her sister, though
Word, Ice in the whole damn herd
I fuck 'em all and leave 'em on the curb
I got a bitch with a mink, who rocks a fat gold link
Who likes to fuck me with her ass up on the kitchen sink
Got a bitch with tits, a bitch with ass
A bitch with none, but hey, I'd give her a pass
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you having girl problems, I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit it

[Hook: Ice-T]
Nah, a bitch ain't one

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
I got a bitch that's old, a bitch that's new
A bitch who love velvet in the colors blue
I got a bitch who's fat, a bitch who's built
A bitch who all her titties give out powdered milk
I got a bitch who's funny, a bitch who ain't
A bitch who can sing, a bitch who cain't
A bitch who loves fucking on a airplane..
I even got a bitch off Soul Train
I got a bitch who rolls a rag-top Benz
Long ends
I got a bitch who's broke as a bum
But she's the most fun
I got a bitch who play piano, a bitch who don't
A bitch who dances naked, a bitch who won't
A bitch who's short, a bitch who's tall
A bitch who burns my pager with priority calls
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me

[Interlude: Ice-T]
Yo Marquis - you from Miami man why don't you show these motherfuckers all the over the world
The 2 Live style of how the bitches treat a mothafuckin' fly nigga like you

[Verse 3: Brother Marquis]
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one of them
I don't trip on hoes, cause I don't need none of them
Pussy's the temptation, dick's the persuasion
All hoes suck cock nigga how you play 'em?
That's why I don't sleep on 'em, I just freak on 'em
Stick dick in they mouth; take it out and I skeet on 'em
The nigga the one-nighter, the bitch exciter
I only love my hoes when I'm going up inside her
Problem number one is getting money
I'd rather taste the green than sip the honey
So don't expect nothing cause I ain't offering
I go hard on my bitches, cause I'm never never softening
Putting the demand on 'em, fuck 'em and scram on 'em
The "wham, bam, thank you ma'am" game is ran on 'em
So fuck how you feel, your fucking cheap thrill
I hope you took the pill cause I won't pay the bill
Getting pussy's just another expense
If pussy pays the bills then dick pays the rent
I only need a ho for one thing and that's to cum
I've got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one, ha

[Interlude: Ice-T & Brother Marquis]
Ha! Yo Marquis my motherfucker you got problems man?
(A bitch ain't one) Aww shit!
Now let me tell you how to do this shit

[Verse 4: Ice-T & Brother Marquis]
I got a bitch that loves to G
She'll fuck you right after she fucks me
I got a bitch who loves both
I got a bitch who loves handcuffs and ropes
I got a bitch that's fast, a bitch that's slow
A bitch that's a virgin and a bitch that's a ho
A bitch that lies
A bitch that's true
A bitch who's a man because they're bitches too
I got a bitch that's cool
A bitch that's hot
A bitch who loves rap, a bitch who loves rock
A bitch who's lost and one who knows where it's at
She gets up under me and purrs like a cat
I got a bitch that runs, I got a bitch that walks
I got a bitch that yells, I got a bitch who talks
I got a bitch that's dirty, got a bitch that's neat
I got a super fine bitch that I knocked in the swap meet
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you having girl problems, I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me...

[Hook]
No a bitch ain't one
Huh, you know a bitch ain't one

[Outro: Ice-T & Brother Marquis]
Youknahmsayin? I got problems with my mothafuckin' rent Marquis
But a bitch ain't one
Man you got yourself nothing man
Fuck them raggedy stank-ass hoes nigga
A bitch ain't one
I got a problems staying out here on these streets
With the police trying to take a nigga out, y'know?
But a bitch ain't one
Got problems with motherfuckers.. buying my records
But a bitch ain't one
Fuck 'em all, nigga fuck them motherfuckers
Youknahmsayin? A bitch ain't one
Got problems man
All them motherfuckers can kiss my mothafuckin' ass.. for real
Really, niggas worrying about bitches
They better, they better find something else to worry about

Eligible bachelor, finna get my Bachelor’s
And if this rap shit don’t work, I’m going for my Master’s
Still scouting hoes on the first day of classes
Keep up with the asses, keep up with the grades
A nigga straight A’s like the Braves
She got me in her dorm room, talking bout her room ain’t clean
And she wanna fuck, but wait until her roommate leaves
Now I could give a damn if her roommate seeing
'Cause if the girl get excited, she’s invited (haha)

[Hook]

Fayettenam, yeah, yeah
Class of 2007 man
Holla at me
I’m going to grad school though, you know?

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt]
Uh, addicts arise when I arrive
In this cracked crack fag back slab in disguise
Fat sack of knives in the passenger side
Bitch, reach for the door, get your access denied
I'm not an asshole, I just don't give a fuck a lot
The only time I do is when a bitch is screaming "Tyler, stop!"
The big bad wolf; to me, you're just a minor fox
Red Riding is getting some of this wolfly odder cock
We the niggas you scared of like bad dentists
Flow is anthemic, dirty like it's plants in it
Sick, spit a pandemic, crack and cancer mixed with cannabis
To have a bitch ready to stab a clit with some glass and shit
Your whole gang'll be diminished, bunch got the Brady's in it
Spit sick shit like my saliva got the rabies in it
Fuck rap, I'll be a landlord so I can rape the tenant's daughter
Leave my house with a new stomach, and a baby in it
Face it, me and Ace is sick like malaria carri—

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt]
"Augh! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, stop!"
"Why did you do that?"
"Say sorry, say sorry!"
"Sorry! I'm sorry as fuck!
"Say sorry!"
"I'm sorry as fuck, ow, ow!"
"Say sorry!"
"I'm sorry! Don't look at this!"
"Say sorry"
"Don't look at this, ow stop!"
"Say sorry!"
"Ow! Stop 'fore you fuck something up!"
"Say, "Sorry!"
"Say, "Sor-"
"Sorry, sorry—Uncle!"
"I fucked this nigga eye up man haha"

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt]
Face it, me and Ace is sick like malaria carriers
Jim Carrey her to the cemetery to bury her
Listen busters, scarier when I finger fuck her
After I dig her up and then eat her out with a bit of mustard
Took karate, mommy told me "Tyler toughen up"
Rihanna haircut, somebody tell Chris Brown to fuck me up
Had to teach the bitch manners, now I gotta learn her
I'll beat the fuck out your bitch anonymous, Ike Turner
Over, sloppy seconds is my preference
Except for when I'm feeding on the flesh of a pedestrian
Nessy loch monster stop Will he though? Probably not
Silly hoes lick my balls like FIFA lollipops
Get the certain tingle, eating Häagen-Dazs
With some soccer moms where they like to fucking sit and mingle
Watch an Animal Planet document on the Eagles
In the flyest '06 Supreme beanie, Sigel
Your grind's feeble, I'm regal, really, I'm Willy Smith
I am Legend, a snicker dick in a vanilli chick
Come take a stab at it faggot, I pre-ordered your casket
This is known as a classic, yeah that chapped lips crack shit
Hat is always forest so the bitches call me Gump
But compliment her tits and then its off to hump her
Fuck her in a Hummer while I rape her then I put her in a slumber
It's not a figure of speech when I tell you that I dumped her
Known narcissists, sipping on arsenic
Carved carcasses in the garage, don't park in it
Hard as finding retarded kids at Harvard
It's Wolf Gang barking keep you up like car alarms and shit
Over the edge, yeah I hide in a potato sack
'Cause I'm cold as ice like Anasia when she fucking Traq
I'm the type to put you down to bring myself up
So when I rape a bitch I hold her down and get my best nut
The reincarnation of '98 Eminem
60 Crip and Grizzly and some RMK Denim
Pay attention I'm stabbing your women friends, like a gentleman
Then dipping with the fucking pen to go sin again
White girl, you can ask her what the dick be like
At monster madness doing drive by's on a fucking fixie bike
Fuck it, moron, snorting oxycontin, wearing cotton
Oxymoron like buff faggots playing sissy dikes
This the shit that get cripple bitches to hop
Dirty crack pipes lit, bullshit to stop, halt
Boss broke, spouse choke, blouse open
Sly's little shop of horrors, now showing
I hate gays, gangbangers and fucking jerkers
Unless it's gay gangbangers, that's fucking jerkers
Whoa yo, yo.. no homo, I'm not gay, faggot
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Wu-Tang banging in your system
Probably banging in your sister
With my children swimming in her system
Let me say this shit in slow-mo, homo
You don't fucking skate, take off that box logo

[Verse 1: Drake]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
Think I had the motherfucking plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I’m the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn, that punch line was predictable
I still got you shitting bricks, homie quit the bull
And we don’t need new members, to me the clique is full
And I be getting the same women that Tip can pull
Believe or not, I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buying the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be ripping the same records that Weezy rock
This shit is easy pop
That’s why I’m ready man
I’d never copy Nor-bit like Eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head, did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just trying to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I’m going up and they heading into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playing streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn’t see ya’ll
These Skee-Lo rappers wishing they could be tall
Letting all their fake friends use them like a free stall

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig

[Verse 2: Drake]
I said I know you see me chilling super low key
If I’m with the right niggas, you can scoop an O.Z
All the hustlers and the bouncers and the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades in a coupe with no keys
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cutting, we can cut some more
Then after you get high
Make em, get em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got a lota dough plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain’t heard? I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend even if they been offended
They ain’t really got a choice, it’s an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it’s a given
Plus a nigga famous, plus I got a vision
Not to mention having bars like a motherfucking prison
They taking too long, their records on hold
They threatened by my presence cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they bragging bout what they sold
Just remember where I live at, fifty thousand's going gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
Instead of hatin’ on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man, you acting like a bitch
I ain’t acting like I’m rude
I’m just acting like I’m rich, rich
Riding with Weezy fucking Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fucking, baby?
Cause I don’t waste time, can’t you see a nigga lazy
And I might need some help
But, you know, Weezy’s fucking crazy

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig

[Spoken Word: Lil Wayne]
Y-M, bitch, everyday
Two times on Sunday
Spitta!
Check your blinkers, baby

Cause, to me, look like you’ve been turning right all day, yeah
Right my way, I got a boulevard, baby
That’s right, Cash Avenue
Wall Street gangsta
Carter, y'all
Why would I lie, yeah
I ain’t rich, bitch, I’m wealthy
Young, I talk shit til I die
Come kill me, nigga
Fuck you, no homo
She like it, yeah
Boy, these motherfucking glasses I got on right now

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig

[Verse 1]
Aye baby tell me have you ever seen a nigga chasin' dreams
Leavin' everything he love behind to make this cream
Kisses his momma on the cheek, say, don't worry I'll be back
I gotta get you out this shit, I'm a hurry, I'll speed back
You see, that's the type of shit the boy be thinkin' when he dreamin'
And he don't pay no mind to them niggas that's disagreein'
Sayin', nigga, is you crazy
Them same ones that's talkin' be the same ones not doin' shit
Aye, nigga is you lazy
Or is you scared to follow dreams
I know you gotta have one
The opportunities be in yo' face
You gotta grab one nigga
But while you're bullshittin'
I'll be woodgrippin' gettin' wealthy
On the road to riches, God help me
I'll holla at ya'll niggas when I see you, wouldn't wanna be you
Cause you fear what I don't, see this here is what I want
So I'm a get it poppin', I'm rockin' despite the obstacles
Look, my nigga what you call impossible is possible

[Refrain]
Aye, tell my niggas to keep they heads up
We made it too damn far just to give it up
And we way too strong
This is a song for the Ville
Yeah, yeah
And baby don't cry, you know I'm comin' back
I did it for the city, gotta get up on the map
And I know we gon' shine
This is a song for the Ville, yeah

[Verse 2]
I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though I'm stressin', I know it's temporary
Starin' at my granny obituary
She almost made it to eighty before they buried
Damn, can't even tell you I'm sure I'll to make it to 30
Cause you never know, sometimes life takes a turn for the worst
Is you holdin' on to will, or did you let it go
Heaven knows I'm tryna hold on
So every night I pray and hope my life is prolonged
The journey seemed so long but hold up
Don't take me up
I got big dreams nigga, ya'll can't wake me up
Life's a bitch but death don't break me up, I got too much to live for
It seems too many niggas die with way too much potential
Gotta get up out this trap even if I got to scrap
I'll lay a nigga down flat before I'll let him hold me back
Ya see I ain't afraid of obstacles
But what you niggas call impossible is possible
Yeah, so aye

[Refrain]

Aye, some niggas take they life for granted, wastin' time
Time is money my nigga, I cannot waste a dime
Or a minute, too much business to handle to be sleepin'
Too much spinach to eat for niggas beefin'
So I'm out here trick or treatin', can my niggas comprehend
Bill Gates, Donald Trump, motherfucker let me in
Stop hatin' that's a sin, why these niggas so sinful
I guess they hate to love a nigga, yes it's that simple
As I ride through the city, feelin' lucky to be breathin'
I know a couple peers that didn't make it to the season, pour it out
See I believe that things happen for a reason, no doubt
Strange times, as I watch these niggas throw they gang signs, and they strapped
Crips or Blood, nigga we all black
From the same city, the same schools we was taught at
Aye fuck the drawbacks and obstacles
Man what them teachers call impossible is possible nigga, yeah

[Refrain]

[Intro]
Bum, ba bum
This is gonna feel real good, a'ight?
Most Dope
Everybody please put a thumb in the air (Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)

[Verse 1]
I feel like a million bucks
But my money don't really feel like I do
And from the ground, I built my own damn buzz
People was amazed I was still in high school
But now I'm out, and money what I'm 'bout
Tryna get so much that I can't keep count
New kicks give me cushion like whoopie
Keep a smile like an Eat'n Park cookie
Everything good, I'm white boy awesome
Up all night, Johnny Carson
I ain't got a Benz, no, just a Honda
But tryna get my money like an Anaconda
Real, real long, cross the country
Smoke joints in the whip, no cop can bust me
Drive into the stage, they applaud and scream
All them pretty little girls come and flock with me
Yeah, I rock the beat

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)

[Verse 2]
And I like my rhymes witty, all my dimes pretty
If you got weed, you can come fly with me
I don't take pity on them silly little hoes
Milli Vanilli but this is really how it goes
Mouth my words, don't say shit
Shh, shut up, bitch, and ride this dick
I'm just playing, let's have a ball
All we need is some weed, hoes and alcohol, hey
Don't forget it when I'm wreckin' the etiquette for the hell of it
Smellin' it when the L is lit, I'm flyer than a pelican
Young fresh, but I'm so damn intelligent
Girls givin' brains 'cause I'm acting like a gentleman
In deeper than the water Michael Phelps was in
Finna have a party, baby, you can tell your friends
We the type, lookin' right, still settin' trends
Fuck a job, I'ma get these dead presidents

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)

[Bridge]
Not a day, goes by when I ain't gettin' high
They wonder why don't I go get myself a job
So I can make, them bucks, but I don't give a fuck
No, I feel great
Bitch, I feel great

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)

[Chorus]
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good (Uh-huh, yo, yo)

[Verse 1]
Now tell them bitches anyway
'Cause we don’t care what none of them gyal affi say
You can’t stop me, I'ma fulfill the prophecy
I do it, I did it, the proper way
On my property, now watch how we operate
Bottles on ice, the bottles is on ice
The VIP lights is hittin' us just right
So if you gettin' money, just throw it up in the air
Yeah, hands in the air like I was your puppeteer
'Cause I, I, I, I am Zolanski
Some call me Barbie, yes, I'm life-size
Yes, I am humble, yes, but why lie?
I am the reason why these girls go bye-bye

[Chorus]
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good (Uh, yo)

[Verse 2]
Okay, now, this right here could get me in trouble
'Cause when I say I ball, I don’t mean in a huddle
I’m always in the lime, I never do nothin' subtle
'Cause it’s Pink Friday, ho, that's their rebuttal
My two guns up, let's blaze it, let's go
I keep a lot of money up in the Escrow
And when I'm at the game, I'm in the best row
I am the baddest bitch up in the pet store
'Cause I, I, I, I am Onika
And these shoes here mean fashionista
'Cause these don’t come out 'til it's Easter
I'm VIP bound with Leighton Meester

[Chorus]
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good

[Bridge]
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah yah yah, yah yah, yah, yah, yah yah, yah

[Chorus]
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good

[Hook]
Work on the kitchen table
Where the bags at
Work on the kitchen table
Where the bags at
Work on the kitchen table
Where the bags at
Work, work
I'm a nigga with money
I'm a nigga with money
I'm a nigga with money
And I don't love that bitch
I tell her; bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, make me rich
I'm a nigga with money
And I don't love that bitch

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Backpack
Full of stacks
All the bitches love me
Don't compare me
To these rappers
I'm on a different budget
I ain't even gotta practice
Never getting rusty
No I ain't lookin down
But I see no one above me
The paper bag brown, wit dirty green money
The bank account good, full of clean money
Fuck chain money
I blow ring money
I got that motherfuckin never-see-the-bank money
Magazine money
Do a spread on me
And you can turn your back, but never turn the Feds on me
Read the note attached: We got ya lil homey
We need bread homey, or that's ya dead homey
I'm like a Corleone, meet the fucking mob
I can get you whacked, or give your ass a job
Weezy F B
I holla CMB
Coca Cola classic, caffeine free

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Stop playing with me, stop playing with me bitch
Stop playing with me, stop playing with me bitch
I'm a cash money stunner on my 14th summer
Dick a bitch down and take everything from her
Now run to the kitchen, I ain't hungry, I ate
Bitch put 36 O's on my plate
See my pa was cooking slabs while my mom was cooking dinner
See my momma is a chef and my daddy was a dealer
Grandaddy was a dealer and my auntie is a killer
I hope she know I love her, pray the pigs never get her
My brother still a baby, and my uncle kinda raised me
Y'all pray for his wife, cause that cancer shit is crazy
And my daughter's so smart that it scares me
Her mother is an angel, she's always there for me
And me, I'm just wild; I think I need therapy
Because I'm going after that money, no matter where it be

(Just like that) It's like Wonderland

You you can't can't be be ripping the mic the mic like do re me me
Measles are contagious like my lyrical pages
Ripping and flipping the mic
From back in the back in the days, these days it's kinda hectic, hectic
When these suckers don't respect it, check it
Flame on, I know the light is bright but keep on watching me
I'm stolen property, kicking the flavor to society
Police be clocking me, but logically they got to be
Cause they were taught that serious poetry would come from Socrates
But that ain't it, in 94 I'll kick the hit
If I was in front of Shakespeare, I'd battle the punk and take his shit
I'm not having it
Bust the narrative I come to give, listen
Rap is something you do, Hip Hop is something you live
The difference is kids nowadays, they got the video
Rappers don't need skills to build so they don't really know
Hear me yo, I'm four times on Arsenio
Got ten videos, but does that help me flow? No
That's why when I come to the show MC's act like they don't know
Cause they were too young to rock up in the disco
Frisco Disco, the disc is like a Nabisco
Chocolate chip cookie, don't fuck with me rookie
I'm rocking beats and with death defying feats
And I'm never squeaking, I'm always freaking when I'm speaking
Inside I'm keeping a statement for police and
I'm down for peace and but not turn the other cheek and
So this DJ, he gets down
Mixing records while they go...
Round and round, round we go
Two years ago a friend of mine
And Flash is gonna rock your mind
Welcome to the terror dome, the terror dome
I wonder if I take you home
E-F-F-E-C-T
A cool operator operating correctly
But back in the days I knew rap would never die
Too late baby bye bye in a batty boy head, head, head
Insane in the membrane
Take the train, take the train
M-E-T-H-O-D man...
...Hattan keeps on making it, Brooklyn keeps on taking it
We keep coming back with more and more hits
Party people
I came through the door, I said it before
Two years ago, super ho
If my train goes off the track
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up back, back
Back to the grill again, the grill again
Friends
How many MC's must get dissed?
Before somebody says don't fuck with Kris
Hey! Ho! Keep on moving don't stop no...
...Body beats the Biz
Let's do the dance called the Pee Wee Herman
Hey, Erick Sermon, hey
You you get off my cloud
Go down baby, go down baby
The gods must be crazy
You ain't fresh, you ain't fresh, yeah

[Intro: Andy & Akon]
Sometimes
Oh, oh, oh
Something beautiful happens in this world
Akon
You don't know how to express yourself, so
And Lonely Island, yeah
You just gotta sing

[Chorus: Akon]
I just had sex, and it felt so good (Felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her
I just had sex, and I'll never go back (Never go back)
To the not-having-sex ways of the past

[Verse 1: Andy & Jorma]
Have you ever had sex? I have, it felt great
It felt so good when I did it with my penis
A girl let me do it, it literally just happened
Having sex can make a nice man out the meanest
Never guess where I just came from, I had sex
If I had to describe the feeling, it was the best
When I had the sex, man, my penis felt great
And I called my parents right after I was done
Oh, hey, didn't see you there, guess what I just did?
Had sex, undressed, saw her boobies and the rest
Was sure nice of her to let you do that thing
Nice of any girl ever! Now, sing

[Chorus: Akon]
I just had sex, and it felt so good (Felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her
I wanna tell the world

[Verse 2: Andy & Jorma]
To be honest, I'm surprised she even wanted me to do it
Doesn't really make sense! But, man, screw it
I ain't one to argue with a good thing! She could be my wife
That good? The best thirty seconds of my life
I'm so humbled by a girl's ability to let me do her
'Cause honestly, I'd have sex with a pile of manure
With that in mind, a soft, nice-smelling girl's better
Plus, she let me wear my chain and my turtleneck sweater

[Bridge: Akon]
So this one's dedicated to them girls
That let us flop around on top of them, yeah
Whether you're near or far, whether short or tall, yeah
We wanna thank you all for letting us fuck you

[Interlude: Andy, Jorma, & Akon]
She kept looking at her watch
Doesn't matter, had sex
But I cried the whole time
Doesn't matter, had sex
I think she might've been a racist
Doesn't matter, had sex
She put a bag on my head
Still counts!

[Bridge: Akon]
I just had sex, and my dreams came true (Dreams came true)
So if you've had sex in the last thirty minutes
Then you qualified to sing with me

[Chorus: Akon]
I just had sex, and it felt so good (Felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her
I just had sex, and I'll never go back (Never go back)
To the not-having-sex ways of the past
(Sex has gotta be so great)

[Lil Wayne talking]
This the remix baby, yea!
You already know what it is
Cause if you don't, you just don't know nothing
Shit period... stupid

[Lil Wayne]
You know me, I just be chillin in the phantom, listenin to opera
Gun is my body guard, call it Kevin Costner
Probably won't stop if, I get to poppin them shots
You niggas is sweeter than a box of Red Hots
Fuck around, see a flock of red dots
Smoke good, eat good, only fuck a bitch
If her dough good, feet good, just bought a fleetwood
And I'mma put some D's on that bitch
Lookin like I got a diamond disease on my wrist
Fresh! bunch of little G's on my kicks
I'ma dog, your all a bunch of fleas on my dick
Young Money Cash Money, and we gon' get the money even if it kills ya'll
And I'mma ride, 'til the muthafuckin wheels off
George Gervin, I'mma get my chill on
I'm cold, yeah I get my Buffalo Bill on
Beatin up ya block, yeah I get my Emmitt Till on
In the New Edition, yeah I get my Johnny Gill on
Keep a shotgun, yeah I get my Jason Will on
Fuck it Swizz, I'm still gon'
Black entertainment, yeah I get my Steven Hill On
Only to talk models, yeah I get my Seal on
Make that chick rock, get my Emil on
Two girls, let 'em get they pill on
Let 'em get they feel on, I get my Tip Drill on
Hey, now why you that ice grill on?
I leave you lookin like you got a barbeque grill on
Yeah, we got money to the ceiling
Real nigga, I get my Keep It Real on
And they be lying on wax, like a earphone
Weezy Baby, the best from here on
Swish, I'm in gear homes
They in trouble, we gon' bubble like beer foam
No homo, let em get they queer on
No commercial, I just take the leer home
My girl she get her pampoir on
She don't touch me, I got cashmere on
I ball, and you just Erik Dampier, dawg
I'm dirty, I get my Bill Lambier on
Weezy the Beast, Swizzy the Monster and we're gone

[Intro: St. Vincent, Kid Cudi]
(—the black hole blacker)
Paint the black hole blacker (Yeah)
Paint the black hole blacker (I swear to tell the truth)
Paint the black hole blacker (The whole truth)
Paint the black hole blacker (And nothing but)
Paint the black hole blacker (Yes)
Paint the black hole blacker (Hey)

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I am the maniac, I am the ghoul (The ghoul)
I'm in the shadows in the corner of my room (My room)
This my new hideaway, this is my tomb (Tomb)
This is my coffin, this is my place for unruliness, no worries
I love the darkness, yeah, I'd like to marry it
It is my cloak, it is my shield, it is my cape (Cape)
I love the dark, maybe we can make it darker (Darker)
Give me a marker

[Chorus: Kid Cudi, St. Vincent]
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
(—the black hole blacker)

[Verse 2: Cage]
I am the maniac, I am the fool
I found the monster in me when I lost my cool (Yeah)
It lives inside of me, eating what's in its way
I put black spray paint on my windows during the day
I want to spend time with it, I think I'm losing it
Or I found it and I'm using it
I wear my shades at night so I can look in the abyss
I see something in nothingness if you can picture this
Put black holes in my jar lid, I climb the wall
I'm too high now, I'll die from the fall
Before the water's to our knees, we can't climb when the trees
Wash away, you and I are the disease

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
I am a maniac

[Outro: Kid Cudi, Cage, St. Vincent]
(I am the maniac)
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
(I am the maniac)
I am a maniac
(—the black hole blacker)

[Verse]
It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head, claim it
I'm about to paint a picture, you niggas go 'head, frame it
Since we getting Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards, I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rolling with some jokers
And me, I'm rolling with some brokers
Like, damn, could you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise yourself, go buy a costume
I am making stocks work while you working stock rooms
Ugh, and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
You fake gangsta rappers are cliché
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I'll be all in your face, like, "No speak-a la ingles"
Soon as you hear it, you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me, I'm aware, and my car's right there
Is this interior enough for y'all ulterior motives?
'Cause if you like it, y'all should stick with me
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a ki
A lot of ice, a lot of cream like Dickie Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Michie Mee
But I'ma try and have you on the trip with me
Sliding through Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex-man is a hater, officially
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah, that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad 'cause his girl's at the house
With her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flicks
But at this point, I'm just poking a body with a stick
Nowadays, rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself is who I am feeling, probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skip
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just lets me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here, baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if they paid me
Mr. Bet You That's Expensive 'cause it's not a fugazi
Spitting a Crock Pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasting?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it, girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that 'Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well, I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga, keep your two cents, I ain't tryna leave you broke

[Refrain]
Life of a don, lights keep glowing
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
And something crazy on my arm, uh-ahem
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds

[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club, I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two, my nig, 'bout to be twenty three, ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many leave they wives so deep inside
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the pit stops
I heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch
And all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin'
And tell them niggas this is Nick's spot
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh?
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh?
Reached to do it and realized his dick stuck

[Chorus: Drake]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina gon' rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth degree, Tennekey, T-Dot to the country y'all
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, and back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
Single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back
Purple drink and trips to Kroger's just to get they money stacked
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!

[Chorus: Drake]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

[Intro]
Mmm
Ladies
My favorite ladies

[Verse: MF DOOM]
Mary—you make me wanna eat you
Every time I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Fragrance like a flower—subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see-through
Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich look like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, complexion like Acapulco Gold
If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer-load (trailer load)
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit it while you would've sold to the highest bidder, like
Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute, and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight and letting everybody hit it (Ally)
Unlike Ally—sometimes she get bitter
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her until to this day and never did abuse her
I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably could've been, if I'd never met Evie
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though
Kept a shorty mad fine 'n' much thinner
If caught, I get mad time just for touchin' her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds (Lucy)
Little young thing, she liked to do the tongue thing
At times she would play hard to get, fronting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling
Met her out in Central Park, that's one sign
Had the God mentally sparked, reflecting sunshine
She said, "You need to stop messing with that white girl
She fuckin' with your head and got your heart in a tight curl" (cookie)
We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the dunce price OT
Plus she from Colombia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish (Miss Hazy)
And Miss Hazy; older woman, mature, Black
Every time she sees me, I end up gettin' towed back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is that she make me too lazy
Sugar-mommy laced me with the butter navy Avi
Just her way to make up for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on

[Outro: MF DOOM]
Mmm
Ladies
My favorite ladies

[Intro]
Kids
Kids, yeah
Haha

[Verse 1]
I'm just high, why they hatin' on me?
People tend to think all the drinks on me
I don't even have the money to spend
To buy Patrón for you and all your friends (Hey)
Baby, I be on my grind, rain, sleet, snow
Rollin' up good every place we go
'Cause we tryin' get high (Get high), get high (Get high), get high
Know the bullshit and all the problems, but we too gone to see
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
We proceed to give 'em what they need
Just wakin' up, then gettin' stoned
Rub my eyes and check my phone
Open up the fridge to make some waffles
But no more syrup left in my bottle, damn
Well, it's okay
I top it off with scrambled eggs, ayy
Gotta work with what you got, ayy (What?)
Gotta work with what you got

[Chorus]
Supposed to be in class, but I ain't goin'
Let's chill on the couch
See what's on the telly
Girl, we won't leave the house
Can you stay a while?
Can you stay a while?
'Cause, girl, I'm feelin' lazy
And I'm tryna hang around

[Verse 2]
Ain't tryna get out of my bed 'til noon
Neighbors smell the perfume, smoke in my room
And I got the door closed, can't be sure, though
Amsterdam weed, spendin' euros
Get the herb rolled, let's relax
Take your shoes off and kick it back
We escape the world, escape the stress
But I don't give a fuck if the house a mess
'Cause we gon' handle that later, we gon' handle that later
Right now, let's get this paper and smile for all them haters
Ayy, cream cheese and a bagel
Have a glass of milk and an Eggo
I'm rockin' PJs and no shirt
I smoke weed, eat yogurt
Enjoy the best things in your life
'Cause you ain't gonna get to live it twice (Twice)
They say you waste time asleep, but I'm just tryin' to dream

[Chorus]
Supposed to be in class, but I ain't goin'
Let's chill on the couch
See what's on the telly
Girl, we won't leave the house
Can you stay a while?
Can you stay a while?
'Cause, girl, I'm feelin' lazy
And I'm tryna hang around

[Outro]
Hardcore pound fucking, that's the shit right there
Hell yeah, yo, that's the only way to do it, man
It's that boom-boom-boom, man
Yeah
I know, but there's a difference between making love, having sex, and then fucking
Right, right

[Intro]
Ooo
Yeah
Wake up, wake up, I don’t wanna wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, I don’t wanna wake up, wake up

[Hook]
Yeah I'm straight, never switch lanes
On my job everyday ’cause it’s hard not to see I
I came up in a big way, and I hardly ever sleep well it’s like a dream
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna wake up from
I don’t wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from

[Verse 1]
Oh, long days, what I know hard work pays
So the money getting long too
And the Kush smell strong too
That’s that good any chick with me, she the bomb too
One thing I know is go hard young, make fake niggas notice
Blowing money ‘cause you dying if you don’t live
That’s how you know I was fly when I wrote this
First class tags or maybe I’m the first ‘cause of my first class swag
Used to say that I was trippin’, so a nigga bought expensive-ass bags

[Hook]
Yeah I'm straight, never switch lanes
On my job everyday ’cause it’s hard not to see I
I came up in a big way, and I hardly ever sleep well it’s like a dream
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna wake up from
I don’t wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from

[Verse 2]
Go hard young, go hard
They let you in the game, better play your part
Go hard young, go hard
And if you in the game might as well play smart
‘cause I’ve seen niggas fold like paper
Got money seen friends turn haters
Got money minor league turn major
Got money white people turn neighbors
Need a girl, teach her how to roll papers, six months three whips all player
Run my town like the mayor, I run my town bitch I’m like the mayor

[Hook]
Yeah I'm straight, never switch lanes
On my job everyday ’cause it’s hard not to see I
I came up in a big way, and I hardly ever sleep well it’s like a dream
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna wake up from
I don’t wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from

[Bridge]
I can take you up higher than you ever know
Let you touch what you want hit it once and you won't let go, hell no
Let you lean back, inhale smoke

[Hook]
Yeah I'm straight, never switch lanes
On my job everyday ’cause it’s hard not to see I
I came up in a big way, and I hardly ever sleep well it’s like a dream
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna wake up from
I don’t wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from

[Hook]
Yeah I'm straight, never switch lanes
On my job everyday ’cause it’s hard not to see I
I came up in a big way, and I hardly ever sleep well it’s like a dream
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna wake up from
I don’t wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from

[Verse 1]
Now you can check the whip appeal
Damn this nigga is ill
Gear shifting as smooth as butter
Cud in and outta lanes, undercover
Style wow, my mirror, the rear view
You could never fly by, homie I will see you
Mach 5, change terrains if need be
Thou shall never floor past
I'm all ready. I did it for you
Act on, seat belt, released to be strapped on
Mach on, hit me when I hit a buck 50
Trying break the speed of sound
Homie do you get me
I call it moving ahead, never speed
A strip of asphalt is all I ever need
All I ever see when I'm switching lanes
They can hardly see, I am good I am okay
Don't worry about a boo boo
I do this all the time this is my life dude
Vroom vroom give me room fool

[Chorus]
You can catch me
Switching lanes lanes
Switching lanes lanes

You can catch me

[Verse 2]
I am getting 'em, getting 'em
And we look at them lookin'
I bring my cool up in the back
And the top is never up on the merr cedes
Four ladies wanna go half on a baby
For anybody ready and willing
I am humbly stunting and I am currently killing
My involvement wit murder might as well begin here
And clearly will they catch on I doubt it
If they ask questions I won't know nothing about it
Being on this side of the law is a ball
Straight west coast and at the Roosevelt crew
We gon' act a fool chilly chill for a min-we uh
I see some French girls baby ooo oui oui
I see you smoking oowee me and my nigga Zuli
Stick it to the script and I'll be puffin' puffin' pass
Don't break the rules and we'll get along fine
Roll tripping steady dipping from what's keeping us behind

[Chorus]
You can catch me
Switching lanes lanes

[Intro: Prince]
Don't worry, I won't hurt you
I only want you to have some fun

[Verse 1: Prince, Lisa, Dez, All]
I was dreamin' when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this morning
Could have sworn it was judgement day
The sky was all purple
There were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction
You know I didn't even care

[Chorus: Prince and All]
'Cause they say
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999

[Verse 2: Prince, Lisa, Dez, All]
I was dreamin' when I wrote this
So sue me if I go too fast
But life is just a party
And parties weren't meant to last
War is all around us
My mind says, "Prepare to fight"
So if I gotta die
I'm gonna listen to my body tonight
Yeah

[Chorus: Prince and All]
They say
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
Yeah, yeah, shh

[Verse 3: Prince, Lisa, Dez, All]
Lemme tell ya somethin'
If you didn't come to party
Don't bother knockin' on my door, oh
I got a lion in my pocket
And baby he's ready to roar, yeah, yeah
Everybody's got a bomb
We could all die any day, oh
But before I'll let that happen
I'll dance my life away
Oh

[Chorus: Prince and All]
They say
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
(We're runnin' outta time)
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
So tonight we gonna, we gonna, oh
Say it one more time
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
No, no
Tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
So tonight we gonna, we gonna, woo

[Bridge: Prince and All]
Alright, 1999
You say it, 1999
Ooh, 1999, oh, 1999
Don't stop, don't stop, say it one more time
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
Yeah, yeah
Tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
So tonight we're gonna, we're gonna, woo

[Outro: Prince, Lisa, Prince and Lisa, All]
Yeah, 1999
Don'tcha wanna go? (1999)
Don'tcha wanna go? (1999)
We could all die any day (1999)
I don't wanna die
I'd rather dance my life away 1999
Listen to what I'm tryin' to say
Everybody, everybody say, "Party"
C'mon now, you say, "Party"
That's right, everybody say "Party"
Can't run from the revelation, no (Party)
Sing it for your nation y'all, "Party"
Tell me what you're singin', baby say, "Party"
Telephone's a-ringin', mama (Party)
C'mon, c'mon, you say, "Party"
Everybody, two times, "Party"
Woo, work it down to the ground, say, "Party"
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Party)
Come on, oh, take my body, baby (Party)
That's right, c'mon, sing the song (Party)
(Oh) (Party)
That's right (Party)
Got a lion in my pocket mama, say, "Party"
Oh, and he's ready to roar (Party)
Ah

[Spoken Outro: Lisa]
Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?
Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?

[Intro: T.I. & Chris Brown]
I'm only, I'm only human dog (Hello, out there)
I'm only human dog (Can you, hear me?)
I'm only human dog (It's an S.O.S)
Ay, ay listen to me (To let me, be me)

[Hook: T.I. & Chris Brown]
Ay when they push you down you got to Get Back Up (I'm only human dog)
Ay when they push you down you got to Get Back Up (I'm just a human y'all)
Push the dirt, off your jersey then go for the cup (Ay, ay)
Or the trophy, or the ring, champion no matter what
Cause when you got the belt, and the ring
People with you popping bottles, taking pictures, look around (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But soon as you fall down all the haters passing judgement (Oh no no)
Fly as I'm is shawty I'mma rise above this (Oh no no no no)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey what it is world? Yeah it's me again
Back before you, at your mercy, on bended knee again
No running from the truth, as much as we pretend
That it ain't what it is, then it hits CNN
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends (I'm sorry)
For letting you down, I won't take you down this road again (Uh-uh)
Most of you now saying, "Whatever, here we go again" (What?)
Blogs, radio and television all going in
I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment (I gotta say)
I gotta say you fucking haters is hilarious (Ha ha)
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou?
Point your finger now with me looking down (Down)
Same clown that was Twitpicing at my wedding
On the same Twitter page disrespecting, wait a second
Never mind my imperfections, this a fact, remember that
No mistake's too great to recover and bounce back

[Hook: T.I. & Chris Brown]
Ay when they push you down you got to Get Back Up (I'm only human dog)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I admit, yeah I done some dumb shit, disappointed erry'body I know
Try not to hold that against me though
My road to redemption has no GPS
So guess that time must be invested for this to be manifested
Yes it's, hard living life in the spotlight
Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light
The Bible say "Let he without sin cast the stone first" (Stone first)
The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first?
Yeah he go to work, never done no drugs up until the Fed
He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead (Damn)
Difference is my shortcomings hit the media
Thanks to TMZ, the AJC and Wikipedia
See the stairway to heaven while stepping down Jacob's ladder
My good outweigh the bad, God ain't that what really matter? (Nope)
And matter fact, I'm wrong but after that
The good I done in yo' hood, should it over-shadow that?
Got the world laughing at me for the moment
But it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with, even if you're so legit
That you get a house with a dog and a picket fence (Ay, ay, ay)
The people with you then but when they turn on you remember this (Ay, ay)

[Hook: T.I. & Chris Brown]
Ay when they push you down you got to Get Back Up (I'm only human dog)

Hello, out there (I'm only human dawg)

[Intro: Tyler]
Odd Future
Wolf Gang
They are them
We are us
Kill them all (Do it with me)
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, come on
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, bitch, bitch over there in the yellow, come on
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Say it loud!
Like you mean it!
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Nigga had the fucking nerve to call me immature
Fuck you think I made Odd Future for?
To wear fucking suits and make good decisions?
Fuck that nigga, Wolf Gang

[Verse 1: Tyler]
Who the fuck invited Mr. I Don't Give a Fuck
Who cries about his daddy in a blog because his music sucks? (I did!)
Well, you fucking up, and truthfully I had enough
And fuck rolling papers, I'm a rebel, bitch, I'm ashing blunts (Sorry)
Full of shit, like I ate that john
Come on kids, fuck that class and hit that bong
Let's buy guns and kill those kids with dads and mom
With nice homes, 401ks, and nice ass lawns
Those privileged fucks got to learn that we ain't taking no shit
Like Ellen DeGeneres clitoris is playing with dick
I'm jealous as shit, cause I ain't got no home meal to come to
So, if you do, I'm throwing fingers out screaming "fuck you"
I got ten of these Kennedy's
Not Dom, but if I was a Dahm, I would be Jeffery
'Preme hat the color of a leprechaun with leprosy
I'm fucking 'bout it, 'bout it, like I'm Master P in '96
It's fucking immaculate, the way your daughter smacking dicks
Surprised she hasn't taken gymnastic dick inside her alley-oop
The Golf Wang hooligans is fucking up the school again
And showing you and yours that breaking rules is fucking cool again
I'm going harder than a midget jumping over me
Chronic youth, I'm shoving blunt wraps in bitches ovaries
Punches to the stomach where that bastard kid supposed to be
Fuck a mask, I want that ho to know it's me, ugh

[Chorus]
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Wolf Gang, it's the Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Gang, triple six crew
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
Wolf Gang kill them

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
My love is gone for you mami, you could ride in hearses
I'm sick in the brain dumb bitch, can you nurse this?
You told me life would never, ever, ever get this perfect
Then you smoke a J of weed, and take his kids to the churches
Uh, fuck church, they singing and the shit ain't even worth it
In the choir, whores and liars, scumbags and the dirt, bitch
You told me God was the answer
When I ask him for shit, I get no answer, so God is the cancer
I'm stuck in triangles, looking for my angel
Kill me with a chainsaw, and let my balls dangle
Triple six is my number, you can get it off my Tumblr

[Chorus]
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Wolf Gang, it's the Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Gang, triple six crew
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
Wolf Gang kill them

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
It was hilarious, well it ain't fucking funny now
I'll push this fucking pregnant clown into a hydrant stuck in the ground
I step through the stomach, replace the baby with some fucking pounds
"My baby daddy shoot bricks, the nigga also shoot rounds"
Cause if I shoot blanks, oops, thanks
I'm right back in it dead yummy and her mildew stank

[Verse 4: Tyler]
Free Earl, that's the fucking shit
And if you disagree, suck a couple pimple-covered dicks
Um, Wolf Gang, that's the fucking clique
Golf Wang kill them all nigga, triple six
Fuck 2DopeBoyz, all them niggas bitches
We don't need y'all, The Fader's who we really fucking with, bitch

[Outro]
And we don't fucking make horrorcore, you fucking idiots
Listen deeper than the music before you put it in a box, Wolf Gang

[Intro: Charles Bukowski]
Born like this, into this
As the chalk faces smile, as Mrs. Death laughs
As political landscapes dissolve
As the oily fish spit out their oily prey
We are born like this, into this
Into hospitals which are so expensive that it's cheaper to die
Into lawyers who charged so much, it's cheaper to plead guilty
Into a country where the jails are full and the madhouses closed
Into a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes
Born into this, walking and living through this
Dying because of this
Castrated, debauched, disinherited, because of this
The fingers reach toward an unresponsive God
The fingers reach for the bottle, the pill, the powder
We are born into this sorrowful deadliness
There will be open and unpunished murder in the streets
It will be guns and roving mobs, land will be useless
Food will become a diminishing return
Nuclear power will be taken over by the many
Explosions will continually shape the earth
Radiated men will eat the flesh of radiated men
The rotting bodies of men and animals stink in the dark wind
And there will be the most beautiful silence never heard
Born out of that, the sun hidden there
Awaiting the next chapter

[Verse 1: DOOM]
DOOM from the realm of El Kulum, smelly gel fume
Separating cell womb to Melle Mel, boom
Revelations in Braille, respiration inhale, view
Nations fail and shaking of a snake tail make due
Blazing swords trace the haze, praise the Lord
Saving Grace, lace your broad, she say she bored
A crazy straw, ink and stale dry paraffin
Candy corn crap rappers pale by comparison
A bad samaritan averaging above average men
Rancid rants having rambling savages scavenging
For scraps, perhaps roadkill, if that
Gift of gab, and he flowed ill, chrome stiff hat
Known for writing lightning tight lines, chiefin'
Beefin', being off deep ends, divine bright shines even
Dimes quiet as mimes by design mighty fine
Slight rewind, tightly bind, blind lead blind
Need mines now that was this is then, listenin'
To sizzlin' officialtons whisperin', "Him again"
Metal Face Finster playing with the dirty money
Sinister, don't know what he saying but the words be funny
Major vet spaded through the vest with a bayonet
Save your breath, gave a F, pay your debt, they forget
Make her sweat bullets, crime pays no benefits
Then it gets wilder with more childisher degenerates

[Interlude]
Three thousand years ago, Moses said:
"Every human being is responsible for his actions
Or thy being is still a beast, not yet human!"

[Verse 2: DOOM]
You ought to let your uncle flow, my motorcycle trunkfuls
From two-one two-one, lose crumbs to chunks in bundles
Hands down, better than what your mans used to get
Standing around from where the translucent looses spit
Missing wheel, you don't listen, you're a feel-head
Sitting in the kitchen pissing, twitching, kissing steel lead
Crime pays no dental nor medical
Unless you catch retirement, county, state or federal
You heard like roaring waters in a seashell
If a tree fell, you couldn't tell from three cell
Be real careful, they tell him by the earful
Kids doing skid bids, acting out is terrible
Word is bond, fix your clothes, put a shirt on
Pants sagging back when you used to meant you had a skirt on
Squirts posing as thuggers and hustlers
El Eloh closer then y'alls ball huggers and jugglers
Motherfuckers!

[Outro]
DOOM is transmitting a message to you
Super fools
I need to use more power

[Verse]
I'm tryna do it all tonight, I got plans
I got a certain lust for life and as it stands
Everything is going as right as it can
They tryna shoot down my flight before it lands, before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me, then crawl back
I really wish y'all would fall back
But gettin' rich s'posed to solve that
And these days, women make offers
And who the hell am I to say (No, no, no)?
My ex sendin' late night texts
'Cause she don't know how to let (Go, go, go)
Uh, she in love
And as for them pretty light-skinned models
Standin' in the cold, ah, yeah, they with us
Let them girls in for a drink and I'm all in they ear
Sayin' she should be the one I see every time that I'm here
But when am I really even here?
Black Suburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old handprints on it
But I'mma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in a Margiela tux, I don't really give a fuck
And we only gettin' older
So what I tend to do is to think of today as the past
It's funny when you comin' in first, but you hope that you last
You just hope that it last

[Outro]
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her, oh-oh
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up

[Intro]
Ayo, dawg, I got some shit on my motherfuckin' chest
That I need to get off 'cause if I don't
I'ma fuckin' explode or somethin'
Now, look, this is the story about
Some little fuckin' girls that I know
It goes like this

[Verse 1]
It's so easy for me to make enemies any more, it's sickening
People are lookin' for an excuse to jump on my shitlist
Stickin' their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
Now I'm in the position that I don't wanna be in shit
I never had no beef with you corny son-of-a-bitches
But now the shit is broke and you can't do nothin' to fix it
So I'm tellin' you right now, motherfuck a Limp Bizkit
Now I'ma be real, B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin, see, he chilled
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'd have never involved my crew if it wasn't for pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpackin' cipherin' name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you were sayin' and
I'da never involved you, but you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit, I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known that song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV, now look who's mentioning me
That little fuckin' weasel, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props in that song, you on national TV
Talkin' 'bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me?
Come on, dawg, you was s'posed to be on that song
Talkin' 'bout how bad you hate him, now you all on his thong?
What's wrong? You scared? And Fred, you said you was dissin' him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin' sissy, up on stage, screamin' how people hate you
They don't hate you, they just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act, and don't call me kissin' my ass
'Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song, I'm tryna to pre-warn you
Lethal, when I fuckin' see you, dog, I'm swingin' on you!
Motherfuckers must think 'cause I'm in trouble with the law
That I won't jaw 'em, up my sentence and double it tomorrow
Y'all some...

[Hook]
Girls (Y'all are some goddamn girls)
Why do you act this way? (Why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fuckin' sissies, you pussies
Keep talkin' shit behind my back, you just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know, hah)
How fuckin' cowards roll (Keep rollin' rollin' rollin'!)
In fuckin' Bentleys and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

[Post-Hook]
Now, I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

[Verse 2]
Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
And I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked
See, I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'd die for me like I'd die for them
I'd fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim
All of 'em been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all of my dawgs, from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Mel-Man, 'til I'm hoist away
In my coffin I'll never soften, no matter how often I'm tested
I'll never give a fuck, I won't never be interested
Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated
This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil
But I will never be this gullible ever again no, nope
Next time I'll know when someone's copyin' off me
I'm not bein' cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin' me
I stick up my middle finger, he sticks up his finger (hey!)
I say, "Fuck Christina!",  he says, "Fuck Christina!", but meaner
So from doin' a song with Method to beggin' to get accepted
I'm peggin' Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal, don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin' you up, punk, you're dead! Don't think that I'm playin'!
And fuck Bizkit! 'Cause I know you're sayin', "Fuck D12!"
Only not to our face, under your breath to yourselves
Little ...

[Hook]
Girls (Motherfuckin' females)
Why do you act this way? (Why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fuckin' sissies, you pussies
Keep talkin' shit behind my back, you just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know the truth)
How fuckin' cowards roll (Keep rollin' rollin' rollin'!)
In fuckin' Bentley's and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

[Post-Hook]
Now, I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

[Outro]
And that's it, that's all there is to it, dawg
If you didn't wanna do the fuckin' song
Don't say you're down with doin' the fuckin' song
And then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin' MTV talkin' about
Everlast can whip my motherfuckin' ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford, dawg
Just say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it
That's all you had to fuckin' say, I wouldn'ta said shit
I woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin' song myself
And not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all
Now, I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckin-you-up-shit when I see you
And I will see you, too
Oh, and by the way, Fred
That wasn't an accident
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards
Haha!

Hey, Barbie, are-are-are are you into black men?
Hey-hey-hey, hey, Barbie!
Hey, I could be your black Ken (Wow!)
Cause once you go black, you never go back
She wear her hair black, with curls in the back
Then she threw that ass back back back
Then I fell to the mat
And after that, everything went black

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Baby, one-two-three, tell 'em get the referee

Hey, Barbie, can I call you Barbara
Hey, Barbie, yeah can I call you tomorrow and today

And after that, everything went black

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Baby, one-two-three, tell 'em get the referee
Cause he can (he can) get the knockout (get the knockout)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Awww, fuck it! Give me that damn bucket
When when I throw this pussy you better not start duckin'
Oh, yo, hit-hit 'em with the blow
Look-look out in the crowd and everybody's yellin' no
Grab him by his locks and give us a good box
Then hit him below the belt I wanna give him good top
Top-top, give him good top
Hit him below the belt I want to give him good top
One-two-three they yellin' one-two-three
I done hit 'em with that motherfuckin' crunk two-piece
Tell 'em, tell 'em to mop out, too late to copout
Give 'em more head than toupees, that's the knockout

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Baby, one-two-three, tell 'em get the referee
Cause he can (he can) get the knockout (get the knockout)
Get the telephone please, it's an emergency
Cause he can (he can) get the knockout (get the knockout)

[Hook: Lil Wayne & T-Pain]
And you if give a fuck that your friends stuck up

And if you wanna fuck, like I wanna fuck
Put your muthafucking hands in the air
I’m on Five-Hour Energy, Nuvo and Hennessy
So what you wanna do little baby

Now all my ladies in the house say hoe
And all my hoes in the house say lady

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I’m so considerate, I never quit a bitch
No matter how many niggas hit, or how many dick she licked
I please that clitoris, I give her a kiss and shit
When other niggas don’t stay long enough, they get the digits and split
If ain't nobody telling you that you are pretty
That's just because you are and they do not want to admit it
Look at all that ass, you ain't got to have titties
At least you part of the itty bitty titty committee really
You goin let em style on you, or you can let em talk
Hop up in this Lamborghini, baby, go on let em walk
Stop hanging round them stupid bitches, you’d be better off
Them hoes dirty birds, Atlanta Hawks
Go on wear them granny draws
Matter of fact go put that dress on, and don't wear any drawls and come sit on Santa Claus
We can take some pictures with the islands in the back drop
We can go to PC, but you’ll still be my laptop

[Hook: Lil Wayne & T-Pain]
And you if give a fuck that your friends stuck up
And she don’t wanna mess up her hair
And if you wanna fuck, like I wanna fuck
Put your muthafucking hands in the air

So what you wanna do little baby

Now all my ladies in the house say hoe
And all my hoes in the house say lady

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Kiss her on the thigh make her pussy hole cry
They say numbers don't lie, lets try a 69
Kiss her on her lips let her pussy hole drip
She can't even walk to the bathroom she gotta skip
Kiss her on her cheek, make her pussy lips speak
Now she pulling on my locks, Kiss, Styles, Sheek
Kiss her on her breasts, east and west
And then I go south and clean up my mess
No stop signs, no red lights
She put on a show, no stage fright
And then I fuck her right, and she say fucking right
She climb on top that mountain and ride that mountain bike
She keep it nice and wet, like Armor All,
She keep a close shave like Barbasol
But all in all she’s just Weezy baby

[Hook x2: Lil Wayne & T-Pain]
And you if give a fuck that your friends stuck up
And she don’t wanna mess up her hair
And if you wanna fuck, like I wanna fuck

That's when I saw a bad bitch ridin right behind me
And I slowed down so she can be beside me

Gas station that's on me
And you know that ain't cheap shawty
You deserve 93 shawty
You deserve me shawty
So tell that other nigga
He can leave like a tree falling
And when it comes to love Baby I'm free falling
Did I leave my eyes In yo pussy cause I see me all in, it
And I put her to bed
And know she sleep walking
And she never answer her phone
Not even if E.T. calling
Man you should see darlin
She like a sea dolphin
Splash splash shout out bird gang
She balling
And I just try to be her
Tol ya somethin
Cop' her 20 hand bags
Out of coach or something
First class flight
Get her out of coach o something

Tell him open his eyes I gotta show him something

But fuck money

Then I'm gone before it's sunny

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's next Friday
I'm on the high way
Ridin to that Sade`
I se a bad bitch up in a Hyundai
I said "baby you supposed to be up in my place"
She started laughin
I got the joke late
Look I just want ta tie u down with this rope braid
Lil mama so cold
I call her Snowflake
I fuck her so good on that coldplay
Now what you kno bout it

It ain't what you know about it's how you go about it
An I go about it like I kno about it

Farther than your fantasy
Maybe one day I can be the father of your family
I can handle all the extremities
She remember me ohww

[Hook]

Oh! 

[guitar solo starts]
Ohhh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Aye!

[Intro]
Uh, look
Good evening
Yeah

[Verse 1]
When I party in New York, take the late night subway
Goin' out Friday to comin' home Monday
From all directions never find me on the one way flavor
The rhyme just the icin' on the cupcake fuck face
My fans notice these other rappers is bogus
I'm supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
And the boy stay, kickin' incredibly dope shit
Make my mama proud 'cause my clothes fit
Travel round the globe bitch, on my Lewis Clark shit
Don't matter where I live, 'cause I can tell you where my heart is
I just stay on my side, fuck where everybody at
Tell the planet, "Peace", 'cause I'm gone I ain't comin' back
Had the whole regular life I can tell you that I'm done with that
Try to build a mil' off a couple stacks
Own my own business, investin' all I got into these fuckin' raps
Willie Parker money, hand it off then it's runnin' back

[Interlude]
Ayo you fuck wit' dat
Uh you gotta fuck wit' dat
You in love wit' dat
Look, uh, Mac Miller

[Verse 2]
Takin' sips from the fountain of youth
If you ain't heard about the kid then you out of the loop
As I'm sittin' back starin' at this world in my eyes
See out the window in my room that I’m hidden inside
I'm just a kid who stays speakin' his thoughts, talkin' his mind
Life a roller coaster but I stay along for the ride
Put my heart up on the page, and the song gonna cry
There’s logic behind the way stayin' caught in a lie, boy
Ain't a shock that I'm a topic of discussion
Muhfuckers want my spot so they probably wish I wasn't
They give a little love like everyone does
In reality, they stoned off that competitive drug
And I don't blame 'em, 'cause those who above me, I'm gunnin' for
Try and make my way to the top, startin' from the floor
And I don't even need to bring a single gun to war
'Cause I be on some shit that they ain't never done before
Takin' over piece by piece, startin' from the core
It's only been a year, I can stick around a hundred more

[Interlude]
Said I could stick around a hundred more
I ain't goin' nowhere
Young and so much time to go
Jerm, you might as well keep this one rollin'
I got like one more verse I haven't spit three verses on a song in a minute
See if I can remember this one
Aight look

[Verse 3]
You can find me in the lab workin' overtime
Smell the weed when you going by, global grind
And I ain't just a local guy
When you feelin' stressed out, have an L
Blow money, keep my lady decked out in Chanel
Live fast when I die better wish me well
Huh, I just hope they servin' beer in hell
Just an everyday story that I'm here to tell
So please, stick around for the epilogue
For anyone who ever blog, probably heard my name
Hip-Hop's underdog, you wanna win the game
I'm sick of hearin' how music change never be the same
And these dudes who think they everything and never pick a lane
Call yourself a vet, but haven't won a single game
Mad, every girl got my name imprinted in her brain
Boy, I'm a beast, match the style in bars
Find me smokin' weed where the wild things are

[Outro]
Yessir
So I mean, I had to take this time
Real quickly, to just go in
I don't know man I feel like you should never stop goin' in on your shit
That's just me
I mean, Q and Treej out there we excited just makin' history
And Jerm of course

[Intro: Eminem & Jazmine Sullivan]
Yeah
Ooh...
This game is like cocaine
I want this more than anything in the world
Haha... So do I... At least I thought I did
Got to have it, yeah I need it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading

[Verse 1: Eminem]
This is a beat with no words at first, it’s a blank painting
Exercising the mind, it’s brain strength training
It starts off something like, "Shady's an insane maniac
Yeah, Slim Shady, that's a zany name, ain't it?"
Now all you need's an image to go with the name, baby
Wifebeaters and white t-shirts, Hanes mainly
It's a long shot, but is it possible? There's a lane, maybe
If not he's gon' have to come and change the whole game, ain't he?
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it, he can see his name up in lights
Women screaming his fucking name, fainting
Shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium
Joe Shmoe made it, he took his Plain Jane lady
And his baby Hailie out the trailer but he ain't trailing anymore
He's ahead of the race while maintaining his innocence
Little does he know his train is derailing
And he's about to be raped by this game anally, now

[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little bit of that c-o-c-a-i-n-e?
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)
I got to have it, yeah I made it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You’re operating on all cylinders, syllables spit like dillingers
Spilling your guts, people are feeling your mic skills
But these haters are ice grilling ya
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
Fake friends will kill for ya, die for ya but you can’t decipher
Why for the life of ya, it wasn’t like this when you were cyphering
Argue with your wife again, she found Vicodin
In your pants last night again, your dispute's public
Nothing is private anymore, oh, and your best friend?
Say bye-bye to him, what kind of apple you take a bite of, Slim?
(But this is what you wanted Marshall, ain't it?) Fuck no!
The way that it turned out was nothin' like the picture that I painted
In my head, sometimes a dream and making it's more fun
Than it's to actually make it, the game stripped me naked
It robbed me of ever having another real relationship
With another girl, this world is a fucking trip
As I slip in another world, proceed, take another hit
Sniff 'til I fucking hurl, tell 'em all to fucking sit
And spin 'til they fucking twirl, middle finger up again
Relapsing back in this game, oh well, fuck it then, now

[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little bit of that c-o-c-a-i-n-e?
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)
I got to have it, yeah I made it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)

[Bridge: Jazmine Sullivan]
You start off bright, just to see your name in lights
Just so you can live the life
You take a bite and lose your sight, they call this (fame)
You think you're good, just cause you got out the hood
Concerned only with getting dough, no longer poor
But lost your soul, they call it (fame)
I hear it callin', my name is callin'
Why you struggling when you could be ballin'?
My head is saying yes but my feet is stallin'
So many walkin' by the end they fallin'
But I got to have it, like Eve and the apple
She had to grab it, I got to take it, I got to make it
That's the plan and I can't forsake it, yee-yeah

[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little bit of that c-o-c-a-i-n-e?
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)
I got to have it, yeah I made it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)

[Outro]
Guess I can't leave it
So I'm ?
Oh well... (Fame, fame)
(Fame)

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, uh, yo
You gotta li—, you gotta follow me
With what I'm doin' right here, mane
Like, when I say this shit is crazy
I don't mean it's crazy like crazy
I just mean crazy like it's fuckin'—
Like it's actually crazy
Know what I mean? Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have
And then I end up fuckin' with someone I shouldn't have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated
With the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait and
Is fate procrastinatin'?
I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause it's…

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
Yeah, and is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard
Aye, tell me, is it stalkin' if I follow her
Like, all the way home without her knowin'?
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
Besides, when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she'll wave at me
Imagine what she'll say to me
This ain't no time to be afraid no more, it's time for bravery
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
Aye, and is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Look, I spot her walkin' in the mall
Okay, it's time to grow some balls if she really gon' be yours
Oh my God, I'm walkin' towards her
My mind's screamin' stop
But my legs keep walkin' forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you comin' for her!
My heartbeat racin', and my hands keep shakin'
Say somethin', you shy motherfucker, she's waitin'!
"What's up, girl? Don't mean to interrupt
But in the city I done met a lot of women, but
You from my dreams
And will you come true?
I know about a show that we can catch
Some R&B and rap, and you should come through."
She said, "Uh, I'd love too
Except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would like that." (Damn, Damn)
Okay, you say you got a man
I mean, I definitely understand
I'm happy for you, really am
I couldn't have been the only fan
In the world of a girl like you
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude
It ain't no biggie
Well, I'm sure that I'm gon' see you 'round the city
Only thing I ask, if shit don't work out for y'all
Then don't forget me
And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene
I came up with a world-class scheme, to get…

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
The girl of my dreams
And is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Or should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
So I find out the nigga name
Know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work
"Hold up, nigga, is you sane?"
I'ma follow in my car; I'ma cut in front of his
Run him right into the wall
Maybe even off the bridge
I give her a little time
Then console her while she cryin'
She gon' take that as a sign
Finally she will be mine
I'll be king, and she'll be queen
When I hit her with the ring
At the wedding, who gon' sing?

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
And is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Think I should try and get some help

[Produced by J. Cole]

[Verse 1]
I woke up early in the morning, hoes blowing up my phone
I ain't used to small talking when they know I'm tryna bone
Fuck 'em, I'll holla later, man, right now, my mind's elsewhere
My mom's healthcare, get her out this hell here
A lot of niggas fail, frail niggas won't prevail here
We seen it all man, niggas can't even spell scared
A Fresh Prince, but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air
Fuck if you would sell, I'm worry bout my welfares
So farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid
Soon as my dough straight, I throw the wifey in some Dolce
And put some chains on my niggas like I own slaves
I get up, look out the window, hope the sun shining
Down on my niggas out there front lining
I hit the streets and see them boys out there locking up some older head
So Goddamn homie, hold your head, and hold your head

[Hook]
I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma, your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though
And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky
I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
Paint a picture to show the deaf what it's like to listen
And speak the words and tell a blind man what he missin'
For all my niggas doin' time man up in prison
Felt you had to resort to crime, man fuck the system
We raisin' babies up in Hades where there ain't no hope
Ain't no fathers, don't take no scholarship to slang no dope
Politicians hollerin' bout problems but I ain't gon' vote
He talk about change, still we floatin' in the same ol' boat
So tell me how I'm supposed to feel when the President spoke
When he ain't never had to struggle, ain't never been broke
Ain't even roll through the ghetto ain't neva been close
Trustin' this government's like trustin' the devil in oath
For rebel with quotes, I get up
Lifestyle of the young, black and reckless
A generation of niggas strapped and askin' questions like:
"Tell me why I ain't got shit?"
I let this liquor fill my liver with them toxics as I sip

[Hook]
I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma, your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though
And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky
I'm on my way

[Verse 3]
Yeah, to all my niggas paper chasin', I pray for your patience
Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cakin'
Takin this shit one step at a time, that real shit is stuck on my mind
But to that bullshit I'm deaf and I'm blind
Destined to shine I'ma find a way, 'cause hey
Damn it, them jobs out there ain't tryna pay, I pray
Granted nine to five is how you survive
I ain't tryna survive, I'm tryna throw my Momma in rides
I'mma provide for my seed I'm the soil
I'll teach 'em bout' loyalty
I'll teach 'em that his skin black like oil that's for royalty
I'll show 'em all the things that my pops was never showin' me
Treat 'em like a growin' tree with this poetry
I get up and show the sons how to lead not to follow
The present is our gift but our seed's got tomorrow
So please niggas raise your kids
And help em' overcome that bull shit they daze us with
I blaze the shit

[Hook]
I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma, your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though
And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky
I'm on my way
I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma, your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though
And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky
I'm on my way

Around with my ass showing all over the fuckin town

[Proof]

Ready to hold it steady....Speakin of hold it steady
You can hold my nuts steady and then

And I'm Slim...I'm also slim and your future's Whim

[Proof]
Ha ha....don't stop

[Eminem]
Speakin of lift off
I'm blastin off...your ass is soft...so I'm startin to jack off
Cuz I'm so horny...and your lyrics are so corny
That they bore me and I woke up too late this morning
Or too early...wait a minute there goes Shirley
The girly I fucked last year when her hair was curly
Couldn't remember it cuz I was Infinite
And I met Ken Kaniff in Connecticut
He said his predicates and pronouns and wanted to throw down
And he said “I like you”...and then he walked up and said “Let me snake bite you”
And I said hell no...kicked him with my shell toe
Gave him a elbow...Ayo Proof ...go

[Proof]
Yo it's the D to the 1 - 2
What you wanna get done to
Your chest plate...eradicate
Get your flesh ate...easily done..Here it is
Freestyle...no need to write shit...cuz when we write shit
Y'all like to buy shit...that why street light up when we write stuff
It's time to be the champions at this...it's D-12
1-2 True crew...Slim Shady and Big Proof
Knockin over igloos in Alaska when we blast ya
A massacre creator, one time for data
Darker than Vader...go anybody hot as the Equator
It's time to get down one time for those that dont know us
Girls wanna blow us like Monica....Lewinsky
Come against me

[Eminem]
Go and see I'm an invincible MC
If you dont believe it then you wanna try to convince me
That you're doper than me...which we'll hope
You would hope to be....but hopefully I will rock globaly
And nationwide...thats why my ass is wide
Thats why your ass just died on the passenger side
Like a fuckin ride...when it got shot up by a drive-by
When I drove by 5 times and gave it five tries
And still missed it
I got a fuckin' mental illness a gentle stillness
Violence...complete silence is what I need in the room while I freestyle
What I need is to do...what is need is smoke weed and brew
And......smoke brew ? You don't smoke brew
If you do I'll choke you and then I guarantee I'll out smoke you
You're crew's a joke too and I can stick my dick in a bitch and poke you

[Proof]
Stick it in there....rock with my cock on sky rock
Knock ya eye out the sock...(sock)
Get..(get) yeah we come to rock....(it)
So don't get in the way cuz we gon drop....(shit)
Now how you feel right now we bust yo..op....(tic)....(tock)
We lunatics with mics and we dont stop we come to rock
The dirty dozen is non-stop
To the top from tree tops to ewoks that pop Reeboks
And men with pre-ops
Yo now there is 3-Pac's
Master P....Thug Life and now it's 2pac
Get back to that one...here goes the rhyme that you dropped

[Eminem]
The rhyme that I dropped is stickin up IHOP
In high tops and walking around like a one-eyed Cyclops
And you can't see me....I only got one eye and I can still see you
You can even give it a dumb try...If you're a dumb guy then come try this
But I rock the microphone with my flyness
So get off my jock..get of my cock..when I sky rock ...it in sky
Rock..shit...bitch

[Proof]
Ayo...a lot of people always try to tell us...that we gonna be better or failures
But me or Slim yo you can't tell me
You try to freestyle son we gon' put these verses on your LP
Slow down with that old stuff....I heard the most of y'all is Mos Def

[Eminem]
My LP...my whole LP...tha last one was screaming help me
You couldn't melt me if you was Vanilla Ice...Yo guess what
My Nuuuuuuuuutz!!
Here I go with the lyrical miracle...spiritual spirital...you dont wanna hear it though
I rickety rock the microphone
Don't do it dont do it cuz that shit is stupid...I knew it
I take a beat and loop it...I take a beat and troop it
What the fuck did that mean...I dont know but I got phat jeans on
And I already said that but I dont know where my head's at
All I wanna do is go back to the hotel and know where my bed's at

[Proof]
Yo wheres the beds at so we can relax and catch Ease
Y'all dont want none of tha dirty Deez
From the 3-1's its for the three of thirds
One third MC yo we smoke y'all like herbs
Under the curb early morn take it to born
Y'all get broke up...put back together ...re-enact it
Some times you see this...you just a faggot
No need to tag it...wit more loot that Jimmy Swagart

[Eminem]
Faggot....uh oh...was that homophobic...?
But no one knows it...and I'm so homophobic
I won't even throw clothes in the closet
Fuck it...I've lost it....I'm holocausted...see my face it's written all
Acrossed it
This beer makes me wanna disappear this year
I'm so high I'm 'bout to die...and I'm so tired I'm 'bout to fry
You're so fired you're down

[Proof]
Hey....it's me...it's the hamster man
Coming all the way from Amsterdam
And I come to tell you all a little secret
So you can ........eat it ....you got to grab your crackers
{mumbling}

[Eminem]
Quit spittin your writ shit bitch I'll kill you and kick you
In your motherfuckin' dick and your clit...you little pussy
Hermaphrodite with no appetite
And you ain't rappin' right but you was taking rapid bites
Of my dick when you was on it...my brain is haunted
I walk up in a place in a T-shirt wit my stains on it
But I dont give a damn...give a fuck...give a shit...give a hell
Give a piss give a dick give a lick

[Proof]
Yea....live and direct it's us
You better back up

[Eminem]
You better back up before I jack off
Back off before I jack off

[Proof]
You better back off before he jack off (laughing)
You better back off before I jack off

[Eminem]
Colder than Jack Frost...smack you across your face
While I'm still jackin off
Sittin' in the closet beatin' my shit
Ain't got nuttin' else to do cuz I'm thinkin' of a bitch
Wait a minute ...oh shit she's here
Look who walked in the door....come in it's Britney Spears!!!!
(Ken Kaniff)
Oh....come here little girl
Come here little girl

[Eminem]
What happened? (I dunno)
We stopped rappin' (Oh it's clappin')
Gun clappin' ...and all I need is one napkin to wipe the cum off
When I come off with the drum off
Whatever the hell that meant...but I can still speak wit' a accent
A French accent
Excuse my French but
Suck my dick touche le le poo...uhh....bitch

[Proof]
Bonjour...I'm here with the cure...Oh yea lets rock it for the drawer
Hey Em...how you doin this is me...The Em jock...get off my
Damn cock

[Eminem]
Yo while you're spraying verbs...you ain't even fuckin' saying words
(THuuuG) Pronounce your words right...and you can ride around curbs
And bounce your herbs tight
What the fuck ? (Yo somethin' is in the beat that keeps talkin')
Yo put another beat on before you get peed on

[Proof]
Yo are we done or what? They want us to freestyle for 45 min—

[Eminem]
Hi...Hi.... My name is ...my name is...my name is
Slim Shady...Slim Shady...Bitch you're little just like that Kim lady
And I'm in sky rock radio...the shadiest bro on the radio
But you dont hear me though
Once upon a time in the apartments, aye
I damn near had to smoke a J
He knocked on the door, what's haapnin'
Its Jimmy Jam trying to score a little packet frame?

I said the work that we was cooking wasn't dry yet
But he could have the residue from the Pyrex
He say, he had some niggas with him worth a hundred plus
But the niggas up the street was servin' touch and bust

I told him "Wait a minute it was all good"
That when I seen a nigga hoppin' out the Fleetwood
With gold teeth talking about he want a whole ki'
Right then I'm thinking: "do this motherfucker know me?"

He was with a nigga who wouldn't even buy an oz
That's when I said he's either robbing or the police
Either way I slammed the door in his face
Started gathering and collecting all the blow in the place

Went and got the dough out of the safe and .44 and a K
Whatever he is trying I ain't tripping cause we know where he stays
About 150 grand, three birds in a knapsack
Stashed it in my neighbor's trash then I ran back
I had to keep the tool just in case though
If these niggas make a move you already know
With the Desert Eagle in my waistband
I slung the front door open and hollered "Jimmy Jam!

"What's up with that nigga that you roll with?
In the fake chains and the flea market outfit."
He said "Now Tip you know I wouldn't try you."
I said "Cause if you do he gets killed and you die, too."

He said "He ain't like that he used to sell weight
Started smoking he embarrassed now he's trying to save face"
The conversation was interrupted again
When this country nigga pulled 'bout twenty bands out of his pants

He said "I'm in the right place, this enough, ain't it?"
I said "Hell yeah, if you trying to donate it
Shit that get you locked up, I don't sell blow."
Then he said "I heard you had it?"
I said "Yeah, so?"

I guess that nigga Boogie from a couple doors down saw his money
Run up said "I got it for the low now."
I'm thinking: "Boogie stupid he don't even know brah
He just always wants to take a nigga's customa."
This one he could have
I said "I guess that's your man, then."
I was smoking laughing at his ass
When they ran in

They said Boogie had a quarter mil, over twenty bricks
Shit all I know is I ain't seen that nigga since
Keep yo' head on the swivel for the nonsense
Everyday is something when you're trapping in apartments

[Hook]
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gz
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Freeze, at ease, now let me drop some more of them keys
It's 1-9-9-tre so let me just play
It's Snoop Dogg, I'm on the mic, I'm back with Dr. Dre
But this time I'mma hit yo' ass with a touch
To leave motherfuckers in a daze, fucked up
So sit back relax new jacks get smacked
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg I'm at the top of the stack
I don't lack for a second, and I'm still checkin'
The dopest motherfucker that ya hearin' on the record
It's me, ya see, S-N-double-O-P
D-O-double-G-Y, the D-O-double-G
I'm fly as a falcon, soarin' through the sky
And I'm high till I dizzie, rizzide
So check it, I get busy, I make your head dizzy
I blow up your mouth like I was Dizzy Gillespie
I'm crazy, you can't phase me
I'm the S oh yes, I'm fresh, I don't fuck with the stress

Every single day, chillin' with the D-O-double-G's

You fuck with us, we gots to fuck you up

Ya wanna get real, now it's time to peel, ya say chill
And feel, the motherfuckin' realism
Snoop Doggy Dogg is on the mic I'm hittin' hard as steel nigga

[Hook]
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas

This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas
This is for the hustlas now back to the Gz

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
How many hoes in your motherfuckin group
Wanna take a ride in my 7-8 Coupe, DeVille
Chill, as I take you on a trip
Where them niggas ride, and slide, you know about the East Side
Niggas like myself, here to show you where it's at
With my hoes on my side, and my strap on my back
Papers I stack daily, and Death Row is still the label that pays me
But you know how that goes
We flow toe for toe, if you ain't on the Row
Fuck you and your ho, really doe, so check it
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip
Still clockin' grip, and don't really give a shiiit
About nuttin' at all, just my Doggs, steppin' through the fog
And I'm still gonna fade em all
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin'
How many hoes in ninety-four will I be bangin'?
Every single one, to get the job done
As I dip, skip, flip, right back to two one
Where the sun be shinin' and I be rhymin'
It's me, Snoop D-O-double-G, and I'm climbin'

[Hook]
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gz
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas
This is for the hustlas now back to the Gz

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I come creepin' through the fog with my saggin' deuce
East Side, Long Beach, in a 7-8 Coupe DeVille
I'm rollin' with the G Funk, bumpin' in my shit and it don't quit
So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set
A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfuckin' dick
And the Compton niggas all about to set trip
Swing it back, bring it back, just like this
And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff
And keep the motherfuckin' blunt in your pocket, loc
'Cause Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke
See it's a West coast thing, where I'm from
And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some
But watch the gun by my side
Because it represents me and the motherfuckin' East Side
So bow down to the bow wow, 'cause bow wow
Yippie yo, you can't see my flow
My shit is dope, original, now you know
And can't no hood fuck with Death Rizzow

[Hook]
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gz
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas
This is for the hustlas now back to the Gz--

[Intro: Jae Millz, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
Dedication 3, Young Money, nigga (Barack O-Drama!)
Dedication 3, Young Money, nigga (Gangsta Grillz, you bastards!)
Dedication 3, Young Money, nigga
Jae Millz (Gangsta! AMG!)
Gangsta Grillz, you bastards!
We just shining on you niggas all crazy!
Hahaha! (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!) Let's go!

[Verse 1: Jae Millz]
I'm the real, I'm the authentic, the fact and the truth
It's Jae Millz, brown skin, but I black in the booth
And for the green or that white, you'll see red
Mushroom bullets hit your body, and they spread
Then your ass dead, no need for a hospital room or a bed
Just tell his mama, "Get him some nice threads"
So at least he'll be a bitch-ass nigga dying in style
He didn't want to look up to me, now he gotta look down
Somebody better tell 'em: On these beats, I'm a beast
Half-man, half-animal like King on "Tekken"
I'll wreck him, and yeah, Young Money is what I'm reppin'
Respect 'em or I'll put you on that highway to Heaven
Matter of fact, pussy, you'll get your own lane
With no speed limits, so you can get there in a minute, ha
It's Dedication 3, it's no replacing we
That's like asking a group of Muslims, "Where that bacon be?"
Straight Grand Patrón flow, it's no chasin' me
And that amnesia is what my medication be
That's that Amsterdam grade-A, I'm smoking in the Netherlands
So high that I'll probably fucking never land, bitch!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
Motherfucking psychopaths
Young Money cavemen, motherfuck a Geico ad (Ill!)
Four-four, bulldog, fuck around and bite your ass
Shitting on you bitches, now let me flush the toilet and wipe my ass (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Bitch, I'm balling, I like my cash—no, I'm lying, I love my dough
Got them hoes fallin' like a hundred million dominoes
But I don't eat pizza, I eat pussy
When he wouldn't
Holla at your guala, yeah, bitch, it's me
Kicking motherfuckers out the kitchen heat
I'll put you where the fishies sleep
And when they wake, you'll be the fishies' feast (Gangsta!)
Haha! Yeah, I'm a shark, you see my fin, ho?
Bullet leave a hole in your face, not a dimple
Straight from the N.O., it's no problemo
To put a nigga brains on the motherfucking window
Ugh! Damn right, I'm nasty
How I come through in that wide-eyed Aston
The leather guts, and might I add in:
It's black-on-chrome like Darren McFadden
Yeah, and don't be comparing my swag
With these wack-ass niggas that's oh-so-swagless
Yeah, and call me Mr. Swagmore
Got your girlfriend open like some fucking pores
Or open like some fucking doors
Nigga, it's, "Fuck you, and I'm fucking yours"
From the bedroom to the floors
Whores, haha!

And I ain't gotta sell 'em

Ottoman couch, how handsome your furniture
Lovelier now, but dressed for funeral
Begging you to sit for a portrait on the wall
To hang in the dark of some parliamentary hall

[Verse: Kid Cudi]
Huh, stay home a lot, no TV (yeah)
Just thoughts, and a heap of good weed (yeah)
Same jeans, same old Converse
Bape tees and the Walees, so works
I'm cool, some niggas mad at it
Lookin' in from the outside, fantastic
Can't keep the negative alive
They be on my dick, if Kid Cudi die
Don't cry hater, I forgive (yeah)
Now go and get my album and get off my dick (yeah)
I smile and I’m pleasant, the weed is the essence
But if I’m in the club, we gon’ tear this shit up
I’m talkin' 'bout shots, ridiculous amounts (uh)
Cause if you’re gonna rage, should be all about (aye)
Take, take another shot or you’re soft
Dream On campaign I’m the mother lovin' boss (yeah)
Haters suck my balls, two time (hehe)
I never say goodbye 'cause I’m on mine
All my life, wanna do some' major
Now every little thing I do might make it in the paper (man)
Cudi found y’all nigga, po-po (whatever)
Mad drunk in the street, no photo (I rage)
Hatin' motherfuckas, don't know yo

Wanna get up in my mind
Wanna know about me and Amanda Bynes (Amanda please)
Wanna know really, really, really who I’m datin'
Is she civilian or super duper famous? (hmmm)
Is she African American, Caucasian, or Asian? (so many)
Or maybe Spanish (yeah)
It don’t matter my nigga, I love them all
As long as she don’t need stupid amounts of makeup
To makeup the self esteem (I know)
Selfish dreams can reflect the blessing
I am tap dancing on a cloud (I am)
Successful raps, I might scream out loud (mhm)
Puttin' it down, for all I met (yeah)
Talking fans, I won't quit (yeah)
I’m puttin' it down, for all I met (yeah)
Talking fans, I won't quit (yeah)

Goodbye

Right about now I'd like to dedicate this song
Out to my main homey, Mike D
A'ight, let's kick it
Ready... go

Get on the mic, get-get on the mic
Just get on the mic, get on the mic, Mike!
Let's be real, and don't cloud the issue
The rhymes are rope, an emcee you must listen to
People say that they been missin' me and missin' you
Get on the mic, and let's show them like we used to
Well, you say fuck that, yo, Holmes, fuck this
I'm the King AdWhammy and you're Dick Butkus
One half science and another half soul
Nicknamed Mike D, not Fat Morton Jelly Roll
Got busy in 'Frisco, fooled around in Fresno
Got over on your girlie 'cause you know she never says no

So just get on the mic, just get on the mic
Just get on the mic, get on the mic, Mike!
Well, Mike D is a special individual
Pullin' out knots and pullin' in residuals
Go to the movies, get the Rolos
The cholos ridin' slow and low
Mike on the mic and bust with the solo
Mike, my stromy, don't be so selfish
Get on the mic cause you know you eat shellfish

{At the fever}

[Hook]
It feels like I'm running on walls and I don't want to touch the ground
If they say that I'm lost, then I don't want to be found
It feels like I'm running on walls and I don't want to touch the ground
If they say that I'm lost, then I don't want to be found
I'm on the mirrors edge

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Stuck in the dream but I can't wake up
Sitting in a bank but I can't cake up
Don't want my girl but I can't break up
‘Cause my every day life, I don't want to shake up
Feel the earth wake up, won’t stay still
Haters all around but I won't stay trill
All up in my face trying to show their skill
Say they don't love it but I know they will
Before the show is over and the lights go out
After I wreck on the mic, show out
Married to the mob so wives throw out
Game all over that's right, blow out
What you know 'bout getting raise? We'd done thought of life 15 ways
So blaze up the endo
While I'm sitting on the ceiling with my J's on the window

[Hook]

[Verse 2: GLC]
Escalade get paid, nigga had to learn from mistakes I made
Dad couldn't teach me, he was laying in the grave
I did a little dirt, hope God forgave
Now tell mama I'm on my way, tell me where she be her best
Got me out the hood, I recess, I smoke a lil weed to relieve my stress
Stacking 'em, making out to perfect, I got a new Cady out of my first bitch
Persist lil purple, seven in the alley, I took that risk
Running in a circle, running out of town
South side nigga just wanna flip me, rich motherfucker, that’s all that is
I survived that, now I feel like this

[Hook]

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
Looking out the window at another city's lights
Trying to make it home on another lonely flight
Because I'm running-running trying to find my way
But there's nothing-nothing-nothing I can say to find you on these days

[Verse 3: XV]
Mirrors on my walls in my new apartment
I never touch the floor, I'm like Aladdin's carpet
I'm feeling like a star but I'm remaining car less
‘Cause I can run on walls like I am Lucy Lawless
They be saying I'm the next and I'm just hoping that is true
I took my number, got in line, just hoping I ain't number two
So you ask how I feel, I'm flyin', you ask about the deal in time
‘Cause the boy from Kansas ran on the ground long enough now

[Hook 2]
It feels like I'm running on walls and I don't want to touch the ground
If they say that I'm lost, then I don't want to be found
It feels like I'm running on walls and I don't want to touch to the ground
If they say that I'm lost, then I don't want to be found
I'm on the mirror’s edge, I’m on the mirror’s edge
I'm on the mirror’s edge, I'm on the mirror’s edge

[Intro: Akon & Eminem]
Shady
Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, could she be that lady? Ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?

[Chorus: Akon]
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Akon]
Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like "You're—"
I'm like, "I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place"
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow (My shadow)
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo? (Like Tae Bo?)
And possibly bend you over? (Ooh, yeah)

[Chorus: Akon]
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more (Yeah)
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Akon]
Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D (D)
Hittin' no less than three (Three)
Block wheel style like whee (Whee)
Girl, I can tell you want me, 'cause lately

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow (Yeah, my shadow)
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo? (Like Tae Bo?)
And possibly bend you over? (Ooh, yeah)

[Chorus: Akon]
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

La, la, la, la
8732, that's the way it go
Wait 'til I get my money right
Kanye and Jizzle, say it ain't so

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
If I had a billion dollars (Yeah!)
Yeah, I'd spend all in a day, show these niggas how to play (Play)
Top floor penthouse, I'll show them where I stay (Stay)
Grand piano, might learn to play (Haha!)
Paid a hundred grand just to walk past it every day (Woo! Woo!)
You know I like them white keys on it (Yeah!)
Duct tape when we wrap them, call me prejudice
Cause I never touch the black ones (Keys that is, haha!)
Let me show how to do this, shawty (Shawty!)
I hit the strip club and I blew bout forty (Damn!)
Patron got me so confused ('Fused)
Until I stumbled outside and I made the news
Fresh nine piece, yeah, them wings is Cajun
Never seen me in the kitchen, nigga, I am amazing (Nah)
Well, fuck it, I'm rich then
If balling is a crime, fuck it, I'm hit then
If thugging is a term, fuck it, I'm it then
The insane dough, hey, fuck it, I'm sick then
Somebody call me a shrink
Until then, I'mma fix me a drink (Haha!)
Top down in the Bent, I'm so intoxicated
Sometimes I think to myself "Goddamn, I made it"
And I know they hate it
On the all night flight
Trying to get my money right, wassup?

[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
La, la, la, la (Hey!)
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la, la (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (Haha!)
You can't tell me nothing
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
Yeah, homie, this a theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always prayed to have gleam on
$300 jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Learjet
Fly as the insect, even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number 'cause
When I get my money right she gon' come running
And I'll be good like "God" with an extra "o"
God knows that my check needs some extra 0's
And you know that you need to bring some extra hoes
Not in jogging pants either, tell them wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional
And my chain so fresh, they go (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Right after the fame did you gain anything?
Damn 'Ye, would you change anything?
But (If I had a billion dollars, yeah!)
I'd copped more pink polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname Sorrow
My Benz need company, her nickname Tahoe
“Wait 'til I get my money” everybody's motto
So I'mma need a bravo for everything that I wrote
Yeah, hey, mama they can't hate him
'Cause after all of the drama, K slayed them

[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
La, la, la, la (Hey!)
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la, la (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (Haha!)
You can't tell me nothing
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Outro: Kanye West, Young Jeezy, & Connie Mitchell]
(If I had a billion dollars, yeah!)
Wait 'til I get my money right
(If I had a billion dollars, yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
(I'm serious, nigga! Hey!)
Why were you late?
(Yeah! Haha! Yeah! You know I'm serious, nigga! I got money!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Good money made!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Good money made!
Why were you late?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Good money made!

[Verse 1]
He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin' home to a place he’d never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

[Verse 2]
When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hangin’ by a song
But the string’s already broken and he doesn’t really care
It keeps changin' fast and it don’t last for long

[Chorus]
But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullaby
Rocky Mountain high (Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)

[Verse 3]
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept the memory

[Verse 4]
Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

[Chorus]
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)

[Verse 5]
Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

[Chorus]
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Though he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky Mountain high

[Outro]
The Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and everybody's high...
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)

[Intro]
(Jahlil Beats, holla at me)
Yeah, leggo
It's what they wanted right?

[Verse]
Black shades, dark tint
Your girl, nigga, I get it in
Stick shiftin', switchin' and burnin' out in the Benz
Wood grippin', kissin' all of they model friends
Mr. Dolo (Dolo), with a bunch of freaks
And you know they get the party bouncin' like a pogo
I'm in slow-mo
But fast forward me to the part where me and your girl underneath the sheets
Just keep your eyes on
Got a whole bunch of niggas behind me wearin' red, Verizon
New money, I get my supersize on
I like a long hair, bad chick, thighs long
Haha, knowin' all the words to my songs
And she fuckin' every girl that's in my phone
Haha, I'm-I'm-I'm so fly
Flight miles up 'cause I'm so high
Huh, lil' nigga get your cheese up
Black Ice on my neck, make you freeze up
Oh, you worried 'bout me? Go figure
I ain't sweatin' it, fuck them old niggas
Lambo', Range Rove', with my pants low
I got the audience clappin' like a backboard
She put her hands up and then I stand up
And get to workin' on the pole like a dancer
I double up, I call it double Dutch
Two girls at the same time, what the fuck?
Rabbit foot in the air 'cause my luck is up
Bring the first aid out 'cause I'm cuttin' up
Bang, bang, now that's some G shit
No chain gang, like I'm really on some free shit
They jaw dropped, I'm leavin' niggas speechless
World premiere, get a sneak peek, bitch
I'm great, today is a new day
Fuckin' with me, do the moonwalk on your face
No games, I'm oh, so serious
And y'all niggas straight pussy, period
They say a singer can't rap, I ain't hearin' it
'Cause after these couple songs. I been killin' shit
Oh, no, niggas sayin' I'm loco
But they Pinocchio niggas, watch they nose grow
It's Young Money, shoutout my nigga Tyga too
They on their first mixtape, I'm on volume two
Turn me up, I'll show you what a tiger do
And I'ma rip this beat up like lion food
Louis luggage and the case for the passport
I don't buy shit, nigga. I ask for it
I'm the freshest, I'm the best
I suggest that I get it off my motherfuckin' chest, Breezy
He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost
He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost
She's slipping through his fingers, and she's moving out to the coast
He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost

Well, if your world was all black, and then your world was all white
Well, then you wouldn't get much color out of life now, right?
I'm nicknamed Shamrock, well, my name is not Shamus
Girlies on the tippy 'cause my homey is famous
My name is not O'Houlihee, nor is it Brian
If I said that I was weak, man, you know I'd be lyin'
Well, suckers try to bite, yeah, then try to pursue it

Ya explain to a musician…
Them knew it, but them can't do it

[Verse]
I'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while I'm sleeping
I keep dreaming of death and I'm hearing people screaming
The devil's spirit's trapped inside me and I want it out
I'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
With both of my wrists slit, I'm lifted up in the air
And suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
I feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
While I choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death
But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
Nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
Tripping over OD'd bodies of dead lushes
Bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
Door's open and close by themselves
Books fly off shelves, curtains catch fire, the house melts
My skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adam's apple
Two cups of holy water and I'm looking at 'em half full
But as soon as I go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
It got silent, then all these voices said
"Come follow me into the gates of Hell"
I heard 'em yell "Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel!"
I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother
Covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel
I said I need a room so I could try to get some rest
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
And told me that's just for starters, Satan'll be in to see me later
To see if I'm interested in being partners

[Intro]
Somethin' new
Geah, uh
Believe me like you saw me on TV
My name is Lu, somethin' new
I show you what it does (what it does)
How it is (how it is)
And what it do (what it, do)

[Verse 1]
I saw it on TV, I was told to buy a CD
The CD told me buy a TV
The TV that I bought came with a CD that said go and buy the DVD
The DVD that I bought came with a CD
Which was the DVD of the makin' of the TV, that I saw
Which told me to go and buy the CD in the first place, wait nah
I put the DVD in the TV so you can see what I saw
But wait, it's a CD so you can't see me, odd
Maybe I should just come out on DVD like CB, far
With mad special effects and maybe a CG, car
To ride around in on your TV
Bumpin' the CD that I got when I copped the TV
Which is the same TV in my car

[Hook]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
It’s somethin' new
What up homeboys my name is Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu
I show you what it is, what it did and it what it do

[Verse 2]
My DVD is gonna come with a CD, too
And music I recorded through a CB
You see when I bought the TV I spent the money for the microphone and
The home recorders too
And the foam that you need for your crew (crew)
That blocks out the noise when your voice's recording you (you)
Tell 'em to be quiet 'til the voice recording through (through)
Garage band file then export to iTunes
Then burn a CD and put it in the CG car that you saw on your TV
But you ain't gotta do that at all you see
Cuz the whole CD is being broadcasted on CB, dog
Break up break up, eh hee haw
They can't do what they see me do
But I'm the dude that's easy/Eazy too
Like I'm Eazy Juniorrrrrr
When the CD starts, better tune in
Or you gotta watch the reruns
Homie this is food for thought
Better put it on your fork like GD Hooverrrrrrrr-ah

[Hook]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
It’s somethin' new
What up homeboys my name is Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu
I show you what it is, what it did and it what it do (do, do, do, do, do)
What up homegirls my name is Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu
I show you what it is, what it did and it what it do (do, do, do, do, do)

[Verse 3]
Now that's two TV's that's in my car
That’s not really real man that's really a fraud
It’s from the green screen
My CD might not pump on your block
But at the truck stop man I'm really a star
So how you gonna act now?
Same music homeboys hollin' in the background (yo!)
See I had to lay the smack down
Act like a X addict
Act now gateway off to the next habitat (habitat)
Couldn’t match it now I'm laying that down like a mat now (ooh!)
And checkin’ for me, now they pat down like a Howard Gap found
I was hidin' in my shoes, with me and my two crews
We took from other things you ain't finding in the stew
That’s why's no booth and I'm rhymin' in the Lou, still buying the CD
That’s why I catch 'em rhymin' in to me while they rhymin' in they room
Now I'm off to Caloon for some rhymin' and some tea
My pinky up on my tea cup
If you play the DVD at the same time that you start the CD
You gon' see that they sync up
And if you happen to doubt, just play the CD while you watch the TV
And you gon' see that I'm doing what I'm rappin' about

[Hook]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
It’s somethin' new
What up homeboys my name is Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu
I show you what it is, what it did and it what it do (do, do, do, do, do)
What up homegirls my name is Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu
I show you what it is, what it did and it what it do (do, do, do, do, do)

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Vette pass by, everybody looking
Six stoves in the house and everybody cooking
Wrist like, "Blaow," chain like, "Ow"
We throw it in the air to watch it come down
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
This house is stupid perp, they cost me half a rack
AK half a stack, so we ain't gon hit back
I'm at the gambling house, I won 'bout eighty bands
And went to Magic City and did the rain dance
I'm the cave man, stupid band man
Rubber band man, I'm Extra Gram Sam
A stupid fruity sack, a stupid fruity pack
Crazy Gucci shoes, where you get 'em at?
I said it's all white, 'bout a fifty pack
The hottest nigga in the nation ain't dropped yet
Where them pots at? Where them Glocks at?
I kick the door in, where them plots at?

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Vette pass by, everybody looking
Six stoves in the house and everybody cooking
Wrist like, "Blaow," chain like, "Ow"
We throw it in the air to watch it come down
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Cartoon chain, Papa Smurf ring
All red wings, So Icey airplane
Gucci Mane hat, Gucci Mane shirt
Louis V shoes, Louis V purp
We ain't the Big Tymers, but bitch, we got work
We get our roll on in new school verts
Old school's cool, but most of ours new
Gesundheit, bitch, we got the bird flu
But we'll bless you, so say, "Achoo"
We'll turn them house shoes into some Prada shoes
On the east side, we play by Gucci rules
He's only in the hood when he's commissioned to

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Vette pass by, everybody looking
Six stoves in the house and everybody cooking
Wrist like, "Blaow," chain like, "Ow"
We throw it in the air to watch it come down
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
The bird flu got me, the Jacob watch Rocky
Balboa'd the diamond now, I'm So Icey
Young Juiceman, goddammit, I'm the shit
Boomin' off the chain, workin' with fifty bricks
Now-a-later cars, crew blue chains
32 karat posted on my pinky ring
Been a hundred charger, sneaker color dump
Super bad bitch, ayy, pocket with the mumps, ayy
Common cold nigga, ayy, this ain't what you want, ayy
'72 donk, ayy, with no skirt
Whoa, six stoves cookin', mean we got work
Young Juiceman, cuz, smokin' nine pounds of purp

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Vette pass by, everybody looking
Six stoves in the house and everybody cooking
Wrist like, "Blaow," chain like, "Ow"
We throw it in the air to watch it come down
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu
I went to a Catholic school for four years, and I also went on  GarageBand, uh, for 20 minutes, and this is the product of that. Hit it

All the seats at the Sunday masses
Filled with the masses' massive asses
Classes pass as fast as molasses
Ceremonial reading glasses

Read a little bit of Leviticus
All the kids are a little too little for this
All the parents nod in agreement
"I think I can vaguely see what He meant."

It's too early in the morning, glory
To read another allegory story
The father reads a little bit farther
Assuring the assured that they need not bother

"When God, in verse 45
Said that slaves are okay to buy
He meant that people all from the start
Each have 'slaves' within their hearts:
Things that we have sold or boughten
That are forced to pick our moral cotton
God calls us to set these free
Free our hearts from slavery
And then as God goes on to explain
The logistics of buying and selling slaves
Uh...he...the bible's sorta like...uhhh...there's like...typos...didn't-"
In the back, I sit and I nod
To the beats that are bumping from my iPod
My God, they're starting to pray
And over the music I can hear them say
"Dear God, dear Lord, dear vague muscular man with a beard or a sword
Dear good, all-seeing being
'My way or the highway' Yahweh
The blue-balled anti-masturbator
The great all-loving faggot-hater
I'd like to thank your holy might
For making me both rich and white
And though this is your day of rest
I come to you with one request:
There's so much pain beyond this steeple
Wars and drugs and homeless people
Sadness where there should be joy
Hate and rape and Soulja Boy
A world in darkness needs your light
So I'm sure your schedule's pretty tight
But my dog just had surgery
If you could fix that first?
JESUS!"

Debra Messing's finger's in a holy place
Hail Mary full of Grace
Obama, could you pass some hope to the Pope?
I know a couple dudes who wanna elope
See the church said nope so the bros can't cope
The bros can grope but the bros can't cope
They've been in love and they've been addicted
Who said they shouldn't? Benedict did
'Cause in the holy land of the Lord
He's the holy landlord
And dicks are evicted
'Cause you can be a Benedict
If you've been a dick under Benedict
But you can't have Benedicts
Because there's only one pope
With only one dick, what?
What? Yeah, a dick on a pope is
Just like a soap on a rope
'Cause it's pointless, unless in prison
Throw up your bibles, Christ has risen

Hallelujah, now it's raining men
Because the gender ratio is 1 to 10
Winos at the Eucharist station, trans-gendered-substantiation
Jesus wasn't the Messiah
Get back, I'm a heretic and I'm on fire
It was Oedipus, those holy nights
The holy motherfucking Christ
I'm a blasphemah
Post-Katrina, cruising the marina
On a crusade to cruise aids
And blast FEMA
You're too late, we're fucked, we don't need ya
Amen, in the name of the father, son and holy ghost
Head, shoulders, knees and toes
Turn up your nose, strike that pose
Hey macarena

[B.o.B - Verse 1]
Well this is the mysterious case of Dr. Aden
Looking after her patients was her only obligation but
That was back before, back before the situation
Before she got a visit from an agent
He introduced himself as an employee of the nation
He asked would she be willing to offer cooperation
You fit the job description and all the qualifications
If interested I need your signature on this paper (sign here)
She signed the dotted line without the slightest hesitation
She then received a letter stating the rules and regulations
And the military bases where she must be relocated
She is not to discuss any business thats work related

[News Clips - Talking]

[B.o.B - Verse 2]
In Central America on a classified location
Before border control before a illegal immigration
Inside a lab where chemicals are manipulated
Is where we see Dr. Aden, she’s very concentrated
But her concentrations broken
When she hears a conversation down the halls
Small talk about destabilization and
Outta curiosity she wanders from her station
Inside a unlocked office she did some investigation
She breaks into a file with top secret information
Probably some of the most disturbing documentation
She ever saw in her life - the article simply stated
Her study being conducted on human civilization

[News Clips - Talking]

[B.o.B - Verse 3]
Deep down inside she wished it was all her imagination
She couldn’t doubt it, cause there it clearly stated
She works in a facility where viruses are created
And not only that, but ‘member when she had her patients
She wrote out prescriptions for what she thought was medication
Her office was really just a part of the operation
She wipes her eyes as they water full of frustration
How a victim of government experimentation
Where's the justification, where's the justification
Where's the judge when you need him
He's probably on a vacation
Probably inside of the same country that these events takes place in
But as the puzzle pieces fall into proper arrangement
Yes we began to see the intentions of these creations
The patterns of epidemics like H.I.V. in the 80′s
Biological chemicals designed to be contagious
There’s nothing in the business of controlling a population

[Intro]
Uh, a lil' better
Yep, lil' Skateboard P, haha
Yessir (hot), yessir (hot), yessir (hot), yessir

[Verse 1]
Ma, the way you huggin' on me, it's a problem
The fuck you tryna end up in the gossip column?
I know I got jewels like I'm the pharoah of the ghetto
But we are and it's a bright-ass shiny Carerra
Stickin' your feet out the window so they can see your stillettos
Cost a thousand dollars, same as your housing holla
Not to mention the wrist and the thirty thousand collar
Pussy must be good, he's victim to your power
Shit, nigga like me? I would never allow it
Spit that shit to me, I would ask you, "Have you showered?"
You wanna get up in my boat and ride
Take pictures with the kid up in Ocean Drive
Go to Casa Tua and just sip on Calouas
At the bar, talkin' to other women about the best jewelers
You like that, huh? Smilin' still, call your girlfriend (Why?)
You fell asleep at the wheel

[Chorus]
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
And don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit
Tryna ask me shit, c'mon

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I walk in brashest, certainly the crassest
The restaurant's classes, the owner is asses
Shit, my money green like the helmet of a fascist
So what you want – Patron or Petrucia glasses?
Ain't no mystery, his daughter know the history
And every night we toast like it's victory, get with me
And I ain't changed since my early mental
I been snackin' on shrimp and sippin' on Shirley Temples
No drug to drinkin' – what you want?
No, seriously, what you thinkin'? Since the Yukon
Never puffed a J, you can ask Loushawn
Back when he pushed beige like it was coupons
With a house full of dames like it was Moulin
I would ask they names, but they would only do Sean
And I ain't sayin they regret it, but fuck it, they do
'Cause if they could reverse time, nigga
What would they do, huh?

[Chorus]
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
And don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit
Tryna ask me shit, c'mon

[Verse 3]
Honeys Panamanian, eyes like Iranian
Lighter than the blue of the sky of the day we in
Ass like a volleyball, the kind that make your dick hard
Head to the hustlers, so sweet she could get cars
Now she here with me, lil' Skateboard P
Cheaper than the sound of a bird that chirps
I spit, then I hit, then I murk, yessir
A flick chico stick and a Twix, that's her
She admire how the champion live
How I signed Slim Thug with a ramp in my crib
I'm a champion, I do as the champions did
Except I improve with the new and the rest get rid
But some of y'all don't like that, it's easy tryna bite back
Instead of sayin' hi, gettin' fly, but I'll be right back
My dude got the steel if you think you fly
Shoot the wings off your ego and watch you skydive, yessir

[Chorus]
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
And don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit
Tryna ask me shit, c'mon

[Verse 1]
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me

[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says "There's no turning back"
She trapped me in her heart

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star"

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

[Interlude]
Diana
Diana
Dirty Diana
It's Diana, -iana, -iana
C'mon!

[Verse 3]
She said "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright"

[Pre-Chorus]
Diana walked up to me
She said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that, I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright"
I said "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key"
She said "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me"

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

[Outro]
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana) (Ah, don't you touch me)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no) (Ah, don't you touch me)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me?
Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinely care?
Doody, most of my life, it's just been me and you there
And I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to, but I do
Yeah, I say it now when you can't hear me
What the fuck good does that do me now?
But somehow, I know you're near me in presence
Oh, I went and dropped some presents off for Easter
To them two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their
Minds a little, and dog, you'll never believe this
But Sharonda actually talks to me now—Jesus!
And everyone else is just tryin' to pick up the pieces
Man, how could you touch so many fuckin' lives and just leave us?
They say grievance has a way of affectin' everyone different
If it's true, how the fuck I'm s'posed to get over you?
Difficult as it sounds

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
Doody, I drop a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missin' DeShaun
Holton, it was written, it was woven
For a soldier to leave so suddenly, got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around, leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're sayin', "Keep goin'!
Be a man! No emotion! It's your duty!"
Until we meet again, Doody

[Verse 2: Eminem]
"Doody," that's what we'd call each other
I don't know where it came from
But it just stuck with us, we was always brothers
Never thought about each other's skin colors
'Til one day we was walkin' up the block in the summer
It was like ninety degrees, I was catchin' a sunburn
Tryin' to walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
I'm moanin', I just wanna get home and
I look over and your shirt is off
I'm like, "You're gonna fry," you're like, "No, I won't
I'm black, stupid! And black people they got melatonin
In their skin—we don't burn," meanwhile my face is glowin'
And I feel like I'm on fire
And the entire time you're just laughin' at me
And snappin' at me with your shirt, bastard
And I still have to get you back for that shit
And by the way, them Playboy rings my mother stole from you
Well, Nate finally got 'em back, shit
It must've been at least 16 years ago
Well, I put 'em in your cask—oww
Movin' past it, it still ain't registered yet
But you can bet, your legacy they'll never forget
The Motor City, Motown, hip hop vet
Hip Hop Shop, dreads, it don't stop there
Yeah, as difficult as it sounds

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
Doody, I drop a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missin' DeShaun
Holton, it was written, it was woven
For a soldier to leave so suddenly, got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around, leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're sayin', "Keep goin'!
Be a man! No emotion! It's your duty!"
Until we meet again, Doody

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And this might sound a little strange but I'ma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding
And I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
And hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all me and D12 we feel like "Fuck rap!"
It feels like our general just fuckin' died in our lap
We shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed
Our two-ways are in the trash
So some cats will have to find a new way
And I know it feels like the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is they're all still here and you ain't
Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressin' on
Don't ever give up the dream, dog, I got love for you all
And Doody, it's true you brought people together
Who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peacemaker, Doody
I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
But you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin'
If it had to happen, it had to happen
Believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to throw them 'bows back on Dresden
From eggin' cars to paintballin', gettin' arrested
To sittin' across from each other in cells, laughin' and jestin'
They tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court, so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin'
Me, you and… what's his face? I forgot his fuckin' name
Shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed our team
And if I see him again I'ma punch him in the fuckin' face
And that’s on Hailie Jade, Whitney Laine and Alaina’s name
I let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot
In the air for you and pour some liquor out
With Obie in the parking lot of 54 just before
We were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more
Difficult as it sounds

[Outro: Obie Trice]
Doody!

[Hook]
Now I'm gon' make a million and one dollars and do it again
Just wait 'til tomorrow, we won't borrow ever again
I can't wait 'til the day we wake up, wake up, wake up
And we all gon' be paid up, paid up, paid up, just wait, wait

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm so tired of praying for this free shit
Man, being broke is some weak shit
But thank God for that Micky D's, one dollar double cheese
Or some nights, I wouldn't eat shit
When I was supposed to be asleep
I was in the studio like "Y'all, make some beats"
Man you can ask B Right, you can ask Earl Mac
You can ask Pat Piff
I didn't have to go to school, I was better at this
Wanna do a fight club, nigga call me Brad Pitt
Tryna get the whole world to know Sean
I'm the only thing getting better with time besides wine
So somebody gotta find me
Cause Sean be cranking hits like Bons B
Man I swear GOOD Music wanna sign me
Yeah right B, naw for real nigga

[Hook]
Now I'm gon' make a million and one dollars and do it again
Just wait 'til tomorrow, we won't borrow ever again
I can't wait 'til the day we wake up, wake up, wake up
And we all gon' be paid up, paid up, paid up, just wait, wait

[Outro]
Man, I can't give you all that man
Like I said, Finally Famous: The Album coming to y'all soon, man, G.O.O.D MUSIC
Right now I wanna get into an exclusive produced by my dawg 88 Keys
Man, featuring Mr Bentley

Finally Famous 2 (Full Song)

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm so tired of praying for this free shit
Man, being broke is some weak shit
But thank God for that Micky D's, one dollar double cheese
Or some nights, I wouldn't eat shit
But there always was girls on my penile
And I fell victim to the vaginal
But when it comes to the ass chase
No thank you, rather run in the cash race
'Till the world knows Sean
The only thing getter better in time besides wine
Honestly better than all these asses
With no practice, for real just as is
I didn't have to go to school, I was better at this
Watch a nigga pull more strings than Lenny Kravitz
So I can say I have it, iff not I wish I had it
I do it with a passion

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
And we just started, we ain't nowhere near the outro
I'll t
