a world we want to grow

[Outro]
Every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
Every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine
Every day-hey-hey
Oh, every night
Every day-hey-hey
Whoa-oh, every, every night
Every day-hey-hey
No, oh, every, every night
Every day I dream, oh, I dream
No, oh, each and every night
You're moving me, soothing me, girl
Loving, touching, feeling, oh oh
And I'm feeling good
Oh, feels good
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be travelling on now
There's just too many places I've got to see

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change

Bye bye, baby, it's been a sweet love yeah, yeah
And though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take this so badly
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change
Lord, help me, I can't change

Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high free bird?
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Time to swing a little melody
To make you all feel something sexually
And now we're going to get it on in the groove
The groove that makes those smooth hips move
We are pumping that driving bad rhythm
To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum kissum kissum
In the mind is one design
To make you feel fine
Sucking on mine with a 69
I'm inclined to fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck your brains out
Make her moan, make her groan and make her shout
Push it all in and pull it all out
Pump that labia 'till it pouts

[Verse 2]
Open your legs to the sensual sound
Let the booty bustin' beat pound your pretty wet mound
I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound
Feel the bass, hump the ground
As you're droppin' to your knees and I come unbound
And now you make your mouth to get on down

[Verse 3]
Our lustful notes will boil your blood
When they slither and slide on under your hood
Makin' me shoot my power packed pud
Like a wild lady loving a viable stud
Causing what is known as a juicy wet pud
Getting it getting it getting' it good

[Verse 4]
In my head, as a jellified hum
I take to rubbing her on the bum
Adjust the lips some on the tongue
With my thumb I strum her plum
Start to make her orgasm
Tastes a little bit like oozing hot cum

[Outro]
Well I like to make her cum
To the rhythm of the drums
Make her cum, make her cum, cum
Make believe U're a hero, make believe U're a star
Make believe that U're somebody instead of who U really are
Make believe
It's only a movie

U don't need 2 scratch 4 crumbs when U deserve the whole cake
Make believe U're Sidney Poitier, believe, U gotta make believe
U got 2 make believe, U got 2 make believe
Baby, U got 2 make believe it's only a movie

Make believe U're sophisticated, make believe that U're en vogue
Make believe that U're quite wealthy even though
U're so broke U can't pay attention
Baby, U got 2 make believe, U got 2 make believe

Make believe it's only a movie
Make believe U're a star

U got 2 make believe, U got 2 make believe
U got 2 make believe, U got 2 make believe
O beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea!

O beautiful for pilgrim feet
Whose stern impassioned stress
A thoroughfare of freedom beat
Across the wilderness!
America! America!
God mend thine every flaw
Confirm thy soul in self-control
Thy liberty in law!

O beautiful for heroes proved
In liberating strife
Who more than self their country loved
And mercy more than life!
America! America!
May God thy gold refine
Till all success be nobleness
And every gain divine!
O beautiful for patriot dream
That sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam
Undimmed by human tears!
America! America!

And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea!

O beautiful for halcyon skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the enameled plain!

Till souls wax fair as earth and air
And music-hearted sea!

O beautiful for pilgrims feet
Whose stem impassioned stress
A thoroughfare for freedom beat
Across the wilderness!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
Till paths be wrought through
Wilds of thought
By pilgrim foot and knee!
O beautiful for glory-tale
Of liberating strife
When once and twice
For man's avail
Men lavished precious life!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
Till selfish gain no longer stain
The banner of the free!

O beautiful for patriot dream
That sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam
Undimmed by human tears!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
Till nobler men keep once again
Thy whiter jubilee!
Woman in a million to me
I never loved so much
Is it any wonder I'm alive
No one ever knows what makes a
Virtue or a vice
Let it be the spell I'm under
(These naked eyes)
Let it be the rain and thunder comes

I go above and beyond the sun
Some love never dies
Story of our lives, ohh
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
I'd give it all for you and me

Love is the earth and the wind
And the fire and the soul
Love is above and beyond any eye to behold
Love is the key and the cause
And it's makin' us whole
Made me a little crazy, but I
Soon realize my fate
Every little touch I'm paralyzed
No one ever know what makes
An angel in disguise
Let me be the one to taste you
Those naked eyes
No pity if the city ever crumbles down

I go above and beyond the sun
Some love never dies
Story of our lives, ohh
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
I'd give it all for you and me

Love is the earth and the wind
And the fire and we share
Love is the force and the edge
And it's ready for those who dare
Love is above and beyond
And I'm taking you there
(And baby, I'll take you there)

I go above and beyond the sun
Some love never dies
Story of our lives, ohh
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
I'd give it all for you and me
Love is the earth and the wind
And the fire and the soul
Love is the key and the cause
And it's makin' us whole
Love is the force and the edge
And it's yours if you dare
Love is above and beyond
And I'm taking you there
(Baby, I'll take you there)

I go above and beyond the sun
Some love never dies
Story of our lives, ohh
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
I'd give it all for you and me

[Verse 1]
In the early mornin' rain
With a dollar in my hand
And an achin' in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home
And I miss my loved ones so
In the early mornin' rain
With no place to go

[Verse 2]
Out on runway number nine
Big 707 set to go
And I'm stuck here in the ground
In the pain that ever grows
And the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
Yeah there she goes my friend
She'll be rollin' down at last

[Verse 3]
Hear the mighty engines roar
See the silver wing on high
She's away and westward bound
Far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the mornin' rain don't fall
Where the sun always shines
She'll be flyin' o'er my home
In about three hours time

[Verse 4]
This old airport's got me down
It's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I can be
You can't jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain
They were young
In their mid-twenties
Some in their teens
They were intelligent
And some believed
Were geniuses
They were passionate
Wildly in love
Adventurous
Well they were exuberant
Capable of hate
Extreme anger

They were drawn
Towards the exceptional
They avoided work
But worked hard at their laziness
And evermore
It seems they walked
Wandering through Paris
Was a genuine art

[Verse 1]
Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all of the time

[Verse 2]
Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together
I'm so weary all the time
All the time

[Bridge]
So weary all the time
Since you went away
The blues stepped up and met me
If they're here to stay
That old rocking chair's going to get me
Every night I pray
That the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sunlight once more

[Verse 3]
I can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I, we ain't together
Keeps raining all the time

[Outro]
Keeps raining all the time
All around the water tower
Waiting for a train
A thousand miles away from home
Sleeping in the rain I walked up to a brakeman
Just to give him a line of talk
He said if you've got money
I'll see that you don't walk
Well I haven't got a nickel
Not a penny can 1 show
Get off, get off you railroad bum
And he slammed that boxcar door

Well, he put me off in Texas
A state I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me
The moon and stars up above
Nobody seems to want me
Nor to lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco
Going back to Dixieland
My pocketbook is empty
My heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home
Just waiting for a train
He was, he was a friend of mine
He was, he was a friend of mine
Now he's dead and gone
This morning my best friend was sleeping in his bed
His face like a jewel and he was dead
He liked to play games or push me on a swing
Or push me on a merry-go-round, so round and round
So many days
I'd rather steal away and die
So many days
I'd rather steal away and die
I was too blue to live
And to mean to die

You've been so mean baby
You've been so mean to me
Baby, you've been so mean
You've been so mean to me
I've got to get even with you woman
You just hang around and see

Baby you ain't no good
You ain't no good no how
Baby you ain't no good
You ain't no good no how
Yes, the way I used to love you woman
Baby that's the way I hate you now
Yes, you can pack your clothes baby
You can pack your clothes and go
Pack your clothes, woman
You can pack your clothes and go
I want you to know baby
You ain't no better than the little girl I had before
My love for you
Is deep and endless as the sea
Strong and mighty as a tree
My love for you

My eager heart
Keeps beating just for you alone
Since the moment it is known
My love for you

There'll be no other lips
No other eyes
No other love for me
Feeling as I do
How could there be

(And) so it will be
Far beyond eternity
Ever faithful ever true
My love for you

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, it's Drake, KC

[Verse 1: Keshia Chanté]
We was just walking
Just smiling and talking
Then add to my surprise
Got lost in your eyes
This time they were different
And I found what it meant
After I leaned in I helplessly fell in

[Chorus: Keshia Chanté]
Help me I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I think that I'm in love

[Verse 2: Keshia Chanté]
In love and I can't see
What's happening to me
You blinded my thoughts
From what pain and tears taught
See my hearts been broken before
It don't trust love anymore
One kiss from you
I just felt myself fall right through

[Chorus: Keshia Chanté]
Help me I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I think that I'm in love

[Verse 3: Keshia Chanté]
Got me hypnotized with your magic spell
I got butterflies, can't control myself
Close my eyes at night and I dream of you
It's true, don't know what to do

[Bridge: Keshia Chanté & Drake]
Don't stop now
Since I let you in
You showed me how
You showed me how to love again
And there's no reason why
I can't give you a try (you know what it is)
'Cause it feels so right

[Verse 4: Drake]
Look, previously mischievous behavior
Was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some considerable degree
Steppin' out the house
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But ugh, Keshia, Keshia do you remember the old us?
We would never be together, is what they told us
From immature kids to entrepreneur kids
We bought our own dreams instead of the ones they sold us
Keep it a hundred, what they sayin' I'm a liar for?
Airing laundry, that's what I got a dryer for
What are they even searching through attire for?
Tellin' you these stories bout lonely women that I ignore
Callin' them out is red rover to me
To them it's a dream, its just a rare rover to me
See I'm passionate and focused
I don't know how they expect a Scorpio born in October to be, but ugh

[Alternate Verse: Drake]
I'm going in, check
Look, previously mischievous behavior was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But now, I need a culprit
I am talking lofts and beach condo adult shit
I am talking all day shopping sprees at the mall with, friends that I ball with, here meet T's girl, go and get some fall shit
Sweetie I am a tracks demise. I will kill this song until it actually dies
With a military jacket and some pack supplies
I won't say I'm the best until the stats arrive
And all these A-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside, its only slacks and ties
But you dont ever act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy until the plaques arrives
Thats why I love you

[Chorus: Keshia Chanté]
I've fallen please help me
I tried to break away from you
From the spics and blacks and the gum you chew
Where the posters are torn by the muggin' gangs
By the faggy parks and the burnt out vans
I've got ninety-nine years of laying in the dark and I'm far too young to lie
I've got ninety-nine ways to play my guitar it's going to pay me before I die

So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play
I'm just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head
Shazam! and Kapow!
With my guitar and me soprano
We can give you sweet head

I'm tough as glass and clean as night
Well if looks can love we can love all right
I'm your rubber peacock angelic whore
I'm a wrought iron face upon the wall
I had ninety-nine years of murder come life and I'm running away from it all
I got a bedroom, every mirror in town they're going to claim me if I fall
So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play
I'm just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head
Shazam! and Kapow!
With my guitar and me soprano
We can give you sweet head

Sweet head, give you sweet head
(spoken: while ya down there)

See my eyes of blocked emotion, see my tremble, see my fall
Traumatics thick and fast, your faith in me can last
Besides I'm known to lay you, one and all

Look south the way your mother dwells
If she knew what's going down, she'd give you hell
I'm the kind of man she warned me of
Till there was rock, you only had god

You and I have a mutual vow
We both like young, and we both like loud
I got pretty shoes, and I'm kid and proud
I'm street side out with my ear to the crowd

So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play
I'm just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head
Shazam! and Kapow!
With my guitar and me soprano
We can give you sweet head
Move along, sir!
Watch out for your friends
Well, they may lose in the end
Sometimes their child can make you sin
What is a man without a friend?

We all live within a game
The word, 'Excuse' has many names
Where true friends really come
You can't afford to lose one

If all men were truly brothers
Why then we hurt one another?
Love and peace from ocean to ocean
Somebody please second my emotion

All men were born to be free, yeah
What about you? And what about me?
This world is filled with hate, there's nothing left
If you enslave me, you'll never rescue yourself

Well, jealousy, as I recall
Has always been man's hardest fall
To conquer fear, that's quite a quest
Until we do never rest
A child was born yesterday
Oh, nothing but an innocent babe
Someone sowed a bitter seed
How could it grow but a bitter weed?

Society, how can you teach, I wanna know
If you don't practice what you preach?
That's right

If all men were truly brothers
Why then, can't we love one another?
Love and peace from ocean to ocean
Somebody please second my emotion

All men were born to be free, yeah
What about you? What about me?
This world is filled with hate, there's nothing left
If you enslave me, you'll only hurt yourself

Hey you, over there, I wanna know why you left
With all your riches and your fancy things
Can you tell me how many friends
Can you truly say you have?
I am an American aquarium drinker
I assassin down the avenue
I'm hiding out in the big city blinking
What was I thinking when I let go of you?
Let's forget about the tongue-tied lightning
Let's undress just like cross-eyed strangers
This is not a joke, so please stop smiling
What was I thinking when I said, it didn't hurt?
I want to glide through those brown eyes dreaming
Take it from the inside, baby hold on tight
You were so right when you said that I've been drinking
What was I thinking when I said, good night?
I want to hold you in the Bible-black pre-dawn
You're quite a quiet domino, bury me now
Take off your Band-Aid because I don't believe in touchdowns
What was I thinking when I said, hello?
I'd always thought that if I held you tightly
You'd always love me like you did back then
Then I fell asleep and the city kept blinking
What was I thinking when I let you back in?
I am trying to break your heart
I am trying to break your heart
But still I'd be lying if I said it wasn't easy
I am trying to break your heart
Disposable Dixie-cup drinking
I assassin down the avenue
I'm hiding out in the big city blinking
What was I thinking when I let go of you?
Loves you
I'm the man who loves you
We walk on every city street
We walk in lanes where branches meet
And stars send down their blessings from the blue
We go through storms of doubt and fear
And so we walk from year to year
Believing in each other as we do
Bravely marching forward two by two...

Boys and girls like you and me
Walk beneath the skies
They love just as we love
With the same dream in their eyes
Songs and kings and many things
Have their day and are gone
But boys and girls like you and me
We go on and on

Songs and kings and many things
Have their day and are gone
But boys and girls like you and me
We go on and on
Sky
So vast is the sky
With far away clouds just wandering by
Where do they go
Oh I don't know.. don't know

Wind that speaks to the leaves
Telling stories that no one believes
Stories of love belong to you and me

Oh Dindi
If I only had words
I would say all the beautiful things that I see
When you're with me
Oh my Dindi

Oh Dindi
Like the song of the wind in the trees
That's how my heart is singing Dindi
Happy Dindi
When you're with me
I love you more each day
Yes I do.. yes I do
I'd let you go away
If you take.. me with you

Don't you know Dindi
I'd be running and searching for you
Like a river that can't find sea
That would be me
Without you my Dindi

[Intro]
Yeah
Y'all know how this goes down
Doin' it funky!
Uh-huh, that's somethin' for the DJ's to cut up
They know (Funky)
Okay, break it down

[Verse 1]
On your mark, get set, let's go, you know it's me
The incomparable, SK, the B-I-Z
I know it's been a long time since you heard me
Do the beatbox and rock an LP
But right about now in 2003
I gotta make one to rock the party
As I change back from DJ to MC
Now it's time to get funky
For the ladies, for the fellas
East, West, North, South
My style is really outrageous
And when you hear the song it's really contagious
It's simple enough, be understood by all ages
But it will make you go out like gorillas in cages
I used to sing songs myself but now I can't
I need the party people to help with this chant
I need y'all to sing a lil' somethin' like this
Ei ya ya ya, oi ya ya ya
Ei ya, oi ya, ei ya ya ya

[Chorus]
Ei ya ya ya ei ya (Ei ya ya ya ei ya)
Sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na (Sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na)
Ei ya ya ya ei ya (Ei ya ya ya ei ya)
Sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na (Sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na)
Ei ya ya ya, oi ya ya ya
Ei ya, oi ya, ei ya ya ya

[Verse 2]
I was a rap king
But you know, on the tables I've been doin' my thing
Like Lisa Stansfield, I've been around the world
I'm from New York, like Earl the Pearl
But since I live in Washington I'm Redskin like LeVar
Hangin' at Dream and V.I.P. like a superstar
But I don't buy the bar, I buy a Red Bull
And sip and look at all the chicks that's beautiful
Like dark-skinned, light-skinned
White, Puerto Rican, Italian
I like to see them dance and drippin' with sweat
Givin' them more than they were supposed to get
Winter, spring, summer or fall
Whether you're eatin' food or drinkin' alcohol
They gonna rock your body all night long
'Cause this beat, it kick your ass like King-Kong
Listen to B, I am the
Original S-K B-I-Z, RRAHHAAAAHAHHHHHHH

[Chorus]
Ei ya ya ya ei ya (Ei ya ya ya ei ya)
Sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na (Sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na)
Ei ya ya ya ei ya (Ei ya ya ya ei ya)
Sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na (Sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na)
Ei ya ya ya, oi ya ya ya
Ei ya, oi ya, ei ya ya ya

[Verse 3]
You can do the hokey pokey or even the wop
I don't care what you do baby, just don't stop
A zunga zeng to the break of day
Listen to the brother with the rhythm rhymes I display
Whether you from New York or L.A
You listenin' to the B-I-Z every day
I was always a class clown, never the teacher's pet
That's why right now I'ma do the alphabet
Like A-B-C-D-E-F-G
H-i-j-k-l-m-n-o-p
Q-Rrrah-S, T-U-V
Ah W-X say Y and Z
That's why a lot of emcees wanna see
If I'm gonna fall off but I'm not G
I'm guaranteed to go all night with rhymes I write
I've gotten the mic guaranteed like Entertainment Tonight
So listen as I take a breather
I'm old school New Yorker like my name's Contiva{?}
I'm Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens
Long Island, New Jersey, and I'm on the scene

[Chorus]
Ei ya ya ya ei ya (Ei ya ya ya ei ya)
Sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na (Sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na)
Ei ya ya ya ei ya (Ei ya ya ya ei ya)
Sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na (Sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na)
Ei ya ya ya, oi ya ya ya
Ei ya, oi ya, ei ya ya ya
Never doubting
Always faithful
She returns
She says she loves me
And I could always
Come to her
She can't imagine how
Another lover
Could make her turn
And I'm so grateful
I'm still willing
To have her home
I'm so grateful
I'm still willing
To have her home
She says she loves me
She won't forget me
And then she's gone
She thinks that later
We could pick up the pieces
And carry on
And I forgive her
Never suspecting
She could be wrong
And I'm so grateful I'm
No longer willing
To have her home
I'm so grateful I'm
No longer willing
To have her home
I wake up every morning
People and take a look at the rising sun
I wake up every morning
And take a look at the rising sun

Then I realize my babe's gone
I missed her last night from holding her in my arm

I'm gonner ring up Turner
And I try to see if the little girl is over there
I'm gonner ring up Turner
And I try to see if the little girl is over there

Well I know, I know my baby
I know my sweet thing by the cloth she wear

She got great big sexy legs
And she wear the shoe number three
She got great big sexy legs
And she wear the shoe number three
I got to find, I got to find my sweet thing
Because her love means everything in this world to me

Since she been gone
You know my life don't seem the same
Since she's been gone
I tell you my life don't seem the same

People you know it fills my heart with sorrow
Every time I hear another man calling my woman's name

[Verse 1:]
Visions that can change the world
Trapped inside an ordinary girl
She looks just like me
Too afraid to dream out loud
And though it's simple, your idea
It won't make sense to everybody
You need courage now
If you're going to persevere

[Pre-Chorus:]
To fulfill your divine purpose
You've gotta answer when you're called
So don't be afraid to face the world against all odds

[Chorus:]
Keep the dream alive don't let it die
If something deep inside keeps inspiring you to try
Don't stop and never give up
Don't ever give up on you, don't give up

[Verse 2:]
Every victory comes in time
Work today to change tomorrow
It gets easier
Who's to say that you can't fly?
Every step you take you get
Closer to your destination
You can feel it now
Don't you know you're almost there?

[Pre-Chorus:]
To fulfill your divine purpose
(oohh oohh yeah yeah)
You've gotta answer when you're called
So don't be afraid to face the world against all odds

[Chorus:]
Keep the dream alive don't let it die
If something deep inside keeps inspiring you to try
Don't stop and never give up
Don't ever give up on you
Sometimes life can place a stumbling block in your way
But you've gotta keep the faith
Bring what's deep inside your heart to the light
And never give up
Don't ever give up on you
Don't give up

[Bridge:]
Who holds the pieces to complete the puzzle?
The answer that can solve a mystery
The key that can unlock your understanding
It's all inside of you
You have everything you need
So...

Keep the dream alive don't let it die
If something deep inside keeps inspiring you to try
Don't stop
And never give up
Don't ever give up on you...
Sometimes life can place a stubborn block on your way
But you gotta keep the faith
Bring what's deep inside your heart, yeah
...your heart to the light

And never give up
Don't ever give up on you
No, don't give up
No, no, no, no

Don't give up
Don't give up
Don't give up
Oh, don't, no, no, no, no
Don't give up
(Just about time I'm feelin' blue tryin' to get over you)
Maybe it's just about time I told you I'm all through with you
But just about the time I start to tell you I start feeling blue
And just about then I lose my nerve and wait another day or two
Cause just about the time I think it's over I start missing you
(Hardest thing I'll ever do tryin' to get over you)
It's just about time I had my sayin' I told you a thing or two
It's just about time I paid you back you treat me like you do
But just about the time I get the nerve I can't seem to carry through
Cause just about then an empty feelin' reminds me I miss you
(Like to find somebody new I could just get you)

(Just don't know what I go through tryin' to get over you)
It's just about time I let you know I've had my fill of you
But just about the time I think about goin' I start missin' you
I'd like to go find another love that'll never be untrue
But just about the time I think about leavin' I start missin' you
(Havin' a hard time feelin' blue tryin' to get over you)
Lady with a Fan

Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
Till my tale is told and done

While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'till things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion's den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
And not disaster

The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise

The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
And not to master
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

Terrapin Station

Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
(Oh)
From the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - if it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - but the train's put it's brakes on
And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

Terrapin

[Instrumental]

At a Siding

While you were gone
These faces filled with darkness
The obvious was hidden
With nothing to believe in
The compass always points to Terrapin

Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain
You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again
For good or ill again

Terrapin Flyer & Refrain

[Instrumental]
Six numbers one more to dial
Before I'm before you
And I tried to call-been busy all night
Gave up waiting at daylight

Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me

Ooooo I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side

One of the many
One of the few
To stand back and wait for you

Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me
Ooooo I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
Life as the man on the side

I fell in love with a dream that I built of you
Playin' the part of the queen
Taking my own advice
I'm giving up tonight good luck to you
And the king

Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free if you wanted me
When! When you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me

I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man
You know life as the man
Livin' life as the man on the side
If you ever leave me, I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you

The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I lost my one and only
They'd be sad if you're bad to me
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighing
If they heard from the breeze that you left me crying
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me

But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me

So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Cos they know I got my one and only
They'll be glad you're not bad to me

They'll be glad you're not bad to me, to me, to me
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

[Verse 1]
Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you night and day

[Pre-Chorus]
Day and night, why is it so?
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's gloom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you night and day

[Chorus]
Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an oh, such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day

[Verse 2]
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter darlin', where you are
I think of you night and day

[Chorus]
Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an oh, such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day
Ah, mercy mercy, mercy mercy
Ah, mercy mercy...

Oh, oh mercy, mercy me (mercy, mercy me)
Oh things ain't what they used to be, no, no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows
From the north and south and east

Oh mercy, mercy me
Oh things ain't what they used to be, no, no
Oil wasted on the ocean and upon our sea
Fish full of mercury

Oh mercy, mercy me (oh mercy mercy mercy me)
Oh things ain't what they used to be
Radiation underground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby are dying

Oh mercy, mercy me
Oh things ain't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land?
How much more abuse from man can she stand?
Oh...oh...mercy mercy
Oh Lord, oh Lord, what do we do?

Oh mercy, mercy me
Oh things ain't what they used to be
Where did all the blue skies go?

Oh...oh...mercy mercy, mercy mercy
Mercy mercy, mercy mercy...
School ya'll to somethin right quick
Sit down, open your ears, close your eyes, listen

Here's a little story that I got to tell
About this chico named Pit everyone knows so well
Illmatic like Nas but that ain't hard to tell
Owes it all to Dade County and the ATL
Picked rap and skipped the triple beam scale
And it's a known fact he gon' die before he fails
These boys rap about hustlin' but can't make bail
I call that hustling backwards and that's real
Miami's hot so I can vacation in hell
The way the game is shit, man, I mind as well
I look at these fools on camera flashin they tools

They must've forgot the streets got codes and rules
But me, I'm confused
'Cause rappers wanna be gangstas
Gangstas wanna be rappers
Ballers wanna be rappers
And rappers wanna be ballers
The truth is its more sickening than Ebola
Until they handcuff then its over
Pop up no dandruff, no neck, just head and shoulders
Bust guns, sell drugs, that's what the streets showed us
But corporate America, that's what they sold us
Hide your heart from sight, lock your dreams at night
It could happen to you
Don't count stars or you might stumble
Someone drops a sigh and down you tumble

Keep an eye on spring, run when church bells ring
It could happen to you
All I did was wonder how your arms would be
And it happened to me

Keep an eye on spring, run when church bells ring
It could happen to you
All I did was wonder how your arms would be

And it happened to me

[Interlude]
To ease the pain
Of changing from Boys II Men
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from Boys II Men
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from Boys II Men
(Here we go again)
Sometimes I think that I'm on the right track
But I keep coming back to the same place
The same place where I sought it
Sometimes you'll think there's a smile on my face
But it can't take the place of a free-heart, a me-heart that I've read of
I can hear mem'ries singing through night and through day
What good are mem'ries, they just seem to get in the way
They get in the way
When it's November, I'll think of July
Where the sunshine will fly through a warm sky
A warm sky where I'll wander
When it's November, I'll think of July
Where the sunshine will fly through a warm sky
A warm sky where I'll wander

[Verse 1]
Preacher man walked into the bar and he said
He said "Hey girl, can't you walk a mile straight?"
Father, I'm torn and I'm selling my soul
To the rhythm, the beat and the bass

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can't confess my rock and roll ways
'Cause I'm so possessed with the music, the music he plays

[Chorus]
I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love, with my rock-rock god

[Verse 2]
Preacher man took my hand and looked in my eyes
He said "Hey girl, can't you live your life right?"
Father, things aren't always so black and white
Don't cast the first stone 'cause I'm not alone

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's not like I'm hurting anyone
But I can't confess my rock, my rock and roll ways

[Chorus]
I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love, with my rock-rock god
I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love, with my rock-rock god

[Bridge]
No, I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
I chose a path and I'm not looking back
And I'm sorry if I left the angels cryin' over me

[Chorus]
I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love, with my rock-rock god

[Breakdown]
Preacher man, preacher man, oh
Preacher man, preacher man, oh
Preacher man, preacher man, oh
Preacher man, preacher man, oh

[Outro]
'Cause I'm gone, gone, gone (Oh, oh)
Gone, gone, gone
Yeah, I'm gone, gone, gone (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me when you need it again
Tell me when you need it again

[Verse 1]
What s comin' over your mind?
You wanted my sugar this time
We're good together i know
Why would you go lookin' for new love tomorrow?

[Chorus]
Why don't you tell me when you need it again
(Tell me when you need it again)
Come on and tell me when you need it again
(Tell me when you need it again)
Why don't you tell me when you need it again

[Bridge]
Tell me when you need it again
I can keep you satisfied
Tell me when you need it baby
So I can keep you satisfied

[Verse 2]
You say we're needin' a change
We should be doin' other things
But when you're feelin' my touch
You don't be complaining as much

[Chorus]
Why won't you tell me when you need it again
(Tell me when you need it again)
Come on and tell me when you need it again
(Tell me when you need it again)
Why won't you tell me when you need it again
(Tell me when you need it again)
Come on and tell me when you need it again

Come on and tell me when you need it again
(Tell me when you need it again)
Come on and tell me when you need it again
(Tell me when you need it again)
Come on and tell me, yeah, yeah

Tell me when you need me baby
(Tell me when you need it again)
You need, when you need, well when you need it
(Tell me when you need it again)
When you need it, when you need it

[Verse 3]
You say you needed my sugar
And now you're changin' your mind
(Tell me)
Why don't you get it together?
And stop wasting my time
Well, well, well, well
(Tell me)
Tell me when you need me baby
I can keep you satisfied
(Tell me)
Tell me when you need me baby
So I can keep you satisfied

'Cause I need your love, I need you so desperately
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
And fade
Dupree went down-town a '44 in his hand
Dupree went down-town a '44 in his hand
Went for the jewelry but he shot that jewelry man
Dupree said Betty here's your diamond ring
Dupree said Betty here's your diamond ring

Just to please you pretty Betty I've done done a wicked thing
Dupree told Betty I'm bound for Tennessee
Dupree told Betty I'm bound for Tennessee
I'm sorry pretty Betty but that sheriff is a haunting me
They caught poor Dupree and put him into the jail
Caught poor Dupree put him in the jail

Atlanta prison is where Betty took Dupree his mail
Dupree said judge I ain't been here before
Dupree said judge I ain't been here before
Judge told Dupree I'm gonna see that you don't come back no more
They took him to the scaffold a black cap upon his face
Took him to the scaffold a black cap upon his face

Now the cold cold ground is for Dupree's resting place
Betty went to the graveyard singing near oh my god to thee
Betty went to the graveyard singing near oh my God to thee
Oh mister hangman look what you done done to Dupree
She told the hack-driver to drive his wagon slow
Told the hack-driver drive your dead wagon slow
When you bury my Dupree I ain't gonna see him no more
Sail on Dupree sail on, sail on Dupree sail on
Don't mind you sailing but you be gone so long
So long Dupree poor boy so long, Dupree poor boy
Don't mind you sailing you'll be gone so long, sail on
Dupree poor boy
Peter said to the bird: "Fly down and circle over the wolf's head. Only take care that he doesn't catch you."

The bird almost touched the wolf's head with his wings while the wolf snapped angrily at him, this side and that

How that bird teased the wolf! And how the wolf wanted to catch him! But the bird was clever, and the wolf simply couldn't do anything about it
She belongs there, left with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She laughs and stays in the
Won- won- wonderful

She knew how to gather the forest when
God reached softly and moved her body
One golden locket quite young
And loving her mother and father

Farther down the path was a mystery
Through the recess the chalk and numbers
A boy bumped into her
Won- won- won- wonderful

She'll return in love with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She'll smile and thank God
For one won- won- wonderful

Na na na na na na na
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Nathan, you must concentrate on the game. The town is up to here with high players. The Greek's in town. Freddie Bottle Bates, Scranton Slim

Nathan: I know, I know, I could make a fortune, but to make a fortune, I need a fortune. A thousand bucks, where do I get it?

The Biltmore Garage wants a grand, but we ain't got a grand on hand
And they now got a lock on the door to the gym at Public School 84
There's a stock room behind McKlosky's Bar, but Mrs. McKlosky ain't a good scout
And things being how they are, the back of the police station is out!
So the Biltmore Garage is the spot, but the one thousand bucks we ain't got

Why, it's good old reliable Nathan, Nathan, Nathan, Nathan Detroit
If you're looking for action, he'll turn it to spot
Even when the heat is on, it's never too hot
But for the good old reliable Nathan, oh it's only just a short walk
To the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York
There are well-heeled shooters everywhere, everywhere
There are well-heeled shooters everywhere
And awful lot of lettuce for the fella who can get us to play
If we only had a lousy little crap, we could be a millionaire
Oh the good old reliable Nathan, Nathan, Nathan, Nathan Detroit
If the size of your bundle you want to increase
I'll arrange that you go broke in quiet and peace
In a hideout provided by Nathan, where there are no neighbours to squawk
It's the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York
Where's the action? Where's the game?
Gotta have the game or we'll die from shame
It's the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York
(Silent night, holy night)
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round young virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
All is dark save the light
See the Eastern wise men
Bring gifts and homage to our King
Christ, the Savior is born
Jesus, the Savior is born
Silent night
(Holy night)
All is calm, all is bright
Poorest dreams from heaven
Afar heavenly host sing Hallelujah
(Christ, the Savior is born)
(Jesus, the Savior is born)
Silent night, holy night
Wondrous dark lend Thy light
With the angels let us sing
Hallelujah, hail the King
Christ, the Savior is born
Jesus, the Savior is born

[Intro]
Hooo ooh ooh ooh yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Nathan]
I'm telling the world here and now
That I'm gonna love you and love you
I take this vow
You captured my heart
So long ago
Still there are some critical things
That you should know
Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Do I give all I have
To be now and forever your man?
Do I take you to be
Without question the woman for me?
Do I promise you? I do
Do I promise you? I do, I do

[Verse 2: Shawn]
This love has been worth, worth waiting for
'Cause love doesn't matter to me if its not yours
As we become one through and through
I dedicate all of my life to loving you
Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Do I give all I have
To be now and forever your man?
Do I take you to be
Without question the woman for me?
Do I promise you? I do
Do I promise you? I do, I do

[Bridge]
To have and to hold, while passions unfold
I promise a life you won't regret
For better or worse
No one can reverse the way that I felt since we met
And you ain't seen nothing yet

[Chorus]
(Girl) Do I give all I have to be now and forever your man?
Do I take you to be, without question the woman for me?
Do I swear on my life we'll be happy as husband and wife?
Do I promise you? (Promise)
Do I promise you? (Promise you, baby)
Do I promise you?
I do
Do I promise you?
I do

[Outro]
I do...I do...I do...I do
I'm tellin', I'm tellin', I'm tellin' the world
I do...I do...I do...yeah yeah yeah
Do I...?
I do, baby
I'm gonna marry you, wanna make you my wife
Tell me where is your lady, lady where is your man
Playin' mind games on each other, givin' heartaches when you can
Keep your feelin's under cover, feelin' lonely when you smile
One couldn't live without the other, tryin' to prove to the world
That you'll change your style

Everything you did together made you feel happy
Same things done alone don't feel the same
In a hurry to forget but you still remember
Every time you do, you feel a pain-You still feel the need

Tell me where are the people who appeared your best of friends
Seems they add to your confusion 'cause they leave you in the end
Write a letter to your lover and she's writin' one to you
Neither one of you are gonna send it, cause your pride gets the best of you

Everything you did together made you feel happy
Same things done alone don't feel the same
In a hurry to forget but you still remember
Every time you do, you feel a pain-You still feel the need
Tell me when will you deliver your satisfaction's long overdue
Try to hide your true feelin's and it's takin' its toll on you
Find that somethin' that you're missin', take a long look at yourself
If you find somethin' missin', reach on out for something else

Everything you did together made you feel happy
Same things done alone don't feel the same
In a hurry to forget but you still remember
Every time you do, you feel a pain-You still feel the need
Nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide
I got nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide

It's not love, I'm running from
It's the heartaches, I know will come
'Cause I know, you're no good for me
But you've become a part of me

Everywhere I go, your face I see
Every step I take, you take with me, yeah

Nowhere to run, baby, nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide

I know you're no good for me, now
But free of you I'll never be, no
Each night as I sleep into my heart you creep
I wake up feeling sorry I met you, hoping soon that I'll forget you

When I look in the mirror and comb my hair
I see your face just a-smiling there
Nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide

I know you're no good for me
But free of you, I'll never be
How can I fight a lover that's sugar sweet
When it's so deep, so deep, deep inside of me

My love reaches so high, you can't get over it
So wide, you can't get around, no

Nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide

I know you're no good for me
But free of you I'll never be

Nowhere to run to, baby nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run

[Intro]
Let me see what you can do
I'm runnin' this (Like-like-like-like a circus)
Yeah, let's go

[Verse 1]
There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first (Oh, oh)
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot

[Pre-Chorus]
When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline movin' through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

[Chorus]
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

[Post-Chorus]
A circus
A circus
A circus
A circus

[Verse 2]
There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me and ones that are scared
So, baby, I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (I call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot

[Pre-Chorus]
When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline movin' through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

[Chorus]
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

[Post-Chorus]
A circus
A circus
A circus
A circus

[Breakdown]
Let's go
Let me see what you can do
I'm runnin' this (Like-like-like-like a circus)
Yeah, like a what? (Like-like-like-like a circus)

[Chorus]
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

I got the key to the highway
Billed out and bound to go
I'm gonna leave here running;
Walking is most too slow
I'm going back to the border
Woman, where I'm better known
You know you haven't done nothing
Drove a good man away from home

Live verse: When the moon peeks over the mountains
I'll be on my way
I'm gonna roam this old highway
Until the break of day
Oh give me one, one more kiss mama
Just before I go
'Cause when I leave this time you know I
I won't be back no more
I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome
My heart is filled with misery

Oh, so many strange things
They happen to me all day long
Oh, so many strange things
They happen to me all day long
Yes, it seems like everything I do
Everything I do is wrong

I had a good reputation
The greatest man in town
But I'm having so much troubles
Till they 'bout to drag me down
I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome
My heart is filled with misery

I got up on my feet
I had lots of friends
But bad luck had hit me
Now I'm down again
I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome
My heart is filled with misery
I WANNA GET NEXT TO YOU
Writer Norman Whitfield
Copyright 1976

Sittin' here in this chair waitin' on you
Ah, baby, to see things my way
But not a word do you say
You won't even look my way
Girl, I'm spending my dimes, wasting my time
Talking â€˜til I'm black and blue
Ah, can't you see
I wanna get next to you
Dreams of you and I go sailing by
Whenever your eyes meet mine
(spoken)You're so fine
And girl you make me feel so insecure
You're so beautiful and pure
Why must you be so unkind
(spoken)and tell me I'm not your kind, blowin' my mind
Girl my money is low and I know
That I can't take you to the fancy places you might wanna go
Still I wanna get next to you
Ah I wanna get next to you
Girl you can bend me, shake me, make me
Whatever it takes to please you I'm willing to do
Â€˜Cause you're my dream come true
I wanna get next to you
I wanna get next to you
I wanna make you mine for all time
I wanna get next to you
I promise I'll never make you blue
I wanna get next to you
I wanna get next to you
You keep coming back like a song
A song that keeps saying "remember"
The sweet used-to-be that was once you and me
Keeps coming back like an old melody

The perfume of roses in May
Returns to my room in December
From out of the past where forgotten things belong
You keep coming back like a song
When I come home in the morning
And I knock on the door
I don't get that glad-to-see-you welcome
The glad-to-see-you welcome any more
Oh but to me
It's just like it used to be, baby
Because you are still my woman

You know a change have come
And I guess I'll blame it on fate
The thing that once was love
It now seems to turn to hate
Oh I guess it's too late
For me now, baby
But you are still my woman

You know I tried to be
The man you wanted me to be
But whatever I do, baby
It seems to add to your misery
Oh you can do
What you want to, baby
But you are still my woman
You know I'm still hoping and praying
That someday I'll find
Someone to love me
So I can have love and peace of mind
Oh I still love you
Like I did before, baby
Because you are still my woman

Your friends are all telling you
That I'm a no good so-and-so
They say that love and affection
Have now turned to a heart
A heart that's old and cold
It's the same old story
Same old story that's so often told

You are still my woman
On the day that I was born, daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day which could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

Half-step Mississippi Uptown Toodleloo
Hello baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old southern sky
I'm on my way, on my way

If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
I lost my boots in transit babe, a pile of smoking leather
Nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather

Half-step Mississippi Uptown Toodleloo
Hello baby, I'm gone, good-bye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old southern sky
I'm on my way, on my way
They say that when your ship comes in the first man takes the sails
The second takes the after deck, the third the planks and rails
What's the point to calling shots this cue ain't straight in line
Cue ball's made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

Half-step Mississippi Uptown Toodleloo
Hello baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old southern sky
I'm on my way, on my way

Across the Rio Grand-eo
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grand-eo
Across the lazy river

[T-Pain whispering]
Feel good baby? Turn the lights off... turn the TV off... STOP. Don't do that...

[T-Pain]
We're in the bed and we both know what time it is
Ain't no use in playin wit it
In my head waitin for the perfect time to

[Chorus]
Drop that bass on you
What ya think about it?
How does it feel baby?

I know you like it
You can't do nothin but ride wit it (C'mon)
Why is my hand touching your leg
I need to wait for the right time to

[Chorus]
You think it's cool (Yeah)
You think it's cool so do I
Now if it's one thing I gotta do to you
I'm not leaving out this room until I

[Chorus]
But what if I go down
And further down
And further down
And further down
And further down
To your belly chain--sike (I'm just playin)
But what id I go further down
And further down
And further down
And further down
And further down
Make you say my name
Twice
Now you can try to find it if you wanna
But I'm tellin ya babe
This feeling is uncontrolable
And this is the first time for us
So trust
Is a must
That high (hiiiiiigh)

[Chorus]
Take your clothes off
Go 'head and show off
What you got
Look at that pretty face on ya
Slim waist on ya
Girl ya make wanna (what you gonna do?)

[Chorus]
Shit
Excuse my language baby
But all I can say is
Shit

[Chorus]

[T-Pain talking]
Nah, we don't need it
It feels so good without it

[Chorus]
I think it's bout that time

[Chorus]
My Lord, what a mornin'
My Lord, what a mornin'
My Lord, what a mornin'
When the stars begin to fall
When the stars begin to fall

My Lord, what a mornin'
My Lord, what a mornin'
My Lord, what a mornin'
When the stars begin to fall
When the stars begin to fall

No more grief and pain for me
I heard from Heaven today
Yes, my Lord's gonna set me free
I heard from Him today

My Lord, what a mornin'
My Lord, what a mornin'
Oh, my Lord, what a mornin'
When the stars begin to fall
When the stars begin to fall
On my way to the promised land
I heard from Him today
God's gonna give me His right hand
I heard from Heaven today

My Lord, what a mornin'
My Lord, what a mornin'
Oh, my Lord, what a mornin'
When the stars begin to fall
When the stars begin to fall
After Hours

By Credits (Boz Scaggs)
After all the ups and downs
All the dues are done
I want you to meet me after hours
And we'll make a little run
I want you to meet me, baby, after the lights go down low
I want you to meet me after hours, then we'll take it nice and slow

Now, don't you go out lookin'
No tellin' what you find
It's a jungle out there, baby
But just take it off your mind
I want you to meet me later, after the lights go down low
I want you to meet me after hours, and leave the crazies at the door

You know it's been a long time
Since you came around this way
And you look like all the pennies
I've been savin' for a rainy day
Would be awful nice to see you, baby, after the lights go down low
Cause you know there ain't no tellin' what after hours got in store
Bo Diddley had a farm
On that farm he had some women
Women here, women there
Women, women, women everywhere

But one little girl lived on a hill
She rustled and tussled like Buffalo Bill
One day she decided she'd go for a ride
With a pistol and a sword by her side

She rode right up to my front door
Knocked and knocked 'till her fist got sore
When she turned and walked away
All you could hear my baby say :

Hey! Bo Diddley
Hey! Bo Diddley
Hey! Bo Diddley

Saw my baby run across the field
Slippin' and sliddin' like an automobile
Hollered at my baby and told her to wait
Slipped off from me like a Cadillac-8
Hey! Bo Diddley
Hey! Bo Diddley
Hey! Bo Diddley
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

She can't be found
But love doesn't care, doesn't care
Ah, don't despair
The next time around, she'll be there

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

I wouldn't make her
Her wooden table, I wouldn't care
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Don't be long
My heart isn't strong, don't be long
Ah, never fear
The next time around, she'll be here

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

So you met someone who set you back on your heals - goody, goody
You met someone and now you know how it feels - goody, goody
You gave him your heart too
Just as I gave mine to you
And he broke it in little pieces
Now how do you do

You lie awake just singing the blues all night - goody, goody
And you think that loves a barrel of dynamite
Hooray and hallelujah
You had it coming to y'a
Goody goody for him, goody goody for me
I hope you're satisfied you rascal you
I hope you're satisfied, 'cause you got yours
It was a cold black night and the rain was falling down
Cold black night and the rain was fallin' down
I went out lookin' for my girl
I knew she wasn't nowhere around

She left me early that morning, with a suitcase in her hand
She left me early that morning, yes, with a suitcase in her hand
And she took off on a train this mornin'
And she was meetin' some other man, yes

She used to treat me real good and I wonder why I
Didn't treat her right
Yes, ah, you know I wonder why I didn't treat her right
And now all I can do, is walk those streets both day and night
I suppose that there are those
Who'll say he had it easy
Had it made in fact
Before he'd even begun
But they don't know the things I know
I was always with him
It may sound strange
We were more than friends

It's hard to tell the truth
When no one wants to listen
When no one really cares
What's going on
And it's hard to stand alone
When you need someone beside you
Your spirit and your faith
They must be strong

What one man can do is dream
What one man can do is love
What one man can do is change the world
And make it young again
Here you see what one man can do
As shaded as his eyes might be
That's how bright his mind is
That's how strong his love
For you and me
A friend to all the universe
Grandfather of the future
And everything I would like to be

What one man can do is dream
What one man can do is love
What one man can do is change the world
And make it new again
Here you see what one man can do

What one man can do is dream
What one man can do is love
What one man can do is change the world
And make it work again
Here you see what one man can do
(willie dixon)

Yeah
A gypsy once told my mother
Before I was born
She said you got a boy child comin'
He's goin' to be a son of a gun
He's goin' make you girls, jump and shout
Then the world, then the world, gonna know
What it's all about, yeah
Everybody knows I'm it
I'm a hoochie koochie man
Everybody knows I'm it
I've got a bad cat bone
I've got a bojo too baby
I got a little jar in the comfort room
We're gonna jump and mess with you
I'm gonna make you girl, fit inside my hand
Then the world gonna know
I'm a hoochie koochie man
Everybody knows I'm it
I'm a hoochie koochie man
Everybody knows I'm it
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
On the seventh night
Of the seventh month
Of the seventh week, haha
For the seventh time she said
He was born for good luck
Can't you see
I got 700 girlfriends and dolloars
So don't you mess with me
Everybody knows I'm here
I'm a hoochie koochie man
Every, every, evrybody knows I'm it

[Intro]
Let's play a game called "you agree"
'Cause nothin' was created in disagreement, see
And if I didn't try to school you, I'd be remiss
You know what?
Why should I do that when I can do this?

(Do this)
(Boom shakalakala boom)
This drummer wicked
(Do this)

[Verse 1]
You were just conceived on a Friday night
I was on stage wasting brothers in a real fight
Everytime they copped my space down I worked it harder
Stripped down to my underwear and spanked them like they father
Never before had people seen a vision so bizarre
Play a hand that's equal to mine
Uh, look at my cards I heard your little groove and I raised you
Another
On a Sunday morning would you play that smack for your mother?
Huh, I believe you would think otherwise
A few CDs from now when the software that you're banging's not alive
In a real battle those loops y'all got suffer TKO's
Until U're playing in front of 70,000 you'll never know, nigga
This a grown folks job
All the young dogs need to recognize
If the world was God, the people need to use it with a third eye
Who? What? Why? Uh, lookout

[Refrain]
And if I didn't try to school you I would be remissed
You should I do that when I can do this?

(If a nigga never stylin', who would I diss?)
Why should I do that when I can do this?
(Boom shakalakala boom)
This drummer wicked
Why should I do that when I can do this?
This drummer wicked
Why should I do that when I can do this?

Everytime I turn around there's another boot
Talking about what another boot can't do
Quiet as it's kept, everyone of U boots need 2 try 2 walk a mile in my shoes

I've had devils (out) try 2 take me out but I stand 4 the truth
So my words makes mo' dollars than sense on your hellavision or your radio
With this flow it just grows
Yo, ask Chuck D. - he know
He's been fightin' the "so called power" since the days of old
So tell me now what should be sold?
Sleepy Jack hazards y'all need a couple of No-doze (Ooh)
Ask Mary J. about Chaka
Mary, is Chaka on the radio? (No)
Huh, see U gotta save your own
In the end it ain't about the dollars but the seeds U've sewn
In a mind state full of Dutch ELM that's where the ghetto's grown (Ohh)
Watch out y'all can't block me out tonight
If I didn't try to school u I'd be remissed
Why should I do that when I can do this? (Hey yeah)
(Do this)
(If a nigga never stylin', who would I diss?)
Why should I do that when I can do this?
(Boom shakalakala boom)
This drummer wicked
Why should I do that when I can do this?

Uh, a drummer in a cold sweat, backin' up my rhyme
I'd make U take your shortie outta here (Everytime )
Calling me fine
I got a big stick, one 4 each hand
Everybody know I keep a tight band, come on
Uh

My brothers in Manhattan say, "Got to shut these haters down G."
He say, "Dog I got yo' back but you gotta, you gotta make a sound" (Make a sound)
Like we used to, "Well U might be pissed
Cuz y would I do that when I can do this?"

2 most I'm known as a lover, to others I'm just a pain (Say what?)
The latter's opinion usually form when mediocrity reigns
And if I didn't school ya, U know what? (What?)
I would be remissed
Yo, y would I do that y'all, (haha) Londell, when I can do this?
(Why should I do that when I can do this?)
Y would I do that y'all, Ananda, when I can do this? (Backup)
(Why should I do that when I can do this?)
Y would I do that y'all, Doug E., when I can do this?
Y would I do that y'all, Spike, when I could do this?
(Why should I do that when I can do this?)
Y would I do that y'all, NPG? We can do this, we can do this
Boom!
There's only one thing that money can't buy
True love, that will never die, oh no, no
All my trials, Lord, soon be over

If religion was a thing that money could buy
Well the rich would live and the poor would die
All my trials, Lord, soon be over

Well, the river of Jordan is chilly and cold, yeah, yeah, yeah
Chills the body but not the soul, yeah
All my trials, Lord, soon be over
All my trials, Lord, soon be over
All my trials, Lord, soon be over
From Hollywood and Vine
To the Sunset Strip
There's so much going on
You can lose your grip
From early in the morning
Until late at night
They'll do you so wrong
They'll do you so right

Back in L.A
Waiting for the sun to shine
Back in L.A
Living down a life of crime
Back in L.A
Working on another line
Back in L.A
To pick up the dime
You must do the time

From way up in the canyons

Where the hot winds howl
To the mean city streets
Where the night hawks prowl
I can feel the rhythm play
The whole night long
Guess I'll stay in L.A
And listen to this song
Back in L.A
Waiting for the sun to shine
Back in L.A
Living down a life of crime
Back in L.A
Working on another line
Back in L.A
To pick up the dime
You must do the time

You must do the time

Greeting cards have all been sent
The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one more wish to make
A special one for you

[Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
Merry Christmas, darling
We're apart, that's true
But I can dream, and in my dreams
I'm Christmas-ing with you

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
Holidays are joyful
There's always something new
But every day's a holiday
When I'm near to you

[Bridge: Wanya Morris & Boyz II Men]
The lights on my tree
I wish you could see
I wish it every day
The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you a Merry Christmas
(Merry Christmas)
Happy New Year, too
I've just one wish on this Christmas Eve
(On this Christmas Eve)
I wish I were with you

[Verse 3: Shawn Stockman]
The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you a Merry Christmas

(On this Christmas Eve)
I wish I were with you
I wish I were with you

[Outro: Boyz II Men]
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, darling
She's a snooty little cutie, she's a burgulous skirt
She's a knockout and a beauty, and a flirt
Such a dapper little flapper, she's just as cute as a train
She's a kissie little missie, a shameless jane
She's slick do do ro ro
She's a classy little lassie, a keen little queen
And although sometimes she's sassy, not mean
Just a fiend for romance is she, a whirly little girl is she
She's a knockout, a beauty, snooty little cutie, snooty little cutie, she
You're a mellow little fellow, you're a cutey little boy
You're a knockout and a beauty, you're a joy
You're a ready little kenny, you've swept this girl off her feet

You're a handy little dandy, you're a keen little queen
And although sometimes I'm bossy, you're never mean
I'm a fiend for romance with you, ever little fellow you're mine
You're a knockout and a beauty, and a snooty little cutie mine
She's a classy little lassie, a keen little queen
And though sometimes she's sassy, she's never mean

(Chorus)
I've been hustlin
From dusk till dawn
I've been hustlin
For so long

I'm the hungry hustla afroman i recycle cardboard, beer bottles, and cans
Food stamps, bust token plus G.R. checks, underground rap tapes tryin to
Get on deck

Hit the rap contest sellin weed on stage
Go to work for the man for minimum wage
Slave hard, grave yard, every day get scard
Airport, fast food, security gaurd
Slangin rocks all day
Let my beeper just beep
Go to work go high, go strait to sleep
Wake up, bake up, then punch them clocks
Swerve them blocks, serve them rocks
Workin at the airport with Jivonni and Kid
Slangin everything the airport bring in
Cook crack sip yak stack cheese
Walk around sell my own cd's
(Chorus)
I've been hustlin (24-7, 365)
From dusk till dawn (all my life just tryna survive)
I've been hustlin (food stamps bus token plus G.R. check
For so long (underground rap tapes tryna get on deck)
I've been Hustlin Dusk till dawn (swerve them rocks)
I've been hustlin
For so long

Ghetto resident everyday get bent
With the 2 tall cans for 89 cent
Get money get fame get women get props
Chillin kick it with my homies rippin rocks from the cops
Walk slow around the corner then dash hall ass
If you run, run fast cus the cops might blast
Run, Shake, Break, bail
Might as well cus it's hell in the county jail
Cut to the left (left) Cut to the right (right)
Run up in the house shut the door goodnight
Come back out bout 20 minutes later
Braggin to the homies how i shook that hater
Start back hangin start back slangin
Rappin, sangin, system bangin
Ain't got no job ain't got no credit
But whatever you need i'll get it
(Chorus)
I've been hustlin (24-7, 365)
From dusk till dawn (all my life just tryna survive)
I've been hustlin (food stamps bus token plus G.R. check
For so long (underground rap tapes tryna get on deck)
I've been Hustlin Dusk till dawn (swerve them rocks)
I've been hustlin
For so long

Afro motha fuckin M A N
Tryna go to the top
Not the federal pen
But i'm in the ghetto
My problems won't let me go
Untill i go get some dough
Only legal things
I can do for snaps
Is program beats
And bust husla raps
Made my first cd started slanging it
The boys in the hood started bangin it
But i couldn't get rich on my side of town
So i jumped in the cadilac and moved around
To the ??Slathlaswane?? ??Kathaswalne??
Even goddinna tell me have u seen her
Dude named afroman from Palmdale
Sellin cd's in front of Sell-u-tell
Rap contest, partys, clubs, and bars
From a homeless bum to the grammies with stars
(Chorus)
I've been hustlin (24-7, 365)
From dusk till dawn (all my life just tryna survive)
I've been hustlin (food stamps bus token plus G.R. check
For so long (underground rap tapes tryna get on deck)
Hustlin Dusk till dawn (swerve them rocks)
I've been hustlin
For so long
You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly you're sighing sighs
You're thinkin' nothin's wrong
You string along, boy, then SNAP!

Those eyes, those sighs -
They're part of the tender trap

You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're actin' kind of smug
Until your heart just goes WHAP!

Those trees, that breeze -
They're part of the tender trap

Some starry night
When her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight
And you'll hate yourself for being single
And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwin' shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked
You're caught in the tender trap

Some starry night
When her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight
And you'll hate yourself for bein' single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwin' shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
It's too late now, there's no gettin' out -
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap

Oh right
Jimi:
"thank you"
Crowd:
"more! more! more! more!"
Announcer:
"ladys and gentlemen the jimi hendrix experience"
And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

[Verse 1]
Well, dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're making me feel, now
Well, I need some indication, girl, if all of this is real, now
Tell me girl now
Well, I've heard it said there's something wrong in my head, now
Got to help me, girl, now
Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

[Chorus/Outro]
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
Sparking my imagination
Got the lightning now
Cause me such excitation
Got the lightning now
'Bout to end my suffocation
Come on strike me now
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
She's back in my imagination
Look around you, art is everywhere, la, la, la-la
Look around you, art is everywhere, la, la, la
Look around you, art is everywhere, la, la, la-la

Take a walk and see the colors
(Pink flowers, green leaves)
Take a walk and see the shape
(Of buildings and cars)
It's everywhere, even there

Look around you, art is everywhere, la, la, la-la
Look around you, art is everywhere, la, la, la
Look around you, art is everywhere, la, la, la-la

Take a walk and see the colors
(Blue oceans are so deep)
Take a walk and see the shape
(Of grass and grains of sand)
It's everywhere, even there
Even there, everywhere
I'd sing you a song, without a word
Still you would hear my tune
I'd give you a day, without a time
So it won't end too soon

Anything, I would do
And that really is my point of view
If ever, my darling in my life
I ever had a chance to love you

I'd build you a world made of the dream
That dances on your head
Take a rainbow with colours bright
To hang over your head

Anything, I would do
And that really is my point of view
If ever, my darling in my life
I ever had a chance to love you

Fate's been waiting for the right time
To put us in each other's arms
But why should we sit and waste time
To start right now would do no harm
Give me a sign and I will show you
The magic of when I speak
Open your heart, let me come in
My love is yours to keep

Anything, I would do
And that really is my point of view
If ever, my darling in my life
I ever had a chance to love you

If I ever had a chance to love you
If I ever had a chance to love you
Take it, you can have it, what I got baby, I can't hold
And if you find the secret tell me how to build the mold
And I can't handle your problems so don't try to handle mine
Get yourself a shotgun, a pocketful of shells
And we can while away the time
Look up the wall, do it right, make a mistake
You're going to pay for it twice
But if you need it, got to have it get yourself
A shotgun and bring it back home
Look up the wall, you know you got to call
Before you start falling, get ready to fall
And if you fallin my direction
Don't expect no help at all.... Don't
Get it right, do it nice
And if you make a mistake, you're going to pay for it twice
But if you need it, got to have it get yourself
A shotgun and bring it back home
Look up the wall, you know you got to call
But if you start falling, be ready to fall
And if you fall in my direction
Don't expect no help at all, don't expect no help at all
Don't expect no help at all, and if you fall in my direction
Don't expect no help at all
I ain't givin' up no love this mornin'
I ain't givin' up love, no, I won't
She said, "I ain't givin' up no love this mornin'"
I ain't givin' up love at all

Covered up emotions
But I can't hide, oh, what it shows
Inside love double feelings
Runnin' hot and, oh, runnin' cold

No reason to make believe
You know how it's gonna be
Oh, this time around
Say just what you wanna say

But the feeling is gone away
'Cause you know what I'm feeling inside
I ain't givin' up no love this mornin'
I ain't givin' up love, no

She ain't givin' up no love this mornin'
She ain't givin' up love at all
Play the song
No reason to make believe
You know how it's gonna be
Oh, this time around
Say just what you wanna say
But the feeling is gone away

'Cause you know what I'm feelin' inside
I ain't givin' up no love this mornin'
I ain't givin' up love, no

She ain't givin' up no love this mornin'
She ain't givin' up no love at all
Oh!
You're so sexy, yo!

I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get your ass back home

We both knew this type of life didn’t come with instructions
So I’m trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact
When you call and I don’t know what city I’m in at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month

In a year I don’t recall
It’s like my life’s on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldn’t be long
That was last November, now December’s almost gone
I’d apologize but I don’t realize what I’m doing wrong
I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get your ass back home

And you’ve been nothing but amazing
And I never take that for granted
Half of these birds would have flew the coop
But you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me
Every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standing o ‘cause they’d a just been over it

Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don’t hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We’ll just drive by and keep waving

'Cause you and I above all that
Just let them wallow in it
Now they all choked up, yuck
'Cause they be swallowing it

I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get your ass back home
No one holds me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I keep doing this
We’ll be alright in the end
Trust that
We put the us in trust, baby
Let’s go

I don’t care what you’re after
As long as I’m the one, no
I don’t care why you’re leaving
You’ll miss me when you’re gone

I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get your ass back home

Ha ha
I'm home baby!

When they see Monique, I know they'll understand

Monique, Monique
I've hungered so for this
Monique, Monique
The magic of your kiss

Monique, Monique
Was Paris always there
Monique, Monique
I didn't know or care

But why am I dancing, my friends may well demand
I'll tell them Monique, Monique held my hand
When they see Monique, I'm sure they'll understand
I couldn't love you more
If time was running out
Couldn't love you more
Oh, right now baby

Take me by the hand, come on
Be my darling, be the one
I wouldn't want to lay or ever love with another
If everyone in the world
Could give me what I wanted
I wouldn't want for more than I have
I couldn't love you more if I tried

I couldn't love you more, boy
I couldn't love you more, boy

'Cause darling I'm on your side
I really am on your side
My love, I'm on your side
Oh, right now, baby
I couldn't love you more, boy
Stay exactly how your are
I couldn't love you more, boy
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love you more, boy
Stay exactly how you are
I couldn't love you more, boy
Couldn't love you more

If everyone in the world
Would give me their treasure
I would not want for more
Than I have right now
Hey baby, baby please set a date
Hey baby, baby please set a date
Well, don't say tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow is too far away

Now, when I want some lovin'
I really want it bad
But the way you've been doin' baby
You really makes me mad
Hey baby, baby please set a date
Well, don't say tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow is too far away

Now, when I want some lovin'
My face gets full of frowns
Now baby, if you don't hurry
I'm going to leave your town
Hey baby, baby please set a date
Well, don't say tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow is too far away
Now, when we first met, baby
We swore we wouldn't part
But the way you're doin' me lately
You're really breakin' my heart
Hey baby, baby please set a date
Well, don't say tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow is too far away
(Leon Wilkeson -- Ronnie VanZant)

I was born a travelin' man, that's all I'll ever be
Moving around from town to town is what makes me so free
My father was a trucker for the years of '23
On the day that I was born his blood was left to me
I'm a travelin' man
Travelin' Man -- that's what I am
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man
That's what I am

Travelin' man -- that's what I am
No woman puts a hold on me
You'll see me once or maybe twice
That's all you'll see of me
All you pretty women Lord, I hope you understand
Don't be a fool Lord no, and put your heart in a travellin' man
I'm a travelin' man
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man -- that's what I am
Travelin' Man
(Bridge)
Travelin' Man -- that's what I am
Guess I'll always be
Travelin' Man -- that's what I am
But at least I'm free

Travelin' man
Oh - that's what I am

Travelin' man -- that's what I am, Lord I move so fast
I have had so many women, none of them have last
I am just a mover, moving fast as sound
Always free, sometimes lonely. Always movin' around
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man -- that's what I am
Travelin' Man
Oh - that's what I am
I've had time to write a book about
The way you act and look
But I haven't got a paragraph
Words are always getting in my way
Anyway, I love you
That's all I have to tell you
That's All I've Got To Say
I held my baby last night, until everything was alright
I held my baby last night, until everything was alright
She woke up early this morning
She said baby, everything was alright

She said daddy daddy, please come back to me
Would you please come back to me
Daddy Daddy, love you baby
And I swear your love is free

Now here it's three o'clock in the morning
And my baby she ain't come home
(I'm gonna jump on you girl)
Yeah! No my baby she ain't come home!
Don't tell me nothing
I know that something is going on wrong

[Verse 1]
Marionette, your dress is all wet
Did someone leave you outside in the rain
Or is it the pain
That makes all the puppet tears
Roll down your cheek
Or does the roof leak?

[Verse 2]
Marionette, how could you forget?
I told you your bright shining varnish
Would peel
And how does it feel
With the bright rouge all faded and
The smile almost cracked
Now that you've come back?
Back to the toy shop by Brandenburg Gate
I hope not too late
'Cause my hands are much stiffer
Than they were when first I
Painted your eyes

[Verse 3]
Marionette, no you're not finished yet;
I'll mend you and make you like new
Paint your eyes blue
And make you as young as I was myself
And there on the shelf...
You'll sit till the Puppet Man
Comes round again
Time, Time is what you said that you were needing
Away from me, But I
I guess that I was too far in the distance to even see
That things between us now, just haven’t quite been the same
Can we figure out which one of us is to blame
Cuz I can't go on
And Ohh
Why are we pretending
Why are we just wasting time
On a love that isn’t real
Because if you don’t want me, You should just tell me now
So I can save these tears
You, You said that you would never ever hurt me
But I guess that was a lie
Cuz its killing me to watch you stay when I
I know this is goodbye
Its hard for me to think that maybe this is the end
You were my heart, baby you were my best friend
But we can't go on
And Ohh
Why are we pretending
Why are we just wasting time
On a love that isn’t real
Because if you don’t want me, You should just tell me now
So I can save these tears
We try to make it work but we just can’t make it last
We need to move on, stop living in the past
And I don’t even know how our love got so strange
It’s not the same
And Ohh
Why are we pretending
Why are we just wasting time
On a love that isn’t real
Because if you don’t want me, You should just tell me now
So I can save these tears
Let me save these tears
They woke you in the night
A glare from bright headlights
Sentry's in a row
You watched them from a front window
Through sleepy eyes you saw the scene
And felt as if a dream...
Had come to life

Caught by surprise
Protection in disguise
A high barricade
The price too high to pay
The late-night dancers filled the street
And stopped as if a dream...
Had come to life

A wail and a cry
Blue lights flashing by
In shadows of the trees
A zone runs in between
The young-boy soldiers filled the streets
And moved as if a dream...
Had come to life
Can it be a nightmare?
Will you wake and still be there?
So you try to run
Frightened you're the one
Left inside
Could'ya, for an ice cream sundae? Could'ya, for a smile or two?
Would'ya, say along about next Monday, keep a guy from feeling blue?
Could'ya, for big red apple? Could'ya, for a tootsie roll?
Would'ya, for some Philadelphia truffle, brighten up some lonely soul?
I don't wanna have the stars in the pocket, or ride a rocket to the moon
I just want what I want when I see what I want, and I hope I get it soon
Could'ya, for a peaceful valley? Could'ya, for the Zuyder Zee?
Would'ya for a honeymoon in Bali? Could'ya fall in love with me?
Baby, could'ya, would'ya take a chance on romance
Couldya, for a ripe tomato? Could'ya, for a place that's in?
Would'ya, for a bowl of sweet potato? Could'ya, for a leopard skin?
Could'ya, for a bright red tulip? Could'ya, for a ferris wheel?
Would'ya for Kentucky plate of juleps? Could'ya, for a home cooked meal?
I don't wanna have the stars in the pocket, or ride a rocket to the moon
I just want what I want when I see what I want, hope I get it soon
Could'ya, for a peaceful valley? Could'ya, for the Zuyder Zee?
Would'ya, for a honeymoon in Bali? Would'ya, should'ya, could'ya fall in love with me?
If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice come through the music?
Would you hold it near as it were your own?
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
Reach out your hand, if your cup be empty
If your cup is full, may it be again
Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men
There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go, no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall you fall alone
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home
New York
To that tall skyline I come
Flyin' in from London
To your door

New York
Lookin' down on Central Park
Where they say you should not wander after dark

New York
Like a scene from all those movies
But you're real enough to me
There's a heart
A heart that lives in New York

A heart in New York, a rose on the street
I write my song to that city heartbeat
A heart in New York, the love in her eyes
An open door and a friend for the night

New York
You've got money on your mind
And my words don't make a dime's worth of difference
So here's to you New York

[Verse 1]
One, two
I think I love you
You got ripped jeans
I'm only nineteen, what do you wanna do?
You got your cigarette
I got my headset
We're two of a kind
You're spades, and I'm diamonds
And you know that you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can see clearly that I am the one you want
But I must admit that I'm everything you're not

[Chorus]
Yeah, I am red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
When you're cold, I like to burn
I cut lines, you wait you turn
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

[Verse 2]
Don't shoot
My heart is on mute
Our physical dreams are only skin deep
How do you wanna groove?
Bang, bang
D'you hear my gun ring? (Oh, yeah)
You're mine, you're there, you'll hear that
I am all up inside your head

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you can see clearly that I am the one you want
But I must admit that I'm everything you're not

[Chorus]
Yeah, I am red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
When you're cold, I like to burn
I cut lines, you wait you turn
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

[Bridge]
You won't forget me when I'm gone
This feels so good, it can't be wrong
I'd recommend a one night stand
I know we're just friends, but you're my kind of man
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
Just for tonight

[Chorus]
Even though I'm red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
I know we could be great for tonight
When you're cold, I'll make it burn
You'll never have to wait your turn
Yeah, I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Yeah, I am red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
When you're cold, I like to burn
I'll cut lines, you'll wait your turn
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold:
"Peace on the earth, good will to men
From heaven's all gracious King."
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing

Still through the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world;
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing

And ye, beneath life's crushing load
Whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow
Look now! for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing:
O rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing!
For lo! the days are hastening on
By prophet bards foretold
When with the ever circling years
Comes round the age of gold;
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling
And the whole world send back the song
Which now the angels sing

For lo! the days are hastening on
By prophet seen of old
When with the ever circling years
Shall come the time foretold
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling
And the whole world send back the song
Which now the angels sing
Makin' love is good for you
Makin' love is good for you
Makin' love is good for you
Makin' love is good for you
So take care of your body
Make a little love today

Ain't nobody can live forever
It's just something that we all uderstand
But while you're young, y'all
We can make it better
If we take care of our bodies while we can

'Cause makin' love is good for you
Makin' love is good for you
So take care of your body
Make a little love today

Man and woman get together
Play the game and swear they're havin' fun
But if we make a little love
From the very start
What a lovely way to getto know someone
So makin' love is good for you
Makin' love is good for you
So take care of your body
Make a little love today

Let the wise man think about it
I'll just put my thinkin' all on the shelf
But if the good Lord made something
Better than love
I swear he must've kept it there for myself

Hey, makin' love is good for you
Makin' love is good for you
So take care of your body
Make a little love today

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Yeah, ladies tell me I'm too cute
And that translates that I'm too rich
They wanna spend the night at the crib
So they hit the club with two fits
We always be in VIP
And each playa got two chicks
They look at us like we live here
They look at y'all like "who's this"
We ain't trippin' about the media
Send 'em one of our platinum plaques
Matter fact
You can send picture of our middle fingers attached to that
All eyes (all eyes) on me (on me) (all eyes on me)
'Cause I'm the player all the haters wanna be (wanna be)

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Purple phantom, dip low
Blowin' out that purple smoke
Open up that closet door
Fresh shoes, fresh clothes
Private jets, taking trips
Ballin', mayne, spendin' chips
Give that girl a gold medal
The way she out there turning flips
Bend it over, that's what's up
Now shake it nasty, that's what's up
Girl, here's my number, that's what's up
Get at me, that's what's up
Man, you know we pimpin'

Man, you know we got them chicks in the pool skinny dippin'

I give her all my love
That's all I do
And If you saw my love
You'd love her, too
I love her

She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Miscellaneous
It's Fate, Baby, It's Fate
Betty: You better make your mind up not to stall with me;
Start playing ball with me
Your future isn't changeable or shapable
It's inescapable
If you should run to China, or toTurkey or Sweden
Or Earth or Venus or Mars
It wouldn't matter where you'd be
A force will pull you back to me
It's written in the stars
It's fate, baby, it's fate
And it's knocking at our door
It's fate, baby, and that's the reason
You're mine and I am yours
Don't wait, baby, don't wait
It'll happen anyhow
Don't wait, baby, don't do next season
What you can do right now
There's a plan for every woman and every man
Each was made for the other
Don't treat me like a brother
Too late, baby, too late
So accept your destiny
It's fate, baby, that you were meant to fall into love with me
(musical interlude)
I'm gonna start it out on my astrology, and phrenology
Frank: It does not matter that you are Aquarius, or Sagittarius
Or Gemini or Scorpio or Taurus the Bull, Capriconus or Pisces the fish
Betty: Winter, summer, spring or fall
As long as you were born at all, Mister, you're my dish
It's fate baby, it's fate
Frank: Can't I even put up a fuss?
Betty: It's fate, baby, the stars have written that you and me is Us
It's right, baby so right, I can see it in the stars
Don't fight baby, take off that mitten
For you and me is pars
Listen, Mac, it's all arranged in the Zodiak
Got you coming and going, hey bud, your future's showing
(Hahaha) Too late, baby, too late, there's feeling in this urge
It's fate, baby, so let's start buying towels marked His and Hers
Shh!

(Church girls)
You trying to leave here without us?
(Rooster)
Let me get a sample first

(Zora)
Keep your ass away from my husband
We've met before
In the same room of my imagination
And it gets so hard to deal with
Out strike temptation, yes it does
Yesterday in my mind
You were here but now we've parted
You need to come on back
And finish what we started, oh baby
I need to know

Who are you
And where did you come from
(Where did you come from, baby)
Who are you gonna give yourself to
And what are your plans
Tell me, baby
(I've really got to know now)
Who are you
And where are you going
Will you give yourself to me
Or some other man
I got to know, baby
You started what I thought
You intended to finish
You were right here yesterday
But today you vanished
When I woke up something told me
That I had been used
But I liked it
And when I couldn't find you
Lord, it gave me the blues
Now I really need to know

Who are you
And where did you come from
(And where did you come from, baby)
Who are you gonna give yourself to
Baby, what are your plans
Tell me, girl
Who are you
And where are we going
Will you give yourself to me
Or some other man, baby

Who are you, baby, who are you
Who are you, baby, who are you
I'd really like to know about you, baby
Who are you, baby
Where are we going
Where did you come from, baby . . 
Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long, I'm sitting
Singing songs for everyone
Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music
As she flies
Du, du, du, du
Find me in the field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daises, sing a lazy song
Beneath the sun
So tired
Soul searching
I followed sounds to a cathedral
Imagine my surprise to find that they were produced by Brian Eno

Past the gates
Quite stark
The roses trimmed and the windows dark
I see the walls through a limestone crack
Not red not blue not yellow but black
And all the spaces left for you
If the sky was synthesized you'd probably know

He taught me many things
The wisdom of O bleak stratagems
The prophet of a sapphire soul
Presented through creative freedoms
And everything I say is true
Cause if I was telling lies it'd probably show

I can tell that he's kind of smiling
But what does he know?
We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno
Brian Eno
When I was stuck he'd make me memorize elaborate curses
Tinctures and formulas to ditch the chori and flip the verses
My whole foundation came unglued
When I tried to humanize by ambient light

Dipping swords in metaphors yeah but what does he know?
We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno
Brian Eno

He promised pretty worlds and all the silence I could dream of
Brian Peter George St. John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno

Well, all alone by the oldest stone, where the shade trees grow
The creature by the water feature with a ghostly glow
Yeah, he's making sure that time's preserved well, we reap what we sow
We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno

Yeah, I can tell that he's doing well yeah, but what does he know?
I'm always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno
Yeah, he dips swords in metaphors, yeah, but what does he know?
I've never seen him plant a forest, 'cause I don't know Brian Eno, yeah

I can tell that he's trying to smile, but what does he know?
I'll always be a step behind him, he's Brian Eno
He's making sure that time's preserved well, we reap what we sow
I'm always one step behind him, 'cause I don't know Brian Eno

[Verse 1]
We're looking in the same direction
But you don't see what I see
Just a half moon in your perception
It looks full to me
Oh my head is caught, caught in clouds
But your buried so, so far down

[Chorus]
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way your pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down

[Verse 2]
Your words can pollute the future
So you should choose carefully
Cynical is a natural born killer
If it were up to me I would say
Lets get you all medicated
So we can get dedicated

[Chorus]
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down

[Bridge]
This is not a race
This is the relationship
But you take the cake at being the worst in it
Try and keep me grounded
You took my faith and nearly drowned it
This is not a test
This is the relationship
You are the best in being Mr. Negative
(You weigh me down)

[Chorus]
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down

[Outro]
You weigh me down (me down)
The world goes round
No one knows what it all means
You're still out there
Looking for a brand new scene
And I'm still here
Never have been hard to find
When new gets old
I'll be playing on your mind

When it all comes down, look for me
I'll still be around
When it all comes down, look for me
I'll still be around

The day will come when there's nothing new to see
And then you'll know here is where you want to be
You know my song used to take your heart away
That same old feel is gonna bring you back to stay

When it all comes down, look for me
I'll still be around
When it all comes down, look for me
I'll still be around
When red is bled and petals blue
And in my sleepless head our love's been dead a week or two
Sometimes good times are stuck inside of you
And then they're gone

But I don't know why
A lot of things have changed since we said goodbye
There were reasons for you to love me but I gave you none

So I tap my glass and nod my chin
And wonder who you've been in rhythm with

So time's just time, cars can't escape
When clouds are gray and close not often, too far away
And blue has no value, power or hue
Or open skies

Relationless
Carelessness is what I miss and that's how I think of you
Sometimes good times were all we had to do
So I tap my glass and nod my chin
And wonder who you've been in rhythm with
So I tap my glass and nod my chin
And wonder who you've been in rhythm with
I'm working day and night to find me my passage to write
I'm gonna get the next train going to be right by her side
Ooh oh ah Kitty just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no

I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back

I tried to phone her but the cable was broke by a storm
Now I won't see her till tomorrow when night meets the dawn
Ooh oh ah Kitty just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no

I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back

I'll buy her anything
A big fat car a diamond ring
If she will be my girl
I want her back I need you girl
I'm working day and night to find me my passage to write
I'm gonna get the next train going to be right by her side
Ooh oh ah Kitty just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no

I want my baby back, oh no
We grew tired of the water
We grew sleepy from the heat of the day
You broke your promises you said that we'd have fun
And all the rest you sent me here to stay

We been away
We been away
We been away yeah yeah
We been away

We're painted silly all red and black
She poured the whiskey down the sink
Caught our father cryin' now
We've chased him up the wall
It never even bothered us to think

We been away
We been away yeah
We been away yeah yeah
We been away
We been away
We been away
We been away yeah yeah
We been away

There's been hangin' in the kitchen
There's been talkin' 'bout things not to say
Goin' home now but that's no excuse
For anyone out there to want to stay

We been away
We been away
We been away yeah yeah
We been away

We been away
We been away
We been away yeah yeah
We been away
Lord I wonder, yes I wonder
Do my baby think of me
Oh, I wonder lord I wonder
Do my baby think of me
Now I wonder, Lord I wonder
Will my baby come back to me

Yes she been gone so long
Just can't stand it no more
Whoah she been gone so long
Just can't stand it no more
Now I ain't got nobody
Have no place to go

Yeah, I think when she left me
Yeah, she went to somebody else
Oh I think when she left me
Yeah she went to somebody else
Now if she don't come back to me soon
I think I'm gonna leave myself

[Verse 1]
I looked at the sun through filters
The heat had provoked lots of colours
I took off high like a feather
Blown to the ground on my shoulder

[Chorus 1]
You fell, are you ok? Do you need a hand?
I'm ok, let me go, go away, I'm all right
Leave me here, go back home, I'm ok, you just go

[Verse 2]
I could hear two sounds in the air
The leaving steps of a guilty sister
The other sound was the water
I leaned and looked into her river

[Chorus 2]
Thanks for the favour, the world little sister
I'm ok, I feel good, I can breathe, fill my soul
I'm ok, feeling good, why do I swim in blood?

[Verse 1]
I looked at the sun through filters
The heat had provoked lots of colours
Took off high like a feather
Blown to the ground on my shoulder

[Chorus 2]
Thanks for the favour, the world little sister
I'm ok, I feel good, I can breathe, fill my soul
I'm ok, feeling good, why do I swim in blood?

[Outro]
I'm ok, I feel good, I can breathe, fill my soul
(La la la la la, la la la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la la)
I'm ok, feeling good, why do I swim in blood?
(La la la la la, la la la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la la)

La la la la la, la la la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la, la la la la la
You've long been on the open road
You've been sleepin in the rain
From the dirt of words and mud of cell
Your clothes are smeared and stained
But the dirty words and muddy cells
Will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself
Till you are off again

So take off your thirsty boots
And stay for a while
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
I'm just lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes

But tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plain from field to town
Marching to be free
And of the rusted prison gates
That tumbled by degree
Like laughing children one by one
Who looked like you and me
Take off your thirsty boots
And stay for a while
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
I'm just lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down
The crooked rainbow trails
From dancing cliff-edged shattered sills
Of slender shackled jails
But the voices drift up from below
As the walls are being scaled
All of this and more my friend
Your song shall not be failed

Then take off your thirsty boots
And stay for a while
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
I'm just lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes
All this feels strange and untrue
And I won't waste a minute without you
My bones ache, my skin feels cold
And I'm getting so tired and so cold
The anger swells in my guts
And I won't feel these slices and cuts

I want so much to open your eyes
'Cause I need you to look into mine
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes

Get up, get out, get away from these liars
'Cause they don't get your soul or your fire
Take my hand, knot your fingers through mine
And we'll walk from this minute now
We can do what we like anywhere

I want so much to open your eyes
'Cause I need you to look into mine
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
All this feels strange and untrue
And I won't waste a minute without you

Honestly, honestly, honestly
Unless it hurts, why do it?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Oh

[Intro]
Now, young lady's been writing songs, well, since she came from Saskatchewan a few years ago. She writes them beautifully and she sings the beautifully, and she looks beautifully at the camera too. Here's Joni Mitchell, and here own song: "Just Like Me"

[Verse 1]
He's so independent
He acts like he couldn't care less for us all
He's someone's descendent, their child
But he'll never acknowledge their call
He's afraid to be loved
And I know he's afraid not to be
And he'll laugh and he'll cry
And someday he'll die
Just like me

[Chorus]
Just like me, he's settling a score
With a world that wants a reason every time you turn around
Just like me, he's looking for a door
Standing open, saying welcome, come and lay your troubles down
Just like me

[Verse 2]
I've seen him look hungry for someone
To tell him "You're doing just fine"
The songs that he's sung me
Have loneliness woven between every line
With no strings to hold him
I guess he could call himself free
Yes, he's free to be lonely and empty and wrong
Just like me

[Chorus]
Just like me, he's settling a score
With a world that wants a reason every time you turn around
Just like me, he's looking for a door
Standing open, saying welcome, come and lay your troubles down
Just like me

[Verse 1]
Since I lost you, I can't get through the day
Without at least one big boo-hoo
The pain won't go away
What am I gonna do?

[Chorus]
Man from Mars
This time you went too far

[Verse 2]
I fall apart every time I think of you
Swallowed by the dark
There is no center to my life now
No grace in my heart

[Chorus]
Man from Mars
This time you went too far

[Verse 3]
I call and call, the silence is so full of sounds
You're in them all
I hear you in the water
And the wiring in the walls

[Chorus]
Man from Mars
This time you went too far
I've got the key to the highway
Feel I got to go
Gonna leave here running
Walking is both too slow

I'm going back to the border
Baby where I'm better known
Because you haven't done nothing baby
But draw the good man from home

When the moon peeps over the mountain
Little girl I'll be on my way
I'm gonna roll the highway until the break of day

Oh give me one more kiss darling
Just before I go
Cause when I leave this time little girl
I won't be back no more

I've got the key to the highway
Little darling I got to go
I'm gonna leave here running
Walking is both too slow
Yeah
Uh, uh
Uh
Yeah
Yeah

There could be dark clouds up over me, yeah
Still I know I can stand tall, yeah
And I can be the only man in the middle of the sea
And still somehow I wouldn't feel small, no, no

Ever since I found you, baby, it's been my attitude, yes, it has
I wouldn't trade you for the world, uh-uh
If I bet my money on you, baby, I would never lose, no
'Cause you're my inspiration, girl
With you by my side, I believe

(Oh, I believe) I believe
(Oh, I believe) Yes, I
(I believe) I believe
(Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe
(Oh, I believe) I believe
(I believe) Yes, I
Now there could be a roadblock right in front of me, mmm
And it wouldn't be in my way, no
Even if they locked me up and threw away the key, yeah
Somehow I know it would be okay, yeah

'Cause ever since I met you, girl, I've been positive, oh, yes
You gave me a reason why, yes, you did
I kinda gave up on life, but now I wanna live, yeah
'Cause in the tunnel you were my light
And with you by my side, I believe

(Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe
(Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe, yeah
(I believe) I believe
(Oh, I believe) Woo...I
(Oh, I believe) I believe
(I believe) Oh, ho, I believe

And I remember when I wrote this song
It was at a time when I, I couldn't go wrong
But since I met you

(Oh, I believe) I believe
(Oh, I believe) Said I
(I believe) I believe
(Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe
(Oh, I believe) Yeah
(I believe) Yes, I, when the clouds are hanging over us, woo
(Oh, I believe) And the going's tough
(Oh, I believe) I
(I believe) I believe
(Oh, I believe) If we stand tall, yeah
(Oh, I believe) I believe, yeah
(I believe) I believe

(Oh, I believe) I believe, yeah
(Oh, I believe) I believe
(I believe) Oh, I believe
(Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe
(Oh, I believe) Whoa, oh, I believe
(I believe) I believe, Yes, I do

(Oh, I believe) If the mountain's too high and the valley's too low
(Oh, I believe) We can do all things
(I believe) If we believe
(Oh, I believe) Ho...whoa...I believe
(Oh, I believe) Hey...yea...ey...yea...
(I believe) Hey, I believe

(Oh, I believe) Said America
(Oh, I believe) America
(I believe) Ooh
(Oh, I believe)
(Oh, I believe)

Hi, have you ever wondered what it would be like to listen to some music?
Well this is your big chance
You see, music is much like a brocaded butterfly, with a shadowy promenade of effervescence, yet sloops down the bottom of misty mountains of darkness
Like a flirtatious flounder upon a non-reflecting mirror
God, what is this opaque window of comfort, that we cannot overcome?
It is a manifestation of love
It a forest of emptiness and it is an ocean with no water except where that which fills it
So as you listen to this masterpiece release yourself from the prison of captivity and let your soul free
Because only a free soul can be captured by greedy soul thieves
Who will have sold it to Leprechaun gold miners
But it is only when your soul is taken away, that you can take it back
And this my friend, does not make any sense whatsoever, or does it, no it does not
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you The Papercut Chronicles
I cannot believe what I do not understand
(it's just impossible to believe what I don't understand)
Understanding and belief should be connected
(understanding is the prime condition to faith)
Thouse who don't get it yet believe are hypocrites
(those who do not understand yet say they believe are hypocrites
Anything which is beyond the limits of human reason is illusion, illusion, illusion)

You have done me no service no you have not helped me
(all you did was confuse but not enlighten my mind)
Therefore I owe you not gratitude but hatred
(nature is vice as much as it is virtue, maybe everything derives from one first cause or:a trillion times as much as it might mean to you...
In which there is neither reason nor wisdom, nor wisdom)

It is amusing to see to what extravagent length
(man has taken fanaticism and imbecility to)
Excesses so unspeakable, unbearable
(the catalog of aberrations is invariably fascinating to contemplate, all we need from morality is contained in those words; make others happy as you yourself would be, and serve them in the way
You would yourself be served, the sole requirement is a good heart, a good heart, a good heart)
By Bob Dylan

Denise, Denise
Gal, what's on your mind?
Denise, Denise
Gal, what's on your mind?
You got your eyes closed
Heaven knows that you ain't blind

Well, I can see you smiling
But oh your mouth is inside out
I can see you smiling
But you're smiling inside out
Well, I know you're laughin'
But what are you laughin' about

Well, if you're tryin' to throw me
Babe, I've already been tossed
If you're tryin' to throw me
Babe, I've already been tossed
Babe, you're tryin' to lose me
Babe, I'm already lost
Well, what are you doing
Are you flying or have you flipped?
Oh, what are you doing
Are you flying or have you flipped?
Well, you call my name
And then say your tongue just slipped

Denise, Denise
You're concealed here on the shelf
Denise, Denise
You're concealed here on the shelf
I'm looking deep in your eyes, babe
And all I can see is myself
You can lead a horse to water
But you can't make him drink
You can send a kid to college
But you can't make him think
You'll never miss your water, baby
Till the well runs dry
And you'll never miss me, baby
Till I say good-bye
Mm hm, you'd better heed my warning

The straw that broke the camel's back
Didn't have to be so big
And when you ran off and left me, baby
I almost blew my wig
They say he who has the last laugh
Always laughs the best
And I'm gonna laugh louder, baby
Than all the rest
Mm hm, baby, you'd better heed
You'd better heed my warning

If you want me to get out, baby
You know you don't have to push
But you'll find a bird in hand
Is worth two in the bush
There's no need to lock the barn door
When the cow is gone
But you're gonna miss me, baby
On some frosty dawn
Mm hm, you know you'd better heed
You'd better heed my warning
It's a long, long road
That don't have a turn
You have to be an early bird
If you wanna catch a worm
They say absence makes
The heart grow fonder
So its plain to see
If the grass look greener yonder
Baby, that's where I'm gonna be
Mm hm, baby, you know you'd better heed
You'd better heed my warning
After the rain goes, people see rainbows
But I see rainbows when it storms above
So darling, is it any wonder I can laugh at thunder
Walkin' in the sunshine of your love

Ten below zero, I'm such a hero
I never wear a muffler or a glove
While all the world have frosty noses, I'm knee-deep in roses
Walking in the sunshine of your love

Just so you know dear, I'm gonna tell you
Your smile's my golden umbrella
Even the rain-out, trouble and pain out of my heart
And from the very start

Your tender affection in my direction
Was like a lovely blessing from above
That's why I go around just beaming, wondering if I'm dreaming
Walkin' in the sunshine of your love

After the rain goes, people see rainbows
But I see rainbows while it storms above
So baby, is it any wonder I can laugh at thunder, yeah
Walkin' in the sunshine of your love
Ten below zero, man I'm a hero
I never wear a muffler or a glove
While all the world got big red noses, I'm knee-deep in roses
Walkin' in the sunshine of your love

Just so you know dear, I'm gonna tell you
Your smile's my golden umbrella
Even the rain-out, trouble and pain out of my heart
And from the very start

Your affection in my direction
Was like a lovely blessing from above
That's why I go around just beaming
Wondering if I'm dreaming
I'm walkin', walkin' in the sunshine of your love

Yeah baby, you keep me nice and warm, yeah
I do not talk, I am just a rapper

Nigga, I'm the capper
Rapper slash not actor
Cause I could never act the part of being fakey
You should really thank me
Who else would do this shit?
All that fucking wishing and waiting

These niggas are mistakin
You don't speak my language
Dressed like Ma cambridge
Bowtie make me muslim
Switch for suspenders

Clickin through our hyperbeast
Tom Brown, Hells Bells, Kitsune, Jay L

I don't wear your shirt unless it got a logo
Now it's to go out and walk around soho
All high schools showing out, Pay less
Man fuck that, yo I earned this
I love clothes

Go to top man
That's the hot spot
Check Kayne's blog for the high tops
Check shake appeal lookbook right quick
They hooking up with ambush, that's it
Spare a top cider with a black trim
Pink leather jacket, gotta get him
New t-shirt and I put it all
On a charge card
Burning through my go yard
And it's so dumb, but it's so tight
Ain't nothing like new shoes every night
And it feels so good in the new jeans
And the new shirt, it's addicting
I'm an addict

I don't want help, I'm a die in my brand new Louis belt
But not Louis, it's too gaudy
Check the lime green frames this girl bought me
Billionaire boys club, I'm living it
One shirt, eight dubs
I'm spending it
Got shoes that I know I won't wear
And the problem is I don't really care
Got money, but nothing is forever
Every time I gotta buy I new sweater
By 211 I'll be dead broke
I'll be the homeless dude in a peacoat
I rode in to Nazareth, was feeling about half past dead
I just need someplace where I could lay my head
I said, "Hey mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand and "No" is all he said
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (and, and,) you put the load (push the load) right on me

She said, "I gotta go but my friend can stick around."

Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (and, and,) you put the load (push the load) right on me
Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog

He said, "That's OK, boy, won't you feed him when you can."

Who sent me here with her regards for everyone
Take a load off Fanny

His moms and pops met in Compton
His pops was a Nutty Blocc Compton Crip
Moms was from South Central, she claimed Hoover
They had the lil nigga in 1979 at Martin Luther King hospital
And if you know anything about Killa King, you know this:
Being born there is just like dying there
Lord I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too
If I clean up sweet mama
Can I stay all night with you?
Lord, I went to my window, babe I couldn't see through my blinds
Went to my window, babe I couldn't see through my blinds
Heard my best friend coming around
I thought I heard my baby cry
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby then just let me sit down in your door
If I can't come in here baby then just let me sit down in your door
And I would leave so soon
That your man won't never know
How can I live here baby, Lord and feel at ease ?
How can I live here baby, Lord and feel at ease ?
Well, that woman I got, man
She do just what she feels
Lord you shouldn't mistreat me, baby because I'm young and wild
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild
You must always remember
Baby, you was once a child
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning, if I have to ride the blind
Leaving in the morning, if I have to ride the blinds
Well, I've been mistreated
And I swear, I don't mind dyin'

[Verse 1: Dennis Edwards]
Well, he specializes in talkin' trash
Carries himself like the world's biggest spender
But he ain't never got no cash
The clothes he wears are second to none
He's a Jack of all trades and a master of none
Agrees with everything he knows nothin' about
So he doesn't feel left out
Secondary all the things in life he really wants
Being in is his thing
So he's got to keep up his front

[Chorus: The Temptations]
Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can
Plastic man
Trvin' to get over any way he can

[Bridge: Dennis Edwards, Melvin Franklin, Damon Harris]
Let me tell you about him
He's a, he's a, he's a self-preservationist, yes he is
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah
And a super-conversationalist, yes he is
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, he always borrows, never lends
He says, "Get off me, man! I'm with him, let me in!"
Says he's willing to stick through thick and thin
But when the chips are down
People find him if you can
(Plastic man)
Claim to fame he has none
Friends in this world, maybe one
He hates being just another face in the crowd
Giving another brother five and talkin' loud

[Chorus: The Temptations]
Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can
Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can

[Bridge]
I guess you know he does a little, uh, dippin' and dabbin'
In a game they call backstabbin' (Plastic man)
You better stop your fantasizin'
And start, buh-buh-boom-boom, to realizin' that
Black is black and white is white
Wrong is wrong, hey, and right is right

[Chorus: The Temptations]
Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can
Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can
Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can
Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be round my vegetables
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vega-table

[Verse 1]
If you brought a big, brown bag of them home
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot

[Chorus]
I'm gonna keep well my vegetables
Cart off and sell my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vega-table

[Verse 2]
I tried to kick the ball but my tennie flew right off
I'm red as a beet 'cause I'm so embarrassed

[Hook]
(Mom and daddy says)
Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
(Wordless vocals and sound effects)

[Verse 3]
I threw away my candy bar and I ate the wrapper
And when they told me what I did I burst into laughter

[Hook]
(Mom and daddy says)
Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)

[Bridge]
I know that you'll feel better
When you send us in your letter an'
Tell us the name of your
Your favorite vega-table

I know that you'll feel better
When you send us in your letter an'
Tell us the name of your
Your favorite vega-table

[Instrumental Outro]

[T.I. Talking]
I got a question fo you hatin ass niggas out there,Ay
Why you mad at me,Ay
Oh lame ass nigga why you mad at me
Sucka ass nigga why you mad at me

[Verse 1]
Remember late nights earn stripes servin straight white
Talk shit slap box clear into the day light
Might fuss may fight but stay tight
Keep what the "J" need for the lighter hit the base pipe
If the trap was the ocean or the sea
You could consider me and them the killa whales and great whites
Befo a nigga tried to click it make them think twice
Cause they knew Cap would kill a nigga fo blink twice
Day right I'm recitein my life
Nigga I was there no matter what through sirens on a silent night
Cold sundays slow mondays hot friday nights
Tuesday thursdays servin whether or not they ride tonight
On peaceful days hostful evenings even violent nights
Chip on my sholder hold a grudge cause you can die tonight
I swear you niggas had no idea what my life was like
Befo the bright lights and a half a mil just to grab the mic

[Chorus]
Is it cause I came from the bottom to the top
Why you mad at me
Maybe cause I Spent a hundred on a drop
Why you mad at me
Is it cause I kept it pimpin and stayed down
Why you mad at me
Or is it cause I am the a town
Why you mad at me
Is cause you a lame and I'm a "G"
Why you mad at me
Is it cause I got love in the streets
Why you mad at me
Is cause you know yo time runnin out
Why you mad at me
Is it cause you know I'm king of the south

[Verse 2]
Niggas mad cause I got it like this

Gold on my wrist hoes on my dick, my dick
But I could give a f**k about this industry
I'm a be the same tip til the end of me
Thats something you know automatically if you a friend of me
Question that will think other wise now you offend me
I came in this game not looking for a friend or enemy
Found them both now that niggas in to me
Got little rap niggas liking into me
Major lables and police want to censor me
Feds on my ass cause I'm in the streets
Think I still slang listen to lame niggas who lie to snitch on me
It ain't my fault that you can't piture me
Ridein in a phatom and I swear I never favthom
All the fame that a nigga can gain from atlanta
Now I'm just tryin to maintain for atlanta
Befo niggas would say in atlanta
I was rhode park doug high stayed in atlanta
Now true enough I sold yay in atlanta
But is that compared to contributions I made to atlanta

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
A pick a reason any reason all excuses would do
But man you lucky I ain't buckin like I used to do fool
While you was throwin one's and two's
I was liftin up tools and then
Shoot at his shoes just to see if he move
Or either bust at his head to check if he dead man
Don't talk around cause I heard he the fed's man
They offer him time and they knowin he scared and tell him
Give me they names or you doin the stretch man
Or wear a wire go record what he said
And then you can tell his lawyer that his clients a dead man
A rat I'm smellin blow I ain't sellin
Where you got that impressin ain't no tellin
Yes I'm a felon why was that in question
What about all these records I'm sellin
I'm bankhead born and bankhead bread
And when a nigga die I'm gone be bankhead dead

[Chorus]
So long, babe
I'm running out of time
I'll never forget ya
You bless this heart of mine

Homeward bound
And you lay sound asleep
Lost and found
These memories I keep

I've got dreams to remember
They're all about a love in September
Dreams to remember
Burning like a glow of an ember
They're all about you

Yesterday calls like
Some enchanted star
I reach up to grab
But it's no easy mark
Sweet and low
I land back on my feet
Romeo will have your soul to keep

I've got dreams to remember
They're all about a love in September
Dreams to remember
Burning like a glow of an ember
They're all about you

I've got dreams to remember
They're all about a love in September
Dreams to remember
Burning like a glow of an ember
Dreams to remember

Sometimes, you have got to be ten feet tall

It's gonna keep on going on by
Going by

'Cause time keeps on by
Na, na, na

Whoa-oh it goes on by
Keep on rolling
Keep on rolling

It's going on
Keep on going
Keep on going, babe
Now, now, now, now
Keep on going now
Keep on going by

Well you may want to stop it babe
And you can't turn it around
Well you may want to turn it up babe
But you sure can't turn it down
You gotta slow down a little bit girl
Keep on rolling by
Keep on rolling by
Keep on rolling by
Time keep on going by
Ain't a thing you can do now
Just keep on going with it
And just stay on top of it for a little while
For a little while
Just for a little while
Just for a little while

You need to stop playing 'round with all them clowns and the wankstas
Good girls gotta get down with the gangsta's
Go 'head girl, put some back and some neck up on it
While I stand up in the background and check up on it

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Ooh, boy, you looking like you like what you see

Ooh, you watchin' me shake it, I see it in ya face
Ya can't take it, it's blazin', you watch me in amazement
You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it

More patience, you take my get you in more places

[Verse 4: Slim Thug]
I'm checking on you boo, do what you do
And while you dance, I'ma glance at this beautiful view
To keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue 'em with glue
I'm in a trance, all eyes on you and your crew
Me and my man's don't dance, but to feel y'all bump and grind
It won't hurt if you gon' try one time
They all hot, but let me see, this one's mine
It's Slim Thuga and DC outta H-Town

[Chorus: Beyoncé]

[Intro]
Oww!
Scream one more time
Scream, scream one more time
I bet you can't--
Oww!
Bless my soul, save my name
I ain't never goin' down to the daisy chain!

[Verse 1]
Just a young man tryin' to feel the flow
(Flow, flow, flow)
Had no idea what the chain is for
(No idea, No idea)
The nashing of the teeth and bloodshed thighs
(Yeah, yeah)
Cop a teeny whiplashed, but still he tries

Bless my soul, save my name
I ain't never going down to the daisy chain!
Black girl givin' it up
White girl givin' it up
Black girl givin' it up
White girl givin' it up
Tell me now what's on the stereo
Funky like a junkie with corn rows
That's why your behind's so narrow
(So narrow)
Switchen numbers with the video
Leave ya with a headache, no more fame
I ain't never going down you the daisy chain!
Black girl givin' it up
White girl givin' it up
Black girl givin' it up
White girl givin' it up

Girls gonna keep on givin' it up
A mouse to the trap, the cheese is up
A little bit of pleasure for the guilty pain
Think about it sister, now you're livin' in shame...
Gots no hips 2 vibrate
(Mm mm)
That's why you gets no page
Everyone of y'all suspect
I takes no blame
(takes no blame)
I writes no cheques
(no cheques)
I ain't never going down to the daisy chain!
I ain't never going down to the daisy chain!(repeat)
(Black girl givin' it up)
(White girl givin' it up)(repeat x 2)
Ahoo, ooh ooh ooh
Ahoo, ooh ohh ooh
(Daisy chain)
Ahoo, ooh ohh ooh
(Givin' it up)
Ahoo, ooh ohh ohh
I knew a dancer, her name was Kelly
Nickname Candy with a hoop through her belly
A tongue ring with a voice to sing
With a body like whooo, dime peace, everything
See I used to deliver pizza to her house
But tonight she said, "Yo, Come in and chill out"
I came in, sat down, I was lookin' around
What I found, I found she was steppin' out a gown
I had to stop that girl in her tracks
I said let me tell you something by a guy that raps
Yo, why buy U if he can just lease you
Why iron you if he can just crease you
Why try you if he won't breed you
Why drive through if he won't eat you
Why V.I.P. you if he can nose bleed you
Ok, stop cryin'
I'm sorry, I'll leave U
Daisy chain
Daisy chain
Daisy chain
Daisy chain
Daisy chain

Make your hip vibrate
Make your hip vibrate
Make your hip vibrate
Make your hip vibrate
Make your hip vibrate
Make your hip vibrate
Make your hip vibrate
Daisy chain
Leave you with a headache, daisy chain
Daisy chain
I ain't never, never, ever goin' down to the daisy chain
(Laughter to fade)
The sun goes down and says goodnight
Pull your covers up real tight
By your bed we'll leave a light
To guide you off to dreamland

Your pillow's soft, your bed is warm
Your eyes are tired when day is done
One more kiss and you'll be gone
On your way to dreamland

Every sleepy boy and girl
In every bed around the world
Can hear the stars up in the sky
Whispering a lullaby

Who knows where you'll fly away

Winging past the light of day
The Man-in-the-Moon and the
Milky Way
Welcome you to dreamland
Every sleepy boy and girl
In every bed around the world
Can hear the stars up in the sky
Whispering a lullaby

Who knows where you'll fly away
Winging past the light of day
The Man-in-the-Moon and the
Milky Way
Welcome you to dreamland

[Verse 1]
The cats are in the flower bed. a red hawk rides the sky
I guess I should be happy just to be alive
But we have poisoned everything and oblivious to it all
The cell phone zombies babble through the shopping malls

[Chorus 1]
While condors fall from Indian skies
Whales beach and die in sand
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan

[Verse 2]
You cannot be trusted, do you even know you're lying?
It's dangerous to kid yourself, you go deaf and dumb and blind
You take with such entitlement, you give bad attitude
You have no grace, no empathy, no gratitude

[Chorus 2]
You have no sense of consequence
Oh, my head is in my hands
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan

[Bridge]
Before that altering apple, we were one with everything
No sense of self and other, no self-consciousness
But now we have to grapple with our man-made world backfiring
Keeping one eye on our brother's deadly selfishness

[Verse 3]
Everyone's a victim, nobody's hands are clean
There's so very little left of wild Eden Earth so near the jaws of our machines
We live in these electric scabs, these lesions once were lakes
No one knows how to shoulder the blame or learn from past mistakes

[Chorus 3]
So who will come to save the day?
Mighty Mouse, Superman?
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan
You're out there with friends
Going club to club
I see you almost every night
I watch you dance every every dance
Men lined up left and right
I hear you telling stories
'Bout your habits and your lies

You paint a pretty picture
Deception's quite an art
Just one look in your party face
And I can see a broken heart
I can see a broken heart

You wear your smile
Just a little too tight
Flirt too much with the band
You laugh and sing just a little too loud
Like a woman who's just lost her man
You're act is quite convincing
But loneliness leaves clues
You paint a pretty picture
Deception's quite an art
Just one look in your party face
And I can see a broken heart
I can see a broken heart

I can see a thousand heartaches
Hidden in your spell
And the hurt behind the sad blue eyes
I've been there
I've had my own high times
Yes I've had my falls
I can hear a lot of words
But that picture says it all

You paint a pretty picture
Deception's quite an art
Just one look in your party face
I can see a broken heart

You paint a pretty picture
Deception's quite an art
All I can see in your party face
I can see your broken heart
Ain't nothing but a party babe
Mmmm
You got your men lined up left and right
Hey
I hear you telling stories about your happy life
Hey hey hey
I can see your broken heart
Intro, the maestro
Nice flow, hot like nitro
Cool as ice though
That type of docodimy
Y'all know it's gotta be
Who else could it be, but me
Rub your eyes but hold the big billy
It's dream supreme bean straight from philly
It's the eclectic female attractor
Rapper slash actor, right back at ya
And to the next millinium
Many come but few are chosen
See me servin' like the u.s. open
Another type of hustler, listed at blockbuster
Go and ask a movie usher
Who is he, he or she, sfp, movies, cd's, and tv's
But uh uh, 'cause the day i take a break from that
As i rule where a tank of gas take me at
I used to rock these, red, i rock z's
Now i rock the mb's, with twelves and v's
Today sun high, up in the sky, from ny
La la, to mi
Just cruisin' where, baby, i don't care
Just cruisin' as long as you take me there
Just cruisin' somewhere to clear my mind
Just cruisin' just cruisin'

Easy wrote a sixty
Flossin' ninety degrees
Sony cartridges, ten cd's each
Reach to the beach
South side leanin'
It ain't often i'm off and i'm feelin' for the top down, drop down
Got me hot now heated up can't stop now
What up cutie what sure sure is cooking now
Yo i know, i'm spoken for can't hurt lookin', no
Pop cd's, b.i.g.'s, and tupac's
While cruisin' on the blocks
Hittin' the hot spots
Got my celly on o-f-f
Golden arches got my belly goin' oh yes yes
So let's just ease on down, ease on down the road
No pager roll my hip
As i'm rollin' my whip
'cause today i'm on the solo creek
Man, why you think i be workin' so hard all week?

I'm just cruisin' where, baby, i don't care
Just cruisin' as long as you take me there
Just cruisin' somewhere to clear my mind
Just cruisin' just cruisin'
Just cruisin' where, baby, i don't care
Just cruisin' as long as you take me there
Just cruisin' somewhere to clear my mind
Just cruisin' just cruisin'

Sun settin' in the s-k-y
Must say i've had the best day i
Tryin' to find an exit
A place to chill not to hectic
So i can spend some time with will
Let the sun shine to the moonlight clearin' my mind
Soul search, see what i find
If i'm being the best lover and friend
Am i being the best daddy i can?
I pray i am
And i feel good today
Reminiece as i'm cruisin' around the way
Roll tight passed the park where i used to play
Can't think of a better way to spend my day
Uh, still findin' my way
Still growin', petrol rowin', move soon showin'
Gots to get goin' losing the light
And the freaks come out at night

Just cruisin' where, baby, i don't care
Just cruisin' as long as you take me there
Just cruisin' somewhere to clear my mind
Just cruisin' just cruisin'
I'm just cruisin' where, baby, i don't care
Just cruisin' as long as you take me there
Just cruisin' somewhere to clear my mind
Just cruisin' just cruisin'
Hey you got hair, long an' black
Hangin' down in the middle of your back
Don't you cut it off whatever you do
I need it to run my fingers through

'Cause you're my baby
Ah-ah, you're my sugar
Yeah drive me crazy
Little wooly booger

Well I got a guitar, got six strings
And a guitarpick that a-make 'em ring
Every string got a note or two
That I'm gonna use to serenade you

'Cause you're my baby
Ah-ah, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe
Little wooly booger

Well I got a dollar that I saved
Saved it up for a rainy day
Everybody's callin' for bills that's due
And if they don't catch me, I'll spend it on you
'Cause you're my baby
Ah-ah, you're my sugar
Drive me crazy
Little wooly booger

Well I had me a gal, she said she's mine
But she run around on me all the time
Now she's gone I'm glad we're through
'Cause I-I'm plum-guggled-eyed over you

'Cause you're my baby
Ah-ah, you're my sugar
Yeah don't mean maybe
Drive me crazy
Don't mean maybe
Little wooly booger
It's the last dance, we've come to the last dance
They're dimming the lights down, they're hoping we'll go
It's obvious they're aware of us, the pair of us
Alone on the floor
Still I want to hold you like this forever and more

It the last song, they're playing the last song
The orchestra's yawning, they're sleepy I know
They're wondering just when will we leave, but till we leave
Keep holding me tight
Through the last dance, each beat of the last dance
And save me the first dance in your dreams tonight
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
From the other direction, she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion but I might as well try, might as well try

She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls

In the heat of the evening when the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches and was closing the door
I had one of those flashes, I'd been there before, been there before

Well, I ain't often right but I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way it does in this song
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

Well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
I had to learn the hard way, I had to let her pass by, let her pass by
Wind in the willow's playing "Tea For Two"
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing in the heart of gold band, heart of gold band

Long distance runner
What you standing there for?
Get up, get up
Get out of the door

You're playing cold music
On the barroom floor
Drowned in your laughter
And dead to the core

There's a dragon with matches
That's loose on the town
Take a whole pail of water
Just to cool him down

Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain

Almost ablaze
Still you don't feel the heat
It takes all you got
Just to stay on the beat
You say it's a living
We all gotta eat
But you're here alone
There's no one to compete

If mercy's in business
I wish it for you
More than just ashes
When your dreams come true

Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain

Long distance runner
What you holding out for?
Caught in slow motion
In a dash for the door

The flame from your stage
Has now spread to the floor
You gave all you had
Why you wanna give more?

The more that you give
The more it will take
To the thin line beyond which
You really can't fake
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Those cotton fields were hot
And that tractor never was my kind of livin'
And when I hit sixteen
I had my size and I hit the road to freedom

And I'm glad I wasn't there to see my Momma
'Cause she must've cried for hours
I still hear her sayin' to me
"Get your guitar and pick the 'Wildwood Flower'"

Now Memphis was big
And it was hard to find a job and so I didn't
And it was easier to go back to the country
And it was more like livin'

Now, I've been down every road
And I've stood on every porch where they were givin'
And if they had a dime on an hour
I would pick the 'Wildwood Flower'

It's hard to turn around
And look back down the roads that I have traveled
'Cause like a never endin' ball of twine
My dreams have come unraveled
Now as evening lays its shawl
Across the shoulders of my life, I find
I couldn't tie my life together
With guitar strings and a poet's heartfelt mind

And I'm glad I wasn't there to see my Momma
'Cause she must've cried for hours
I still hear her saying to me
"Get your guitar and pick the 'Wildwood Flower'"

Play it like this, son
Someday some morning sometime, sometime
I'd like to hold your hand in mine
Someday some morning sometime

I'd like to tell you you're pretty and fine
Your face will smile and your eyes will shine
Someday some morning sometime

I'll build you a house all covered in vines
I'll bring you a nickel, I'll bring you a dime
Someday some morning sometime

Five six seven and eight oh nine
I'll take you down where the birds fly by
Someday some morning sometime
Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby you're the best

I wasn't looking but somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me, the spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

And nobody does it better
Sometimes I wish someone would
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why'd you have to be so good

The way that you hold me, whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from running, but just keep it coming
How'd you learn to do the things you do

And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Baby, baby
Baby you're the best
Baby you're the best
Baby you're the best
Baby you're the best
Once there was a fellow and his name was Buzz
He was just a rookie cop, just a baby Fuzz
He patroled the Sunset Strip in the land of the free and the home of the hip
He protected you and me until he met a girl called Alice D

Alice was the girl that all the hippies dread
And they called her sweet Alice the head
Alice it was plain to see, was full of pot and LSD
She'd attract a great big crowd, because her inner piece was much too loud

Good Buzz did the thing that good Fuzz must
Stuck his gun in Alice's back and said "This is a bust"
Shone the flashlight in her eyes, she began to hypnotise
Buzz said "What a wild sensation, guess this must be hallucination"

Love is so sensational, when you fall in love with eyes dilational
Now they're taking pills in shops, Buzz is not afraid of Watts
Buzz and Alice D have shown the way of where the fuzz might be some day
Buzz is still a cop of course, he's the pusher on the porch
He's protecting you and me from evil women like poor Alice D

[Intro: Drake]
(And Imma leave on one more note
One more motherfucking note

Cut the lights off I feel fantastic right now baby...

[First Verse: Drake]
I said I used to cut the porch lights on and now I cut the porches lights on just to let them know their foresight's wrong

Oh me Oh my them girls love me like Seth Cohen
So get a grip get a glass pour the XO in

Pick a road cause where you driving is not a lane
And rest in peace to Pimp C life is not a game
Taking over the world no Pinky just a lot of Brain
He bout to send them the shit that I'm on (Yeah)
You probably could have predicted I'm on (Yeah)
My sense of judgment's a officially gone
Up into the air all the smoke from the swisher is blown
Ahh... I'm grown, I'm grown, I'm living in this elevator zone alone
I'm up so high, I'm never coming down and you say you got them hoes but they never coming 'round
I got penthouse bars I stay high above your ass
And I can see it all, my balcony is glass
And wifey's over (Bitches)
But money's over (Her)
Cause money's under (Nothing)
My life is such a (Blur)
That's not the way it has to go that's just what I prefer

Even when I fucking die they're going to bury me alive...

[Hook: Drake]
And I'm so prestigious

Stop the violence, how when every blind is like the motherfucking Watts riots pouring out my pen
Alright then be easy I'm a get back
Gentleman with a superlative use of syntax
And I done gave up the narcotics but I can't leave the crib without some Xanax in my water... (Nope)
Hello my name is Travie and I'm a lifeaholic
Told'em all these beats is like the Wallace to my Gromitt... (Ha)
The alpha to my Bruce Wayne, stripes on my candy cane
Worn without the other so for real without the candy brain
Super trooper like a gun tote in candyman
Ask me how I'm living bet I tell ya fine and dandy man
Check his vital signs they peaking off the meter man
Imma live forever in Neverland with Peter Pan
Fuck pulling the nine out

Sipping Purple Rain with Mary Jane girls in my house... (My House)
Isaiah I'm a see ya when I get there
Until then hold me down like gravity it's Travie, Uno, Easy

Ha I'm bout to overdose on life somebody please pass the weed

If the things that I seen through my Prada frames got me paid
Watch me man, I'm cocky slave with this Rocky chain

And this name of it is fame and it's all up in my blood
Trying to suppress the too fresh feeling I got... Oooh yes

Leaving with a bruised neck then I yell whose next... (Next)

Hung out with celebrities from every drug house

Will I ever find the girl on my mind, the one who is my ideal
Maybe she's a dream, and yet she might be
Just around the corner waiting for me

Will I recognize the light in her eyes, that no other eyes reveal
Or will I pass her by and never even know that she is my ideal
A red sun came rolling down a grey sky
And the frogs and dogs and night birds then
Started up singing sweet country lullaby
You see that patch of city lights-
Somewhere in there's cotton avenue-
That's where i'm going to take myself tonight
With a spit shine on my dancing shoes

If you got a place like that to go
You just have to go there
If you got no place special
Well then, you just go no place special

I guess it's just the summer in the young blood
Ripe and juicy in the young blood
Teasing to go down to ...
Cotton avenue
To hear the shiny shiny music
See all the shiny people dancing to it
Anytime you go to ...
Cotton avenue
If you got a place like that to go
You know you got to go there
If you got no place special
Well then, you just go no place special

You see that summer storm brewing in the southern sky
By the time it hits here i'll be dancing high and dry
To rhythm and blues
On cotton avenue
Poor boys'll be hanging around outside in the street
They got all the latest words
They're dancing to the latest beat
While they're hustling and sizing you
On cotton avenue

If you got a place like that to go
You just have to go there
If you've got no place special
Well my dear
You just so no place ... special

[Verse 1]
Don't send me away (Don't send me away)
I've hurt you it's true
Don't close the door (Don't close the door)
I'll make it up to you
'Cause you know that I need your, your wonderful love
Whoa

[Verse 2]
Don't send me away (Don't send me away)
I may have been wrong
But please let me stay (Please let me stay)
Here, where I belong
Darling, you know that I need your, your wonderful love
(I need) I need your love (your love)

[Bridge]
Dear, through all my days of mine, I need your love
Dear, through every phase of mine, I need you love
Everyday and in every way
Hmmm

[Verse 3]
Don't send me away (Don't send me away)
For I surely be lost
I'm willing to pay (Willing to pay)
My life as the cost
'Cause you know that I (need your love)
Oh, you know I do (I need your love)
Oh, I'll cherish you (I need your love)
Oh, don't be cruel (I need your love)
Sitting at the corner of the heart of Paris
Noting the relative common lack of movement
Where is the noise confusion, bustle and hazard
That one would associate with the big city?

Yes, it is clean, those ways of napping, of control and policing

Hundred percent, ordered and safe
I was so lonely without you baby, don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm goin' crazy without you baby, look at what I'm goin' through
How many times must I tell you I love
Tell you I love you times before
Don't believe that I'm worth all your kisses
I'm worth more then this , but you ignore

How many birds will I see high and flying
How many birds will it take till I get you
I will be crying, yeah

Maybe tomorrow you'll come walkin' my way
Come talkin' my way , you'll find out
My love for you will be stronger then truer
I'll look at you and there's no doubt

How many birds will I see high and flying
How many birds will it take till I get you
I will be crying, yeah

I was so lonely without you baby, don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm going crazy without you baby, look at what I'm goin' through
Baby, baby, baby
Here come old flat top, he come
Groovin' up slowly, he got
Ju-ju eyeballs, he want
Holy rollers, he got
Hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please
He wear no shoeshine, he got
Toe jam football, he got
Monkey finger, he shoot
Coca-Cola, he say
I know you, you know me
One thing I can tell you is: you got to be free
Come together
Right now
Over me
He bag production, he got
Walrus gumboot, he got
Ono sideboard, he one
Spinal cracker, he got
Feet down below his knees
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease
Come together
Right now
Over me
Owaaa
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together
Come together, yeahhhhh
Come together, yeahhhhh
Come together

[Hook x2]
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go

[Verse 1]
Childish Gambino
I'm trying to hold my liquor
A vomit stain on my t-shirt
A sick boy but getting sicker
I don't really wanna take another marijuana
But I do it cause I'm stupid and it hits me I'm a goner

[Hook x2]

[Intro]
Hey, hey
After midnight, we're out of control
(We outta control, we outta control, we outta control)
(Ooooh) Let's go!
'Cause after midnight, we let out the ghosts
(We outta control, we outta control, we outta control)
(Yeah) Let's go!
It's like the Rocky Horror awesome sorta freak show
We're gonna board them up and bleed the sore and just let go
So when the clock strikes midnight, everyone lose control
And let the freaks come out tonight

[Verse 1]
The shitty nine to five (Man, I hate this job)
It's gonna be the end of me (It's gonna be the end of me)
And since when did time (Since when did time)
Become my biggest enemy? (Become my biggest enemy)

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think it's smart standing so close to me
(So close, so close, you to close)
Because at 11:59, I can feel it in my spine taking over me
(I-I-I feel it, I feel it taken over)
(Hey hey)

[Chorus]
After midnight, we're out of control
(We outta control, we outta control, we outta control)
Let's go!
'Cause after midnight, we let out the ghosts
(We outta control, we outta control, we outta control)
Let's go!
It's like the Rocky Horror awesome sort of freak show
We're gonna board them up and bleed the sore and just let go
So when the clock strikes midnight, everyone lose control
And let the freaks come out tonight

[Verse 2]
It's midnight, it feels right
Everybody's acting up
If you're a freak, be proud of it
You got it from your mother
And I have rather good manners
I just choose not to employ them
It's about that time for you to embrace your flaws and enjoy them
Everybody in the back
Bring your ass up to the front and
Nevermind the fuss because we do what we want
You feeling how I'm feeling
Put your hands up to the ceiling
And say "We don't need no blocks, let them motherfuckers go!"

[Chorus]
After midnight, we're out of control
(We outta control, we outta control, we outta control)
Let's go!
'Cause after midnight, we let out the dogs
(We outta control, we outta control, we outta control)
Let's go!
It's like the Rocky Horror awesome sort of freak show
We're gonna board them up and bleed the sore and just let go
So when the clock strikes midnight, everyone lose control
And let the freaks come out tonight

[Bridge]
I don't think this after midnight
After midnight (So close, so close)
Because at 11:59, I can feel it in my spine
Takin' over me (After midnight)
I feel it taking over me
I don't think this after midnight (So close, so close)
Because at 11:59, I can feel it in my spine
Taken over me (Yeah)

[Chorus]
(Hey, hey!)
After midnight, we are out of control
(We outta control, we outta control, we outta control)
(Ooooh) Let's go!
'Cause after midnight, we let out the dogs
(We outta control, we outta control, we outta control)
(Yeah)
Let's go!
It's like the Rocky Horror awesome sorta freak show
We're gonna board them up and bleed the sore and just let go
So when the clock strikes midnight everyone lose control
And let the freaks come out tonight
And let the freaks come out tonight
And let the freaks come out tonight

[Outro]
After midnight, we are out of control
(We outta control, we outta control, we outta control)
It's a mighty hard row that my poor hands have hoed
My poor feet have traveled a hot dusty road
Out of your dust bowl and westward we rolled
Blue deserts so hot and your mountains so cold

I wandered all over this green growing land
Where ever your crops are I lend you my hands
At the edge of your cities, you'll see me and then
I come with the dust and I'm gone with the wind

California, Arizona, I worked on your crops
North up to Oregon to gather your hops
I got beets from your ground
I cut grapes from your vines
To sat on our table's that light that sparkling wine

Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground
From the grand coulee dam where the water runs down
Every state of this union us migrants have been
Oh we come with the dust and we're gone, gone, gone with the wind
It's always we rambled that river and I
All along your green valley's I'd work till I die
I traveled this road until death lets me be
Cause pastures of plenty must always be free

I's a mighty hard row that my poor hands have hoed
My poor feet have traveled a hot dusty road
Edge of your cities you see me and then
I come with the dust and I'm gone, gone, gone with the wind
People in their pride believe it's easier for them to leave
Their problems in the arms of others , running to their mothers
Lasting love is such a funny thing
When you're in love you're on the wings
You're not in love, it's good for you
'cause you can do the things you want to do

It's you big chance , to take it baby
It's you big chance , you'll make it baby

When you're high and mighty you'll remember how I loved you
You'll be thinkin' how you hurt me when I needed you beside me
In the night is such a lonely time
I dream of you and that's a sign
It means that I am still a fool
And I am still so much in love with you

It's your big chance, so take it baby
It's your big chance, don't fake it baby

Big chance
Hot chance

I knew a man Bojangles and he danced for you
In worn out shoes
Silver hair a ragged shirt and baggy pants
The old soft shoe

He jumped so high
He jumped so high
And he'd lightly touched down

Mr Bojangles Mr Bojangles Mr Bojangles dance

I met him in a cell in
New Orleans he was down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he
He spoke right out

He talked about life
He talked of life
He laugh-slapped his leg in step

He said the name Bojangles and he danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants and took a stance
And he jumped so high
He clicked his heels
He let go a laugh
He let go a laugh
Shook his clothes all around

Mr Bojangles Mr Bojangles Mr Bojangles dance

We danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke in tears of fifteen years
How his dog and him

They traveled about
The dog up and died
He up and died
After twenty years he still grieves

He said I dance now at every chance and honky-tonks
For drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
Cause I drinks a bit

He shook his head now
He shook his head
I heard someone ask please
Mr Bojangles Mr Bojangles hey Mr Bojangles dance
Silent weekend
My baby she gave it to me
Silent weekend
My baby she gave it to me
She's actin' tough and hardy
But I'm sleepin' at the party
And she's leavin' me down in misery

Silent weekend
My baby she took me by the heart
Silent weekend
My baby she took me by the heart
She's thinkin' about disposin'
But I know I know she's dozin'
And she's tearin' it all apart

Silent weekend
Oh lord, I wish monday would come
Silent weekend
Oh lord, I sure wish monday would come
She's uppin' and she's leavin'
But I hate to sit here grievin'
But I just can't sit here playin' dumb
Well, I done a whole lotta thinkin'
'Bout a whole lotta cheatin'
And I, maybe I did please
But I just wallopped a lotta pizza
After makin' our peace
Puts ya down on my bended knees

Silent weekend
Man alive, I'm burnin' up on my brain
Silent weekend
Man alive, I'm burnin' up on my brain
She knows I'm just teasin'
But she's all misbelievin'
And I just don't wanna do it again

[Verse 1]
My love
I'll never find the words, my love
To tell you how I feel, my love
Mere words could not explain

Precious love
You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
You taught me how to live again

Only you
Cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you
Filled with gratitude and love

[Chorus]
God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You made me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
You make me feel brand new

[Verse 2]
My love
Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me

Precious friend
With you I'll always have a friend
Someone who I can depend
To walk a path that sometimes bends

Without you
Life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay
You for having faith in me

[Chorus]
God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You made me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You...
I am the eagle, I live in high country
In rocky cathedrals that reach to the sky
I am the hawk and there's blood on my feathers
But time is still turning, they soon will be dry

And all those who see me and all who believe in me
Share in the freedom I feel when I fly

Come dance with the west wind and touch on the mountaintops
Sail o'er the canyons and up to the stars
And reach for the heavens and hope for the future
And all that we can be and not what we are
Bells will be ringing the glad, glad news
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
To wish me greetings, once again

Choirs will be singing 'Silent night'
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night

Friends and relations send salutations
Oh, sure, sure as the stars shine above
This is Christmas, Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the one you love

Then won't you tell me you'll never more roam?
Christmas and New Year will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
'Cause I'll be happy, happy once again

Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
This is Christmas, yes Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the one you love
Then won't you tell me you'll never more roam?
Christmas and New Year will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
'Cause I'll be happy, happy once again
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
I met her walking down a uptown street
She's so fine you know I wished she was mine
I get shook up every time we meet

I'm talkin' 'bout you
Nobody but you
Yeah, I do mean you
I'm just trying to get a message to you

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
I tell ya now she looks so good
Got so much skills and such a beautiful will
She oughta be somewhere in Hollywood

I'm talkin' 'bout you
Nobody but you
Come on and give me a cue
So I can get a message to you

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She's sitting right here by my side
Lovely indeed that why I asked if she
Promised someday she will be my bride
Talkin' 'bout you
I do mean you
Nobody but you
Come on, let me get a message through

[Pre-Chorus: The Temptations & Melvin Franklin]
All you poor, all you needy
All you're doin' is givin' to the greedy

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
In the center of the silence
Violent thoughts are thrown through the thick smoke
And flickering lights that brighten the room
All the things that you wanted to say get lost and thrown away
You can fade and hesitate to speak your mind
Can't turn back when you cross the line
Sometimes, it's someone you know who just doesn't care
Has to see you go to know you were there

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is the sun behind the rain
Even though, sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back when I begin it
I know that this is the sun behind the rain
Even though, sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back when I begin it

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Sometimes, you've got no control of where you go
Taking down a road you don't know
And you feel so lost that you wanna hide your face
You don't recognize the place you're in
Sometimes, the sun doesn't shine your way
Sometimes, the night doesn't turn to day
But sometimes, the light's so bright, it burns through the night
And keeps the darkness at bay (Run away)

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is the sun behind the rain
Even though, sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back when I begin it
I know that this is the sun behind the rain
Even though, sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back when I begin it

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough, you'll make them see
You'll be far away from them with me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Follow the link in the chain without a name
Seal the light and the darkened days remains
Taken away from the place you've been trapped
Break all you know, then bring it all back

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is the sun behind the rain
Even though, sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back when I begin it
I know that this is the sun behind the rain
Even though, sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back when I begin it

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough, you'll make them see
You'll be far away from them along with me
You say you love me
And you're thinkin' of me
But you know you could be wrong
You say you told me
That you wanna hold me
But you know you're not that strong
I just can't do what I done before
I just can't beg you any more
I'm gonna let you pass
And I'll go last
Then time will tell just who fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine

You say you disturb me
And you don't deserve me
But you know sometimes you lie
You say you're shakin'
And you're always achin'
But you know how hard you try
Sometimes it gets so hard to care
It can't be this way ev'rywhere
And I'm gonna let you pass
Yes, and I'll go last
Then time will tell just who fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
The judge, he holds a grudge
He's gonna call on you
But he's badly built
And he walks on stilts
Watch out he don't fall on you

You say you're sorry
For tellin' stories
That you know I believe are true
You say ya got some
Other kinda lover
And yes, I believe you do
You say my kisses are not like his
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is
I'm just gonna let you pass
Yes, and I'll go last
Then time will tell who fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it

Give love a chance girl
You're still young
You still got time
Handle it with kid gloves girl
You gotta treat love kind

Love is what you make it baby
It's what you make it
Love is what you make it baby
It's what you make it

Always trust each other
Be true to one another
It's a great, great pleasure
When you're doing things together
All though thick and thin
Stay together till the end
Take it for what it's worth
It's the greatest thing on earth

Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
I see your breath
Your words in frozen space tonight
I hear a distant bell and you appear
Like some ancient one I'd never really seen

There's a light falling from your hair
A photograph I thought I'd lost somewhere
You're all of this to me my dream
And a universe of you I've never seen

And now it seems not long ago
I was emptiness and you arose
And as the day fades to night
May we ever love fade into light

I feel the stillness of your eyes
And shadows fall away
The promise of a spring is waiting there
Underneath it all
Underneath it all
The sky is crying heavens raining tears
The flood of sorrow runs a million years
But across this universe or just next to me
You are calling

And now it seems not long ago
I was emptiness and you arose
And as the day fades to night
May we ever love fade into light

And as the day fades to night
May we ever love fade into light

[Intro]
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser

[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

[Verse 2]
Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say, "Hell, yes"
Low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now
Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it

[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Oh, oh yeah
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

[Backwards Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Lucky me swimming in my ability
Dancing down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom, I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me
Ah, there's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is a never gonna wither
Come on, everybody, time to deliver

[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

[Verse 1]
What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser

[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now

[Outro]
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Yeah
I get over heels for someone, I
That I really can't deal with, deal with
I want to block her out my mind
But I really can't do it, do it
I tell myself this the last time
I'ma let her do this to me
Whenever we do spend time
I realize that I can't get enough of you
Wipe that smile off your **** face, let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your face, let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your **** face, let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your face
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
To be inside, I don't care
Right in the middle, I'm right in the middle
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
To be inside, I don't care
Be my unholy, my one and my lonely
If I could start with words 'cause it's the only hope of feasting I got left
And everything I love about you is a mess
Smash the mirror and break the palm in his hand
I want to be better than I am
Let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your **** face, let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your face, let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your **** face, let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your face
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
To be inside, I don't care
Right in the middle, I'm right in the middle
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
To be inside, I don't care
Be my unholy, my one and my lonely
Girl, just look what you've done
How could you do this to me?
I gotta put my foot down
I can't let you do this to me
I can't forget those good ole times
And all the things you've been doing to me
I wanna hit that one more time
I mean love, what you're doing to me
I'ma say it loud, right here
Let's **** in this crowd
Why we arguing
I thought me and you were supposed to be friends
Let's chill for minute
Better yet we need a heal for a minute
Baby, put down the knife
Sometime I wanna save ya life, why don't you
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
To be inside, I don't care
Right in the middle, I'm right in the middle
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
To be inside, I don't care
Be my unholy, my one and my lonely
We ain't got no *** band
We ain't got no stinking the *** microphone setter
Timbaland, you tuned in, son of a b***
Let's get this f*** out of my house now
Before I get to my and I can't turn back
Hey, didn't I say you to f*** out
Get the f*** out
On my way to sunny Californ-i-a
On my way to spend another sunny day

Water, water
Get yourself in the cool, clear water
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
(The sun shines brightly down on the bay)
The air's so clean it'll just take your mind away
(A- take your mind away, take your mind away)

Have you ever been south of Monterey, barrancas carve the coast line
And the chaparral flows to the sea 'neath waves of golden sunshine
And have you ever been north of Morro Bay, the south coast plows the sea
And the people there are of the breed, they don't need electricity

Water, water
(Get yourself in that)
Cool cascades of clear, clear water
(Get yourself in that, get yourself in that water)
The sun dance final scene sets the hills ablaze
(Get yourself in that water)
Horizon edges quick up the mountain's way
(Up the mountain’s way, up the mountain’s way)
Have you ever been down Salinas way where Steinbeck found the valley
And he wrote about it the way it was in his travelin's with Charley
And have you ever walked down through the sycamores where the farmhouse used to be
There the monarch's autumn journey ends on a windswept cyprus tree

Water, water
(Get, get yourself in that)
Get yourself in that cool, clear, water
(Get yourself in that, get yourself in that water)
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
(Get yourself in that water)
The air's so clean that it just takes your mind away
(Takes your mind away, takes your mind away)

Have you ever been to a festival, the Big Sur congregation
Where Country Joe will do his show and he'd sing about liberty
And the people there in the open air are one big family
Yeah, the people there love to sing and share their new found liberty
Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
"I love you, love you"

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
"I love you, love you"
I still recall the thrill, I guess that I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
Hey, fellas, have you heard the news?
Yeah, the women in this town have been misused
Yeah, I seen it all in my dreams last night

Baby, baby, baby, please, don't leave here
Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on a-turnin'
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning

{Lay your head upon my pillow}
{Hold your warm and tender body close to mine}
Hear the whisper of the raindrops flowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times

I'll get along, you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me

{Lay your head upon my pillow}
{Hold your warm and tender body close to mine}
Hear the whisper of the raindrops flowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
(For the good times)

{For the good times}

{For the good times}

We don't sleep, I ain't sleepin' in weeks
It's cool though, 'cause I've been wasted
Haha, what's up, Mom?
(Ronnie VanZant -- Jeff Carlisi)

Well them four walls of Raiford, closing in on me
Doin' three to five hard labor, for armed robbery
I had two years behind me, but I could not wait the time
Everytime I thought about it, well I died some more inside

And I had stripes on my back, memories that hurt
For the only time I seen sunshine is when I went to work
Diggin' ditches for the chain gang, sleepin' in the "hole"
Oh Lord please forgive me for I could not wait parole

And I comin' home to see you Jesus
Well it feels so close this time
Please take mercy on a soldier
From the Florida-Georgia line

When they find me they must kill me
Oh Jesus save my soul
I can't go back down to Raiford
I can't take that anymore
Well these last few years behind me
Oh Lord, have been so sad
I fought proudly for my country when the times were bad
Now they say I'm guilty, when they find me I must die
Only me and Jesus know that I never stole a dime

Well when Vietnam was over there was no work here for me
I had a pretty wife awaitin and two kids I had to feed
Well I'm one of America's heroes and when they shoot me down
Won't you fly old Glory proudly, put my medals in the ground

And I comin' home to see you Jesus
Well it feels so close this time
Please take mercy on a soldier
From the Florida-Georgia line

When they find me they must kill me
Oh Jesus save my soul
I can't go back down to Raiford
I can't take that anymore
I heard how all the lights went out in Memphis
On the death night anniversary of the king
The pretenders talking dirty in the palace
But it doesn't have that old familiar ring

I see there's been some changes in the valley
All the renegades have finally settled down
Now they worship in the temples of their rivals
And desecrate the holy heart of town

Can't you hear all those sweet voices singing
Takin' care of the chosen ones
Can't you hear all those mission bells ringin'
Say a prayer for the chosen ones

I read they're pourin' oil on troubled waters
Yet they cast a giant shadow on the land
Let's spend another night across the border
And bury all our secrets in the sand

Now they claim there is a message in the Bible
They swear there is no master and his slave
But the future's lookin' dim for the lonesome cowboy
When the hand that rocks that cradle digs the grave

[Verse 1]
I fell in love
On a very special day
This feeling will never go away
Now I can say
That with your love, I'll always stay
Look at me and tell me if I'm being deceived
Cause right now this feelin' is hard to believe

[Chorus]
Who would have thought it'd be this way?
Oh, no
I never thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day
Who would have thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day?

[Verse 2]
I can't believe
That you are right here with me
The star on my Christmas tree
I wanna love you endlessly
And that's the way I always want it to be (want it to be)
Standing there when the lights from the tree
Meets your eyes
I can see
That I only want you
'Cause you're all that I need

[Chorus]
Who would have thought it'd be this way?
Oh, no
I never thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day
Who would have thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day?

[Bridge]
I'd never fall in love on Christmas day
I never thought I'd fall in love
On Christmas, Christmas day I'd fall in love

[Chorus]
Who would have thought it'd be this way?
Oh, no
I never thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day
Who would have thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day?

[Outro]
I know that Christ came down
To endure my sins and shame
But now my dear we fall in love
On this very special day
This day
Do do do do do do do do do do do hey
Thought it'd be this way
Oh, no
I never thought I'd fall in love
I never thought I'd fall in love
Who would have thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day?
I'm not the guy who cared about love
And I'm not the guy who cared about fortunes and such
I never cared much
Oh, look at me now!

I never knew the technique of kissing
I never knew the thrill I could get from your touch
I never knew much
Oh, look at me now!

I'm a new man better than casanova at his best
With a new heart and a brand new start
Why I'm so proud I'm bustin' my vest

So I'm the guy who turned out a lover
Yes I'm the guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One of those things
Oh, look at me now!

I'm not the guy who cared about love
And I'm not the guy who cared about fortunes and such
I never cared much
Oh, look at me now!
And I never knew the technique of kissing
I never knew the thrill I could get from your touch
I never knew much
Oh, look at me now!

I'm a new man better than casanova at his very best
With a new heart and a brand new start
I'm so proud I'm bustin' my vest

So I'm the guy who turned out a lover
Yes I'm the guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One of those things
Oh, look at me now!
Look at me now!
Stand on your feet for another go 'round
Sight the shakin', now we're gonna go down
In the mean time gettin' ready, gettin' ready to roll
I'm the dealer and I'm takin' control
Come on and make your play
You'll be a winner in my game, yeah
Come on and make your play
You just remember that the winner takes it all
Follow the leader, that's the name of the game
You've got the power to go all the way
Everybody's runnin', runnin', I can understand
'Cause I got it, 'cause I got it, baby, got the winnin' hand
Come on and make your play
You'll be a winner in my game, yeah
Come on and make your play
You just remember that the winner takes it all
Follow the leader, that's the name of the game
You've got the power to go all the way
Everybody's runnin', runnin', I can understand
'Cause I got it, 'cause I got it, baby, got the winnin' hand
Come on and make your play
You'll be a winner in my game, yeah
Come on and make your play
You just remember that the winner takes it all
Goin' up to Alaska
Up to the land of the midnight sun
Where the whale and the polar bear run
O'er the icy blue sea

Goin' up to Alaska
Up to the north and the pioneer life
Where courage and strength still survive
And a man can be free

American Child, does the call of the wild
Ever sing through the mist of your dreams
Does it fly with the wind when you waken again
When it's gone do you know what it means

Can you picture the time when a man had to find
His own way through the cold
To come back again to all that you've been
Can't you see that it's time to come home

To the flowers and seas and the rivers and the trees
And the earth who's the mother of all
A promise once made - will it shine, will it fade
Will we rise with the vision or fall
Goin' up to Alaska
Up to the land of the midnight sun
Where the whale and the polar bear run
O'er the icy blue sea

Goin' up to Alaska
Up to the north and the pioneer life
Where courage and strength still survive
And a man can be free

Men can be free
Goin' up to Alaska
Goin' up to Alaska
Goin' up to Alaska
Well, my bad luck is falling
Falling down like rain
Bad luck is falling
Falling down like rain
No matter what I do
Seems like my luck won't never change

I felt kinda lucky
My luck was running slow
The last hand I caught four aces
And the police broke down the door
I said, Lord
Lord, what can a poor boy do?
Well, ain't it bad when you can't make no money
Seems like all the bad breaks will come to you

Yeah, I got home this morning
She was looking kinda funny
She said "Don't come in, daddy
Daddy, unless you got some money"
And I said, Lord
Lord, what can a poor boy do?
Well, ain't it tough when you can't make no money
Without your woman turning her back on you
Well now, I asked my woman for some dinner
She looked at me like a fool
She said, "I'm playing checkers, daddy
And I think it's your turn to move"
I said, oh
Lord, what can a poor boy do?
Yes, it's bad when you can't make no money
And your woman turns her back on you
It was a blue letter she wrote to me
Its silver words she told
Wanna be on the road to paradise
I wanna lover who don't get old

Do I read the message in your eyes
You want love to stay another night
Baby when your day goes down
I won't be waitin' around for you

For every voice you've ever heard
There's a thousand without a word
Redbird, don't say you told me so
Just give me one more song to go

Do I read the message in your eyes
You want love to stay another night
Baby when your day goes down
I won't be waitin' around for you

I ain't waitin'
You, you're driving me crazy! What did I do? What did I do?
My tears for you make everything hazy, clouding the skies of blue
How true, were the friends who were near me to cheer me
Believe, me they knew, but you
Were the kind who would hurt me, desert me
When I needed you
Yes you, you're driving me crazy! What did I do to you?

[Verse 1]
There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
And though he wandered very far
Very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

[Verse 2]
And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"

[Outro]
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"
Everybody's war cry everybody's pride
Anybody's soapbox anybody's lives
Everybody's problem everybody's gun

Nobody's daughter nobody's son
Anybody's country anybody's blood
Anybody's body anybody's gun

You do something hurt
You do something pain
Why don't you do something love for a change

Why don't you do something love 

[x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love 

[x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love 

[x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love 

[x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love 

[x3] for a change
Give me a sign that I'm not on my own

Everybody hides everybody cries
Anybody wanna look me in the eyes
Somebody's conflict somebody's cause
Nobody asked for everybody's loss

Somebody listening somebody care
Somebody do something somewhere
Anyone listening anyone care
Somebody do something somewhere

Why don't you do something love 

[x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love 

[x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love 

[x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love 

[x3] for a change

It's only love gotta give it away
Why don't you do something love for a change

Why don't you do something love 

[x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love 

[x3] for a change
Why don't you do something love 

[x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love 

[x3] for a change

Give me a sign that I'm not on my own
I'm a fool, I've taken no advice
And I'm so cruel, I'm talkin' to you nice
But then again you may not take me back
Oh just to put my hat back on your rack
Guess I don't know why I bother with myself
You will find a part of me in someone else
I never argued with the fact that she is mine
I only hurt her and kissed her three times out of nine
You have the edge to talk to men and make them feel at home
You spent that every lasting cent on someone that's not your own
Bear with me there's bound to be a chance
To heal the wound and start back our romance
I gained a heart and part of it is yours
Oh just to see my love walk through these doors
Oh and my life's bound out ahead, I can not look
And if you read me, then I am just a book
You don't care if rain falls in my room
You won't be there if trouble fills my spoon
I'm just a clown that plays around with misery in my way

[Verse 1]
If a picture paints a thousands words
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show
The you I've come to know

[Verse 2]
If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you
And now you've left me too

[Chorus 1]
And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself on me

[Verse 3]
If a man could be two places at one time
I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today
Beside you all the way

[Verse 4]
If the world should stop revolving
Spinning slowly down to die
I'd spend the end with you
And when the world was through

[Chorus 2]
Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I, would simply fly away
And on that dawn just when the day was breaking
I saw your face everywhere
And on that morning, love was in the making
I heard your voice, I hear music, I've no care
Sunrise in the morning, stay awhile, you know that I'll
Be thinking of you now and everyday
Make it worth my while, I'll see that you will always smile
And never stray, you stay baby, I'll pray
On that sweet night I looked at moonbeams clearly
Moonbeams dancing in your eyes
And it was right I know I loved you dearly
I saw your face, I hear music, I've no care
Sunset in the evening, stay awhile, you know that I'll
Be thinking of you now and everyday
Make it worth my while, I'll see that you will always smile
And never stray, you stay, baby, I'll pray
Stay awhile, you know that I'll
Be thinking of you now and everyday
Make it worth my while, I'll see that you will always smile
And never stray, you stay, baby, I'll pray
Please stay, baby, I'll pray. Oh, you stay, baby, I'll pray
Please stay, baby I'll pray..
Lord, I've never lived where churches grow
I loved creation better as it stood
That day you finished it so long ago
And looked upon your work and called it good
I know that others find you in the light
That sifted down through tinted window panes
And yet I seem to feel you near tonight
In this dim, quiet starlight on the plains
I thank you, Lord, that I'm placed so well
That you've made my freedom so complete
That I'm no slave to whistle, clock or bell
Nor weak eyed prisoner of Waller Street
Just let me live my life as I've begun
And give me work that's open to the sky
Make me a partner of the wind and sun
And I won't ask a life that's soft or high
Let me be easy on the man that's down
Let me be square and generous with all
I'm careless sometimes, Lord, when I'm in town
But never let them say I'm mean or small
Make me as big and open as the plains
And honest as the horse between my knees
Clean as a wind that blows behind the rains
Free as the hawk that circles down the breeze
Forgive me, Lord, if sometimes I forget
You know about the reasons that are hid
You understand the things that gall or fret
Well, you knew me better than my mother did
Just keep an eye on all that's done or said
And right me sometimes when I turn aside
And guide me on that long, dim trail ahead
That stretched upward toward the great divide
Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There is nothing in life but you
(Roll the windows down, you know why?
I'll tell you why)
So the wind can hit my face while i pump the bass, oww
Swervin' lane to lane, like i'm going insane, may-ayne
(I'm just playin', don't drive like that)
Afroman in your stereo, crumblin' the walls of Jericho
Catch me limpin' down the street, to the tempo of the beat
Let your head bu-bop at the bu-bus stop, ay, put up your hands if you love hip hop
(BUCOOC!)
Joseph Foreman made this beat, funky like the bathroom in the Slauson' swap meet
You know how the traffic goes; it don't
The radio could play my song; but they won't
Jam my jam in the traffic jam, wom, bom, let your system slam
Three eighteens vibrate your body, make you jump around like you're throwin' karate
Dancin', dancin', can't stop moving, exhausted - still groovin'
Ì
You know how the traffic goes (traffic goes, oh)
It don't (It ain't going nowhere, hurry up and wait.)
The DJ can play my song (play my song)
But he won't
That's why i hit the swap meet, bought some major beat (oww)
MAJOR BEAT
So i can be patient when i'm in the street (oww)
MAJOR BEAT, MAJOR BEAT
I'm never rude, when i get my food
I've got a good attitude, take time dude
Bump my beat, bust my rhyme
Jammin' a drive through the Hoe town
Walk to school, walk back home
I never walk without my Walkman on
I remember when i got my GRJ
I bought an old car with a new tape deck
Well get the in-crowd (?), cargo cluttin' (?)
Chillin' in my car with my woofers subbin'
Can't end my night, can't start my day unless I've got myself some tight rap music to play
Turn it up (turn it up), start humpin' (humpin')
Everything i play beat-bumpin'
Chicken on the grill getting roasted
I ain't going nowhere, i'm posted
You know how the traffic goes (traffic goes, oh)
It don't. (It ain't going nowhere, hurry up and wait.)
The DJ can play my song (can play my song)
But he won't. (What's wrong with him?)
So i hit the swap meet, bought some major beat (oww)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, BUCOOC!)
So i can be patient while i'm in the street (get on down, oww)
I used to be broke as can be
Hubcaps missin' on my LTD
Chillin' with the winos tryna' keep warm
Fillin' out my CA-7 form (Got a pen?)
I stand in line for three hours tops
Gettin' yelled out by the food stamp cops
County wheel (?), county mail, county hospital, county jail
Cluckhead gangbangers and rude tramps
General relief and food stamps
My girlfriend Kim was down with me
Even though i was broke, she let me live in her place
She got a son, now we havin' a daughter
My lightning ain't paid, i'm in hot water (?)
Took a little trip (trip)
Down in Mississippi
Got with God
Clucked the grip
Jesus Christ, save my life
Re-united me with my kids and wife
When Christmas come around, they call on me
For the Powerpuff Girls and the Dragonball Z
The new Xbox and the Yugioh cards
All praises go to God
I beg me patience, in my soul
I don't trip on things i can't control
You know how the traffic goes (traffic goes)
It don't. (Go nowhere. It don't go nowhere.)
The radio could play my song
But they won't. (Ah no)
You know how the traffic goes (traffic goes)
It don't
The DJ could play my song
But he won't
Going to the swap meet, get some major beat
MAJOR BEAT, MAJOR BEAT
So i can be patient when i'm in the streets......

But we having sex tonight

I said I ain't have sex in a long time X3
Yeah I'm fucking tonight
So you speak to me of sadness and the coming of the winter
Fear that is within you now that seems to never end
And the dreams that have escaped you
And the hope that you've forgotten
And you tell me that you need me now
And you want to be my friend
And you wonder where we're going
Where's the rhyme and where's the reason?
And it's you cannot accept it is here we must begin
To seek the wisdom of the children
And the graceful way of flowers in the wind

For the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers
Their laughter and their loveliness would clear a cloudy day
Like the music of the mountains and the colors of the rainbow
They're a promise of the future and a blessing for today

Though the cities start to crumble and the towers fall around us
The sun is slowly fading and it's colder than the sea
It is written: "From the desert to the mountains they shall lead us
By the hand and by the heart, and they will comfort you and me
In their innocence and trusting, they will teach us to be free."
For the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers
Their laughter and their loveliness would clear a cloudy day
And the song that I am singing is a prayer to nonbelievers:
"Come and stand beside us, we can find a better way."
Angelina, Angelina, please bring down your concertina
And play a welcome for me cause I'll be coming home from sea

Yes its so long since Ive been home
Seems like theres no place to roam

And I've rode out many a storm

Angelina, Angelina, please bring down your concertina
And play a welcome for me cause I'll be coming home from sea

Well I've heard the bawdy tunes
I've been in honky tonk saloons
I took my liquor by the vat
Well I stayed on call for a rousing brawl
Home was where I hung my hat

Angelina, Angelina, please bring down your concertina
And play a welcome for me cause I'll be coming home from sea
Now I've courted many a girl
I've been in ports all around the world
But my rambling days are done

And I've found theres only one

And she is Angelina, Angelina, please bring down your concertina
And play a welcome for me cause I'll be coming home from sea
Butterflies

All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when
I'm trying to get through
Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

I just wanna touch and kiss and i wish that i could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i

All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real

Just to draw my pay

[Verse 1]
High water risin'
Risin' night and day
All the gold and silver
Are being stolen away
Big Joe Turner lookin' East and West
From the dark room of his mind
He made it to Kansas City
Twelfth Street and Vine
Nothing standing there
High water everywhere

[Verse 2]
High water risin'
The shacks are slidin' down
Folks lose their possessions
Folks are leaving town
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it
Then she hung it on a wall
Says, "You're dancin' with whom they tell you to
Or you don't dance at all."
It's tough out there
High water everywhere

[Verse 3]
I got a cravin' love for blazing speed
Got a hopped up Mustang Ford
Jump into the wagon, love
Throw your panties overboard
I can write you poems
Make a strong man lose his mind
I'm no pig without a wig
I hope you treat me kind
Things are breakin' up out there
High water everywhere

[Verse 4]
High water risin'
Six inches 'bove my head
Coffins droppin' in the street
Like balloons made out of lead
Water pourin' into Vicksburg
Don't know what I'm going to do
"Don't reach out for me," she said
"Can't you see I'm drownin' too?"
It's rough out there
High water everywhere

[Verse 5]
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman
The Italian and the Jew
"You can't open your mind, boys
To every conceivable point of view."
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five
Judge says to the High Sheriff
"I want him dead or alive
Either one, I don't care."
High Water everywhere

[Verse 6]
The Cuckoo is a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
I'm preachin' the Word of God
I'm puttin' out your eyes
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat
She said, "Take it off the shelf
As great as you are, man
You'll never be greater than yourself."
I told her I didn't really care
High water everywhere

[Verse 7]
I'm getting' up in the morning
I believe I'll dust my broom
Keeping away from the women
I'm givin' 'em lots of room
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale
Everything is looking blue
I just can't be happy, love
Unless you're happy too
It's bad out there
High water everywhere
Keep your hands off her
Hey Ledbetter wrote this

Keep your hands off her
Keep your hands off her
Keep your hands off her
Keep your hands off her

Keep your hands off her
Keep your hands off her
Keep your hands off her
Keep your hands off her

Keep your hands off her
Keep your hands off her
Keep your hands off her
Keep your hands off her

Keep your hands off her
Keep your hands off her
Isabel is waiting
In a room of many shadows
Her eyes like flashing diamonds
Shining brightly from the sea
Her hair in silken tresses
Like a robe around her shoulders
Hiding tantalising treasures
That the sun has never seen

Isabel is watching
Like a princess from the mountains
For the first soft snows of winter
And the icy winds they bring
With a whisper of her sadness
In the passing of the summer
Her crown is wild red roses
With a lace of forest green

And she wraps her arms around me and she sighs
And she sing to me in silence with her eyes
And her hair upon my pillow comforts me
Isabel is weeping
And her eyes are full of wonder
She knows that it's the time for her
And she cannot understand
She's a mistress of the moonlight
To the stars she is a sister
And the morning now awaits her
To betray her once again

And she whispers as she sadly slips away
Then she smiles because there's nothing left to say
And she takes with her the sadness and the sun
Three O'Clock Blues

Well now it's three o'clock in the morning
And I can't even close my eyes
Three o'clock in the morning baby
And I can't even close my eyes
Can't find my baby
And I can't be satisfied

I've looked around me
And my baby she can't be found
I've looked all around me, people
And my baby she can't be found
You know if I don't find my baby
I'm going down to the Golden Ground
That's where the men hang out

Goodbye, everybody
I believe this is the end
Oh goodbye everybody
I believe this is the end
I want you to tell my baby
Tell her please please forgive me
Forgive me for my sins
Darlin' You Know I Love You

Darlin', darlin' you know I love you
I love you, for myself
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else

I think of you, think of you every morning
I dream of you, every night
And I'd love to be with you always

When night began to fall
I cry, cry alone
And I wish, I could hold you in my arms tonight

Darlin', Darlin' you know I love you
I love you, for myself
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else
I fall in love with you ev'ry day
The thrill is always new, ev'ry day
The sun may shine, the rain may fall
And icy winds may blow
You smile at me and all I see
Are blossoms in the snow

I thank my lucky star ev'ry day
That you are as you are, ev'ry day
The years may come
The years may go
If we're still here I'll say
I fall in love with you ev'ry day

I thank my lucky star ev'ry day
That you are as you are, ev'ry day
The years may come
The years may go
If we're still here I'll say
I fall in love with you ev'ry day
I walked 47 miles of barbed wire
I got a cobra snake for a necktie
Got a house down by the roadside
Made out of rattlesnake hide
Come on, child, take a walk with me
And tell me who do you love?
Your dogs ain't found a good girl, one that love you and give you warning
Now you find that you been misused, well how many girls can think all right
She'd embarrass you anywhere, she'd make her friends think that she didn't care
Give me the chance and I'd been begging
And I just want to take care of you and I want you to
Tell Mama, all about it, tell Mama, what you need
Tell Mama, what you want and how that girl does things all right
Let me hear you say "Yash"
The girl you had didn't have no sense
She wasn't worth all the time you spent
Had another man kick you out the door
Now that same dude is wearing your clothes
Tell your Mama, what you want, tell your Mama, what you need
Tell your Mama, what you got to have
I hang on every word you said and
No one could get inside my head like you
Then I guess I was a fool for you then
But now I understand
It was all part off your plan
And you should know that

You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart
You taught me how to break a heart

Dear God if you can hear me know
Please stop the anger building up inside me
I need you to come and guide me
I look into the eyes
Of the one I thought was mine
And my only scream is
You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart
You taught me how to break a heart

No one could get inside my head
You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart

You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart
You taught me how to break a heart
I wanna be your lover baby
I wanna be your man
I wanna be your lover baby
I wanna be your man

Love you like no other baby
Like no other can
Love you like no other baby
Like no other can

I wanna be your man

I wanna be your man
I wanna be your man

Tell me that you love me baby

Somewhere out on the prairie
Is the greatest cowboy that's ever been
And when he lays his hands upon the ponies
They shudder with an understanding skin

And he says ponies
Now ponies don't you worry
I have not come to steal your fire away
I want to fly with you across the sunrise
Discover what begins each shining day

When the storm clouds in the west
Are quickly gathering
The ponies they run wild there
Before it rains

You'll see their sleek dark bodies
Brightly gleaming
You know the fire is flying through
Their brains
And he says ponies
Now ponies don't you worry
I have not come to steal your fire away
I want to fly with you across the sunrise
Discover what begins each shining day

And he says ponies
Now ponies don't you worry
I have not come to steal your fire away
I want to fly with you across the sunrise
Discover what begins each shining day

And he says ponies
Ponies don't you worry
I have not come to steal your fire away
I want to fly with you across the sunrise
Discover what begins each shining day
I want to fly
Little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got

Well I'm not braggin' babe, so don't put me down
But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town
When somethin' comes up to me, he don't even try
'Cause if I had a set of wings, man, I know she could fly

She's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got

Just a little deuce coupe with a flat head mill
But she'll walk a Thunderbird like she's standin' still
She's ported and relieved and she's stroked and bored
She'll do a hundred and forty in the top end floored

She's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got

She's got a competition clutch with the four on the floor
And she purrs like a kitten 'til the lake pipes roar
And if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid
There's one more thing, I got the pink slip, daddy
And comin' off the line when the light turns green
Well she blows 'em outta the water like you never seen
I get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steer
When I get rubber in all four gears

She's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
She's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
She's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
She's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
(Talk) - Mike
The rose

Verse 1 - Nate & Shawn
How I love to smell
She kisses me so well (She kisses)
Unlike anyone I've ever known (You're the best)
Knew there was no other who
Listen it's time up
But I see right now I was deadly wrong (I was wrong)

Scent is ohh so strong
Feel like an animal
'Cause I can smell it through the phone
Soft like silky petals
All over my skin
Still yearning for the honey
That I've been missing (I've been missing)

Chorus
The love I've been waiting for all my life
Has rendered my soul helpless
Whether in bloom or a taste I consume
My rose and a honeycomb (My rose and a honeycomb)
The love I've been waiting for all my life
Has entered my heart with grief
Can't think of a reason
Taste and smell when in season
My rose and a honeycomb
(Talk) - Mike
The honeycomb

Verse 2 - Wanya, Shawn & Nate
Sweet and tantalizing
It just stays on the rising
Everytime her eyes address my name

So hard to keep composure
'Cause she's taking over

Fills my every fantasy

(Tastes just like heaven) Tastes just like heaven
Can't feel my knees
Like my precious rose
She attracts too many bees

(Talk) - Wanya
Sometimes I wish I never knew her

I meant some people knew her
But I need the sticky love that she gives to me

Chorus
The love I've been waiting for all my life
Has rendered my soul helpless
Whether in bloom or a taste I consume
My rose and a honeycomb (my rose and a honeycomb)
The love I've been waiting for all my life (all my life)
Has entered my heart with grief (entered my heart)
Can't think of a reason
Taste and smell when in season
My rose and a honeycomb (honeycomb)
Bridge - Nate, Shawn & Wanya
Oh how I wish I could choose
Be ashamed to fight for love and then lose
So I'll taste as I smell
I can't choose the whole world
My rose or my honeycomb

But if one day I am found
And be forced to let one wear the crown
If we are to do this
Neither one would be missed

My rose and my honeycomb...

Chorus
The love I've been waiting for all my life
Has rendered my soul helpless (so helpless)
Whether in bloom or a taste I consume (whether, my rose)
My rose and a honeycomb (my rose and a honeycomb)
The love I've been waiting for all my life
Has entered my heart with grief (entered my heart)
Can't think of a reason
Taste and smell when in season
My rose and a honeycomb (and a honeycomb)

2nd Bridge - Wanya
She's my rose
She was my rose
See I love loving her
She mkes me feel like a man
Oh my honeycomb
Make me feel like a man
Chorus
The love I've been waiting for all my life (she was the sweetest)
Has rendered my soul helpless (thing that God could ever send to a man)
Whether in bloom or a taste I consume
My rose and a honeycomb
The love I've been waiting for all my life (I've been waiting for)
Has entered my heart with grief (entered my heart)
Can't think of a reason
Taste and smell when in season
My rose and a honeycomb (my honeycomb)

[Verse]
I took a house by the water
Took a man on a mountainside
Pretty house by the water
Lovely lover by the waterside
Last time I saw that man
He hung down his head and cried

[Chorus]
Corrina, Corrina
Do you have to go
Corrina, Corrina
Tell me why do you have to go
Just made me come to love you girl
Now you pack your things and go
Leave me this bird that whistles
Leave me this bird that sings

[Outro]
I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that's singin'
If I don't have you darlin'
Birds don't mean nothin'

[Verse 1]
Confidence is a must
Edginess is a rush
A man with a Midas touch
Intoxicate me, I'm a lush
Stop, you're making me blush

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you know (Know)

[Chorus]
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot
Wonder if you know you're on my radar
And yep, I notice you, I know it's you I'm choosing
Don't wanna lose you, you on my radar
When you walk
And when you talk
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle, that's what I want
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
Tryna make you understand you're on my radar
On my radar (On my radar)
On my radar
On my radar

[Verse 2]
Interesting sense of style
Ten million dollar smile
Think I can’t handle that
Animal in the sack
His eyes see right to my soul
I surrender self-control
Catch me looking again
Falling right into my plan

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you know (Know)

[Chorus]
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot
Wonder if you know you're on my radar
And yep, I notice you, I know it's you I'm choosing
Don't wanna lose you, you on my radar
When you walk
And when you talk
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle, that's what I want
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
Tryna make you understand you're on my radar
On my radar (On my radar)
Radar, radar, radar...
So hot, so hot
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot
Wonder if you know you're on my radar
And yep, I notice you, I know it's you I'm choosing
Don't wanna lose you, you on my radar
When you walk
And when you talk
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle, that's what I want
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
Tryna make you understand you're on my radar
On my radar (On my radar)
On my radar
On my radar
On my radar
On my radar
On my radar
On my radar
On my radar
On my radar

[Outro]
On my radar
I'll walk alone because to tell you the truth I'll be lonely
I don't mind being lonely when my hear tells me you are lonely too
I'll walk alone, they'll ask me why and Ill tell them I'd rather
There are dreams I must gather, dreams we fashioned the night you held me tight
I'll always be near you wherever you are each night in every prayer
If you call, I'll hear you, no matter how far
Just close your eyes and I'll be there
Please walk alone and send your love and your kisses to guide me
Till you're walking beside me, I'll walk alone
Missed the Saturday dance
I heard they crowded the floor
It's awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore

I thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
I just couldn't bear it without you
I don't get around much anymore

Darling I guess
My mind is more at ease
But nevertheless
Why stir up memories
Been invited on dates
I might have gone, but what for
I just couldn't bear it without you
I don't get around much anymore

Don't get around much anymore...

[Verse 1]
Love overflows around this season
Our hearts find pleasure in the simplest of things
It brings joy to a child
When he sees all the decorations hanging all around
The birthday of our king
We sing praises to you
People gather around to see a tree
Light up the sky for all of the world to see
Of all the holidays that exist
None makes more happier than this one

[Chorus]
I see love all around this world
In every man, woman, boy, and girl
The time is so right and I'll say
Thank you Lord
It's so great to be alive
Because it's all about love

[Verse 2]
As we sit around the fireplace
Windows fill with snow as it flutters down and gives the ground a glow
I feel your kisses
Your warm embrace
Kneeling as we pray
To thank our Lord for what he's done for us
Time stands so still
As I touch your hand it says things to me words never will

[Bridge]
I feel it (it's easy to feel) peace all the way inside
Joy from a stranger as he walks by and says
Hi, Merry Christmas to you and yours
May you receive everything you wish for and more
I see love

[Chorus]
I see love all around this world
In every man, woman, boy, and girl
The time is so right and I'll say
Thank you Lord
It's so great to be alive
Because it's all about love
I see love all around this world
In every man, woman, boy, and girl
The time is so right and I'll say
Thank you Lord
It's so great to be alive
Because it's all about love
I see love all around this world
In every man, woman, boy, and girl
The time is so right and I'll say
Thank you Lord
It's so great to be alive
Because it's all about love
I see love all around this world
In every man, woman, boy, and girl
The time is so right and I'll say
Thank you Lord
It's so great to be alive
Because it's all about love
I see love all around this world
In every man, woman, boy, and girl
The time is so right and I'll say
Thank you Lord
It's so great to be alive
Because it's all about love
I like to deal with the ladies
I like to give 'em a real hard time
Like to make 'em sigh
Like to make 'em cry over me
I like to swing with the good times
I like to have me a real live ball
Doin' what I can like a dirty old man
Tee Hee

Like to have 'em just to hanging around
Wondering where I've been
Like to see 'em with their big brown eyes
Just-a drinkin' me in

I like to deal with the ladies
I like to hang 'em up on my line
Treat 'em kinda rough
But they never get enough of me
Rat a tat tat tat

Like to have 'em just-a hanging around
Wondering where I've been
Like to see 'em with their big brown eyes
Just-a drinkin' me in
Yeah
I like to deal with the ladies
I like to give 'em a real hard time
Like to make 'em sigh
Like to make 'em cry over
Like to make 'em bawl
Love to have 'em crawl over
Treat 'em kinda rough
But they never get enough of me
Rat a tat tat tat
With my high starched-collar
And my high-topped shoes
And my hair piled high upon my head
I went to lose a jolly hour on the trolley
And lost my heart instead

With his light brown derby
And his bright green tie
He was quite the handsomest of men
I started to yen so I counted to ten
Then I counted to ten again

Clang, clang, clang went the trolley
Ding, ding, ding went the bell
Zing, zing, zing went my heart strings
From the moment I saw him I fell

Chug, chug, chug went the motor
Bump, bump, bump went the brake
Thump, thump, thump went my heart strings
When he smiled I could feel the car shake
He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name, I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

Chug, chug, chug went the motor
Pop, pop, pop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings
As he started to go then I started to know how it feels
When the universe reels

The day was bright, the air was sweet
The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet
You tried to sing, but couldn't squeak
In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak

Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings

As he started to leave
I took hold of his sleeve with my hand
And as if it were planned, he stayed on with me
And it was grand just to stand
With his hand holding mine to the end of the line
Yo i wanna talk about tonight
Later on what gonna be happening??
You and me listen

I hear ya body callin Kelly rescue me
Girl u a prisoner and u need to be set free
Ya body speaking words that only my body can hear

I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome
My heart is filled with misery

Oh, so many strange things
They happen to me all day long
Oh, so many strange things
They happen to me all day long
Yes, it seems like everything I do
Everything I do is wrong

I had a good reputation
The greatest man in town
But I'm having so much troubles
Till they 'bout to drag me down
I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome
My heart is filled with misery
I got up on my feet
I had lots of friends
But bad luck had hit me
Now I'm down again
I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome
My heart is filled with misery
Hey Mr. President
All your congressmen, too
You got me frustrated
And I don't know what to do
I'm trying to make a living
I can't save a cent
It takes all of my money
Just to eat and pay my rent
I got the blues
Got those inflation blues

You know, I'm not one
Of those high brows
I'm average Joe to you
I came up eating cornbread
Candied yams and chicken stew
Now you take that paper dollar
It's only that in name
The way that buck has shrunk
It's a lowdown dirty shame
That's why I got the blues
Got those inflation blues
Mr. President
Please cut the price of sugar
I wanna make my coffee sweet
I wanna smear some butter on my bread
And I just got to have my meat
When you start rationing
You really played the game
And things are going up
And up and up and up
And my check remains the same
That's why I got the blues
Got those inflation blues
Wrangle Mountain Song

This song appears on three albums, and was first released on the Spirit Album
And has also been released on the Autograph and Voice of America Albums. On the
Latter two albums, the song is called The Wragell Mountain Song

Sunday and it's rainin' in Alaska
Seven days, I haven't seen the sun
Flyin' bush, flyin' low along the shore line
Doin' everything I can to make it home
I can't wait to see the Wrangle Mountain
I can't wait to do what I will do
Honey, did I never say how time goes by so slowly
When I can't wait to get back home to you

Three years from the war and settled down now
I did my time and served my country well
In the freedom I defended I fly beneath the North Star
And I just don't know a better way to feel
I can't wait to see the Wrangle Mountain
I can't wait to do what I will do
Honey, did I never say how time goes by so slowly
When I can't wait to get back home to you
It's a quiet life out here among the mountains
In a cabin that was built with these two hands
Mccarthey lies asleep beside the Glacier
It's colder now, winter's in the air
If you think they're wild it's just because they can't be broken
It's a strong and gentle people living there
I can't wait to see the Wrangle Mountain
I can't wait to do what I will do

Honey, did I never say how time goes by so slowly
When I can'? T wait to get back home to you

Words and music by John Denver
Did you ever have a dream or two
Where the hero is a guy named you
And the things he does are just too much
Does he fly like Mr. Superman, speak Chinese, French and Dutch?
And did you ever have a dream or two?

Have you ever woken up one day
With the feeling that you'd been away?
If the girl that you dreamed of last night
Had the same dream, in the very same scene
With the very same boy, hold tight

[Chorus]
It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can travel anywhere with anyone you care
It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can walk around in New York while you sleep in Penge

I will travel round the world one night
On the magic wings of astral flight
If you've got the secret, tell me do

[Chorus]

I will travel round the world one night
On the magic wings of astral flight
If you've got the secret, tell me do
Have you ever had a dream or two?
Have you ever had a dream or two?
In the night, there are sights to be seen
Stars like jewels on the crown of a Queen
But the only sight I wanna view
Is that wonderful picture of you

On a Streetcar, or in the café
All of the evening, and most of the day
My mind is in a maze what can I do?
I still see that picture of you

It was last summer, I fell in love
My heart told me what to do
I saw you there on the crest of a hill
An' I took a little picture of you

Then you were gone, like a dream in the night
With you went my heart, my love and my life
I didn't know your name, what could I do?
I only had a picture of you

Then you were gone, like a dream in the night
With you, went my heart, my love and my life
I didn't know your name, what could I do?
I only had a picture of you, oh yeah
That wonderful picture of you
I'm left with a picture of, oh yeah
That wonderful picture of you
We have got to come together
How long can we stay apart?
You may get it maybe never
But it's coming from the heart

Your life is full of indecision
You can't make up your mind
We must get it in position
And move it on down the line

'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb
I been on that road too long of a time
Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
When I think of the love that I left behind

Make me up a bed of roses
And hang them down from the vine
Of all my loves you've been the closest
That's ever been on my mind

Please don't talk about tomorrow
I'm really not one to care
This world is filled with too much sorrow
That nobody's heart should bear
'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb
I been on that road too long of a time
Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
When I think of the love that I left behind

Please, please give me indication
Stop and talk to me
Like a river that is flowing
My love will never cease to be

You will always be my honey
No one could take your part
Our love can't be bought with money
'Cause it's coming from the heart

'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb
I been on that road too long of a time
Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
When I think of the love that I left behind

[Chorus]
Burning desire sets my soul on fire
Burning desire sets my soul on fire

[Verse 1]
I feel my body drowning in your sea of love
But in the meantime there's nothing to dream
Between Hell and Heaven you just may see me chase my heart everywhere

[Chorus]
Burning desire hotter than an electric chair
Burning desire hotter than an electric chair

[Verse 2]
Last night sure was sweet
It sure was good this time around
You really sent me around and around, round and round

[Verse 3]
You came on down hard on me baby
You showed me just how love could be
I wish I could stay baby
But I'm just a night bird flying over the sea
And I'm trying not to drown

[Chorus]
Burning desire hotter than an electric chair
Hanging down from my window
Those are my wind chimes
In the late afternoon you're hung up on wind chimes
Though it's hard I try not to look at my wind chimes
Now and then a tear rolls off my cheek

On the warm breeze the little bells
Tinkle like wind chimes
Close your eyes and lean back now listen to wind chimes

[Intro: T-Pain & Bei Maejor]
Yeah, shawty, yeah
La, da, da, da
Bei Maejor are you ready? (Uh huh)
Bei Maejor are you ready? (Uh huh)
Do it for the 85 (0)
85 (0)
Let's go
Where she was?

[Chorus: Bei Maejor]
She was in the center of the stage, showin' me love
I was so amazed, throwin' up dubs
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch
Maybe catch a grub, like it's only us
In the middle of the stage, showin' me love
I was so amazed, throwin' up dubs
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch
Maybe get some...

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I swear this girl so fineeee, she move me so fast
Putting creases in my t-shirt with her ass
Baby that's your theme song put it on the glass
I just wanna backstage pass
And you so fly, I just wanna do ya
Get ya to my crib and seduce ya
Shit I'll have you screamin "Hell yeah!", while I'm giving it to ya
Baby we can lay in my cooler?
So let me know, if I can be the one to show
How bad you make a nigga wanna go
To the ATM
And come back with a grand so I can see you

[Chorus: Bei Maejor]
On center of the stage, showin' me love
I was so amazed, throwin' up dubs
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch
Maybe catch a grub, like it's only us
In the middle of the stage, showin' me love
I was so amazed, throwin' up dubs
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch
Maybe get some...

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
I thought I was the center of attraction till
I saw lil mama in action still
Ridiculous, wanna lick her like a liquorice
Tease her till that thang becomes ticklish
Got me throwing all my money on the floor
Cause she the baddest mutha'ucka on the floor
That's even when the lights come on
Not like these other chicks when the lights come on
Just wanna put her in the coupe and take her home
Center of the stage when I get shawty alone
Cause you bending over well, it looks like a car
Drove all the way up north just to see that booty south

[Chorus: Bei Major & R. Kelly]
On center of the stage, showin' me love (love)
I was so amazed, throwin' up dubs (Shawty tell me what it is)
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch (touch you)
Maybe catch a grub, like it's only us
In the middle of the stage, showin' me love (middle of the stage, ooh)
I was so amazed, throwin' up dubs
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch (Baby what it is, touch)
Maybe get some...

[Bridge: T-Pain & R. Kelly]
T-Pain what she do?
She got me trippin, dawg
Shawty butt-naked, just getting off
I gotta deliver there I'm a tip it off
Already got her in club, shawty what it do tryna get in

[Pre-Chorus: Bei Maejor & R. Kelly]
You, you, you, you, you
I spend my chips on you
You, you, you, you, you (Spend my money, spend my money)

[Chorus: Bei Major & R. Kelly]
Once shawty on center of the stage, showin me love
I was so amazed throwin' up dubs (Dubs)
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch (I just wanna touch)
Maybe catch a grub, like it's only us
In the middle of the stage, showin me love (In the middle of the stage)
I was so amazed throwin' up dubs
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch (Baby what it is)
Maybe get some...
Not so long ago, I packed my bags a hundred times
Didn't seem to know how to stop or to unwind
Goin' nowhere, a man without a dream

Guess my lucky star fell the day you came along
To my lonely heart you are like a special song
Singing sweetly your tender melody

Thanks to you
The child in me lives again
Thanks to you
I have found a peace within
I know where I'm goin' and what I want to do
Thanks to you

Lying in you arms I found my greatest pleasure
I look into your eyes and dream about forever

Wakin' up with you and lookin' forward to the day
What we plan to do, knowin' anything at all's okay
A life has a meaning
Love has got a name
Thanks to you
The child in me lives again
Thanks to you
I have found a peace within
I know where I'm goin' and what I want to do
Thanks to you

Thanks to you
The child in me lives again
Thanks to you
I have found a peace within
I know where I'm goin' and what I want to do
Thanks to you
Well, well, well, well, well, well
Ooh yeah, oh yeah, hmm listen

Baby, I know that you really think he loves you
And it would hurt you so if you knew the things that I knew, baby
'Cause I see the things that he does behind your back
And I ask myself, how can he treat you like that?
'Cause if I had your love I'd never let you go and I just don't know

How could he hurt you?
(How could he hurt you?)
How could he treat you so bad?
(How could he treat you so bad?)
How could he lie to you?

How long can it take for you to see the pain he's causing you?

If I had your love I'd do the things that he don't do
(If I had your love, he don't do)
He plays you for a fool 'cause he thinks you need him
(He plays you for a fool, oh yeah)
But if you let me, let me, I said I'll show you what love's all about
How could he hurt you?

Blues shadows fallin', since my baby went away
Blues shadows fallin', since my baby went away

[Verse 1]
You say you're living in a world of trouble
All your schemes have popped like a bubble
Your mother told your sister
And your brother told your friend
Now your secret's out, and you don't have to pretend
You can see for yourself, it's really not the end

[Chorus]
You're standing there with tears in your eyes
There's too much going on now, there's no time to cry

[Verse 2]
You say the walls are closing in on you, child
All your friends have put you in exile
Bad luck seems to follow you all around the world
You can't seem to find no peace of mind, girl
You will take a chance to seem so bad

[Chorus]
You're standing there with tears in your eyes
There's too much going on now, there's no time to cry

[Bridge]
Every minute is a brand new day
And there are some games that I'd just love to play
Even bad scenes are for real, there's no time to cry

[Verse 3]
Since you left your old scene behind you
Go ahead and let the green light find you
It's warm and friendly, girl, and it won't blind you
Come out in the street and the weeds won't grind you
See the love is in the air, you feel it all around you

[Chorus]
You're standing there with tears in your eyes
There's too much going on now, no time to cry

[Bridge]
Your yesterdays are all left behind
There's a brand new light in your mind
You don't need a key to define
What's written on the magic sign
There's no time to cry

[Verse 4]
When the season of the magic lantern
Is transformed into a funny pattern
And the wheel of fortune has a flat tire
You can't seem to get any higher
When you go above the machine, you find a horseshoe

[Chorus]
You're standing there with tears in your eyes
There's too much going on now, no time to cry
Need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, whoa, I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad

I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up - to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low - and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad

So why don't you give it up, baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman - so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me - and stop drivin' me mad
Whoa, because I - I need your love so bad

Need a soft voice - just to talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, come on bring it to me
'Cause I need - your love so bad
Baby, I need, I need - woman, I need your love so bad

[Verse 1: David Ruffin]
(Remember me) The one who heard your cries
And reached out and dried your eyes
(Remember me) The one who found you and wrapped all my love around you
When you were all alone and your dreams were all gone
When you had nothing but a tear-stained face, I took you in
Now your broken wing is mended and your need for me has ended
Now you say you must be free
You wanna fly away from me
You were lost yesterday, I gave you my tomorrow
Now you're leaving me in sorrow
And you're telling me you're sorry, but hey

[Chorus: The Temptations & David Ruffin]
Sorry is a sorry word after all I've done for you
Bbay, sorry is a sorry, sorry word when I need a love that's true
You're telling me, baby, but listen

[Verse 2: David Ruffin]
How could sympathy be all you feel for me
After all the sweet love I've given to you, given you, baby
Girl, you walk away with the best of me
The love I gave to you, you give it to someone new
And sorry won't end this misery
(Remember me) Who took your hand
Held you up and made you stand
(Remember me) The one whose love you shared
The one who really cares
Now you've turned away from me to say that you're sorry
That it had to be, baby, that sorry it had to be
But

[Outro: The Temptations & David Ruffin]
Sorry is a sorry word after all I've done for you
Sorry is a sorry, sorry word when I need, when I need a love that's true
Baby, sorry, sorry, sorry is a sorry word
But it won't mend my broken heart
You don't know how much I love you
You don't know how much I care
You don't know how much I need you
Without you life I can't bear
You don't know
You don't know baby
You don't know how much I love you
And you can't know just how I feel

The flame is still burnin'
Burnin' deep down in my soul
When I think of your love and kisses
It makes my blood run cold
You don't know baby
You don't know baby
Yes you don't know how much I love you
And you can't know just how I feel

All my friends call me crazy
For acting the way that I do
But I just can't help myself
'Cause I'm so in love with you
You don't know
Yes baby you don't know
You don't know how much I love you
And you can't know just how I feel
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know baby
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know baby
You don't know

Yes you don't know how much I love you
And you can't know just how I feel

Who's the funky drummer with the crooked little sticks? (Sticks)
He might have better luck if he was drummin' with his dick (Dick?)
If you don't play the piccolo, why you wanna lick?
Now check the drum solo and tell me not to kick it

[Solo]
(Seek and destroy)
(It'll fuck you up)

I love the taste of unpredictable licks
A loop is a loop is a loop, uh!
A loop is a loop is a loop, uh! (Fuck that)
A loop is a loop is a loop is a loop is a loop is a loop is a loop

[Intro]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-hey
Hey

[Verse 1]
I say let us put man and a woman together
To find out which one is smarter
Some say man, but I say no
The women got the men beat, they should know

[Chorus]
And not me, but the people they say
That the man are leading the women astray
But I say that the women of today
Smarter than the man in every way

[Post-Chorus]
That's right, the woman is, uh, smarter
That's right, the woman is, uh, smarter
That's right, the woman is, uh, smarter
That's right, that's right

Ah, ever since the world began
Woman was always teaching man
And if you listen to my bid attentively
I goin' tell you how she smarter than me

[Chorus]
And not me, but the people they say
That the man are leading the women astray
But I say that the women of today
Smarter than the man in every way

[Verse 3]
Samson was the strongest man long ago
No one could a-beat him, as we all know
Until he clash with Deliah on top of the bed
She told him all the strength was in the hair of his head

[Chorus]
And not me, but the people they say
That the man are leading the women astray
But I say that the women of today
Smarter than the man in every way

[Post-Chorus]

Hey, you meet a girl at a pretty dance
Thinkin' that you would stand a chance
Take her home, thinkin' she's alone
Open de door
You find her husband home

Not me, but the people they say
That the man are leading the women astray
But I say that the women of today
Smarter than the man in every way

[Post-Chorus]
That's right, the woman is, uh, smarter
That's right, the woman is, uh, smarter
That's right, the woman is, uh, smarter

[Verse 5]
I was treatin' a girl independently
She was makin' baby for me
When de baby born and I went to see
Eyes was blue
It was not by me

[Chorus]
And not me, but the people they say
That the man are leading the women astray
But I say that the women of today
Smarter than the man in every way

[Outro]
Oh, yes, smarter

Feels so good to me, girl
Keep on doin' whatcha doin', lady
Ooh, you feel so good to me
Girl, I went to see my doctor and he told me
Well, from your lovin' I've got to stay away
He told me to let you go for my heart can't stand much mo'
And there oughta be a law against lovin' a man this way
Aww, but I can't get enough of your lovin', no, Lord
And my need keeps getting stronger every day
Girl, I've got just one life to live and a lotta love to give and give
And let it be known that I ain't ashamed to say

Oh, yeah, baby, baby

[Verse 2: Dennis Edwards]
When it comes to lovin', you're one of a kind
Satisfaction guaranteed, every doggone time, whoa, baby
You ain't got to worry about me ever leaving you
'Cause they ain't made a woman yet that can do the things you do
Oh, oh
When you press your sweet lips to mine, oh baby
My blood starts boiling and my temperature starts to rise
Girl, I shudder, baby, and I ain't ashamed to admit it
And even if it kills me, girl, I don't want you to quit it

[Chorus: Dennis Edwards & (The Temptations)]
You've got my soul on fire, oh yeah, baby

I walk in my bedroom floor
I hung my head and cry
I gotta find my baby
You know I can‘t be satisfied
I gotta find my baby
I declare I wouldn't lie
You know if I don‘t find my baby
I believe I‘m gonna lose my mind

Yeah she‘s a fine lookin' woman
Her shape is a dream
She‘s the loveliest woman people
I declare I ever seen
I gotta find my baby
I declare I wouldn't lie
You know if I don‘t find my baby
I believe I‘m gonna lose my mind

I walk in my bedroom floor
Hung down my head and cry
You know I'm crazy 'bout my woman
And I just can‘t be satisfied
I gotta find my baby
I declare I wouldn't lie
You know if I don‘t find my baby
I believe I‘m gonna lose my mind
You know I got to got to
I got to find my baby
Hey yes I say
I gotta find my woman
I gotta find my woman
If I don't find my woman
I think I‘m going out of my mind
For all we know we may never meet again
Before you go make this moment sweet again
We won't say goodnight until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it

For all we know this may only be a dream
We come and go like a ripple on a stream
So love me tonight tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come for all we know

For all we know this may only be a dream
We come and go like a ripple on a stream
So love me tonight tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come for all we know
Swing low sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home

I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Comin' for to carry me home
A band of angels comin' after me
Comin' for to carry me home

If you get there before I do
Comin' for to carry me home
Tell all my friends I'm a coming too
Comin' for to carry me home

Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down
Comin' for to carry me home
But still my soul feels heavenly bound
Comin' for to carry me home
You may not be an angel
'Cause angels are so few
But until the day that one comes along
I'll string along with you
I'm looking for an angel
To sing my love song to
And until the day that one comes along
I'll sing my song to you

For every little fault that you do have
Say, I've got three or four
The human little faults that you do have
Just make me love you much more

You may not be an angel
But still I'm sure you'll do
So, until the day that one comes along, baby
I'll string along with you

You may not be an angel
But still I'm sure that you'll do
So, until the day that one comes along
Baby, I'll string along with you
She was a level-headed dancer on the road to alcohol
I was just a soldier on my way to Montreal
She pressed her chest against me
About the time the juke box broke
She gave me a peck on the back of the neck
These are the words she spoke

Blow up your TV throw away your paper
Move to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try an' find Jesus on your own

I sat there at the table and I acted real naive
I knew that topless lady had something up her sleeve
She danced around the bar room
And she did the hoochy-coo
Sang her song all night long
Tellin' me what to do

Blow up your TV throw away your paper
Move to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try an' find Jesus on your own
Well, I was young and hungry, just about to leave that place
Just as I was goin', she looked me in the face
I said you must know the answer
She said, no but I'll give it a try
To this very day we've been livin' our way
And here is the reason why

We blew up our TV threw away our paper
Move to the country, built us a home
Had a lot of children, fed 'em on peaches
They all found Jesus on their own

Blow up your TV throw away your paper
Move to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try an' find Jesus on your own
Haha, I get it down on the dance floor
Watch this, hey
You don't even know girl
Come here
You know what I do (do)
If you can do it too (too)
Then that's just something that makes me more attracted to you
And I, and I
Wanna see you break it down
For me (ha)
Yes, we in this private (party)
Girl I like your body (body)
But can you tic, tic, tic, tic, tic, tic, pop, lock and drop it
Cause I, and I wanna see you break it down
For me
Watch this

[Chorus]
Girl I've been waiting all night to see you dance like me
And you gonna sweat your outfit out, trying to dance like me
(Now let me see), Ah ah ah, now freeze, like me, oh
Shorty
Girl I want a battle
Meet me downstairs
Bring your dancing shoes and something to tie you hair
Cause I, cause I'm about to break it down, on you
I see you with you friends
You don't wanna get embarrassed
I know you see my bling, bling
Check out the carrots
Cause I, I'm bout to break it down on you

[Chorus]
Girl lets get it popping (cracking)
Tell me how you feel (feel)
Lets get up on this floor and do this thing for real (whoa)
Cause we (we), you and me (me), can really break it down, together
Watch me slide on ya (on ya)
Watch me ride on ya (on ya)
You ain't gotta say it
You think I'm fly, don't ya
Cause we (we), you and me(me), can really break it down oh oh oh

[Chorus]
Yeah Lamborghini breezy
Or graffiti breezy
It's easy
Hey
I just want you to relax
And now my ladies pop, popping
Drop dropping
One, two, three, four, freeze, ha ha ha ha

[Chorus]
I'm coming round and now my vision is so clear
If I could change my state of mind, then I would disappear
The love I get from you is something I can't chance
And I could let you slip away, without a second glance

Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!
Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!

This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory x2

This is like a flashback
Flashback
This is like a flashback
Flashback

Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!
Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaaah, Woaaaah!
This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory x2

[Intro]
The Dogg Pound and the LBC, your baby is awaiting you

[Female]
That's that damn Snoop Dogg again, he ain't nothin' but a fuckin' pimp!

[Snoop Dogg & Kid]
Man snoop you got a bad car, when I grow up I wanna be just like you!
Look here little homeboy, let me tell you something
Don't let me ever hear you say you wanna be like me
You could be a doctor, a lawyer, a football player, a Laker, anything!
Just don't let me ever hear you say you want to be like me
You hear me?
Yah Huh!
Now take these dollars and go give em to your brothers and sisters! And you run on to school!
Thanks Snoop!
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying
Lay down all thought, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining
Then you may see the meaning of within
It is speaking, it is speaking

That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing
When ignorance and haste may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living
Or play the game, existence to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
I want to play in the World Game
I want to make it better it's ever been before
I want to play in the World Game
I want to make sure everybody knows the score
About using less, doing so much more

Everywhere I'm going I see trouble
Everywhere I'm looking I see all kinds of pain
Maybe we can get back on the double
Maybe we can turn around and make it all change
They say it's you against your neighbor
If it gets right down to it, you against your friend
I swear that this is not the answer
As far as I can see it is the way it all ends

I want to play in the World Game
I want to make it better it's ever been before
I want to play in the World Game
I want to make sure everybody knows the score
About using less and doing so much more
Hey man, you know me I don't worry
Hey man, you know me I am never afraid
Only one thing can make me sorry
Something to say and then it never gets said
What kind of man turns on his brother
What kind of man turns his back on a friend
Who has the right to say it's over
Who has the right to see how far it can bend

I want to play in the World Game
I want to make it better it's ever been before
I want to play in the World Game
I want to make sure everybody knows the score
About using less, doing so much more

Yaweh yaweh yaweh jah
Yaweh yaweh yaweh jah
Yaweh yaweh yaweh jah
Yaweh yaweh yaweh jah

You and me you and me
You and me you and me

I and I - I and I
I and I - I and I
I want to play in the World Game
I want to make it better it's ever been before
I want to play in the World Game
I want to make sure everybody knows the score
About using less, doing so much more
Earth shares what Earth receives
And now only blood brings life
A tiller bring life, producer bring life
Protector bring life, soiled hands bring life

The tree of democracy shall be watered by the blood of revolution
So go plant a seed, go plant a seed for harvest
Go plant a seed for harvest producer

Producer, producer, producer, producer
Producer, producer, producer, producer
Producer, producer, producer, producer
Producer, producer, producer, producer
Producer, producer, producer, producer
Producer, producer

And it all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall
It all shall fall
I first met you and the ideas you uphold while incarserated A victim of a social experiment
Eventually addicted to your eight hour injections of hypocracy and arrogance and greed
Forced to sit with coplicity in front of my executioners
As they blugeoned me with their so called superior values and demanded my submission
I bacame an indentured servant in a factory
Where I myself was the product
Whos' useful quality was to protect their palaces
Every word uttered from their mouths strangeled me

So that every thought I express
Shall sow the seed for the noose around their necks
And set fire to their homes

And every word uttered from their mouths strangeled me
So that every thought I express
Shall sow the seed for the noose around their necks
And set fire to their homes

And set fire to their homes
And set fire to their homes
And set fire to their homes
And set fire to their homes

And it all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall
Fall
Fall
Fall

Fall
Fall
Fall
Fall
I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have spring fever
When it isn't even spring

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walkin' down a strange new street
And hearing words that I've never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams
Spinning, spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud
Or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring
It might as well be spring
Oh I, baby what a fool I am
First a boy and then a man
And I and you
You're the heart of that all
You're the things I say and do
And I'm wasting my time hanging around
You would be gone
But I can't help it
Every moment that I think about you
Every day and every night without you
I can't survive
Love, take away the lonely days gone by
Make it every day for you and I
Given me a chance to go on believing
Girl, you gotta go on believing
Boy, you gotta go on believing
You, baby all the breath I take
Coming from the heart in love
And I and you
You're the heart of it all
You're the things I say and do
And I'm wasting my time hanging around
You would be gone
But I can't help it
Every moment that I think about you
Every day and every night without you
I can't survive
Love, take away the lonely days gone by
Make it every day for you and I
Given me a chance to go on believing
Boy, you gotta go on believing
I can't help it
Every moment that I think about you (every moment)
Every day and every night without you (every day and night)
I can't survive
Love, take away the lonely days gone by
Make it every day for you and I
Given me a chance to help it, help it
Every moment that I think about you (every moment)
Every day and every night without you (every day and night)
I can't survive
So in Love, Sad as can Be
'cause apretty Face got the best of me
Suddenly you came into my life
And gave it meaningand pure delight
Now good looks I've learned to do without
'Cause I knpw that it's love that really counts

'cause I know that...
Beauty's only skin deep, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know that
Beauty's only skin deep yes indeed

Now you speak your words warm and sincere
And let's me know that your love is near
A preety face you may not possess
But what I like about you is your tenderness
A pretty face may be some guys taste
But I'll take love'in in it's place

'Cause I know
That beauty's only skin deep yeh, yeah, yeah
And you know that
Beauty's only skin deep oh baby, oh yeah
(oh yeah, oh yeah)

My friends Ask, what do I see in you
But it goes deeper than the eye can view

And that's a ever rare lovin' quality
Now show me girl, a girl that's fine
And I'll choose the one with true lovin' every time

I know that...
Beauty's only skin deep Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I believe that...
Beau- know thatbeauty's only skin deep

So if your lookin for a lover(oh yeah)
Don't judge a book by it's cover(oh, yeah)
She may be fine on the outside(oh yeah)
But so untrue on the inside(oh yeah)
Ooo
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
Oh you and me girl
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
Then my life, I can see beyond forever
Everything we are will never die
Loving's such a beautiful thing
Oh you make my world, a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
You and me girl got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night and day
And the tears you had to cry
You're my life
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we are will never die
Loving's such a beautiful thing
When you are to me, the light above
Made for all to see our precious love
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
Love is such a beautiful thing
You make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river
And harder to climb
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
You've been sweet, you've been good
I've been better than you ever cook
I've been yours, you've been mine
Don't be kind

You got dreams, I've got plans
I'll be gone before you understand
I betrayed, you've been blind
Don't be kind

(Don't be kind)
Shoot it straight as an arrow
(Don't be kind)
To the quick, to the marrow
You can say what you've got on your mind
Don't be kind

We've been friends, we've been folks
We've been lovers clinging so close
We've believed but not this time
Don't be kind
When you hurt me, oh, you hurt me
Then you feel you must be nice
Well, it's bad enough to take it once
Being kind makes it twice

It's been great, it's been real
It's been soft as silk and tough as steel
You be yours and I'll be mine
Don't be kind

(Don't be kind)
Shoot it straight as an arrow
(Don't be kind)
To the quick, to the marrow

You can say what you've got on your mind
Don't be kind
Don't be kind
You can say what you got on your mind

(Don't be kind)
Shoot it straight as an arrow
(Don't be kind)
To the quick, to the marrow

You can say what you've got on your mind
Don't be kind
Don't be kind
You can say what you've got on your mind
Don't be kind
Don't be kind
You can say what you've got on your mind
Don't be kind
Don't be kind
TT: My lovin' heart would shake
More than the earth could break
If you should ever go
You know my heart would break
MG: If I lost your sweet embrace
Even time could not erase
The memories of you
Tears would cover up my face

CHORUS:
BOTH: Oh how I'd miss you, baby
MG: I need you so
BOTH: Oh how I'd miss you
TT: Baby never go
MG: I'll never leave
TT: My world would cease to be
Without the love you give to me
The chains around my heart
Would never set me free
MG: When my life had just begun
My sky didn't have a sun
You fill my every need
So if you ever leave
(chorus)
(Backing, x2):
(Oh how I'd miss you, baby baby)
MG: Oh you're always on my mind
Losin' you would leave me blind
Fill my heart forevermore
Never leave my love behind

To you I'll always cling
If you took away your love
It would be the end of things, &...
BOTH: Oh how I'd miss you

TT: Marvin, I need you so
BOTH: Oh how I'd miss you

I found love on a two way street
And lost it on a lonely highway
Love on a two way street
Lost it on a lonely highway

True love will never die
So I've been told, but now I must cry
And it's finally goodbye, I know

With music softly playing
Her lips were gently saying "I love you"
She held me in desperation
I thought it was a revelation, then she walked out

How could I be so blind
To give my love for the very first time
To be fooled is a hurting thing
To be loved and fooled is a crying shame
While I bear the blame
As she laughs my name
With music softly playing
Her lips were gently saying "Honey, I love you."
She held me in desperation
I thought it was a revelation, then she walked out

I found love on a two way street
And lost it on a lonely highway
Love on a two way street
Lost it on a lonely highway
Love on a two way street
I lost it on a lonely highway
Love on a two way street

[Verse 1]
At the corner of 53rd
And the summer of '62
The first time I felt the tug
Of what I call the thread of you

[Verse 2]
There at the Lever House
Street map across our thighs
Tracing the gateway
Leaning in close I'm feeling your fingertip

[Chorus]
This time, this place
This state of grace
The promise of tomorrow
Your thread runs through
Park Avenue
Street of dreams and sorrow

[Verse 3]
Seven years up the road
And two blocks south
On the run from a sudden rain
With too much to talk about
On our knees we choose
To end in St. Bartholomew's

[Chorus]
This time, this place
This fall from grace
The promise of tomorrow
Your thread runs through
Park Avenue
Street of dreams and sorrow

[Bridge]
This town is my every day
But sometimes the grand design
Marries a common road to an uncommon time

[Verse 4]
By the Waldorf Astoria
At 49th and now
Out of the uptown flood
Your face appears somehow
In a passing car
Wearing a tiny scar

[Chorus]
This time, this place
This state of grace
The promise of tomorrow
Your thread runs through
Park Avenue
Street of dreams and sorrow

Five long days and I'm tired of working
I'm going to see my boss today
In fifteen minutes I'll be on the train
'Cause I just got my pay

Now I could take and sock away my dough
And make me six percent a year
But it's not much fun to wait around for that
When I can spend it while it's here

Ah
Let's get dressed up
And see a movie

I like spending my money
And I like having a good time
Good times sure make me happy
And I'm so happy
'Cause I just got my pay

Monday morning I'm up and at it
Those last two days were good for my soul
It's time to do my working thing
I'm late so I got to roll
My take home comes to 'bout ninety-five
And my boss is giving me some praise
If it weren't for me the place would fall apart
I think I'll hit him up for a raise
(Hit 'im up get a raise)

Ah
Let's get undressed
And climb in bed too

I like spending my money
And I like having a good time
Good times sure make me happy
And I'm so happy
'Cause I just got my pay

[Chorus]
Sex me baby
Sex me not
Come to the afterparty
Let's make it hot
Leave your sister and your underwear at home
Ain't gonna stop until everybody gone

[Verse 1]
Mmmm
Front row center
With the out-stretched hands
More chill around your wrist
Than the ice-cream man
Speaking of which
You say you like it
You say you like it when I scream
I like it when you do too
Ooohhhh, uh huh
Looky here now
Looky here now
Look at my hips
(look at my hips)
I'm about to do something
To make your backbone slip
And when I get through
You will be confused
Should you take another pill after morning?
Or play the fool?

[Chorus]
Sex me baby
Sex me not
Come to the afterparty
Let's make it hot
Leave your sister and your underwear at home
Ain't gonna stop until everybody gone

[Verse 2]
Come and get happy
When I know u are here

Everybody that came to see me dance
Jump back, watch me, I'm about to wet your pants

[Verse 3]
I don't need to break any vows to get ya hot
I don't need to break open bottles, you high a lot
Pheromone rushin' like smokin' pot
Like smokin' pot, I think not
Roll up and drag in front of my groove
I move any scag to a "life of repentance"
Why you trippin' on the last three words of this sentence?
I'll be out on bail paid by Caucasians
Sex me, baby
That be his law till the chocolate invasion come
Uh, I wanna have fun, see?

[Chorus]
Sex me baby
Sex me not
Come to the afterparty

Leave your sister and your underwear at home
Ain't gonna stop until everybody gone

[Verse 4]
I'll make a lot of money, uh, and give it all to you

If you choose right and do what you're supposed to do
Black pepper, grind you please
Make a brother happy
Where?
On ur knees
Ho ho ho ho
Sex me
Hold me tight, uh, choke the bird
Sex me
Choke it
And when the needle drop
The groove you're gonna hear'll make you never wanna stop, you heard

[Chorus]
Sex me baby
Sex me not
Come to the afterparty

Leave your sister and your underwear at home
Ain't gonna stop until everybody gone

Sex me baby

Far away when the day is raining
Far away when the sky is blue
Anytime at all
Take Me Away from it all
Take Me Away

Long ago, where the Western breezes
Used to blow here into my heart
I would hear you call
Take Me Away from it all
Take Me Away. (Take Me Away.)
Take Me Away from it all
Take Me Away

(Love is like a melody we simply can't forget
A sad and happy memory we never shall regret
The magical duet.)
Far away when the day is sleeping
Far away where a starry sky waits for you to call
Take Me Away from it all
Take Me Away. (Take Me Away.)
Take Me Away from it all
Take Me Away. (Take Me Away.)

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
What is this news you've got to tell me?
Girl, What has got you so excited?
Why Would you call me on my job
When I'm right in the middle of writing?
See, you've got this look upon your face
Spit it out, girl, I just cannot wait
To get whatever it is up out of you
So tell me, girl, What it do?

[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly & Sheri Hauk]
I'll give you a hint
It crawls 'fore it walks
In a couple of years
It begins to talk
And it makes us so happy
Girl, are you telling me...

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Sheri Hauk]
I'm havin' a baby
Oh, I'm so happy
I'm havin' a baby
And I'm so glad to be that baby's daddy
I'm havin' a baby
A little girl, a little boy, a little you, a little me
I'm havin' a baby
Girl, it doesn't matter as long as it's healthy

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
While I can't believe I'm gonna be a father
In 9 months, a child will be born
Baby, you're pregnant in April
Which means we're havin' a Capricorn
I'm so glad to be a part of this
'Cause girl, a child is heaven sent
This is a blessing to me
To have you bear my seed

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Sheri Hauk]
I'm havin' a baby
Girl, I'm so glad that...
I'm havin' a baby
And I'm so proud to be that baby's daddy
I'm havin' a baby
A little girl, a little boy, a little you, a little me
I'm havin' a baby
Girl, it doesn't matter just as long as it's healthy

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
Girl, you got me staring at you from head to toe (head to toe)
When I look at you, it's like you've got this glow
So much respect I got for you
Girl, since you told me what's good
Ever since you told me, I love you more
Girl, what I feel is so spiritual
And baby, our lives have been changed
Now I want you to have my last name

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Sheri Hauk]
I'm havin' a baby
Girl, I'm so glad...
I'm havin' a baby
And I'm so proud to be that baby's daddy
I'm havin' a baby
Said a little boy, a little girl, a little you, a little me
I'm havin' a baby
Girl, it doesn't matter, and now here it is, 9 months later

[Outro: R. Kelly & Sheri Hauk]
I'm havin' a baby

Aw baby let me tell U how
What U think about me
Tworkin' U from your front to your backend
Kick back in relax come sit up on my lap shorty
Tonight I'm takin' U all the way
Won't stop till U scream my name
Chorus 2x Bridge
Moring is coming and I don't want to let U go
Let's just lay here in this bed of red rose petals
I know that we're spent but
One kiss can make this start all over again
If U want it baby come with me
Verse3
It's way too treal
The way U making me feel
The way you're tworkin' is oh so sexy
Ooh baby U sure love to ball
It's way too treal
The way you're tworkin' is oh so sexy
Ooh baby U sure love to ball
Chorus- Ad Libs
I try to see through your eyes
But life keeps changing the view
Are we so unalike?
It's a boy's life after all..
It's a boy's life
After all

Have I really forgotten
The way I felt at fifteen?
When things were taken for granted
It's a boy's life after all...
It's a boy's life
After all
Let's get lost, lost in each other's arms
Let's get lost, let them send out alarms
And though they'll think us rather rude
Let's tell the world we're in that crazy mood

Let's defrost, in a romantic mist
Let's get crossed, off everybody's list
To celebrate this night we found each other
Darling, let's get lost

Let's get lost in a romantic mist
Let's get crossed, off everybody's list
To celebrate this night we found each other
Darling, let's get lost

[Chorus 1: Damon]
M1-A1, thousand miles an hour
Gorillaz got the bass drum
Gorillaz say they want some
M1-A1, thousand miles an hour
Gorillaz got the bass drum
Gorillaz say want some, some

[Chorus 2]
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la, hey
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la, hey
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la, hey

[Chorus 1: Terry Hall & Damon]
M1-A1, thousand miles an hour
Gorillaz got the bass (Ba-) drum
Gorillaz say want some

Gorillaz got the bass drum (Drum)
Gorillaz say want some

[Chorus 2]
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la, hey
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la, hey
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la, hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
M1-A1, thousand miles an hour
Gorillaz got the bass drum
Gorillaz say want some
M1-A1, thousand miles an hour
Gorillaz got the bass drum
Space Monkeyz say want some
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Ooh everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worryin' baby, yeah it's you I hate to lose

Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Well worries and trouble darling, babe you know I've had my share

Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worryin' baby, yeah it's you I hate to lose

Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Well worries and trouble darling, babe you know I've had my share

I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on down the line
I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on down the line
Where there ain't nobody worryin', and there ain't nobody cryin'
He don't care
Where he's been playing
He doesn't hear
A word she's saying
She's a fancy girl
So why's she staying
Hanging on for Mr. Wrong
He doesn't show her that he needs her
She doesn't know his love's a liar
She'a a fancy girl - got to be strong
Say so long - Mr. Wrong

Get out on your own girl
Show him how
You can be strong girl
You don't need him now
Run away, pretty girl
Say so long - Mr. Wrong

Run away
Bye bye

[Intro]
Hey Mom! It's me again. It's still going in here. I can still do this. Listen, Jack and I have discovered a lot of the old songs that I, that I, that we've rediscovered all of the songs that I used to sing at uh, you know at Grosvenor when we were together there. And uh, you know the records I used to play? We've discovered a lot of these. So I'm gonna send some of these to you. 

[Verse 1]
If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe

[Bridge]
Someone like you makes it hard to live
Without somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give
Never thinking of myself

[Verse 2]
If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd find a way to leave the past behind
Knowing how you lied straight faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe

[Outro]
Someone like you makes it hard to live
Without somebody else

[Verse 1]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows
A turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Bridge]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Verse 2]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two, yes
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you, yes

[Outro]
Ah, and so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two, yeah
Although it's been said many times and many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you
Are you wearing old dreams, breaking out at the seams
These should be new
And have I got a bargain, you lucky people you
Here's the hollyhock scent makes the lady you send feel well-to-do
And the price fits your pocket, you lucky people you
Then here the green velvet landscape and to prove I'm no rogue
I'll add a smart looking rainbow like you see pictured in Vogue
I've a wonderful buy in a wrap-around sky of moonlight blue
And it's yours for a love song, you lucky people you
It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
But when I see you hanging about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry, I wanna die

It's not unusual to go out at any time
But when I see you out and about it's such a crime
If you should ever wanna be loved by anyone
It's not unusual, it happens everyday

No matter what you say
You'll find it happens all the time
Love will never do what you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine

It's not unusual to be mad with anyone
It's not unusual to be sad with anyone
But if I ever find that you've changed at any time
It's not unusual to find that I'm in love with you

Whoa-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-oh
Whoa-whoa

Hey baby
That's alright, people
I know that's alright
Every day, that's alright
Oh, when we love each other
I know that's alright
Oh, feel it, feel it
Oh, everybody feel it
I know that's alright, yeah
Some of us were born
With money to spend
Some of us were born
For races to win
Some of us are aware
That it's good for us to care
Some of us feel the icy wind
Of poverty blowing in the air
For those of us who simply like to socialize
For those of us who tend the sick
Ah, and heed the people's cries
Let me say to you

[Chorus]
Right on
Oh, right on, feel it, yeah
Oh, oh, oh Lord, Lord, people
And I say right on, right on
Honey, right on, woo, woo, woo

[Verse 2]
For those of us who live
Where, where peace is craved
For those of us who live, mhm
Where hatred is enslaved, alright
For those of us who live a life, yeah
Surrounded by good fortune and wealth
Talk about it
Those of us who live a life
Hey, hey, hey, enjoying ourselves
For those of us who got drowned
In the sea of happiness
For the soul that takes pride in his God
And himself and everything else
Love
That's all it is
We need love
That's all it is
Oh, oh
Love, love

[Outro]
Ah, can you love? I need love
Love, love
Love is the thing
Love, love, love, love
Sweet love, love
Wonderful love
Ah, true love, love
Love for your brother
Love for God
Love, pure love
Love can conquer hate every time
Give out some love and you'll find peace sublime
And my darlin', one more thing
If you let me, I will take you
To live where love is King
Woo, ah, ah baby, baby
Ah baby
People, people
People who love and care
Ooh, that's alright
Alright
Ah, ah...

[Verse 1]
Every picture has its shadows and it has some source of light
Blindness, blindness and sight
The perils of benefactors, the blessings of parasites
Blindness, blindness and sight

[Chorus 1]
Threatened by all things, devil of cruelty
Drawn to all things, devil of delight
Mythical devil of the ever-present laws
Governing blindness, blindness and sight

[Verse 2]
Suntans in reservation dining rooms, pale miners in their lantern rays
Night, night and day
Hostage smiles on presidents, freedom scribbled in the subway
It's like night, night and day

[Chorus 2]
Threatened by all things, god of cruelty
Drawn to all things, god of delight
Mythical god of the everlasting laws
Governing day, day and night

[Verse 3]
Critics of all expression, judges in black and white
Saying it's wrong, saying it's right
Compelled by prescribed standards or some ideals we fight
For wrong, wrong and right

[Chorus 3]
Threatened by all things, man of cruelty, mark of Cain
Drawn to all things, man of delight born again, born again
Man of the laws, the ever-broken laws
Governing wrong, wrong and right
Governing wrong, wrong and right
Wrong and right
Come to me, come to me, this is the night, our night for ecstacy
A nightingale lifts up its voice and trills to the moon above
Look on the thrills of love here in the night
Hold me dear, closer dear, this is the night, one night to live a year
The wind in the trees heaves a sigh, and whispers "No more goodbye,"
Making me vow that I will not let our love die
Oh my sweet one, my complete one, take my love, this is the night

Hold me dear, closer dear, this is the night, one night to live a year
The wind in the trees heaves a sigh, and whispers "No more goodbye,"
Making me vow that I will not let our love die
Oh my sweet one, my complete one, take my love, this is the night
Who can I turn to
When nobody needs me
My heart wants to know
So I must go
Where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me
And no one beside me
I'll go on my way
And after the day
The darkness will hide me
But maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, steal or borrow
My share of laughter
'Cause with you I could learn to
With you on a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away
With you I could learn to
With you on a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away
We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts, we traverse far
Field and fountain
Moor and mountain
Following yonder star

Oh, star of wonder, star of might
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading
Still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

Born a babe on Bethlehem's plain
Gold we bring to crown him again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign

Oh, star of wonder, star of might
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading
Still proceeding
Guide us to the perfect light
Frankincense to offer have I
Incense owns a deity nigh
Prayer and praising, all men raising
Worship God on high

Oh, star of wonder, star of might
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading
Still proceeding
Guide us to the perfect light
Poinciana, your branches speak to me of love
Pale moon is casting shadows from above

Poinciana, somehow I feel the jungle heat
Within me, there grows a rhythmic, savage beat

Love is everywhere
It's magic perfume fills the air
To and fro you sway
My heart's in time, I've learned to care

Poinciana, from now until the dawning day
I'll learn to love forever, come what may

Love is everywhere
It's magic perfume fills the air
To and fro you sway
My heart's in time, I've learned to care

Poinciana, from now until the dawning day
I'll learn to love forever, come what may
Poinciana
Yeah, uh, feels good, don't it?

Attraction, are you ready
I know you feel it
Pull you nearer ’til you feel it again, oh
I wanna do something right
But we can do something better
Ain’t no time like tonight
And we ain’t trying to save it ’til later
Stay out here living the life
Nobody cares who we are tomorrow

A little something I’ve been wanting to borrow
Tonight the night’s, come on surrender

Your love’s a weapon
Give your body some direction

Then, we could
Take back the night
Come on, use me up until there’s nothing left
Take back the night

Take back the night
Ooh, don’t know when the sun is rising next

So if the feeling’s right, raise your glass and let’s
Take back the night, take back the night

Take back the night, take back the night
You know you gon’ mess around and find out there ain’t no one better
Take back the night, oh
Yeah
Rare, there’s not too many
No one but you and crowded rooms, we can do anything (yeah)
Attraction can drive you crazy
The way you move, you go crazy, that’s incentive for me
I wanna do something right
But we can do something better
Ain’t no time like tonight
And we ain’t trying to save it ’til later
Stay out here living the life
Nobody cares who we are tomorrow
You got that lil’ something I like

[Verse 1]
Give up if you wanna survive
Get oh so alive in your life
Everything falling out the sky on top of you
Now what you do?
Set yourself up now
It's the love of your life
Shallowly on me
All I know, before it's gone
I always feel it's getting you down
If nothing's wrong
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?

[Verse 2]
Give up if you wanna survive
Pick the sound back up
You got to get on the song, lonely
What's the point?
It's funny 'til you're left to kill yourself
In this town
So what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
I'm in trouble today
I feel like push to the Milky Way
Girlfriend dies in jealousy (jealousy)
Talked too long with a girl
My baby's upset, she's angry with me
She thinks that I fell in love

She claims that I'm myself
For I made clear she's longing for me
But when I hear this plan, I try to make her see

Is it love
When I try to understand your feelings
Love, this can't be love

I feel angry with me
When you ignore that I got to be free
Love can be weather behind a fence
I don't think it is good
When love breaks off, you come to be friends
So when I hear that plan, I try to make her see
Is it love
When I try to understand your feelings
Love, this can't be love
Is it love
When I try to understand your feelings
Love, can't be love

Can't be love (be love)
Can't be love

Is it love
When I try to understand your feelings
Love, this can't be love
Is it love
When I try to understand your feelings
Love, can't be love

Is it love
When I try to understand your feelings
Love, this can't be love
Is it love
When I try to understand your feelings
Love, can't be love
What makes a man go crazy when a woman wears her dress so tight
What makes a man go crazy when a woman wears that ol' dress so tight
Must be the same ol' thing that make a tom cat fight all night
Now, why do all the big men try to run a big-legged woman down
Now, why do all the big men try to run a big ol' woman down
Must be the same ol' thing that makes a bulldog a huggling 'round
It's that ol' same thing, now tell me who's to blame
The whole world is fighting about that ol' same thing
What make you feel so good when your baby's in her evening gown
When your baby get a little bit of an evening gown
Must be that same ol' thing that makes a preacher lay his bible down
It's that ol' same thing, it's that ol' same thing
I tell my troubles to the coalman
He's a coalman but he understands
He's not such a very very old man
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He makes a man feel good when he's down
Head is touching the ground
He's going to help you if he can
He's a coalman

I've been waiting for the coalman
He's a whole man and he treats me nice
Ev'rybody needs a coalman
When you're low man , you can get advice
He makes a man feel good when he's down
Head is touching the ground
He's going to help you if he can
He's a coalman

I need her loving so much the feeling is too much to bear
You've got to have somebody, when she's not there
I tell my troubles to the coalman
He's a coalman but he understands
He's not such a very very old man
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He makes a man feel good when he's down
Head is touching the ground
He's going to help you if he can
He's a coalman

I need her loving so much the feeling is too much to bear
You've got to have somebody when she's not there

I tell my troubles to the coalman
He's a coalman but he understands
He's not such a very very old man
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He's gonna help you when he's down
When your head is touching the ground
And he'll help you if he can
He's a coalman
Coalman, coalman , coalman
You are too beautiful
My dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling
That because I had found you
I could have bound you to me

You are too beautiful
For one man alone
One lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own
To see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs?

If on the other hand
I'm faithful to you
It's not from a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool
For beauty
Way down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods, among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin mad of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy, name of Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell

Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
The engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' to the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by, they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy can play

Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny B. Goode
Well, his mama told him: Someday, you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people comin' from miles around
Just to hear you play your music 'til the sun go down
Maybe, someday, your name will be in lights
Sayin': Johnny B. Goode tonight

Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris, Boyz II Men]
I don't give a damn who sees me
It's all about you 'cause you please me
To me you're not just another breezy
(That's how I feel about you)
Some dudes act hard, try to hide it
PDA to the girls they deny it
It's all love when they see you they should try it, shit
(That's how I do with you)
Public display of affection
Whether before or after we're sexin'
No flippin' on you in public, no wild flexin'
You're my angel and I'll be your protection (Yes)
Those are the chicks that I deal with
Don't get the kind of treatment that you get
Matter fact, if they saw me they'd be pissed
'Cause they don't think I know how to do this
But you, miss

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Baby, I just wanna, I just wanna be
All boo'ed up with you
Wherever we are, all I know is
I just wanna, I just wanna be
All boo'ed up with you, yeah

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
Girl, I'm really into you
I'm enjoying the scent of you
The more time that I spend with you
The closer I get to you
It don't matter where we are
In the park, restaurant, or the car
I wanna show the world
That you are everything to me, yeah
The attention that you show me now
Is enough just to hold me down
Whenver I'm not around
And I just can't get to you
It's a mutual thing
'Cause how you feel about me is the same
I hope the way it is now will never change
I like how me and you is arranged

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Shawn Stockman]
Baby, (Baby), I just wanna, I just wanna be
All boo'ed up with you (I just wanna be, baby)
Wherever we are, all I know is (Baby)
I just wanna, I just wanna be
All boo'ed up with you, yeah
(All boo'ed up with you, you, you, ooh ooh)
Baby, I just wanna, I just wanna be
(I just wanna be)
All boo'ed up with you
Wherever we are, all I know is (Oh, oh)
I just wanna, I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
All boo'ed up with you, yeah

[Bridge: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
(Oh, oh) I know sometimes you don't feel beautiful
(Sometimes you don't feel beautiful)
That's why I take some time to let you know (Oh, oh, oh)
How crazy that sounds to me (Sounds so crazy to me)
There's things I see in you that you don't see
And I'm sure there's some things you see in me
That keep this lovin' real, so real
(That keep this lovin' real, oh, oh, baby)

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Baby, I just wanna, I just wanna be
(I just wanna be)
All boo'ed up with you
(All boo'ed up with you)
Wherever we are, all I know is
(All I know)
I just wanna, I just wanna be
All boo'ed up with you, yeah
(All boo'ed up, there's no secret)
Baby, I just wanna, I just wanna be
(I just wanna be)
All boo'ed up with you
(All boo'ed up with you, wherever we are)
Wherever we are, all I know is
I just wanna, I just wanna be
(I just wanna be)
All boo'ed up with you, yeah

[Outro: Wanya Morris]
All boo'ed up with you, yeah
With you, with you
(Baby boo, baby, baby boo, I just wanna be boo'ed up with you)
Boo'ed up with you, oh
(Baby boo, baby, baby boo, I just wanna be boo'ed up with you)
Boo'ed up with you, oh
(Baby boo, baby, baby boo, I just wanna be boo'ed up with you)
(Baby boo, baby, baby boo, I just wanna be boo'ed up with you)
Boo'ed up
See here's the thing

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're actin' like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me?
Hmm, that sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burgulary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some naked peekaboo
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
I'm quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Now here's another bar, I'm coming for the slow gunners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your mom and 'em
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak and Spell way I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I change my name to "Did He Really Just Say That Shit?"
Yep
I'll take a mile if you let me
6-5, 200 plus and so sexy
My legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been tryin' to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

[Verse]
Good god girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you
It's not a scam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan, I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the antidote's under my tongue
Whoa

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Damn

[Intro: Hillel Slovak]
Oh, oh, baby
Why do you want with me?
Why do you want with me?
It'll be all real
All real
Eh

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
About this planet, there is somethin' I know
There's a very big difference between above and below
Friend foe, or bro, leave ya body on the floor
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow
Your animated oral will begin to glow
When you listen to my mind to this time not to grow

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
They'll be fourteen in the alley's man's everyday life
Floating, he's riding his girl 'til he dies by the night
'Cause here, above land, man has laid his plan
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan
We got a government so twisted and bent
Bombs, tanks. and guns is how our money is spent
We got VD, heroin, greed and prostitution
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution
Not to mention. hardcore chemical pollution
If you think a different way, you're in a mental institution
And that's a heartfelt shame
'Cause everyone's crazy, everyone's the same
So, why should only Larry, Curly, and Moe be to blame?

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
Time now to take you to a different place
Where peace-lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space
Groovin' and a-gliddin' as graceful as lace
A never losin'-touch with the ocean's embrace
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none
'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun
No one tells 'em how their life is run
And no one points at 'em with a gun
They have a lot of love for every livin' creature
The smile of a dolphin is a built-in feature
They be movin' in schools, but everyone's the teacher
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you

[Verse 4: Anthony Kiedis]
Back to the land of the policeman
Where he does whatever he says he can
Including hating you because you're a Jew
Or beating black ass, that's nothin' new
Trigger-happy cops, they just like to brawl
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all
They got puke-ridden prisons and sex-sick jails
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail
So support your police, support your local wars
That's the way to open economic doors
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore
We assume the position to sell the ammunition
What the fuck? It's the American tradition
Along with going fishin', apple pies in the kitchen
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?

[Outro: Hillel Slovak]
How did you 

[?]
What do you want to do then that with?
What do you want to do with me?
Why are you using me?

[?] buy your love

[?] a whale
Perhaps love is like a resting place, a shelter from the storm
It exists to give you comfort, it is there to keep you warm
And in those times of trouble when you are most alone
The memory of love will bring you home

Perhaps love is like a window, perhaps an open door
It invites you to come closer, it wants to show you more
And even if you lose yourself and don't know what to do
The memory of love will see you through

Love to some is like a cloud, to some as strong as steel
For some a way of living, for some a way to feel
And some say love is holding on and some say letting go
And some say love is everything, and some say they don't know

Perhaps love is like the ocean, full of conflict, full of pain
Like a fire when it's cold outside, thunder when it rains
If I should live forever, and all my dreams come true
My memories of love will be of you

Love to some is like a cloud, to some as strong as steel
For some a way of living, for some a way to feel
And some say love is holding on and some say letting go
And some say love is everything, and some say they don't know
Gone and got the blues in Paris
Paris blues called Azure-Té
How can I be blue in Paris?
It's easy 'cause you're far away
Can't lose these blues, this azure-té

Sidewalk tables filled with people
Always happy, always gay
Still I'm all alone in Paris
Praying you'll return someday
Can't lose this blues, this azure-té

Montmartre, springtime, Eiffel Tower
Funny taxis, the kids at play
Paris without you is lonesome
Yearning more and more each day
Can't lose these blues, this azure-té

If you knew how much I need you
You'd come back to me to stay
Having you with me in Paris
Really is the only way
To lose this blues, this azure-té
These Paris blues, this azure-té
Well, she comes from Tallahassee, she's got a hi-fi chassis
Maybe looks a little sassy but to me she's really classy
She's my Tallahassee Lassie, down in F.L.A

Well, she dances to the bop, cha-cha rag-a-mop
Dances to the shake, rocks the bunny hop, woh, woh, woh, woh
Well, she dances to the shake, dances to the stroll
Dances to the beat, she can rock and roll

She's my Tallahassee Lassie, oh, she comes from Tallahassee
She's my Tallahassee Lassie, down in F.L.A

Well, she dances to the bop, cha-cha rag-a-mop
Dances to the blues, rocks the bunny hop, woh, woh, woh, woh
Now, she dances to the shake, dances to the stroll
Dances to the beat, she can rock and roll

My Tallahassee Lassie, oh, she comes from Tallahassee
She's my Tallahassee Lassie, down in F.L.A

Oh, come on baby, come on darlin', come on sugar, come on darlin'
Yeah, she's my Tallahassee Lassie, down in F.L.A
Come on baby, come on sugar, come on darlin', come on baby
Oh, she's my Tallahassee Lassie, down in F.L.A

Oh, yeah, come on baby, come on, come on baby
Come on baby, come on darlin'
Oh, she's my Tallahassee Lassie, down in F.L.A
I'd rather dance in the air
Than lie on the ground
I'd rather my open my ears
Than shut out the sound
Travel to the ends of the Earth
And tell you what I found

I rather kneel down and pray
Than scream at the sun
Prefer to know than
To hide from my skeletons
I don't want to sit down and cry
While watching others run

If I missed the bus more than once
I'm not the only one
Don't wanna wait around
For things to come to me
'Cause when my hands are tied
They struggle to be free
And if they steal my eyes
I'll find a new way to see

[Chorus]
The world's forever turning
And there's a thought that never stops burning
If I'm pounding at your door
It's because I'm here to ask for more
The world's forever turning
And there's a thought that never stops burning
If I'm pounding at your door
It's because I'm here to ask for more

Prefer a thousand hellos
To just one goodbye
Prefer the pain of the truth
To a pretty lie
Listen to the words in my head
Although they may not rhyme

Listen to the voice in my heart
Somedays it's so sublime
Don't wanna wait around
For things to come to me
'Cause when my hands are tied
They struggle to be free
And if they steal my eyes
I'll find a new way to see

[Chorus]
The world's forever turning
And there's a thought that never stops burning
If I'm pounding at your door
It's because I'm here to ask for more
The world's forever turning
And there's a thought that's always burning
If I'm pounding at your door
It's because I'm here to ask for more

The world's forever turning
And there's a thought that never stops burning
If I'm pounding at your door
It's because I'm here to ask for more
The world's forever turning
And there's a thought that's always burning
If I'm pounding at your door
It's because I'm here to ask for more
The prodigal son he'd been away awhile
He was workin' his way back home now
Over many a ragged mile
When he finally crossed the river
And his father saw him near
There was a joyful sound for all the world to hear

I listened to what the Good Book said
And it made good sense to me
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'
And people tryin' to be free
Now we got new names and faces
This time around
Gospel changes, Lord
Still goin' down

Jesus--He did not doubt His gift
Though He knew that He had not long to live
He took care of the business
Teaching us how to fly
Then He bowed His head
And laid down to die
I listened to what the Good Book said
And it made good sense to me
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'
And people tryin' to be free
Now we got new names and faces
This time around
Gospel changes, Lord
Still goin' down

Jerusalem I see is standing high
But if you lose your salvation
There'll be no tears left to cry
Now some men worship a golden calf
While others are bought and sold
And if we live like that
Brother we pay the toll

I listened to what the Good Book said
And it made good sense to me
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'
And people tryin' to be free
Now we got new names and faces
This time around
Gospel changes, Lord
Still goin' down

Verse:
The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it

Chorus:
Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?
Mississippi River so big and wide
Blond haired woman on the other side
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
I worked all summer, spring and fall
I had a woman who caused it all
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
I saw her in Dallas and El Paso
Said, "Come back baby, I need you so"
And now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
Mississippi River so big and wide
Blond haired woman on the other side
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 1]
Stop right there
Let me picture you in my mind for the last time
Soon you'll be walking out of my life
Let me gaze upon you for the last time

[Verse 2]
I need something to hold on to
Something to carry me through
All I need is one last look before you go
So I'll have memories where ever I go
One last look before you're gone
So in my heart you'll live on and on

[Verse 3]
Just one last look before we part
So memories of you will fill my heart
Let me remember my whole life through
'Cause my happiest days, I've spent with you
I remember your eyes that was my treasure
Your tender lips that brought me pleasure
Oh, loving you, I don't regret
And all these things I don't want to forget

[Verse 4]
How being without you will be hard to do
But I want, I want what's best for you
I rather see you happy with someone new, baby
Than to bring, bring sorrow to you
As you leave
If you see tears in my eyes, just keep on walking
Don't you worry

[Verse 5]
All these tears you see, are tears of joy
The joy of loving you and knowing you'd loved me
It's given me enough happiness, so true
To last my whole life through
Just one last look before you go
Let sweet memories overflow
So the thought of you will live on and on
Long after, after you're gone

[Verse 6]
If I never see your face again
Never feel your, your embrace again
The happiness I've known with you
Will stay with me, baby
My whole through
Just, just one last look before we part
Just one last look to fill my heart
Just one last look
I don't even know your name
But I love you just the same
If you let me hold your hand
Then I think maybe I can make you understand

If you only, only knew
Just how much I love you
Loving you the way I do
Then you'd take the night to love me too

I'd like the picture on the wall
So please don't let me fall
It's my heart I'm thinkin of
So please, please accept my love

If you let me be your slave
Your love I'll cherish to my grave
And if you should die before I do
I'll, I said I'll, I'll end my life to be with you

Yes I will!
On tomorrow's clear blue skies
If today your heart is weary, if every little thing looks gray
Just forget your troubles and learn to say
Tomorrow is a lovely day
Down in Eastern Australia
I met her
She was wearing a red blue sweater
I asked her who knitted the sweater
She said never mind

[Intro]
Yo, hol' up, you got a dollar for candy?
Y'all don't?
I ain't think so
Uh, yeah, check me out one time

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm at a candy buffet (Uh)
Gumdrops, blow pops, strawberries and grapes (Yeah)
I know you got the flavor (You got the flavor in you, what?)
You all in the mix like a cup of Kool-Aid (Okay)
When I try to kiss ya, put the sugar on my lips
I can't resist, I'm not used to this (Uh-huh, oh)
Can anybody help me why? (Why?)
Shawty got me feeling high (I'm high as a kite)

[Chorus]
You're my now and later, girl (Now and later)
Since you're so good to me
Like a cherry flavor, lifesaver (My lifesaver)
Please don't ever leave
Now and later, girl (Now and later)
Yeah, my candy girl
I can tell you want me close to you (Ooh, ooh)
Baby, I want you all for myself (Ha)

[Verse 2]
They don't understand (Nah)
I consider you as my first real love
Official, authentic, first sho'nuff
From the rough into love (Yeah)
Baby, you changed me (One time), I feel good about you (Two time)
Before the sugar rush, I'd never doubt ya (Huh, how about the third time)
I need you dealing with me, not without me
So baby, get in close to me

[Chorus]
Call me your now and later, girl, ooh (Now and later,)
It feels good to me, baby (My lifesaver)
Please don't ever leave, ha
Now and later (Now and later)
(My candy girl) Candy girl
I can tell you want me close to you
Baby, I want you all for myself (All to myself)

[Bridge]
You don't have to worry, baby, we got forever (All the time in the world)
To keep it grown, baby, it's a good thing, ha
(You're right here)
You're right here and I am always cool with that (Yeah, you know I'm cool)
Candy coated love
Okay, now put your hands up if you in the spot (Oh)
Let me see your now and later drop, hey (Yeah)
'Cause put your hands down playing around (Oh)
Now let me see your now and later drop, what? (Uh-huh yeah)
'Cause put your hands up if you in the spot (Mmm)
Let me see your now and later drop, hey (Mmm, mm)
'Cause put your hands down if you wanna play around (Woah, woah)
I know you wanna see your now and later drop

[Chorus]
Now and later, girl (Now and later)
Feels so good to me
Like a cherry flavor, lifesaver (My lifesaver)
Please don't ever leave
Now and later (Now and later)
Yeah, oh, my candy girl (My girl)
I can tell you want me close to you
Baby, I want you all for myself

[Outro]
I need you, girl, I need you girl (I want you)
Baby, I want you all for myself
Ha, I want you (Put your hands up, put your hands up)
Baby, I want you all for myself (Stop leaning and fronting with the hands up)
Uh-huh, hey
Baby, I want you all for myself (C'mon)
Oh, hey (I see y'all)
Baby, I want you all for myself
Yeah, uh-huh, huh
Treat her like a lady
Ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh-
Ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-
Ooh, yeah, baby
Whoa-whoa-oh-oh
Mmm

Now I'm the kinda guy who don't believe
That chivalry is dead, no
'Cause I believe a woman should be treated
With the utmost respect, mmm-hmm

Don't be afraid, don't turn and walk away
I wanna get to know ya, well
Don't be ashamed, don't say that love's to blame
Just come and look me over

(You'll find a heart)
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, woo-hoo
Now I like openin' doors
Pickin' up 

[Yeah] her hanky (Yeah) off the floor
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)
Light her cigarette if she smokes
Even (Help her with her coat), well
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)

In this world of liberation
It's so easy to forget, mmm
That it's so nice to have a man around
To lend a helping hand, you can bet, bet you can, baby

When I was young, my mama used to say, Boy
A woman's like a flower, with love on her you shower
Ever since that day, her words never went away
I always will remember to treat my baby tender

(You'll find a heart)
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, whoa-ooh-ooh

Now I like openin' doors
Pickin' up (Yeah) her hanky (Yeah) off the floor
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)
She's a bad son-of-a-gun
I'm her lovin' Don Juan
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh-
Whoa-oh-oh-
Hey-hey-
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-baby
Every day, every way
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

(You'll find a heart)
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, whoa-whoa-oh-ooh

Now I like openin' doors
Pickin' up (Yeah) her hanky (Yeah) off the floor
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)
Light her cigarette if she smokes
Even (Help her with her coat), help her out
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)

Compliment her in her hair
Even help her with her chair
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)
Now boy, you should remember
To be a gentleman
Treat her like a lady
(You better) Treat her like (Well), treat her like (Ho)
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like a lady)
Treat her like, treat her like (Hey-ey)
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like a lady)

[Outro]
Treat her like (Well), treat her like
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like a lady)

[Verse 1]
I'm just an oxymoron in a song when I'm straight bent
Intoxicated on sobriety, irony makes sense
I'm tryin' to make a livin', you diein' to pay the rent
Why you lyin' for forgiveness, when I ain't givin' you shit?
My original plan was to live as a starvin' artist but
Starvin' artist die hungry, dress bummy
OMG, LOL, capital HEO
See a lot of 'em talk, half of 'em ain't paid
Know, truthfully I walk it out, like Dre say
Bought my car on 106, but now it's missin' like AJ
I played it smart, with a little to the side
Bought a bar in New York, where I sit and swallow my pride

[Hook]
I'm home and they've been missin' me since I've been gone
That's why your Mrs is been hittin' me on my phone
Little man, had a plan, now he grown, not do along for too long
Sing the song everybody
I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home

[Bridge]
I know I've been gone for too long, but I'm back, homecoming
I know y'all missed me, don't even play, I'm home now though

[Verse 2]
I'm back, your boy did it, look how he shitted on 'em
He's like hard division, consider him a problem
Subtract me from the game, now that's a bad equation
Add the fact, this industry's whack, now check your calculations
He's the equivalent of MC squared
Multiplied by eight kimbos, plain and simple
When I'm not to the nearest tenth hell, it's just a waste of time
I'm stingy, I only make sense to myself
If wealth was the truth, then it should by a man's happiness
Why the hell you think I'm smilin' so hard while I'm rappin' this
Ay Dios fuckin' Mio
The whole world got their eye balls in my keyhole
And that's why I keep the Lysol close by 'cause currency is dirty
Especially when you got it stacked miles high
They say money changed me, that's a no, no
I just don't roll with bums, no hobo

[Hook]
I'm home and they've been missin' me since I've been gone
That's why your Mrs is been hittin' me on my phone
Little man, had a plan, now he grown, not do along for too long
Sing the song everybody
I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home

[Bridge]
Man, Gym Class Heroes is a real problem, you need to recognize that
Y'all was actin' funny while we was gone, now we back

[Verse 3]
You tried livin' in the fast lane but couldn't reach the pedals
Now your so called life not as cool as Jared Ledos
I give this whole rap game a purple tonsil
Now that's what you get for acting hostile
You can bite the hand that feeds you, but when it bites back
You gon' get arrested development cuffs and cardiac
I'm in my prime, going harder than I should so
You little bastards takin' orders like good burger
Spittin' Snapple facts, that's nonsense
Read a couple books and you call yourself concious
The only reason I've been sleeping on music lately
'Cause y'all ain't makin' nuthin', slightly close to entertaining
But that's entertainment, this is history
If you ain't on my level, don't even get at me
Literally, I am what you have been waiting for
Gym Class is now in session, you ain't gotta wait no more

[Hook]
I'm home and they've been missin' me since I've been gone
That's why your Mrs is been hittin' me on my phone
Little man, had a plan, now he grown, not do along for too long
Sing the song everybody
I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home

[Outro]
And there you have it, Gym Class Heroes, baby
Decadence, Cool and Dre, back squad, 08, fuck outta here
How can you stand there smiling
After all you've done
You know it seems to make you happy
When you've hurt someone
Twice before you fooled me
With your deceiving and lying
Come in and close the door
One more time, one more time

Yeah. you've been gone so long
No one knows where
And you said that you still love me
Then show me you care
Because you've got what it takes, sweet mama
To make a man feel fine
So I'll take the word of a liar
One more time, one more time

Girl, you've got me hungry
Losing my mind
I know I'm playing with fire
Getting burned every time
Yes, I'm a fool for you, baby
I can't deny
But I've got to have your sweet love
One more time, one more time
Girl, you've got me hungry
Losing my mind
I know I'm playing with fire
Getting burned every time
Yes, I'm a fool for you, mama
I can't deny
Well, I've got to have your sweet love
One more time, one more time

Yes, I'm her fool once more
I can read her brown eyes
When the rooster crows tomorrow
Well, it's her time to cry
I'm heading down that old road
She lost her free ride
So tonight, I'll take what I paid for
One more time, one more time, one more time!

[Verse 1]
There must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wouldn't vibrate
No I seen her inner eyes
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her I had a girl, nah I didn't lie
Told her this rap game is alright. I'm just getting by
She had a lil weed and we get a lil high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibrate
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe
Boo back in 92' I was just like you
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other guy buy ice to stay cool
Like any other kid that claim they hate school
And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel

[Chorus](2X)
We ball 'til we fall
Hit the mall
After we
Hit don't call
We fill your lives
With nothing but lies
And I would like to
Apologize

But you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be alright
'Cause until the day a real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise

[Verse 2]
Was it something I did wrong?
Yeah I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though, man that hurt yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work yo
And she don't call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me then the call drop hmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges
Never had money so I feel like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry
Trying to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari, and a dinner date with Halle Berry?
When from 50 g's to fifteen hundred in a week
No I'm trying to call..one ring...two rings...seven rings...eight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like she in school and she don't stay here no more
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys
And focus on school full-time to improvise

[Chorus]
No no, you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise. 

[x3]
All of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing cold
I've said all of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing cold
Hey, I've got a new story to tell you this evening, baby
One that ain't never been told

I went to work the other day
But I thought that I would double back
And that car I saw sitting in front of my door
Looked like a brand new, a brand new Cadillac, yeah!

I ain't got none now baby
I think you've been cheating on me
I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some outside help
That I don't think I really need

The iceman came by this morning
And you know he didn't leave no ice
The postman came by later baby
And he didn't even ring twice

I think you've been cheating on me
I think you're running out on me
I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some outside help
That I don't think I really need
Now, I want you to tell the iceman
The next time he'd better leave some ice
And I want you to tell the postman
He'd better ring more than twice

And when I come home from work in the morning
Better still be some groceries on the shelf
I want to tell that slick insurance man
That he'd better write some insurance on his self

Yes, I think you've been cheating on me
I think you're running out on me
I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some help, some help
Some help, I don't really need
In me you see a man alone
Held by the habit of being on his own
A man who listens to the trembling of the trees
With sentimental ease

In me you see a man alone
Behind the wall he's learned to call his home
A man who still goes walking in the rain
Expecting love again

A man not lonely
Except when the dark comes on
A man learning to live with
Memories of midnights that fell apart at dawn

In me you see a man alone
Drinking up Sundays and spending them alone
A man who knows love is seldom what it seems
Only other people's dreams

A man learning to live with
Memories of midnights that fell apart at dawn
In me you see a man alone
Drinking up Sundays and spending them alone
A man who knows love is seldom what it seems
Just other people's dreams
Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learning how
Come on and safari with me
(Come on and safari with...)

Early in the morning we'll be startin' out

There once was a time when I thought if I had a house, I'd be happy
There once was a time when I thought if I had a car, I'd be made

One by one I achieved my ambitions
But didn't feel like I wanted to feel
Didn't feel like I wanted it to feel
I didn't feel like I wanted to feel

I needed a comfort of love
Any place and anytime
I needed a comfort of love
Just to get me some piece of mind, wo-oh

I long for the time when the world is a better place, to be happy
I long for the day when the people who went to sleep, will awake

One by one I improved my conditions
But it doesn't feel like I wanted to feel
Doesn't feel like I wanted it to feel
Doesn't feel like I wanted to feel
I needed the comfort of love
Any place and anytime
I need the comfort of love
To just to get me some piece of mind, wo-oh

I needed a comfort of love
Any place and anytime
I needed a comfort of love
To just to get me some piece of mind

Well, I needed the comfort
I needed the comfort
I needed the comfort of love

I needed the comfort
I needed the comforte
Shakin' sugar from a sugar spoon
Peppermint tea afternoon
Alone, alone, alone

Taking a shower take another nap
Watching television take a bath
Alone, alone, alone

Feel like a book, but I just can't start it
Feel like a lover, brokenhearted
Look in the mirror at the face in the glass
Look like a question no one ever asks

Alone
Like I'm supposed to be
Lone lonely alone
Like I'm supposed to be

Go for a walk, go for a drive
Listen to the stereo stay inside
Alone, alone, alone
Feel like a book, but I just can't start it
Feel like a lover, brokenhearted
Look in the mirror at the face in the glass
Look like a question no one ever asks

Alone
Like I'm supposed to be
Lone lonely alone
Like I'm supposed to be

Shakin' sugar from a tablespoon
Bitter black coffee underneath the moon
Alone, alone, alone

Feel like a book with a big ghost heart
I didn't finish, I didn't start it
Look in the mirror at the face in the glass
Look like a question no one ever asks

Alone
Like I'm supposed to be
Lone lonely alone
Like I'm supposed to be
Ruckus

There go thAT Homie Big DRAWERS
HUSS UPP Hustler!

(Talking and shizz)

Limpin' through the hood with my kakis saggin
The bottom of my pants toe back from draggin
I'm not a handicap but I like to limp
Life's a bitch and I'm a Palmdale pimp
Limpin' down the street to the gangster beat
Lean to the side and grab my meat
I don't walk, I stroll brother
Afroman is a soul brother
I'm young, but I'm from the old school
Always hang around old fools
Lean to the side as I stride
I can't hide my hustler pride
When I walk that walk and talk that talk
They sport my clothes, Break them hoes
Hey Ladies
Afroman is from the 80's

--Chourus--
Keep on Limpin'
Down the street
Keep on Limpin'
To the beat
(4 times)

Limp when you sing, limp when you rap
Hold your leg straight, bend your kneecap
Put a glide in your stride, dip in your hip
Be cool fool, when you clock your grip
You can limp fast, you can limp slow
However you limp, limp to the tempo
When I was, thirteen years old
Some boys in the hood taught me how to stroll
My homie TooTall said "what up G"?
Walk to the liqour store
And walk like me
I did it wrong and I did it right
I did it all day, I did it all night
I used to practice in my room
In my mirror, to the sound of the stereo boom
The very next day I walked to school
And grown women told me "you so cool"
Power to the people - right on
The sheriff hit the block
Turned the spotlight on
The skinny black boy called Afroman
Rollin' through South Central
With my dick in my hand
--Chorus__

(more Talking and shizz)

Four things I like, about a pimp
The way he dress, the way he limp
That clean, unique car that he drives
And the cool ass way he talk and jive
Even when he get locked up in jail
He hop out his cell and begin to bail
All the homeboys locked in the pen
Limp down the hall for me once again
You can take my freedom, put me in the hole
But even in the hole - Im'a hit my stroll

--Chorus__

(talk, talk, talk)

Your love is fadin' I feel it fade
Ah, your love is fadin' I feel it fade
Ah, your love is fadin' Baby I feel it fade

Ah-----your touch, your touch has gone cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I've fooled myself long as I can
Can feel the presence of somebody else's hands

Ooh, babe, I'm losing you
It's in the air
It's there everywhere
Baby, baby, babe, I'm Losing you

A reflection of a face, I see
I'm hurt, down-hearted and worried
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me
It's all over your face
Someone's takin my place
Ooo baby, I'm losing you
You try hard to hide
The emptiness you feel inside
Oo babe, I'm losing you

I can't bear the thought of losing you
Ah Baby, can't you see what I'm goin' through

She made me rise, rise, rise, rise, rise
Can't get her off my mind
Got Luda like why, why, why, why
Sexy lady got me gone
Never thought that it can happen to a pimp
But I bet she was plotting all along
She the one that should be working with a limp
Or a cane 'cause her game is extra strong
But she better watch her back
'Cause in fact my plan of attack in sack
Or the back of the lac with the yack is extra long
All my ladies so, so fine
But in my heart Ive made up my mind
'Cause everything that you
(Wear)
The way that you fixin' your
(Hair)
Gotta keep on acting keep

Keep making your boy say

Yeah ooh
Yeah ooh
You're so amazing

[Verse 1]
Breathless, you leave me breathless
The only air I wanna breathe is yours
Girl, your best is so effortless
Oh, you's what I wanna get into
And when I do I'm gonna

[Pre-Chorus]
Live inside of you, spend a night or two
Beyond this, girl, I'm just frozen
See I'm not used to this, soon as you got undressed
You stop my heart, there's one way you'll say it, you are

[Chorus]
You're amazing, baby, you're amazing
So amazing, ooh, amazing
Can I touch you, I just wanna love you
Let me just say that you are

Let me love you, girl, I won't waste it
Just wanna say that you are

[Verse 2]
Speechless, you got me speechless
Girl, I'm at loss for words
To say the things you've never heard before
I'm ready, you get me ready
To turn you out I start to search the softest place on earth

[Pre-Chorus]
Is inside of you, (it is)
Nothing left to do
Not to take it, girl 'cause I need it
See I'm not used to this
I am so ready to promise you
Everything, everything 'cause you are

Oh luna rossa, you're out tonight
A moon of red in a sky of white
Because I'm telling a lie tonight
And blushing moon, you know of it

Oh lunna rossa, you're smart at love
You know I'm playing the part of love
I try my hand at the art of love
Just for the thrill and glow of it

Luna rossa, forgive me, luna rossa
For the vows I made tonight that are untrue
What else am I to do?

But blushing moon, there's a reason why
The love I longed for has passed me by
And so I play at the game but I
I am lonely, luna rossa

Luna rossa, forgive me, luna rossa
For the vows I made tonight that are untrue
What else am I to do?
But blushing moon, there's a reason why
The love I longed for has passed me by
And so I play at the game but I
I am lonely, luna rossa
I am lonely, luna rossa
War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier

Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier

Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days

Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longingly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier

Sunshine entered our Frankie's days
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coin he made

Then two gentlemen called on him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?

Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said "no more" to
The little bombardier

Packed his bags, his heart in pain
Wiped a tear and caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again
The little bombardier
What do you want?
Man, fuck, is that mode do you talk like that?
The fuck do you want?
What the fuck you here?
Are you still fucked that bitch?
Ain't nobody fucked that bitch, here we go with this shit again?
Are you still...?
NOOO! I don't fucked that bitch, what the fuck you here? Get the ass on
Liar! You are a liar!
Hey yo, what time you go home? I founded in all that fucking places, what the fuck you doin?
I'm going...to go send some money, the fuck do you want, leave me fucking alone, goodbye!

Hello?
Yo, what's up?
Nothing, what's going on? You alright?
I'm not alright right now, she's gotta crazy, wife thang...
She's coming out again?
She's bring the fuck out, i don't know, what the fuck is a problem?
I told you, he get deserved...
Hey yo, hold up, who is right? I'll be hold in a minute
(I'll be...)
I'll be take the doggy open
Aight!

(I'm gonna give it to you, babe)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(I'll be right there, yeah)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

[Outro]
From the bottom of my heart, yes
I promise me we will never part
Let's say a prayer together
Say a prayer together, baby
Can we say a prayer together, baby?
Heavenly Father, which art in Heaven
I pray that You keep this love together
This is my prayer, baby, baby, baby
I love you
We stuck together
All while growing up
We made mistakes together
Let's make them while we're young
But you made your own religion
And then we drifted apart
It's been awhile
Since we last had a chat
I thought that you'd go crazy
If you didn't lighten up your act
But you didn't go crazy
In fact, i'd never seen you so happy
We'll meet from time to time
But we'll soon find that we have
Nothing to say
We'll just say 'hey
I don't like it
But i guess things happen that way.'
We were friends once
That's all i'd say for sure
Cause everything else got screwed up
And it's just some angry blur
Well i guess i do things different
But i guess i can't complain
Thought about some old times
I had myself a beer
Sung to myself the first verse
Of "still crazy after all these years"
But you didn't seem crazy
In fact, i'd never seen you so happy
We'll meet from time to time
But we'll soon find that we have
Nothing to say
We'll just say 'hey
I don't like it
But i guess things happen that way.'

[Intro]
I've had enough
I've had enough
I've had enough
I've had enough
I'm not your property
I've had enough
I'm not your property
I've had enough
I'm not your property
I've had enough
I'm not your property
I've had enough
I'm not your property
I've had enough
I'm not your property

[Chorus]
Hush, just stop (Just stop, just stop, just stop, just stop)
Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger
Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger
Stronger, stronger, stronger
Come on, now
Stronger, stronger
Oh, yeah (Stronger)

[Verse 1]
Hush, just stop
There's nothing you can do or say, baby
I've had enough
I'm not your property as from today, baby
You might think that I won't make it on my own

[Chorus 2]
But now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I am stronger

[Verse 2]
Than I ever thought that I could be, baby
I used to go with the flow
Didn't really care 'bout me
You might think that I can't take it
But you're wrong

[Chorus 2]
'Cause now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I am stronger
Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger
Come on, now
Come on, now
Oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Here I go, on my own
I don't need nobody, better off alone
Here I go, on my own
I don't need nobody, better off alone
Here I go, on my own now
I don't need nobody, not anybody
Here I go on my own now
I don't need nobody, not anybody
Here I go..
Alright
Here I go, here I go..

[Chorus 2]
Stronger than yesterday
It's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I am stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
Now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more (No more)
I am stronger

[Outro]
Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger
Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger
I think of Andy in the cold wet clay
Those three are on my mind
With his comrades down beside him
On that brutal day
Those three are on my mind

There lies young James in his final pain
Those three are on my mind
So I ask the killers, "Can you see those three again?
Those three are on my mind"

I see dark eyed Michael
With his dark eyed bride
Those three are on my mind
And three proud mothers
Weeping side by side
Those three are on my mind

But I'm grieving yet
And for some the sky is bright
I cannot give up hoping
For a morning light
So I ask the killers, "Do you sleep at night?
Oh, those three are on my mind"
I see tin roof shanties
Where my brothers live
Those three are on my mind
And the little burnt out churches
Where they sing we forgive
Those three are on my mind

I know of Tom paints water tree
I know the price of liberty
Now I ask the question that is deep inside of me
Did they also burn the Courthouse
When they killed those three
Those three are on my mind

Those three are on my mind
Those three are on my mind
In the sleepy town of San Juanita
There's a story that the padre tells
Of a gay senor and senorita
And the serenade of the bells
Seems they asked the padre for permission
To be married early in the spring
But their folks had just made one condition
That the mission bells had to ring
Everyone knew that the bells were broken
And hadn't sounded for a long long time
Then one night the village was astounded
For the bells began to chime
Still the bells are broken, goes the story
But if in your heart a true love dwells
They will chime for you in all it's glory
That's the serenade of the bells
Our Father
Which art in Heaven
Hallowed would be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
In earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day
Our daily bread
& forgive us our debts
As we forgive our debtors
& lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
& the power
& the glory
Forever
Amen

[Refrain]
(The lights go out)
The lights go out
The smell of doom
Is creepin' into your lonely room
The bed's on fire
Your fate is sealed
And you're so tired
And the reason is Camille-mille

[Chorus]
Shockadelica
The girl must be a witch
She got your mind, body, and soul hitched
Shockadelica
You need a second opinion
But she never wears a stitch
So you can't take her home

[Verse 1]
She got you tied with a golden rope
She won't let you play your guitar
And when you've cried enough
Maybe she'll let you up
For a nasty ride in her shockadeli-car
She'll make you beg (Please) girl

[Chorus]
Shockadelica
Got you in a trance
'Cause when this woman say dance you dance
Shockadelica
You need a second opinion
But you just can't leave her alone
With her you got no mind of your own

[Post-Chorus]
Shockadelica, Shockadelica
Doobie, doobie, doobie, yeah
Shockadelica, Shockadelica
Doobie, doobie, Shockadelica

[Refrain]
The lights go out, the smell of doom
Again, it's creepin' into your lonely room
Is this a dream or is this real? (Or is this real?)
Or is this just a mirage you feel?
Shockadelica, Shockadelica

[Chorus]
Shockadelica
She must be witch
She got your mind, body, and soul hitched
Shockadelica
You need a second opinion
She never wears a stitch
You can't take her home
Shockadelica
She got you in a trance
When this girl say, "Dance"
Baby, baby, baby, you dance (Shockadelica)
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance, you oh!

[Post-Chorus]
Shockadelica (She must be a witch; Yeah)
Shockadelica (She got my mind, body, and soul hitched)
Shockadelica (I need a second, I need a second opinion)

Shockadelica, Shockadelica
Doobie, doobie, doobie, yeah

[Bridge]
Shockadelica

Shockadelica
Doobie, doobie, doobie, yeah

[Bridge]
Shockadelica is a feeling
The lonely cold
Sleepin' alone will bore ya
And soon you'll grow old
In lust we will suffer
But in love we will grow
Shockadelica is a feeling nobody should know
I'm talkin' about the lonely cold, mama, uh (Shockadelica)

[Refrain]
The lights go out
The smell of doom
Again is creeping into your lonely room

[Outro]
(Is this a dream) Is this a dream
Or is this real
(Or is it just a mirage) Or is this just a mirage you feel
(Is this just a mirage) Or is it just a mirage
(Is this just a mirage) Or is it just a mirage (Shockadelica)
(Is this just a mirage) Or is it just a mirage
(Or is this just a mirage) Or is it just a mirage
(Is it just a—)
Shockadelica
Hey, look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
Hey, look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
It's that Orange Blossom Special
Bringin' my baby back
Going down to Florida
And get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californy
And get some sand in my shoes
Ride that Orange Blossom Special
And lose these New York blues
Say man, when you going back to Florida?
Say, I don't know, I don't reckon I'll ever go back to Florida
But ain't you worried about getting your nourishment in New York?
Well, I don't care if I do die, do die, do die, do die, do die
Hey, talk about a-ramblin'
She's the fastest train on the line
Hey, talk about a-travellin'
She's the fastest train on the line
It's that Orange Blossom Special
Rollin' down the seaboard line
(dialing)

Good bye
I cried the day you left me and I still don't know what kept me
From jumping off the highest bridge I know
My poor heart was breaking, I felt lower than a snake-in
That is just about the lowest you can go
I finally stopped my drinking, fell down and started thinking
That it's no pay to relive yesterday
I tried to hide my sorrow, started living for tomorrow
I think I'm gonna make it all the way

You hurt me and abused me, took advantage of and used me
I swear it almost made a wreck of me
When I needed your devotion, you were never in the notion
You were cold as any iceberg in the sea
Love to you had lost its splendor, my pride went out the window
When you left me, I kept begging you to stay
But now my heart is healing, and I got a real good feeling
I think I'm gonna make it all the way

My troubles came in bunches, I kept rolling with the punches
You'd shoot me down and I'd get back again
I tried to be your lover, in no time I did discover
Your loving cup was not for me to win
Your kisses weren't the same but I kept kinda fan the flame
Till I just couldn't take another day
You can't blame me for trying, now I stopped my crying
I think I'm gonna make it all the way
I tried my best to take it, but my smiling face didn't make it
'Cause in my heart, I knew there was no hope
Each place reminded me of the memories of your love
I've come right to the end of my rope
That's when I met my new friend, she's just as much a true friend
Treats me like a lover here to stay
And it's working out so well now, you can go to hell now
This time I'm gonna make it all the way
Yes, this time I'll make it all the way
Yes. I think I'm gonna make it all the way
Baby, get out of my way

[Intro: Boyz II Men]
Loving you, I'm never gonna change my mind
Loving you, I'm never gonna make you cry, I, I, I
I'll be by your side now and forever more
Whole life with joy and delight, ooh ooh

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
Don't you know I loved you from the start?
From the moment that we met
Long before I saw that smile of yours
I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart
You're the only one that I've been searching for
There was a time when I had lost my way
Couldn't find the lights surrounding me
I was almost frozen in the dark
You came along and gave me life again
You've warmed and opened up my broken heart

[Chorus: Nathan Morris & Boyz II Men]
I'm never gonna change my mind
Im loving you and I'm never gonna make you cry
(Won't make you cry)
Don't you know that I'll be by your side now and forever more
To fill you heart with joy and delight

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
Sometimes I made you feel all alone
When I'm too caught up in myself
Maybe I put you down in sorrow
But still you keep knocking at my door
And I know that you make me feel so strong
It's time for me to make you understand
I want to be with you, I'll be everything you want me to
So baby won't you give me another chance
So I can show you everything that I can do

[Chorus: Shawn Stockman & Boyz II Men]
I'm never gonna change my mind
I'm never gonna make you cry
(Won't make you cry)
Girl, I'll be by your side now and forever more
Fill your whole life with joy and delight
Every time we gotta make it through the rain
Every time things all turn out in vain
I swear I'll be by your side now and for ever more
To protect you from any kind of pain

[Bridge: Wanya Morris]
Someone told me
And I agree that we were born in this world
To find one single, one single true
(One single true girl, it's you)
So stay right beside me
You know it's the way that we should be
I don't wanna think about what it'd would be
If we were to fall apart, oh

[Chorus: Boyz II Men & Wanya Morris]
I'm never gonna change my mind
(And I'm never gonna change my mind)
Never gonna make you cry
(Said I'm never gonna make you cry, oh)
I'll be by your side forever more
Said I'll be by your side forever more
Fill your heart with joy and delight
Every, every, every time
Every time we gotta make it through the rain
(Gotta make it through)
Every time things turn all out in vain
(Turns out in vain)
I swear I'll be by your side now and for ever more
To protect you form any kind of pain, oh

[Outro: Wanya Morris]
Don't you know I loved you from the start?
Form the moment that we met
Long before I saw that smile of yours
I'm telling you from the bottom of heart
You're the only one that I've been searching for
You're the very one that I've been searching for
And I've been searching for a million years, it's you

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
Thought I heard your voice yesterday
Then I turned around to say
That I love you
Then I realized that
That it was just my mind playing tricks on me

And it seems colder lately at night
And I try to sleep with the lights on
Every time the phone rings
I pray to God it's you
And I just can't believe
That we're through

[Chorus]
I miss you
(I miss you)
There's no other way to say it
(And I) I can't deny it
I miss you
(I miss you)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
Is it done and over this time?
Have we really changed our minds?
But there's first love
All the feelings that we used to share
I refuse to believe
That you don't care

[Chorus]
I miss you
(I miss you)
There's no other way to say it
(And I) And I can't deny it
I miss you
(I miss you)
It's so easy to see...

[Bridge: Wanya Morris]
I've got to gather my senses together
I've been through worse kinds of weather
If it's over now
(Over now)
Be strong
(Be strong)
I can't believe that you're gone
I've got to carry on

[Chorus]
I miss you
(I miss you)
There's no other way to say it
(And I) I can't deny it
I miss you
(I miss you)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me

Oh, there's no other way to say it
(And I) And I can't deny it
I...I miss you
(I miss you)
Oh, it's so easy to see
I miss you and me

Oh, no other way to say it
I miss you, baby
So there's no other...
That you're a part of me now
That you're a part of me now
(I miss you)
(And I) Said I can't deny it
I...(miss you) miss you, baby
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me
I miss you so much, baby
Pretty little baby
Won't you listen to my heart?
My needs are simple
And you're what i've been needing from the start

Like honey
To a honeybee
You got me buzzing
I see what i need

I ain't lying
Gonna lay it on the line
This is the moment tonight
I got to make you mine

Like candy
To a wild-eyed child
I see what i want
And it's driving me wild

Release your love
Girl you got to give it up to me oh baby
Very good so good
Release your love to me
Only you can set me free
Wanna get closer
Ooh let's go somewhere hey baby
Where we can get closer yeah

You've been distant
You've been playin' hot and sweet
I've been burning
All fired up by your heat i'm hot baby

Just look at me
I'm on my knees
My sincere intention
Is only to please

Release your love

Girl you got to give it up to me oh baby
Very good so good
Release your love to me
Only you can set me

Oh set me free
Come on baby closer
Let's go somewhere tonight
Where we can get closer
Oh just look at me
I'm on my knees
My sincere intention
Is only to please

Release your love
Yeah give it up to me
I know it's good for me
Very good so good
Release your love to me
Only you can set me

Oh come on baby

Baby be good so good
Release your love to me

Oh it's so good
Release your love baby

[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
It's not time to make a change
Just relax and take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want, you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Why think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

[Verse 2: Johnny Cash and Fiona Apple]
How can I try to explain
When I do he turns away again
It's always been the same, the same old story
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
There's a way and I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go

[Verse 3: Johnny Cash]
It's not time to make a change
Just sit down, take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

[Verse 4: Johnny Cash and Fiona Apple]
All the times that I cried
Keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it
If they were right, I'd agree
But it's them you know not me
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go
It was the very edge of summer
The air was thin the sky more pale
Dusty roads I remember
Oh so well...

The winds of future blew around us
The owners came to tell their tale
Feelin' like a piece of paper
In a gale

Go West, go West
Where there's fruit in every place
A smile on every face...
Go West, go West...
Where there's work (so I'm told)

California's never cold
So Go West...

We sold part' our lives
For 18 dollars...
Bought a Hudson Super-6
Travelled on down the highway
With no rest...
Childhood memories behind us
Grown-up feelings lie ahead
Asked my Dad why we're going
And he said...

Go West, go West
Where there's fruit in every place
A smile on every face...
Go West, go West...
Where there's work (so I'm told)
California's never cold... so
Go West...

[Verse 1]
Wanna see you whip it
Sure to treat you right
Give me just a minute
Of your time tonight
We both are here to have the fun
So let it whip

We'll get into groovin'
Love your body language

You've got me sort of anxious
We both are here to have the fun

Now that you can see
How you groove with me
What else can I do
To get closer to you?

Obviously revealing

I'd love to be your joker man
We both are here to have the fun

I got three kids and a lovely wife
I got a happy home and a
Electric carving knife

That's why I wrote this song
Because there's nothin' wrong
Nope, there's nothin' wrong with my life
There's nothin' wrong, nope, there's nothin' wrong
There's just nothin' wrong with my life

I got a four wheel drive
And I got a computer hard drive
And I got asphalt drive
And I got plenty of motivational drive

That's why I wrote this song
Because there's nothin' wrong
There's just nothin' wrong with my life
Nothin' wrong, nothin' wrong, nothin' wrong with my life

But then one day
My wife phoned
To tell me I was
On my own
And now there's one thing wrong
One thing wrong
One thing wrong with my life

So I had to change my song from "there be nothin' wrong" to
"there be somethin' wrong" with my life

There's somethin' wrong, there's somethin' wrong, now there's somethin' wrong with my life (arooo)
To change my song from "there been nothin' wrong" to "there be somethin' wrong" with my life

Well I, I caught my wife, and I
I had my electric knife and I just
Carved her up
And put a end to my strife

And now there's nothin' wrong
No, there's nothin' wrong
There's just nothin' wrong with my life
Nothin' wrong, nope there's nothin' wrong, there's just nothing' wrong with my life

Speaking:
Hello sheriff, what can I do for you?
My wife left me? no you got the wrong end of the stick sheriff, I left her
I left her all over the place
I left her down at old Jackson's well, down Simpson's Creek, Shrimpy's? store
You'll have a hell of a time putting her back together, sheriff, hell of a time
The law's a joke; I'm laughing, sheriff!
A-one two, one two three four
All my friends think it's their appointed duty
They keep tryin to tell me
That you just want to use me
But my answer
To all that use me stuff
I want to spread the news, that if it feels this good gettin used
Will you just keep on using me
Until you use me up

My brother, he sit me right down and he talked to me
And he told me he thought I ought to not let you just fuck on me
And I know, I know that my brother he meant well
But I just don't know what's really true
And I said oh brother if you only knew
You'd be wishin you were in my shoes
So keep on using me, keep on using me
Until you use me up

It's really true it's really true, you really do you really do
You really do abuse me
You get me in a crowd of high-class people
And then you gotta act all rude to me
I want to spread the news, that if it feels this good gettin used
Will you just keep on using me, keep on using me
Until you use me up

[Intro: KRS-One]
Yeah, yeah
Adam Dice, how you get hardcore like this?
You better watch out
They all lookin for you now

[KRS-One]
K-R-S, O-N-E, comin back for y'all
I do a little more than videos and rap for y'all
I been in many cars, known by almost every star
New rappers, old rappers, this'll rock for any y'all
The edutainment from the pavement, Kris'll flatten y'all
I'm like a fitted to my enemies, I'm cappin y'all
What happened y'all? Them corporations backin y'all
You're so desperate you can't see that they be stabbin y'all
This that realness, come on you can feel this
Whether fresh fruit or tax{?} my raps you can peel this
Them conscious lyrics; hear it, it ain't new to me
I see my influence done flipped the whole industry
Everybody's conscious now and it's great
Ain't nuttin gon' stop us now y'all but the hate
And wait - hate can't stop us either
Cause Knowledge Reigns Supreme, KRS the Teacher

[Chorus 2X: KRS-One]
Da-dee-dee, da-dee, dee-dee-dee-dee-da-dee-day
KRS, son come'll back most every day
You have got to understand that we don't play
Throw your hands up if you like the way it's goin down

[KRS-One]
Look at this, look at this, LOOK~!
Grown men on the TV still jiggy
Still on the television, holdin up they pinkie
Little children lookin at 'em thinkin that it's pretty
But let me introduce you to that gritty inner city
Where the cops be +Kurupt+ like my man from dogtown
If I unite with +Daz+ we could shut 'em all down
Hip-Hop, East West, North South we lovin it
It's time for new leadership, time for self-government
Put a fist up! Every real club we rip up
I spit raw conscious lyrics to lift Kris up
Never give up, see the real O.G.'s know me
But these young'uns be buggin they think they can hold me
I'm holy! I'm livin a different dimension
I keep the crowd jumpin like hydraulic suspensions
Releasin your tension with every lyric I mention the truth
Eight years, ain't that enough PROOF?!

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Nothing touches me man
These walls are three feet thick
Wouldn't take one of them little drills
To get through it

[Bridge]
I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
She went..

[Chorus]
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me now

[Verse 2]
Nothing touches me man
No matter how you split
Sticks and stones can get through bones
So I've given up looking out of it

[Bridge]
I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
She went..

[Chorus]
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me now

[Outro]
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Why why can't we love again?
Why why are you shy on love?
If you only knew how much I love you
Why can't you love me again?

Why why don't you open your heart?
Why why are we so far apart?
If you only knew how much I love you
Why can't you love me again?

I just want your loving arms around me, yeah
I got to find a way to make you take me back

Baby won't you tell me
Why why why why are we so far apart?

Why why don't you open your heart?
If you only knew how much I love you
Why can't you love me again?

I just want your loving arms around me, yeah
I got to find a way to make you take me back
Baby won't you tell me
Why why why why are we so far apart?
Why why don't you open your heart?
If you only knew how much I love you
Why can't you love me
Why can't you love me
Why can't you love me again?

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
Nightfall, here we are
Making love histories
Sexual, natural
The feeling that you give me
We've been at it for hours now
And I see no signs of it slowing down
Girl, you're so beautiful
I just wanna lay back and watch you rock me

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Slowly, slowly, slowly
Love your body on me, on me
Like you own me
I feel you rock me slowly, slowly, slowly
Love your body on me, on me
Like you own me

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
Oh oh oh oh, got nowhere to go
It's just you and me and the radio
And your warm skin, cold wine
Holding you as you moving in a slow grind
Having you in my bed
Fulfills every fantasy in my head
As we make this memory
Nothing better than for me to watch you rock me, yeah

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Shawn Stockman]
Slowly, slowly, slowly
Love your body on me (On me), on me (On me)
Like you own me
(When you do it to me, it's like a work of art)
I feel you rock me slowly, slowly, slowly (Oh yeah)
Love your body on me, on me (On me)
Like you own me

[Bridge: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
(Baby, slow it down)
Slow it down, gently rock it back (Rock it back)
To the end then rewind it back (Oh, oh)
Right now you're a part of me
(Right now you're a part of me)
Inside is where I have to be
We can do it like it's supposed to be done
And together we will become one (Oh, oh)
Feel my love, my love is just for you
Watch you rock me

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Slowly, slowly, slowly
Love your body on me (On me), on me (On me)
Like you own me
I feel you rock me slowly (Slowly), slowly (Slowly), slowly
Love your body on me (On me), on me (On me)
Like you own me (Like you own me)
Watch you rock me slowly, slowly, slowly (Slowly, yeah)
Love your body on me, on me
Like you want own me
(Like you own me, baby, I can feel you, oh oh)
I feel you rock me slowly, slowly, slowly
Love your body on me (On me), on me (On me)
Like you own me (Oh, oh, yeah)
I jumped off a boxcar down around Tennessee
I was cold tired and dirty hungry as I could be
But I had my guitar and a hundred railroad songs
So I asked the policeman
Can I stay here long
He said Mr. Hobo you got to go now
We don't want you around
See I'm trying to build a respectable town
And we don't need a hobo like you hanging around

So I left that town, Lord with my guitar in my hand
Still cold and tired, kinda mad at the man
But this life that I chose to live, sometime's strange
See I'm trying to learn about the old music from ridin' the train
I'm a hobo I know, but thta's the price I pay
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say
Mr Choo-choo train take me away

I'm goin' to ride this train Lord until I find out
What Jimmie Rogers and the Hag was all about
See I play this rock n roll and I think that's fine
But I wnta to go back a little further in time
I'm a hobo I know but that's the price I pay
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say
Mr Choo-choo train take me away
You're wondering if I care about ya
Is there's some cause that I should doubt you
Oh I can see boy that you don't know me very well
You're so unsure

And you run here and there to ask my feelings
Friends only I guess, they can't really say

[Chorus]
Don't ask my neighbor
Don't ask the friends I hang around
Don't be afraid to come to me
Don't ask my neighbors, come to me
Don't be afraid of what ya see
You'll find I love you, come to me
Don't be afraid

You ask all my friends if I'm the same girl
You don't understand, you think I'm changing

[Chorus]
Don't ask my neighbors, come to me
Don't be afraid of what ya see
You'll find I love you, come to me
Don't be afraid
I'm lookin' out my window
Watch the clouds go by
I look to see eternity
The endless rolling sky
You cannot think of eternity
Thinkin' it like time
You try to think, you try to count
You just mess up your mind
Eternity, eternity
Baby, I love you, you love me
Let's love each other through eternity
Since before man could see
There was eternity
After man is come and gone
Eternity lingers on, eternity lingers on
Everything crawl, creep, or fly
Just live until they die
I love you, you love me
Let's love each other through eternity
Eternity, eternity
I love you, you love me
Let's love each other through eternity
Through eternity
Well I think about life, we don't know
Whether it all could be in vain
Look through time, it's for sure
It's the greatest gift to man
Music and Love, you can't explain
Try and understand
The greatest thing could ever be
We make love through eternity
Eternity, eternity
When the world think our defeat
Think that we are gone
We'll still have our place in peace
Our love will linger on, linger on
We won't care just what who said
If it's truth or lie
We'll still have our greatest gift
Love won't ever die
Love won't ever die
No, never die
Love won't ever die
Never, never
Never die
Here I go again
I hear those trumpets blow again
All aglow again
Taking a chance on love

Here I slide again
About to take that ride again
Starry-eyed again
Taking a chance on love

I thought that cards were a frame-up
I never would try
Now I'm taking that game up
And the ace of hearts is high

Things are mending now
I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have a happy ending now
Taking a chance on love

Here I slip again
About to take that trip again
I got that grip again
Taking a chance on love
Now I prove again
That I can make life move again
Mmm, I'm in a groove again
Taking a chance on love

I walk around with a horseshoe
In clover I lie
And brother rabbit of course you
Better kiss your foot goodbye

On that ball again
I'm riding for a fall again
I'm gonna give my all again
Taking a chance on love
I've been down one time
And I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love

I've been out here so very long
I done lost all my direction
Baby, when you came my way
Thought I had found my protection
But a strong wind came into my life
It surely took me by surprise
I can't seem to control these tears
That's falling from my eyes

I've been down one time
And I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love

Sea of love
Baby, I depended on you
For the love navigation
But now you've gone and deserted me
Can't you see that I'm in desperation
I'm in the middle of a bad love storm
And it's bad as it can be
I look around, all I can see
Is water coming down over me

I've been down one time
And I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love

Sea of love, sea of love

I've been down one time
And I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love

Sea of love
But right now I'm just drowning
Drowning in the sea of love
A sea of love, sea of love
Well, well well well, well
Hey, ooh-hoo...

[Verse 1]
Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be than with you, yes
Loving you, well well well
Day will make the way for night
All we need is candlelight
And a song, ooh, soft and long
Well well well
Glad to be
Here alone with a lover unlike no other
Sad to see, a new horizon slowly coming into view, yeah

[Chorus]
I want to be living for the love of you, oh oh
All that I'm giving is for the love of you

[Verse 2]
Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me when the morning comes
Feels good to me
Well, my love and me, love and me
Smoother then a gentle breeze
Blowing from my mind with ease
Soft as can be
When you're loving me, when you're loving me, ooh
I love to be
Riding the waves of love, enchanted with your touch
And it seems to me
We can sail together in and out of mystery, oh

[Chorus]
I want to be living for the love of you, oh yes I do
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
I know that I'm living for the love of you, oh yes I do
All that I'm giving, giving is for the love of you

[Verse 3]
Paradise I have within
Can't feel as secure again
You're the key
This I see, oh
Now and then I lose my way
Using words that try to say what I feel
Yeah, this is so real, so real

I might as well, sign my name on a card which could say it better
Time will tell
'Cause it seems that I've done just about all that I can do, I can do

[Chorus]
I want to be living for the love of you, oh yes I do
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
I wanna be living for the love of you, oh yes I do
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
Each and every day I'm, oh, I'm living for the love of you
Said that I'm living for the love of you, baby
Heaven
I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven
I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gamblers lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much as dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I love to go out fishing
In a river, or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you will carry me through to...
Heaven
I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find that happiness I seek
When we're out together swinging cheek to cheek

Come on and dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you will carry me through
Right up to...

Heaven
I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find that happiness I seek
When we're out toghether dancing
Out together dancing
Out together dancing cheek to cheek!

[Verse 1]
I've been feeling this emptiness for some time
Tryna make do
But my world has been so crazy
Living without you
Now I'm a man and not ashamed to admit my faults
Now that I know
But the only thing that matters now
Is I shoulda never let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
So every night before I go to sleep
I pray
That the Lord would one day somehow
Send you back my way

[Chorus]
Baby, I miss you (oh yes I do)
I need to be back in your arms
I never stop loving you (oh yeah)
My heart is where you belong
Baby, I miss you (baby i)
Before heaven and earth pass away
Lord, please show me what to do
Tell me what to say
'Cause we've come too far to let it slip away
Whoa-oh-whoa
'Cause we've come too far to let it slip away

[Verse 2]
Couldn't understand many things in my life
How much you meant to me
Now I'm prepared to be everything
That a man is supposed to be
Mmm... I don't wanna be alone no more
Know that my heart can't take it
Not a day has passed
Since you've been gone
That I thought that I could make it
Ah baby

[Pre-Chorus]
So every night before I go to sleep
I pray
That the Lord would one day somehow
Bring you back my way

[Chorus]
Baby, I miss you
I need to be back in your arms
(bring it back to me, baby)
I'll never stop loving you
My heart is where you belong
Baby, I miss you
Before heaven and earth pass away
Lord, please show me what to do
Tell me what to say
'Cause we've come too far to let it slip away

[Bridge]
Oh, baby
Don't know that else to say or do
It's hard to get through every night and every day
Knowing I let you walk away
It's killing me inside
Feelings so strong I can't hide
So Lord
Help me get through these trying times
I'll do anything to have you back in my life

[Chorus]
Baby, I miss you
I need to be back in your arms
I'll never stop loving you
(Never stop loving you, no)
My heart is where you belong
(Where you belong)
Baby, I miss you (Baby, I miss you)
Before heaven and earth pass away
Lord, please show me what to do
Tell me what to say
'Cause we've come too far to let it...
Baby, I miss you
I need to be back in your arms
I'll never stop loving you
My heart is where you belong
Baby, I miss you
Before heaven and earth pass away
Lord, please show me what to do
Tell me what to say
'Cause we've come too far to let it...
Baby, I miss you
As I was a-goin' over Gilgarra mountains
I met Colonel Pepper and his money he was counting
I drew forth my pistol and I rattled my sabre
Saying "stand and deliver, for I am a bold deceiver"

Musha ringum duram da
Whack-fall the daddy-o
Whack-fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

The shining yellow coins did sure look bright and jolly
I took the money home and I gave it to my Molly
She promised and she vowed that she never would deceive me
But the devil's in the women for they never can be easy

Musha ringum duram da
Whack-fall the daddy-o
Whack-fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

When I awoke between the hours of six and seven
Guards were standing 'round me in numbers odd and even
I flew to my pistols, but alas I was mistaken
I fired off my pistols and a prisoner was taken
Musha ringum duram da
Whack-fall the daddy-o
Whack-fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

They put me in jail without a judge or jury
For robbing Colonel Pepper in the morning so early
They didn't take my fist so I knocked down the sentry
And I bid a long farewell to that cold penitentiary

Musha ringum duram da
Whack-fall the daddy-o
Whack-fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I think I'll find my brother, he's the one that's in the army
I don't know where he's stationed be in Cork or in Killarney
Together we'll go roving thru the Moutains of Kilkenny
I dare he'll treat me fairer than my darling sporting Molly

Musha ringum duram da
Whack-fall the daddy-o
Whack-fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

Some take delight in fishing and bowling
Others take delight in carriage a-rollin'
I take delight in the juice of the barley
Courting pretty women in the morning so early
Musha ringum duram da
Whack-fall the daddy-o
Whack-fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris, Boyz II Men]
So let me get this right
You call yourself saying goodbye
With no good reason why
(You didn't even try) to work it out
(This time) Before you walk out the door
(Walk out the door)
You really really need to be sure
We've been here before but now
It's funny you don't want this anymore

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
But I remember when over and over again
With all the craziness you put me through
I shoulda been done with you

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Shawn Stockman]
Well, okay, if love is not a reason to stay
Then it really doesn't matter anyway
Why should I give it my all, when you're giving up? (Oh no)
Just so you know, everything ain't always been everything
But I was still willing to give anything, I mean anything
But I refuse to be the reason why you're gone
Oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris, Boyz II Men]
Now I ain't gonna lie
All my friends say I'm outta my mind
'Cause I spent all my time (and my paper)
When they said you weren't worth a dime
I thought they were wrong
But they were right all along
I can't believe it, look what you're doing
You're trying to ruin everything that we made so strong

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
But I remember when over and over again
With all the craziness you put me through
I shoulda been done with you

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Shawn Stockman]
Well, okay, if love is not a reason to stay (Said it don't matter)
Then it really doesn't matter anyway (Tell me why should I)
Why should I give it my all, when you're giving up?
Just so you know (So you know) everything ain't always been everything
But I was still willing to give anything, I mean anything
(But I was willing to give all of me I mean everything)
But I refuse to be the reason why you're gone

[Bridge: Wanya Morris]
Tell me why, why did you stay so long
If you, you knew that you felt this way?
(That you felt this way)
And if I knew I wouldn't have wasted my time on you
(Now you're free, now you're free) To do what you want to do

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Well, okay, if love is not a reason to stay
(It doesn't matter, girl)
Then it really doesn't matter anyway (No, it don't)
Why should I give it my all? (Why should I give you my everything?)
Just so you know, everything ain't always been everything (No)
But I was still willing to give anything, I mean anything
But I refuse to be the reason
(I refuse to be the reason why you're leaving me)
Well, okay, if love is not a reason to stay
Then it really doesn't matter anyway
(Why should I give you my all when you're giving up?)
Just so you know, everything ain't always been everything
But I was so willing to give you anything, I mean anything (Yeah)
But I refuse to be reason why you're gone

[Outro: Wanya Morris]
Why you're gone gone, gone, oh oh oh
It's not my fault
This time why you're leaving me
Oh oh oh yes, I refuse to be the reason why you're gone
1. Well I'm truckin' on down from Memphis
Cruisin' down to New Orleans
Tonight he sleeps along with a Cajun queen

2. Well there's smoke from stacks blowin'
And he don't care where he's goin'
The only time he feels right is when he's a-rollin'

3. He's got a road man's scene in his hand
Good drivin' just as hard as he can
A time and that your scales in me

Chorus Well I'm talkin' about a truck drivin' man
Yeah he'll always give you the best that he can
White cross and coffee oh yeah, is all that he needs
And it's allright by me truckdrivin' man

Chorus

4. He's got the ladies up from North-Dakota
From The Keys meant to Minnesota
And a love such-a never want these as what is told her
5. Well all the flame of shirts and blue jeans
Truckstops are routines
Tonight he sleeps along with a Cajun queen

Chorus
Sit yourself down, girl
And talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind
Don't keep saying
Everything's ok, baby
'Cause if it was, girl
You wouldn't be crying

You've been tossing and turning
In your sleep lately, baby
Sitting around crying all day long
Now how in hell do you expect me
To understand, baby
When I don't even know what's wrong

Let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out, baby

Well the last five nights
When we went to bed
Oh I could tell something wasn't right
When you turned your back
And you covered your head, baby
You didn't even say good-night
Now if you're tired
And you don't wanna be bothered, baby
Just say the word
And I'll leave you alone
Instead of lying there
Crying your eyes out
You and me oughta be getting it on

Let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out, baby
Let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out
Please let's straighten it out, baby
Let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out now, baby
(Laughing)
Yeah
Comeon Homeboy, Turn it up
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh Buch-ach x2

Afroman, Double H, Double C
Double OG, Checking in the double tree

Colt 45, No Bubbley
Cops give me trouble, but they still don't trouble me
Hit the lights, read my rights
Fly somewhere, anywhere, anywhere, I really don't care
Run up in the club, grab me a woman (Oh)
Waitress keep them drinks 'a coming (burp)
Hah, easy come easy go, fuck what you talking bout?
I don't know, Shutup bitch, I'm in my own zone
Turn the music up, and leave me alone
Put your hands up if you're with me (ooh)
Tell the bartender, 'a hit me (Buch-ach!)

(Chorus 2x)
Take shots to the head, pick em up, put em down (uh)
You know tomorrow morning, your head's gonna pound (Oh)
But tonight, since you don't care, put your beer bottle in the air
(Chorus 2x)
The hungry hustler, Afroman, That fool Raule
Fatso and Matt Payne, Drinking brew
Drinking brew, taking blunts to the brain
Palms in the air, cause it's a Palmdale thang
Everybody in the crowd, put your beer in the air (uh)
If you're real short, stand up in a chair (uh)
If you ain't quite, fucked up yet, smoke you a newport cigarette

Keep a beer, in your hand, take a swig every chance you can
If you feel the urge, go ahead and burp, chill for a minute
Then take a slurp, Drink slow homie, don't want the bottle
To get all foamy, moving, grooving, jumping around
Bottle in the air, chugging it down

(Chorus 2x)
Take shots to the head, pick em up, put em down (uh)
You know tomorrow morning, your head's gonna pound (Oh)
But tonight, since you don't care, put your beer bottle in the air

(Chorus 2x)
Throw it in the trash, drop it on the ground
Stagger to the bar, get another round
If you got alot of money, than share
I'm sure another alcoholic will care
Smoke a sweet, to the beat, if it's good
Put it on the beat, gotta have alot fun before you get too old
Lock the door, to your room, drown everybody out with the boom
Stereo blasting loud as hell, cellphone calls go to your voicemail
Take a little time out for yourself
Cause Afroman is good for your health
(Chorus 2x)
Take shots to the head, pick em up, put em down (uh)
You know tomorrow morning, your head's gonna pound (Oh)
But tonight, since you don't care, put your beer bottle in the air

(Chorus 2x)
Hayley Williams
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

B.o.B
Yeah
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion

And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at that phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back

But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel
And they sayin' "What would you wish for?"
If you had one chance
So airplane, airplane
Sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?

I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

B.o.B
Yeah, yeah
Somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank

Yeah back when I was tryin' to get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessing that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Then maybe yo maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur, what's up Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Hayley Williams
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

B.o.B
I could really use a wish right now
I-I-I could really use a wish right now
Like, like, like shooting stars
I-I-I could really use a wish right now
A wish, a wish right now, right now

The way you read the crowd
The way you make them pay
You stepped in and did the scene a whole new way
No one would resist you now
And even if they could
Hollywood just never had it quite this good

I see your name in lights
I see them standing in line
They send the cards and the wine
Broadway here she comes
You should be a natural

(Camera action do it again)
Ooh anyway I gotta do it
(What a reaction do it again)
Yeah I'm gonna make you a star
(Camera action do it again)
Ooh anyway I gotta do it
(What a reaction do it again)
To get you this part
No one had to tell you what your smile was for
You sure there's not an uncle name of Barrymore
Now she did this and she did that
You are the latest talk
Now there lining up for you around the block

Throwing roses
And Holy Moses
Even the Times say
Sparks fell from the skies
That gets you immortalized

(Camera action do it again)
Oh anyway I gotta do it
(What a reaction do it again)
Yeah I'm gonna make you a star
(Camera action do it again)
Ooh anyway I gotta do it

Just found joy
I'm as happy as a baby boy
When he's playing with his choo-choo toy
When I'm with my sweet Lorraine

She's got a pair of eyes
That are bluer than the summer sky
When you see her you're gonna realize
Why I love my sweet Lorraine

When it's raining I don't miss the sun
'cause it's in my sweeties smile
Just think that I'm the lucky one
Who will lead her down the aisle

Each night how I pray
That nobody steals her heart away
I can't wait until that lucky day
When I marry my Lorraine

When it's raining I never miss the sun
'cause it's in my sweeties smile
Just the think that I'm the lucky one
Who's gonna lead her down the aisle
Each night how I pray
That nobody steals her heart away
I can't wait until that lucky day
When I marry my Lorraine

That'll be the day when I marry my Lorraine

[Verse 1]
Haiti Cherie says Haiti is my beloved land
Oh, I never knew that I have to leave you to understand
Just how much I miss the gallant Citadel
Where days long ago, brave men served this country well
Where sun is bright or evening with soft moonlight
A shading tree, Creole maiden for company
A gentle breeze, a warm caress if you please
Work, laughter and play, yes, we'll always be this way
Haiti Cherie says Haiti is my beloved land
Oh, I never knew that I have to leave you to understand
Just how much I miss the gallant Citadel
Where days long ago, brave men served this country well

[Harmonizing]

[Verse 2]
Haiti Cherie, now I've returned to your soil so dear
Let me hear again the things that give music to my ear
The shepherd's horn that welcomes the rising morn'
When roads overflow as crowds to island market go

[Outro]
Where sun is bright or evenings with soft moonlight
A shading tree, Creole maiden for company
A gentle breeze, a warm caress if you please
Work, laughter and play, yes, we'll always be this way

I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

And we saw, oh, this light, I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright, as we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall, is a waterfall, oh, is a waterfall
Oh, is a, is a waterfall, every tear is a waterfall
So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag
It was a waaaterfall
A waaaterfall

Every tear, every tear, every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear, every teardrop is a waterfall
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape – I can't wait
I need a hit – baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it

Too high, can't come down
Losin' my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With a taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you: don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do: don't you know that you're toxic?

It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from a devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you: don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do: don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you: don't you know that you're toxic?

With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you: don't you know that you're toxic?

Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
Tell me how long I can float
Don’t want to sing the song
That we wrote together so long ago
So long ago
So let me know
So let me know
Where is it going
When it explodes
I hope that my head is not all straight
Loving you and I just can’t wait
Till something great something unknown
So let me know
So let me know
Where is it going
When it explodes
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
I don't want no more lonely nights

I can wait another day
Until I call you

And if it takes a number of years
I'll turn your tears away

And ev'rything a'flutter

But another lonely night
Might take forever. (forever, ever, ever)

It's all the same to me, to me, to me

No more lonely nights

Don't want no more, no more, no more lonely nights

And everybody there, they were jumpin'
To hear the sailor boys in our chorus singin'

Brown skin girl, stay home and mind, baby"
I'm goin' away in a sailing boat
And if I don't come back

Now the Americans made an invasion
We thought it was a help to the island
Until they left from here on vacation
They left the native boy home to mind their children

[Intro]
Rainman, rainman, rainman, rainman
Ca-call me ca-call me rainman, rainman

[Verse 1]
There's no need for me to lay out my clothes
When she's not around there's nowhere to go
Make no attempts getting up out of this bed
I wanna open my eyes but I just close the curtains instead

[Pre-Chorus]
Her thunderstorms shuts my lights off oooohhhhh
I got no missed calls maybe by tomorrow, cause right now I just can't catch a break

[Chorus]
Everyday it rains
When she ain't laying right here I can feel the coolness in the air I know my chances ain't fair
Everyday it rains
Would it be just my window seal sound reaches my ear go then It reappears
Everyday it rains
My heart starts drowning my vision gets cloudy the flood Moves around me
Everyday it rains
No sign of the light as the time goes by 40 days and 40 nights

[Verse 2]
Just when I thought I've gotten rid of you
I turn my face to your pillow that's soaked in your perfume
The waters raging, no life vest, and I can't swim through, through no
My heart, and my mind, and my soul it's lost somewhere in this deep blue

[Pre-Chorus]
Her thunderstorms shut my lights off oooohhhh
I got no missed calls maybe by tomorrow cause right now I just can't get a break

[Chorus]
Everyday it rains
When she ain't laying right here I can feel the coolness in the air I know my chances ain't fair
Everyday it rains
Would it be just my window seal sound reaches my ear go then It reappears
Everyday it rains
My heart starts drowning my vision gets cloudy the flood Moves around me
Everyday it rains
No sign of the light as the time goes by 40 days and 40 nights

[Outro]
Baby cut my lights (cut my lights)
Back on (back on baby)
Take me out your storm (Take me out your storm)
Baby cut my lights (cut my lights)
Back on (back on baby)
Release me (release me)
Release me from the sea
Ohhhhh uhh ohhhh rainman, rainman, rainman
Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky is full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look behind
From where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round in the circle game

Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like "when you're older" must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look behind
From where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round in the circle game
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town
And they tell him, "Take your time, it won't be long now
'Till you drag your feet to slow the circle down."

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look behind
From where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round in the circle game

So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams, and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look behind
From where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round in the circle game

[Intro]
Mmmmm oooooh oooh oooh yeah
Oooh ooh yeah ooooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oooo ooooh
Oooh ooooh yea yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Can I be committed is the question in my head
All the issues in my life keep holding me back
Can I live up to the standard
Seems so hard to do
Then you tell me "Take my hand"
You'll help me make it through oooh

[Chorus]
You ask me child do you love me
And I say yeah (yeah) yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
But will you just give up everything
And follow me yeah (yeah) yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
We talk periodically which should be everyday
Can't imagine how it could be if I let you lead the way
No broken hearts less scars less road
That never have an end
So I throw away my pride let down my guard lord here I am yeah

[Chorus]
(If you ask me)
You ask me child do you love me (Do I love you)
And I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(And then you say)
But will you just give up everything
(Will I follow you and give up? Oh yeah, Oh yeah)
And follow me yeah (yeah) yeah yeah

[Bridge]
When I just stop to think of all that you've done for me

Ride on - baby don't you wanna go
Ride on - baby don't you wanna go
Back to the same old place - sweet home Chicago

Well, do you remember when the steel mill shut down
We had to go in the country, mama, 'cause you couldn't live in town
Ride on - baby don't you wanna go
Back to the same old place - sweet home Chicago

Well, do you remember baby back in 1934
You had the nerve to tell your daddy
That you didn't want him no more
Ride on - baby, don't you wanna go
Back to the same old place - sweet home Chicago

Ride on - baby don't you wanna go
Ride on - baby don't you wanna go
Back to the same old place - sweet home Chicago
(Allen Collins - Ronnie VanZant)

I said baby mama, I don't know your name
But I said baby, sugar I can play your game
Every night when we leave the hall
I see you hanging around
You wanna ride in my big black car baby
Wanna go uptown

(Chorus)
I know who you are baby
I know what they call you girl
Never put you down baby
I'm just like you baby, I'm on the hunt

I know lady
People gonna talk about you and me
Let me say one thing mama, sugar I do as I please
And if you wanna love me baby, I'm your man
And all those high-falutin' society people
I don't care if they don't undertand
(Chorus)
My daddy told me a long time ago
Said there's two things son
Two things you should know
And in these two things you must take pride
That's a horse and woman, yeah
Well both of them you ride

[Verse 1 - Nathan]
What is love that I'm deserving now
That you would give to me exclusively
To have and to hold selfishly
I said if I should try to share with you
My life and with all I have in mind
I'll show you that magic is still alive, Yes I will
And I promise 'til I die
I won't let go of your heart that's in my hand

[Chorus]
Darling let me know
If there's anything your heart needs
I'll work vigorously
Just to keep you happy
Just let me know
If there's a dream you should ever see
I'll make reality
Say I do and I'll show you

[Verse 2 - Shawn]
The finer things in life
I'll even take you on a carpet ride all across your mind
We will fly across blue skies and crystal nights
'Cause you're the twinkle in my eye
Sometimes just looking at you makes me cry, oh my
I thank you God for two lives unified in matrimony yeah
You're the missing link that makes my life complete, indeed
Honey

[Chorus]
Darling let me know
If there's anything your heart needs
I will sail from sea to sea
Just to keep you happy
Just let me know
If there's a dream you should ever see
I'll make reality, say I do and I'll show you

[Bridge - Wanya (Mike)]
(Please say I do, and I'll give you the world)
There is no mountain that we cannot move yeah
There is no flower that our love cannot make bloom
(I will do anything that you need to grow)
There is no hill that our bind cannot climb, yeah
(If I had to walk on my knees, Baby, I'll get to you)
We'll last and last forever, body and soul
Darling let me know
(Let me know baby)

[Chorus: Wanya (Mike)]
If there's anything your heart needs
I'll work vigorously, oh yes I will, to make you happy
Just let me know
If there's a dream you should ever see
I'll make reality yeah
Say I do and I'll show you
(Girl, anything you want I'll make reality
You just say I do baby)
Say I do and I'll show you
(And I promise, I'll show you)
If you want me to stay
I'll be around today
To be available for you to see
I'm about to go there
Then you'll know
For me to stay here
I've got to be me
You'll never be in doubt
That's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days I'm gone
Forget reachin' me by phone
'Cause I promise
I'll be gone for a while
And when you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person
That you really are now
You got to get it straight
How could I ever be late
When you're my woman
Taking up my time
Oh how could I ever allow
I guess I wonder how
I could get out a pocket for fun
When you know that
You're never number two
Number one's gonna be number one
I'll be good
I wish I could
Get this message over to you now

When you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person
That you really are now
I'll be so good
I wish I could
Get this message over to you now

Get this message over to you now
I'll be so good
I wish I could
I watch you sleeping little angel face
And on behalf of the human race
Welcome to this crazy place

I watch you sleeping innocent and free
I don't know what your dreams may be
You don't know what you mean to me

You have never heard thunder
You have never seen the rain
But you can still feel the wonder
You can still feel the pain
And sometimes you look at me
So wise and so sure
I could easily believe you have been here before

I watch you sleeping little angel face
And on behalf of the human race
Welcome to this crazy place

I won't be here forever
But as long as I'm around
I promise you I will never let you down
To help make a world you can feel worthy of
I will teach you to fly on the wings of my love
I watch you sleeping brave and unaware
You don't know yet so you don't care
I want you to know it's hard out there

I watch you sleeping little angel face
And on behalf of the human race
Welcome to this crazy place

I watch you sleeping
I watch you sleeping
I watch you sleeping
I watch you sleeping
I watch you sleeping
I watch you sleeping

[Verse 1: Elton John]
I am here to tell you we can never meet again
Simple, really, isn't it? A word or two, and then
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when
You think of me or speak of me or wonder what befell
The someone you once loved so long ago so well

[Verse 2: LeAnn Rimes]
Never wonder what I'll feel as living shuffles by
You don't have to ask me, and I need not reply
Every moment of my life from now until I die
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand
How a perfect love can be confounded out of hand

[Chorus: Elton John & LeAnn Rimes]
Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this God's experiment
In which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day

[Verse 3: Elton John, LeAnn Rimes, & both]
Nothing can be altered, oh, there is nothing to decide
No escape, no change of heart, no anyplace to hide
You are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned
What it is to be in love and have that love returned

[Chorus: Elton John & LeAnn Rimes]
Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this God's experiment
Oh, in which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day

[Chorus: Elton John, LeAnn Rimes, both, & choir]
Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this God's experiment
In which we have no say (In which we have no say)
In which we're given paradise (Given paradise)
But only for a day
You keep goin' your way - I'll keep goin' my way (I'll keep goin' my way, you keep rollin' your way)
River, stay 'way from the door
I just got (me) a cabin - you don't need my (you'll never need that) cabin
River, stay 'way from the door

Don't (you) come up any higher - I'm so all alone
Leave the bed and the fire - that is all I own (- and you can have that phone)

I ain't breakin' your heart - don't (you) start breakin' my heart
River, stay 'way from the door

(Stay 'way, get 'way, roll 'way, stay 'way)
(You dirty, old, muddy river, you)
(River, stay 'way from the door)
I got on a city bus and found a vacant seat
I thought I saw my future bride walking up the street
I shouted to the driver hey conductor, you must slow down
I think I see her please let me off this bus

Nadine, honey is that you?

Oh, Nadine. honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I see you darling you got something else to do

Downtown searching for her, looking all around
See you coming to me, here we yellow cab
She move around, look, go go. (? )

Oh honey is that you ?

[Intro: Mike]
Excuse me, I know we just met
But may I have this dance?

[Verse 1: Nathan]
Sitting here with a drink in my hand
Your presence I can't ignore
I must admit I like watching you dance
But it seems like I've seen this before
Girl, you look like my first wife
Though I've never been married before
So I kiss your hand and tell you, "Thank you"
You turn and ask me, "What for?"

[Chorus]
For our first kiss on next week
For when we made love in six weeks
For the ring you wore
Proudly three months from now
For when you said, "I do", next March
And for those beautiful children of ours
Yes, I know it might sound strange 'cause we just met
But I thank you in advance
Shawn, help me sing it

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman, Michael & (All)]
Hi, my name is Shawn
Tell me your name although I know the last one
It's funny that we're shaking hands
Wait a minute, I know this hand
It's the same hand
(I'll hold in front of a minister)
Same hand
(When you're having my son and his sister)
I don't mean to sound so bold and forward
But I thank you in advance

[Chorus]
For our first kiss on next week
For when we made love in six weeks
For the ring you wore
Proudly three months from now
For when you said, "I do", next March
And for those beautiful children of ours
Yes, I know it might sound strange 'cause we just met
But I thank you in advance

[Bridge: Wanya]
It's like I came back in time to tell you, "Thank you"
You're as beautiful then as you are now
Look in the mirror, there is a picture
Of you and the man you love

[Chorus]
For our first kiss on next week
For when we made love in six weeks
For the ring you wore
Proudly three months from now
For when you said, "I do", next March
And for those beautiful children of ours
Yes, I know it might sound strange 'cause we just met
But I thank you in advance
For our first kiss on next week
For when we made love in six weeks
For the ring you wore
Proudly three months from now
For when you said, "I do", next March
And for those beautiful children of ours
Yes, I know it might sound strange 'cause we just met
But I thank you in advance

[Outro]
I...I thank you in advance
Oh, ooh ooh ooh
Yo, aye yo, I live by the sun and I'm a' die by the sun. Can't be livin' by the gun, man I never even held one, but does that make me less of a man? 'Cause I got a spray can not a gun in my hand. I got 4 clips of innocence. Blaster gas. Leave them speechless I'm sketching pieces while the cats is killin my thesis. It's hard to find peace of mind but when you do, it's hard to keep. Ignorance will take you out in your sleep. It's just a little hard to swallow nobody's a leader no more. They all follow. They is as hollow as my man mike as drum be. I know it's always hard to believe. They cast to sea. They catch a disease. They quickly try to Preach it to my family but somethin's gotta give before I bring my kinds into this world we gotta rearrange the way we live, we gotta rearrange the way we live

This thing called life is made of many decisions. The choices you make determine you and your livin'. There's a rocketship headed for truth, you better get it. You find yourself a waste of time tryin to fit in. This thing called life comes to many conclusions. You get one shot. You either winnin or losein . & I had to break free from my state of confusion but it gave me the strength to see through hate's illusions
(Like that ya'll, L-like that, L-L-Like that ya'll, Like that, L-L-Like that, Like that, L-L-Like that ya'll, like that x2)

Sometimes I push my mental way beyond my boundaries and sometimes it's detrimental to my health. Nowadays, we can't be out for self. We got to free one another, Kill that racial blindfold so we can see one another. Ignorant racist leave a scar tissue on the faces of beautiful human beings. I see a new light, this thing called life creep up from behind like a sign on your back. Spark your mind with a rhyme and it's time to react. Addicted to this rap sh*t like he be to crack. It won't stop writing the mic is like a crack pipe. Don't get the wrong idea. this is for the cats usin' the third eye vision to try and find why we're here. You need to get up, get out. You're all in the wrong without and I hope it don't take you too long to figure it out. I said I hope it don't take you too long

This thing called life is made of many decisions. The choices you make determine you and your livin'. There's a rocketship headed for truth, you better get it. You find yourself a waste of time tryin to fit in. This thing called life comes to many conclusions. You get one shot. You either winnin or losein. & I had to break free from my state of confusion but it gave me the strength to see through hate's illusions
(Now clap your hands and say yeah! x3)

This is more than just music to us, this is life. These cats ain't that amusin' to us. We on a another level. Pissin' on their heads from above. We in the clouds watchin over the kids (watchin' over) x 4

This thing called life is made of many decisions. The choices you make determine you and your livin'. There's a rocketship headed for truth, you better get it. You find yourself a waste of time tryin to fit in. This thing called life comes to many conclusions. You get one shot. You either win it or lose it. & I had to break free from my state of confusion but it gave me the strength to see through hate's illusions
Don't know why
Theres no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I
Ain't together
Keeps raining all the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time
The time
So weary all the time

When she went away
The blues walked in and they met
If she stays away that old rocking chair's gonna get me
All I do is pray the Lord above is gonna let me
Walk in the sun once more
Can't go on
Everything I have is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I
Ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all the time

Backing singers:
When she went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away that old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I have is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I
Ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
The time
Keeps raining all the time
Part I: This Moment

[Verse 1]
Can you tell me, who called a race?
Can anyone stay in one place?
And when you get to the finish line
Will you wish for more time?
But see, one day
One day you will
But maybe one day you will find
That you just can’t push rewind

[Chorus]
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now

[Bridge]
Be here with me now
'Cause the future is right now, right in front on you
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
Our future is right now, I'm in front of you
Baby, don't blink and miss this moment

[Chorus]
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now

Part II: Love Me

[Verse 1]
I lost myself in fear of losing you
I wish I didn’t do, but I did
I lost my own, my own identity
Forgot that you picked me for me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But now, I don’t negotiate with insecurities
They always seem to get the best of me
I found I had to love myself the way I wanted you to
Love me

[Chorus]
No more second-guessing
No, there’s no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I’m gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I’m gonna love myself the way I want you to love me

[Bridge]
No more standing in my own way
(Let's get deeper, let's get closer)
No more standing in my own way
(The way I want you to love me)
No more standing in my own way
(Let's get deeper, let's get closer)
No more standing in my own way
(The way I want you to love me)

[Chorus]
No more second-guessing
No, there’s no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I’m gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I’m gonna love myself the way I want you to love me
No more second-guessing
No, there’s no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I’m gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I’m gonna love myself the way I want you to love me
Ever since the day I met you
I feel like I'm walking on air
And lately I'm convinced, it's no coincidence
I run into into you everywhere

And though I've heard your love is taken
I gotta believe what's in your eyes
Would I be out of line if I suggested a time
And we got together one of these nights

Got my heart set on you
You're everything I've ever wanted
Got my heart set on you
Can't be anything but love
Baby I'm bettin' on it

I don't want to give you the wrong impression
I'm not the kind who rushes in
But baby every time I see you, before I even leave you
I can hardly wait to see you again
Got my heart set on you
You're everything I've ever wanted
Got my heart set on you
Can't be anything but love
Baby I'm bettin' on it

I don't mean to be coming on strong
Or taking everything for granted
But love is a thing that just comes along
You don't understand how it got out of hand
But you're in it right from the start

Got my heart set on you
You're everything I've ever wanted
Got my heart set on you
Can't be anything but love
Baby I'm bettin' on it
And there used to be a ballpark where the field was warm and green
And the people played their crazy game with a joy I'd never seen
And the air was such a wonder from the hot dogs and the beer
Yes, there used a ballpark right here

And there used to be rock candy and a great big Fourth of July
With the fireworks exploding all across the summer sky
And the people watched in wonder, how they'd laugh and how they'd cheer
And there used to be a ballpark, right here

Now the children try to find it and they can't believe their eyes
'cause the old team just isn't playing and the new team hardly tries
And the sky has got so cloudy when it used to be so clear
And the summer went so quickly this year

Yes, there used to be a ballpark, right here

[Chorus 1]
I hate to see your broken face
This world would give you anything
As long as you will want to
As long as you will want to

[Verse 1]
I hate your state of hopelessness
And that vain articulateness
You're a loser-type wreck wannabe
Not a pretty sight, really
In another world, it'd be funny

[Verse 2]
I hate to see your broken face
A lazy life, a fatal waste
Of fashionable cynicism
The poison they want you to drink
Oh no, man, that's too easy
Oh no, man, that's so easy

[Chorus 2]
We weren't talking about happiness
Apply your leading potential
To be useful to this planet
The world would give you anything
As long as you will want to
As long as you will want to

[Verse 2]
I hate to see your broken face
A lazy life, a fatal waste
Of fashionable cynicism
The poison they want you to drink
Oh no, man, that's so easy
Oh no, man, that's too easy

[Chorus 2]
We weren't talking about happiness
Apply your leading potential
To be useful to this planet
The world would give you anything
As long as you will want to
As long as you will want to

[Verse 1]
Hey babe
I'm feelin' something kinda crazy
I know that we got something special, boy
But lately, I've been feelin' naughtier than usual

[Pre-Chorus]
You see I
I need a love that's crazy, don't you see
I'm looking for someone who can handle me
Need a fire so hot that it burns me so
I'm sorry when I met'cha that I did not know
That you and me, we're kind of incomplete
Need someone the same in-love with me
Give it up, put it up
Not enough, not enough, not enough
I need it
Out of control

[Chorus]
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control

[Verse 2]
Baby, I'm a toy
Let's play out of control
Cuz I want you more
When your out of control
BABY BABY BABY!

[Pre-Chorus]
You see I
Need a love that's crazy, don't you see
I'm looking for someone who can handle me
Need a fire so hot that it burns me so
I'm sorry when I met you that I did not know
You and me, we're kinda incomplete
Need someone who's the same, in love with me
Give it up, put it out
Not enough, not enough
Not enough, I mean it

[Chorus]
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control

[Bridge]
You see I want you here right now
No hesitate
Don’t pull me down
I love you more in my wavelength, in the night
(Cuz you want me
Cuz you want me
Cuz you want me)

[Chorus]
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
You were a lovely child
And your hair was like the morning sun
And I knew we were in love
We were alone to dream a dream
We held our love that held our hearts
And who are we who knew
All there was in life and coming through
And ev'ry lonely sad mistake
Every change and interchange we make
We held our love and that held our hearts

Until, until , oohh

Ahh .....
The game of love is to live it up and, baby, not too high
Don't you know, if you wanna get down with Mister P
You gotta go and let your backbone slide
What a feeling when you push it up, push it down
You gotta push it up, push it down, feel good

George Michael or Marvin Gaye
It still is the same in you
Baby, don't tease, ooh, just please
'Cause you know it's just me and you

All or nothing (hush)
It's got to be
Something gotta show when you're livin' under heat
All or nothing (hush)
Girl, let it be
Take it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat

I'm under heat, oh, baby, please take it slow
Give me some time and maybe our love will grow
I want a suitor, baby, and make it right
Take it from me, babe, I wanna rock all night
If it's good for me, it's good for you
You gotta never let your mood get dry
Just keep it wet and my 740 jet
Is pushing right on high

George Michael or Marvin Gaye
It still is the same in you
Baby, don't tease, ooh, just please
'Cause you know it's just me and you

All or nothing (hush)
It's got to be
Something gotta show when you're livin' under heat
All or nothing (hush)
Girl, let it be
Take it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat

I'm under heat, oh, baby, please take it slow
Give me some time and maybe our love will grow
I want a suitor, baby, and make it right
Take it from me, babe, I wanna rock all night

Push it up, push it down
Push it where it feels real good
On my lips, my sweet bumble bee
Sting me like I knew you could
All or nothing (hush)
It's got to be
Something gotta show when you're lyin' under me
All or nothing (hush)
Girl, let it be
Take it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat
"Just before we ask the Statler Brothers to come back out, we'd like to ask the Carter Family and Carl to help us out on a fine scripture. We got a lot of requests to do "Peace in the Valley."

Well, I'm tired and so weary but I must go along
Till the Lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well, the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes

(There will be peace in the valley for me some day)
There will be peace in the valley for me dear Lord, I pray
(There'll be no sadness no sorrow no trouble I see)
There will be peace in the valley for me
(For me)

Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolf will be tame
And the lion shall lay down with the lamb, oh yes
And the beast from the wild will be lead by a child
And I'll be changed changed from this creature that I am, oh yes

(There will be peace in the valley for me some day)
There will be peace in the valley for me dear Lord, I pray
(There'll be no sadness no sorrow no trouble I see)
There will be peace in the valley for me
(For me)

While the Snow Goose gradually gains
Strength, tended to by Rhayader and visited
By Fritha, a strong bond of affection grows
Between the three of them
Corrina, Corrina where you been so long
Corrina, Corrina where you been so long
I've been wondering about you baby
Baby please come home

Corrina, Corrina got you on my mind
Corrina, Corrina got you on my mind
I was sitting here thinking about you
Just can't keep you off my mind

I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
But without my Corrina
Life don't mean a thing

I love you Corrina, tell the world I do
I love you Corrina, tell the world I do
And I don't love nobody in this world but you
And I don't love nobody in this world but you
And I don't love nobody in this world but you

One does not know how
To deal with the real
Not even with its reflection
Scared of the void
Can't hear oneself
"this very" (whispering?) void must stay empty
To allow the space in which
One can vibrate
Leave it empty
Accept this place
So not to die alone
Connect and radiate
Hey little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go away and leave you all alone?
I got a bad desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire

Tell me pretty baby, is he good to you?
Can he do to you the things that I do?
I can take you higher
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire

Sometimes it feels like someone took a knife
Baby do you know and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my skull

At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire, ooh ooh
Take me, I'm yours if you'll take me, I want you to make me a part of your heart
And hold me, I dreamed you would hold me, now really enfold me, say we'll never part
All the love I have to give, I want to give to you
And as long as I shall live, I'll only live for you
Take me, and never forsake me
My darling, please take me and make your own, and make me your own
In the airport lounge she sat in a fancy feathered hat
The grandest lady I had ever seen
Outside the heavy rains had grounded all the planes
So I asked her if she'd like some company

In my rhinestone studded suit, My cowboy hat and boots
I must have been a sight to see
But she said "Pull up a chair," as she fumbled with her hair
A more unlikely pair you'll never see

I was Mogen David wine, she was Chabls Fifty-nine
But there we sat, the cowboy and the lady
She was evenings at the opera and summers in Paree
I was Grand Ole Opry, Nashville, Tennessee

The cowboy and the lady
As diff'rent as could be
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee

And somewhere in between her Harvey's Bristol Creme
And the beer I drank and the easy company
We somehow came together for a night of stormy weather
Now there's a little bit of class in this old cowboy
And there's a little bit of cowboy in the lady
The cowboy and the lady
As diff'rent as could be
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee

We somehow came together for a night of stormy weather
Now there's a little bit of class in this old cowboy
And there's a little bit of cowboy in the lady

[Verse 1]
Think I'll go out to Alberta
Weather's good there in the fall
I got some friends that I could go to working for
Still I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more

[Chorus]
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
If the good times are all gone
Then I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

[Verse 2]
If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are lookin' good
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
Not too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there

[Chorus]
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
The good times are all gone
So I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

[Verse 3]
Still, I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

[Chorus]
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
If the good times are all gone
Then I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
Wave that flag, pop the bag, skin the goat, learn to cope
Bell the rat, trap the cat, ball the jack, chew the fat
Read the signs, connect the lines, pay your fines, save your dimes
Pick up time, light the fuse, making time, pass the juice
Eat at days, hide in caves, pull the tooth, stretch the truth
Feed the poor, starve the war, pick up chicks, catch the fix
Get your kicks, pick up sticks, trim your wick, take your pick
Try your tricks, impress the chicks
Wash the fence, dig the den, live the vain, die in shame
Catch the fool, burn the stew, shine your shoes, sing the blues
Wave the flag, pop the bag, bell the cat, trap the rat
Ball the jack, chew the fat, shoot the breeze, lose the keys
Read the signs, connect the lines, pay your fines, read the rhyme
Shhot the breeze, lose your keys, don't be late, what I say
Walk on waves, read the raves, eat at day, hide in caves
Stretch the truth, pull the tooth, feed the poor, starve the war
Cash the fix, get your kicks, trim your wick, take your pick
Try your tricks, impress the chicks
Wash the fence, dig the den, live the shame,die in vain
Catch the fool, burn the stew, shine your shoes, sing the blues

[Intro: Yolanda Adams]
What are you trying to say, Yolanda?
Look, forget about all that other junk
This battle ain't yours, it's the lord's
Think about it, and then start shouting
Help me sing it

[Verse 1: Yolanda Adams]
There is no pain, Jesus can't feel
There is no hurt, that He cannot heal
For all things work — yes, they do
According to the Master's purpose
And His holy will
No matter what — you in the balcony — are going through
Remember that God only wants a chance to use you
For the battle is not yours, it's the Lord's
We gonna tell the devil that, alright?

[Verse 2: Yolanda Adams]
There's no sadness, Jesus cannot feel
And there is no sorrow
That the Master is not able and willing to heal
Remember that all things work
They're not gonna be all good
But they're gonna work according to God's purpose and His holy will
No matter what, no matter what you're going through
Remember, God sees all and he knows all
And all he wants to do is use you
For this battle is not yours, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's the Lord's

[Outro: Yolanda Adams, Choir]
This battle is the Lord's (It's the Lord's)
Yes, it's the Lord's (it is the Lord's)
But in faith you've got to hold your head up high
(hold your head up high)
You belong to the most high God, you don't need to cry
(Don't you cry, its the Lord's)
It's the Lord's
It's the Lord's (It's the Lord's)
Yeah, yeah, yes, it's the Lord's (It's the Lord's)
No matter what (No matter what)
You're going through (Through)
Remember, it's gonna be alright, He's just using you
(God is only using you for His glory)
No matter what (No matter what)
You happen to go through right now (Through)
Remember, this will be a memory, God is only using you
(God is only using you for His honor)
You've got to have faith (No matter what)
You've got to know in your heart (Through)
That no matter what comes no, matter what goes, God loves ya
(God is only using you)
He loves ya, He loves ya, He loves ya, He loves ya, He loves ya, He loves ya, He loves ya
(It's not yours)
And this battle is not yours (No)
He needs a chance to prove to your enemies that He is God
(It's not yours, it's the Lord's, not yours)
So what you've gotta do is hold on, hold on
(It's not yours)
Hold on, hold on (No)
Don't give up, don't give up
(It's not yours, it's the Lord's, not yours)
Don't give up, don't give up
Step out on faith (It's not yours)
Yeah, step out on faith (No)
Yes, step out on the word
It's not yours, it's the Lord's, not yours
Yes, this battle is not yours (It's not yours)
No, no (No)
This battle is not yours, no
(It's not yours, it's the Lord's, not yours)
If you don't understand anything (It's not yours)
Know that you've been set up by God to be blessed (No)
Understand that it's gotta work this way
(It's not yours, it's the Lord's, not yours)
Understand that God knows, God knows, God knows what you need
(It's not yours) Before you really need it (No)
He knows how to move ya
(It's not yours, it's the Lord's, not yours)
He knows how to take you around the enemy
He knows how to hide you (It's not yours)
In the comfort of His arms (No)
You'll have peace, the paths of understanding
(It's not yours, it's the Lord's, not yours)
You'll have joy like a river ever-flowing, ever-flowing
(It's not yours) Ever-flowing (No)
This battle is not yours, no
(It's not yours, it's the Lord's, not yours)
Tell the devil, no, this battle is not mine (It's not yours)
This battle is not mine (No)
I don't have to fight it, God is gonna do it
(It's not yours, it's the Lord's, not yours)
I don't have to fight it, God is gonna do it
I don't have to fight it, God is gonna do it
(It's not yours)
I don't have to fight it, God is gonna do it (No)
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
(It's not yours, it's the Lord's, not yours)
No, no, no (It's not yours), no, no (No)
I'm so glad that God sees it
(It's not yours, it's the Lord's, not yours)
The battle is not yours, no, it belongs to the Lord
Hallelujah, yeah, Hallelujah, yeah, Hallelujah
Woo, yeah
He's just good like that, He's just good

[Verse 1]
Hello my lover wherever you are
I've been a fool my dear
A fool by far
But I've grown up in my mind
I've played the game of love and lost
And now I'm crying
Aha Aha oh yeah

If you come back my dear
There'll be some changes made
I will alter myself in every way
I'm gonna start a brand new policy
I'm gonna teach you a lesson in loveology
Hmmm hmmm mmm mmm oh yeah

[Chorus]
Yes I will
Yes I will
You know I will

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna try my best do what is right
I'm gonna bewitch you my dear
Day and night
I'm gonna teach a brand new policy
I'm gonna teach you a lesson in loveology
Hmmm Hmmm oh yeah

[Chorus]
Yes I will
Yes I will
You know I will

Yes I will
Yes I will
You know I will

Yes I will
Yes I will
You know I will
I know they're gonna run take me
When they get across the sea
Ever' chance, those women; Watch-it's amazing
It's all safe and now sugar baby
Oh Mama, don't you weep and moan, Uncle Sam got your man and gone
Now then they're doin' the Lindy Bird across the sea
Oh Mama, how can it be, You went way across the sea
Just to keep from doing that Lindy fight with me
Oh baby, well I done just told'ja now
Oh Mama, don't you weep and moan, Uncle Sam got your man and gone
Now then they're doin' the Lindy Bird across the sea
She said, "Let me play the blues on your piano
And then I'll do that Lindy thing with you."
Mary had a dream about a submarine
I asked her for a glass of payolla;
She said, "Let me play the blues on your Victrola
And then I'll do that Lindy fight with you
Eleven times I been busted, eleven times I been to jail
Some of the times I been there nobody could go my bail
Well it seems to me, Lord that this ol' boy just don't fit
Well I can jump in a rosebush and come out smelling like sh...

Those misters dressed in blue never done so right by me
Some of the times I was innocent but the judge said guilty
I'm not one to complain now son I tell you true
When the black cat cross your trail, Lord
It comes in misery times two

(Chorus)
Double trouble--that's what my friends all call me
(Double trouble)
I said, double trouble
T-R-O-U-B-L-E

Well I was born down in the gutter
With a temper as hot as fire
Spent ninety days on a peat farm just doin' the county's time
Well now, even mama said Son you're bad news
And it won't be too long before someone puts one through you
(Chorus)

(Chorus)
Why was I born? Why am I livin'?
What do I get? What am I givin'?
Why do I want a thing I daren't hope for?
What can I hope for? I wish I knew

Why do I try to draw you near me?
Why do I do I cry? You never hear me
I'm a poor fool, but what can I do?
Why was I born to love you?

I'm a poor fool, but what can I do?
Why was I born to love you?
I'm gonna live till I die!
I'm gonna laugh 'stead of cry
I'm gonna take the town and turn it upside down
I'm gonna live, live, live until I die

They're gonna say "What a guy!"
I'm gonna play for the sky
Ain't gonna miss a thing
I'm gonna have my fling
I'm gonna live, live, live until I die

The blues I lay low
I'll make them stay low
They'll never trail over my head
I'll be a devil, till I'm an angel, but until then Hallelujah

Gonna dance, gonna fly
I'll take a chance riding high
Before my number's up
I'm gonna fill my cup
I'm gonna live, live, live, until I die!
The blues I lay low
I'll make them stay low
They'll never trail over my head
I'll be a devil, till I'm an angel, but until then Hallelujah

Gonna dance, gonna fly
I'll take a chance riding high
Before my number's up
I'm gonna fill my cup
I'm gonna live, live, live, until I die!
I say hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
Sweet Mary Lou I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
You passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
Ooh, I wanted you forever more
Hey, I'm not one that get's around
Swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did see you no more
Yeah neah
I said hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
Sweet Mary Lou I'm so in love with you
Hey, I knew Mary Lou we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
So hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
One more time
Yes, hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
Hey, wait a minute
One minute
Ah, I need my fucking water
I don't care, let's go
Right, give us the right key for fuck's sake
Welcome to my morning (farewell andromeda)
(john denver)

Welcome to my morning
Welcome to my day
I'm the one responsible
I made it just this way
To make myself some pictures
See what they might bring
I think i made it perfectly
I wouldn't change a thing

Welcome to my happiness
You know it makes me smile
And it pleases me to have you here
For just a little while
While we open up the spaces
Try to break some chains
And if the truth is told
They will never come again
Welcome to my evening
The closing of the day
I could try a million times
Never find a better way
To tell you that i love you
And all the songs i play
Are to thank you for allowing me
Inside this lovely day

Welcome to my morning
Welcome to my day
I'm the one responsible
I made it just this way
To make myself some pictures
And see what they might bring
I think i made it perfectly
I wouldn't change a thing
Will you take part in my life, my love
That is my dream
Life is but a dream; it's what you make it
Always try to give; don't ever take it
Life has its music, life has its song of love, love
Life is but a dream, and I dream of you
Strange as it seems, all night I see you
I'm tryin' to tell you just what you mean to me
I love you with all my heart
I adore you and all your lovin' charms
I want you to do your part
Come here to my open arms
Life is but a dream, & we can live it
Oh we can make a love none to compare with
Oh will you take part in my life, my love
That is my dream
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I was a sailor, I was lost in sea
I was under the waves, before love rescued me
I was a fighter I could turn on a threat
Now I stand accused of the things I've said

When love comes to town
I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town
I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

Used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town

Ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue when I fell into a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town
Love comes to town
I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town
I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

I was there when they crucified my lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah...
(There they go again but they never break up)
(Everyday a fight, then they kiss and make up)

Kisses and tears, that's all our love is
It's nothing but kisses and tears
You don't seem to need the slightest reason
To chase that sunshine and bring on the rainy season

Kisses and tears, it's up to you
If we laugh or we cry through the years (it's up to you)
Unless you trust me, whenever a doubt appears
Your future with me will continue to be kisses and tears

You're crying again, you're sighing again
Can't we patch it up this time?
I guess it's alright, we've finished our fight
It's just about kiss-time

You shouldn't be kissed, I oughta resist
That's all that love is
You're making me cry, you're making me sigh
Oh whatsa matter, baby?
You don't seem to need the slightest reason
(To chase the sunshine and bring on, bring on the rainy season)
Kisses and tears, it's up to you
If we laugh or if we cry through the years
Unless you trust me, whenever a doubt appears
Your future with me will continue to be
Loving and crying, continually
Our future will be just kisses and tears
(Kisses, kisses, kisses and tears)
(Woe, it's lover's quarrel that they never should have started,)
(A dearly lover's quarrel and it's left them broken-hearted.)
Oh, I'm sorry, can't you see that I'm sorry
All my life I'll be sorry, I was mean to you
You're so dear to me, when you're near to me, the whole world seems fine
Need you so
I'm sorry, will you ever forgive me?
Heaven knows I'll be sorry if you say we're through

Darling, I love you, won't you tell me you're sorry too

I'm sorry (take him back, oh take him back, he didn't mean it)
Will you ever forgive me (take him back, oh take him back, he never meant to hurt you))
I'll be sorry (please forgive him, please forgive him)
If you say we're though (take him back and never say you're through)

Won't you tell me you're sorry too
(take him back, oh take him back, or maybe you'll be sorry too.)
How green was my valley
How blue were my skies
I worshipped the love light
That shone in your eyes

Our heavenly love dream
Has faded and gone;
No more does the sunrise
Appear with the dawn

I still hear your laughter
I whisper your name;
This world, dear, without you
Will never be the same

How green was my valley
How dear were your charms;
Come back to me darling
Come back to my arms!

How green was my valley
How dear were your charms;
Come back to me darling
Come back to my arms!
Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, yeah

Father, father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me
So you can see
Oh, what's going on
What's going
What's going on
What's going on
Right on, baby
Right on
Right on

Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Come on talk to me
So you can see
What's going on
What's going on
Tell me what's going on
I'll tell you ya, what's going on

Right on, baby
Right on, baby
Right on, baby
We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night
Got into a fight
Well, I feel so broke up
I want to go home

So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home, yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home

The first mate he got drunk
And broke in the captain's trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone
Why don't you leave me alone? Yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home
So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Let me go home
Why don't you let me go home?
(Hoist up the John B's sail)
Hoist up the John B
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home
Let me go home

The poor cook he caught the fits
And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home
Why don't they let me go home?
This is the worst trip
I've ever been on

So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Let me go home
Why don't you let me go home?
There's a law in what we do
We got a quest for something new
Everything you witness seems to
Let you down
If someone gets you from behind
I got an open mind
And you've been thirsty for the friend you found

Close your eyes and make a wish
I don't wanna mess with mother nature
Knowing that you're mine
You said I could see
You with another and we all get satisfied

It's a form of evolution
It's a kind of movin' on
An eternal source of pleasure
In being the one
When your love is for the giving
It's a case of destiny
You know we look for the same insane games
Got to be commital to be a little deviation
So I get all wound up inside
I can see your scene unwind
You dance together or you dance alone
And leave the real world in the air
Love it in leather I don't care
Everything is legal in the danger zone

Close your eyes and make a wish
Later we could cater to the animal
Knowing that you're mine
It's straight in my face
You and your lover and the brain is paralyzed

It's a form of evolution
It's a kind of movin' on
It's a cycle of emotion
In being the one
In the storm of revolution
What is done can be undone
You know we look for the same insane games
Got to be commital
To the subtle variations

It's a form of evolution
It's a kind of movin' on
It's a cycle of emotion
In being the one
If your love is for the givin'
It's a case of destiny
And you can find your source of pleasure
In being with me
It's a form of evolution
It's a kind of movin' on
It's a cycle of emotion
In being the one
If your love is for the givin'
It's a case of destiny
And you can find your source of pleasure
In being with me

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
Look what you've done
You made a fool out of someone (out of someone)
You thought love was true
And found out that you were just having fun (just having fun)

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks + (The Temptations)]
And oh, why do you wanna make me blue?
After all, I've been good to you (I've been good to you)
Oh, yes I have

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
And I recall the time, mmm-hmm
You needed somebody and I made you mine
You needed a friend so I took you in
And treated you so kind

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks + (The Temptations)]
And oh, why do you wanna make me blue?
After all, I've been good to you (I've been good to you)
Oh, yes I have

[Bridge: Eddie Kendricks]
And you know I've always been around
And I never, never, never let you down
And now you telling me that you must go
You know that you're hurting me so...

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks]
But there, there come a time
One day, one day, one day you're gonna wake up and find
You'll come back to me on your bending knee
And you're gonna be crying

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks + (The Temptations)]
And oh, believe me, what I say is true, baby
After all, Lord, I've been good to you (I've been good to you)
Every day, and every way (I've been good to you)
Whoa, you know, you know, you know, baby, I've been so good
(I've been good to you)

(June 7, 1969)

1
I feel the ocean swaying me ...
Washing away all my pains
See where I was wounded
Remember the scar ?
Now you can't see a thing ...
And I feel no pain --

Singing about the Valley of Sunsets
Green and blue ... Canyons too
Singing about Atlantis love songs
The Valleys of Neptune is arising

2

Mercury liquid ... Emerald's shining
Telling me where I came from --
Honey Sun ... Pourquise Bed he
Lays in -- ... on the Burning
Edge Horizon
I'm sailing on the Bluebird's mission ...
Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam --
See the wind make love to all
The ocean ... Joy spread and
The massage got home --

Singing about the Valley of Sunsets ...
Purple and gold ... the Armies of the Lord
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips ...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising --

3

Look out East coast, but you're
Gonna have a neighbor
A rebirth land ...
The praying Burning Sands

We know there were worlds
So much older ...
And they shall rise, and
Tell us much more the truth of man --

4

I see visions of sleeping peaks
Erupting ...
Releasing all hell that
Will shake the Earth from end to end --
And this ain't bad news, good news
Or any news ... it's just the truth
Better save your souls while
You can --
Singing about the New Valleys
Of the Sunrise ... Rainbow clean
The world is gonna be ...
Singing about getting ready for the new tide ...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising
I woke up under the ... my way
... tomorrow
Sorry I was under the sky
Sorry I was under the sky
Joy and ...broken too, ...reach out
Summer is breaking ... and try
Sorry I was under the sky
Sorry I was under the sky

[Chorus]
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
Keeps us all anticipating
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are searchers of the truth
Every man's a boy deep down
Gotta say it how you mean it
There ain't no easy way

[Verse 1]
Like a bird in the wind, like a tree in the storm
Like the breath of a child from the moment he's born
'Til the very last day when the curtains are drawn

[Chorus]
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Asking every question why
From arrival to survival
Just to make it worth the waiting
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are faces in the night
Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
There ain't no easy way

[Verse 2]
In the back of your mind, there is always a mark
There's a wandering soul all alone in the dark
You can keep it forever or tear it apart

[Chorus]
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by
Changing my life, changing your life
Keeps us all anticipating
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by

[Verse 3]
Like a bird in the wind, like a tree in the storm
Like the breath of a child from the moment he's born
'Til the very last day when the curtains are drawn

[Chorus]
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
Keeps us all anticipating
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
Keeps us all anticipating
It starts with just a little glance now
Right away you're thinkin' 'bout romance now
You know you ought to take it slower
But you just can't wait to get to know her

A brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing
But if you're not careful think about the pain it can bring

It makes you feel so bad
It makes your heart feel sad
It makes your days go wrong
It makes your nights so long

You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Right now you think that she's perfection
This time is really an exception
Well you know I hate to be a downer
But I'm the guy she left before you found her
Well I'm not saying you won't have a good love with her
But I keep on remembering things like they were

She made me feel so bad
She made my heart feel sad
She made my days go wrong
And made my nights so long

You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
Uh uh oh ahhhhhhh radio killa
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love

You said you changed, but still nothing
You're still the same, I'm just a part time lover

And I'm the blame, should've went away
But yet I stayed, with a part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out on the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

I left the state, changed everything
No more 818, for the part time lover

What goes around, comes back around
And then you get what you deserve
You part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out
On the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

Watch these red bottoms, and the back of my jeans
Watch me go, bye baby
Don't know what you got until it's gone

Tail Lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit that driveway

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)

Watch me walk it out
Walk it out, walk it out
Walk this right up out the house
Walk it out watch me walk it out
Walk it out walk this right up out the house
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)

Half-black half-white domino
Gain the money - Op-e-doe

Everyday I'm shufflin'
Shufflin', shufflin'

Step up fast
And be the first girl to make me throw this cash
We gettin' money, don't be mad
And now stop - ...hatin' is bad

One more shot for us, another round
Please fill up my cup, don't mess around

Put your, put your (whoo)
Put your, put your
..your hands up

Put your hands up
Every day I'm shufflin'
There may be trouble ahead
But while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance

Before the fiddlers have fled
Before they ask us to pay the bill
And while we still have the chance
Let's face the music and dance

Soon, we'll be without the moon
Humming a different tune
And then...

There may be teardrops to shed
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Face the music and dance

Before the fiddlers have fled
Before they ask us to come up with the bill
And while we still have got that chance
Face that music and dance
Soon, we'll be without the moon
Humming a different tune
And then...

There may be teardrops to shed
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance
Dance
Let's hear that music
Look at that music
Why not face the music and dance?
Time's gonna come
You'll want me back someday
Time's gonna come
Want me, want me back someday
But you are evil woman
You don't mean me no good at anyway
You was blind to me, baby
I give you all I can
You was blind to me, baby
But still I give you all, all I had
But you, b-b-but you are evil woman
I'm a strong man
You caused me so much trouble
I don't wanna see your face no more
You caused me so much trouble
Don't wanna see your, your face no more
'Cause you are the evil woman
Don't want you hangin' 'round my door
Jemaine and Bret:
Frodo, don't wear the ring
I know it's very tempting
Yes, you will appear to disappear
But the dark riders they'll know you're there
Yes, Lord Sauron has many spies…

Eugene:

Many spies, have many eyes…

Jemaine and Bret:
One ring to bind them, to find them
One ring to rule them all
One ring to bind them, one to find them
One ring to rule them ALLLLLLL!!!
Yea, Little Frodo!
You've got to rule them, Frodo, rule them with the ring Come on ruuuule them
With your ring!

Eugene:
Lord Sauron has many spies, beasts and birds
Mel:
If you want him, come and claim him!

Bret:
Do they, Gandalf?

Murray:
I am not a conjurer of cheap tricks!

Jemaine:
I can't carry the ring
But I can carry you, Mr. Frodo

Dave:
You have my sword

Bret:
And my bow

Dave:
And my axe!

Mel:
Noro nim mish fir mar nim nor!

Jermaine:
Mordor…
Dave:
We'll never make it
There's thousands of them and only nine of us...

Bret:
Ohhhh…

Dave:
We made it…

Bret:
Hurray, we made it

Jemaine and Bret:
Yo Frodo, what you doin' wearing the ring?
All powerful jewelry, is that your new thing?
I know it's hard when you're little more than 3 foot 4
Your little ass so close to the floor
Trying to lead the fellows to the gates of Mordor
The Fellowship!
(Yea the fellowship)

I don't rap about bitches and hoes
I rap about witches and trolls
Just passing on the words of the Elven king
Wisdom to all
Frodo! Don't wear the ring!
Jemaine and Bret:
Frodo don't wear the ring
The magical bling bling
You'll never be the Lord of the Rings…

I'm glad
I'm glad

[Verse 1]
Baby, when I think about
The day that we first met
Wasn't looking for what I found
But I found you and I'm bound to
Find happiness in being around you

[Chorus]
I'm glad when I'm making love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel (I'm glad)
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time

[Post-Chorus]
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad

I dig the way that you get down
And you still know how to hold me
A perfect blend, so masculine
I think I'm in love

I'm glad when I'm making love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind

[Bridge]
I'm glad that you turned out to be
That certain someone special
Who makes this life worth living (Worth living)

So say that you won't leave
'Cause since the day you came, I've been glad
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Many times, I've been told, by the wise and the old
Something good I'm supposed to remember
If my first love I'll found in, in the warm of July
It'll cool in the, in the nip of September

[Verse 2]
Now they point to the skies
To the old and wise
And they speak of a chill in the air
But I don't care

[Chorus]
Oh, still I love my summertime love
Still I love the kissing and the codding
Still I love my summertime love
With a heart still summertime true
Still I love my summertime love
Still I want her walking close beside me
Still I love my summertime love
Let the seasons change as they do

[Outro]
Oh, still I love my summertime love
Still I love the kissing and the codding
Still I love my summertime love
With a heart still summertime true

Cryin' in the streets
They run for their lives
How can you lead them to heaven
They don't realize
Children of the night
How far can we fall
That which we say is forever
Ain't no time at all

Father and the son
Not too young to be old
Reach out for each other when
The world goes cold
Feel so good to be home
Are you ready for

My high civilization
Are you ready for
My high civilization
Are you ready for
My high civilization
Civilization
Everything for us to see
The ultimate society

Keeper of the sword
You fight for your rights
How can you live for the hour
When there's no yesterday
Dyin' in the streets
Your number your name
All that which keeps us together
Is bringing us the pain

Thunder of the guns
Comes the criminal mind
Working for the power of
The evil eye
We are never alone
Uncivilized

My high civilization
Are you ready for
My high civilization
Are you ready for
My high civilization
Civilization
New York, Paris, Tokyo
Vienna to Berlin
Baby don't know you
L.A., Rome, Afghanistan
Cairo to Iran
No city can hold you
There's no one in Avalon to show you
Minutes into seconds are you ready
For the end

My high civilization
Are you ready for
My high civilization
Are you ready for
My high civilization
Civilization
Well, I wish I was a catfish
Swimmin' in the deep blue sea
I'd have all you women
Fishin' after me
Fishin' after me
Fishin' after me

Well, I'm broke and I'm hungry
Ragged and I'm dirty too
Well, if I clean up, baby, can I
Stay home with you
Stay home with you
Stay home with you

If I can't, can't come in
Let me sit down front of your door
I'll leave so early, your
Mom won't know
Won't never know
Won't never know
Oh, I know, know my baby
Well, she's going to jump and shout
When my train pulls in and I
I come walkin' out
Come walkin' out
Come walkin' out

Yes, I'm goin', babe I'm goin'
And your crying won't make me stay
Oh, the more that you cry, baby
More I'll go away
More I'll go away
More I'll go away

Well now I know, I know you don't want me
Why in the world won't you tell me so?
Then I won't be caught, baby, 'round
Your house no more
Your house no more
Your house no more
Girl.... I'm gonna take the month of August off... just to get you off
I'm freaky... I'm gonna clear the table top, we're gonna need a mop, I'm freaky

Let's take a photo of a goat in a boat
And then we can float in the moat and be freaky
Freaky
Let's take my body and we'll cover it with honey
Stick some money to the honey, now I'm covered in money, honey
I go outside onto the ledge and push my ass against the glass
You can act like you don't know me
I take a cup and then I put it on my head
And I just stand there being freaky with a cup on my head

I told you I was freaky (I told you I was freaky baby)
You didn't believe me (Don't look at me)
I told you I was freaky (Look at me)
Girl, let's get freaky

Let's make two life-size cardboard cut-outs of our bodies
And then pose them into sensual positions
I'll paint the wallpaper pattern onto your naked skin
Stand against the wallpaper and get off like chameleons
I'll flip some clips on my lips, I'll clip some chips to your hips
I'll nibble chips off your hips and watch the moon eclipse
I'll go outside and get some leaves and pretend to be a tree
You can be a squirrel, and store my nuts for me
I told you I was freaky (He told you he was freaky baby)
You didn't believe me (Take that off)
I told you I was freaky (Put this on)
Girl, I do this shit weekly

I want to fly so high in the sky and see what our love brings
Let's steal my roommate's pillow feathers and make some homemade wings
Gonna fly so high on makeshift pillow wings
Girl, can you believe we're flying on homemade pillow wings?

Here I am all dressed in snakeskin
Now I'm in your kitchen making love to your cake tin
Oh no, is this the one you bake in?
I told you I was freaky did you think I was fakin'?
At 8PM I sell my underpants on eBay
At half-past nine I hold a seance in your hallway
At ten o'clock I ask some ghosts for a three way
Yes it's creepy, I told you I was freaky

Ow!
Ow ow ow!

I told you I was freekie, baby!
I told you I was freekie, baby!
When I first met you baby, honey you were almost out of school
When I first met you baby, honey you were almost out of school
You were real wild then woman, honey, but you were nobody's fool

I was so in love with you baby and I tried to get you to love me too
I was so in love with you baby and I tried to get you to love me too
I thought you had no time for me then woman, wouldn't do anything you asked me to

Oh, sweet thing, you are all I want to see
Oh, sweet thing, you are all I want to see
I having so much trouble baby, I wonder what's gonna happen to me

[Intro]
Aha, Fuck is this? S Soun-Sounds like the industry
You know, people don't understand, how you get to this point
So I think I should tell them before cause right now after
And you know this morning , I woke up in my Polo sheets
Throw on my Gucci slip ons , brushed my teeth , hopped in the benz and came right to the studio
But ima tell you the story

I.......
If I fall in love , it's only with you
And if I call for love, it's got to be true
But if you fail . to keep it a tie
Then I'll know, it's only a lie
And I'll know what to do
Oh, I'll know what to do

If you wear my ring , you wear it for me
You've got to wear that thing indefinitely
And if you're bad , even just for a while
I'll be sad , then I'll push you behind
'cause I know what to do
Oh I know what to do

I.......

I am a man of words, the few words I say
If you play my game , you play it my way
If you don't , one look in your eye
And I'll know, you're telling me lies
And I'll know what to do
I know what to do
I.....
Oh I'll know what to do
Oh I'll know what to do
Be sure it's true when you say, "I love you"
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of hearts have been broken
Just because these words were spoken

I love you, yes I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure it's true when you say, "I love you"
It's a sin to tell a lie

Cross my heart, I hope to die
I'll never, never, never tell another white lie
Took a little girl out on a date last night
Next to her Gramma Gerty would have looked alright

Now I'm between the devil and the deep blue sea
Cause I said "Baby you look good to me"
I told her I loved her and oh how I lied
Now she's getting set to be my blushing bride

If she leads me to the altar, I'm sunk
Cause I cannot tell the preacher I was drunk
So Dear Lord have mercy on a no account sinner
Give me one more chance to let another guy win her
Cross my heart, I hope to die
I'll never, never, never, tell one more time
I'll never tell another white lie
O-lee-o-lee-o-lee-o

Come darling let's join in matrimony
So please marry me Gloria, darling can't you see Gloria

Gloria girl I tell you no, and I beg you not to forget
A promise to me is more than a debt
So please marry me Gloria, sweetheart can't you see Gloria
You must understand, I want you like a cop wants a wanted man

My only hope in this world
Give me your hand and say you do

Three days of snow in Birmingham
Thought you would wonder where I am
Rang our number all night long
It's no comfort on the telephone
Ran out and caught a midnight flight
Thought a little love would make everything all right
The landlord said, "You moved away"
And left me all your bills to pay"
Look out baby, you might have made your move too soon

Left me with a Keno card
This life in Vegas sure ain't hard
I ran it up to about fifty grand
Cashed it in and held it in my hand
That kind of word can get around
And make a lost love come up found
I hear you knocking baby at my door
But you know you ain't living here no more
It's too bad
I think you made your move too soon
I've been from Spain to Tokyo
From Africa to Ohio
I never tried to make the news
I'm just a man who plays the blues
I take my lovin' everywhere
I came back, and they still care you know
One love ahead
One love behind
One in my arms and one on my mind
It's one thing baby
I never make my move too soon

I've been from Spain to Tokyo
From Africa to Ohio
I never tried to make the news
I'm just a man who plays the blues
I take my lovin' everywhere
I come back, you know they still all care
One love ahead and one behind
One in my arms you know, one on my mind
And it's one thing people
I never make my move too soon
Yeah

Somebody told me, mm, U were cryin' tears

All in the merry month of May
When green buds all are swellin'
Sweet William on his deathbed lay for love of Barbara Allen

He sent his servant to the town
The place where she did dwell in
Saying, 'Master dear has sent me here if your name be Barbara Allen.'

Then slowly, slowly she got up and slowly she went to him
And all she said when there she came was, 'Young man, I think you're dying

'Don't you remember the other night when we were in the tavern?
You drank a toast to the ladies there and slighted Barbara Allen.'

He turned his face unto the wall
He turned his back upon her
'Adieu, adieu, to all my friends
And be kind, be kind to Barbara Allen.'

As she was wandering on the fields she heard the death bell knellin'
And every note, it seemed to say
'Hard-hearted Barbara Allen!'
The more it tolled the more she grieved
She bursted out a-crying
'Oh, pick me up and carry me home
I fear that I am dying.'

They buried Willy in the old church yard and Barbara in the new one
And from William's grave, there grew a rose, from Barbara's, a green briar

They grew and grew in the old church yard
Till they could grow no higher
And there they tied in a true lover's knot
The red rose and the briar
They turned away Mary and Josef
Away from the inn
They turn 'way Mary and Josef
'Way from the inn
They turn 'way Mary and Josef
'Way from the inn

That's what made the glory manger
And the hallelujah, hallelujah
Wasn't that a bright Bethlehem morning
All around the glory manger

There in a stable she born him
Cold winter night
There in a stable she born him
Cold winter night
And there in a stable she born him
On a cold winter night

And sanctified the glory manger
And the hallelujah hallelujah
Wasn't that a bright Bethlehem morning
All around the glory manger
And all his pretty little fingers played in the straw
All his pretty little fingers played in the straw
And all his pretty little fingers played in the straw

That's what made the glory manger
And the hallelujah hallelujah
Wasn't that a bright Bethlehem morning
All around the glory manger
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood, in the mood
I'm in the mood for love
I said, night time is the right time
To be with the one you love
You know when night come, baby God know
You so far away
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood, in the mood
Baby, I'm in the mood for love
(guitar solo & instrumental)
I said, yes my mother told me
To leave that girl alone
But my mother didn't know
What that girl was puttin' down
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood, baby
I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood, in the mood
Baby, I'm in the mood for love
In the hush of evening
As shadows steal across my lonely room
I think of you
I think of you
From afar the music
Of violins comes softly through the gloom
All I can do
Is think of you
O I can see you standing there before me
And I can hear you whisper
You adore me
So when dusk is falling
I live again the loveliness we knew
I think of you
I think of you

[Intro]
I love you
I love you
And this is eternal, oh

[Verse 1]
It's love, true love
That brings my heart to you
Home to you girl, yeah
And it's the same
Deep feeling of love
That brings you close to, to me baby
Oh, but tonight I want my arms
And body wrapped all around you
All around you
For as close as we both are
So much closer we will be
Believe in me, yeah

[Chorus]
Here and now
I wanna take a lover's vow
I want you to come with me now
Let's make tonight the first night of a love eternal
Day and night
We'll have an everlasting life
I wanna feel it shining bright
Let's make tonight the first night of a love eternal

[Verse 2]
Here in this place our passions move
Move in slow motion
Oh, while the rest of the world
In real time passes by, rushes by
Oh, I expressly forbid
Any heartache to ever, ever, ever, ever
Come anywhere, anywhere, anywhere near you girl
Oh, we'll use our love as protection
You'll never, never, never, never
Never have to cry or dry your eyes

[Chorus]
Here and now
I wanna take a lover's vow
I want you to come with me now
Let's make tonight the first night of a love eternal
Day and night
We'll have an everlasting life
I wanna feel it shining bright
Let's make tonight the first night of a love eternal

Here and now
I wanna take a lover's vow
I want you to come with me now
Let's make tonight the first night of a love eternal
Day and night
We'll have an everlasting life
I wanna feel it shining bright
Let's make tonight the first night of a love eternal

[Guitar solo]

I'll dry your eyes girl, ooh

[Chorus]
Here and now
I wanna take a lover's vow
I want you to come with me now
Let's make tonight the first night of a love eternal
Day and night
We'll have an everlasting life
I wanna feel it shining bright
Let's make tonight the first night of a love eternal

Here and now
I wanna take a lover's vow
I want you to come with me now
Let's make tonight the first night of a love eternal
Day and night
We'll have an everlasting life
I wanna feel it shining bright
Let's make tonight the first night of a love eternal

[Outro]
Hey, oooh, oooh baby

You see, all I know is I love you, girl
And I need you baby
Oooh weee, oooh wee
Oooh wee, ooh wee baby
Ah, ah, ah

Daddy was a Cajun, raised on Southern land
And so my kinfolks tell me, was a street-fightin' man
Well, they rushed him down to see the doctor
"Hey doctor, won't you check his head?"
The only thing that was wrong with him
Was Johnny Walker's Red
He drank ole poison whiskey
'Til it killed him dead

It happened back in the bayou many years ago
Satan came to take him and he did it real slow
Well, they rushed him back to see the doctor
The doctor just shook his head
"Twenty years of rotgut whiskey
Done killed the poor man dead."
He drank ole poison whiskey
'Til it killed him dead

Take a tip from me, people... brothers can't you see
Ain't no future in ole poison whiskey
They're gonna rush you down to see the doctor
The doctor's gonna shake his head
The only thing he's gonna tell ya
"Stop drinkin' Johnny Walker's Red
Don't drink poison whiskey, don't you drink it boy
You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had to lose
You don't know what love is

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost
You don't know what love is

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is
Well, its eight o'clock in Boise, Idaho
I'll find my limo driver
Mister, take us to the show
I done made some plans for later on tonight
I'll find a little queen
And I know I can treat her right

What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same

Back at the hotel, lord we got such a mess
It seems that one of the crew
Had a go with one of the guests, oh yes
Well, the police said we can't drink in the bar, What a shame
Won't you come upstairs girl
And have a drink of champagne

What's your name, little girl
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
For there ain't no shame
What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same

What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same

Nine o'clock the next day
And I'm ready to go
I got six hundred miles to ride
To do one more show, oh no
Can I get you a taxi home
It sure was grand
When I come back here next year
I wanna see you again

What was your name, little girl
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Well there ain't no shame

What was your name, little girl
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same
It's a Cole world, it's no allergies, I'm sick late
Can't underlain, niggas fowlin' me, I switch Haynes'
Switch flows up like Mike Jordan switch hangs
Which explains, I'm the shit, you the shit stain
I'm the type of nigga fuck the baddest and forget name
Meanwhile, you be flyin' 'em out
Me, I just be tryin' 'em out
They love it when you hard on hoes
But I'm Magna Cum Laude, niggas smart on hoes
Which means I seen her intentions
The same time I seen her dimensions
Automatic, I might be leanin' to switches
Got good cop on for sisters, but I'm meaner than bitches
Fuck yeah, won't even leave with the digits to say it's vicious
I say it's necessary for a young legendary
Nigga try to throw you orders, ain't nobody ever taught us
Father, forgive us for the shit we do to your daughters
Up in VIP, poppin' bottles like it's water
Used to ride to Starter
Pardon, cause a part of me just want to save the world
But I don't want to be a martyr
Caught between a rock and a hard place
Caught between a rock and hypogamy always
What's stoppin' me? They say I'm a hypocrisy and doubt me
For God's sakes, better that than be a mockery
Ah, fate, don't talk to me

[Breakdown 1]
What now?
What now?
What now?

[Breakdown 2]
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?

[Bridge]
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout
I've got a good mind to give up living, and go shopping instead
I say, I've got a good mind to give up living, and go shopping instead
To pick up me a tombstone, and be pronounced dead

When I read your letter this morning, that was in your place in bed
I read your letter this morning, that was in your place in bed
That's when I decided, that I would be better off dead

It read, there is no use you looking, or ever hoping to get me back
Oh, there's no use you looking, or ever hoping to get me back
Yes, because it's all over now, and you can bet on that
Good mornin' baby, baby, welcome back to town
Yeah, you doin' so much trav'lin' woman, I never know when you're gonna be around

Yeah, you a fine and mellow baby but you stubborn as a mule
You love me like an angel baby but you treat me like a fool
Two faced woman don't you hand me no double cross
Well, because anytime I'm ready woman
Well, I can tell you, I can tell you, "Baby, get lost!"

You cheatin' on the outside, you're doin' ev'rything you chose
You better come back on the inside woman, 'cause you got too much to lose
I don't want no trouble with you baby
I wanna tell you I got to be the boss
Yeah, because anytime I'm ready baby
Oh, I can tell you, I can tell you, "Baby, get lost!"

Yes, I'll try to stop your cheatin' woman but I just don't have the time
I got so many woman, baby, 'till they're standing in line
I want to tell you baby, yeah, you know I've got to be the boss
All right!
Well, because anytime I'm ready, baby
I can tell you, "Baby, get lost!"

[Spoken]
Ramona is so cold. When she broke it off with Leon, she said, "The ring is enough, I don't wanna see his face again."
Ramona was so cold, Ramona was so cold...
My love is warmer than a smile
My love gives to every needing child
If anyone should ask you who's my true love
Tell them my love true is ever
Letting all their love come through
My love sees love with not a face
And lives to love through time and space
If all of everything about my love
Fits to the tune of you
Then you can say that you are my love too
Let my love shine throughout the world
To every mountain top and steeple
Let It be felt by every soul
'Til love's all over
Let it reach out to every heart
To every disinfranchised people
'Til it is present and no more is
Pain all over
Our love sees love's the key to peace
We'll pray 'til all world wars have ceased
Should you or anyone you know
Enough to say they feel as we
Then let our universal song be free
Let our love shine throughout the world
To every mountain tap and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
Til love's all over
Let it reach out to every heart
To every disinfranchised people
Till it is present and no more is
Pain all over

Say words of love to all we see
To rich or poor for love is equal
Let us lift up humanity
Spead love all over
Let all its forces join as one
So to rebuke all signs of evil
Through every valley, land and sea

Our love's all people
There is no great big ending
No sunset in the sky
There is no string ensemble
And she doesn't even cry
And just as I begin to say
That we should make another try
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye
There is no big explosion
No tempest in the tea
The world does not stop turning round
There's no big tragedy
Sitting in a coffee shop
With cheesecake and some apple pie
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye
Good-bye
Said so easily

Good-bye
Said so quietly
Good-bye good-bye good-bye
Just two always strangers avoid each other's eyes
One still make believing
One still telling lies
She tells me that I'm not to blame
But when I ask the reason why
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye
Good-bye
Said so easily
Good-bye
Said so quietly
Good-bye good-bye good-bye
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye
Smoke a blunt
I love to smoke a blunt man
Hey man you know, my white homies ask me

I love smoking weed all by myself
Dont have to pass it to no one else
I hit my blunt
Anytime i want
Got so much weed i dont have to hunt
I dont get hyper
I dont get crunk
I do get high
I do get drunk

Once im high and im high no doubt
I grab my ashtray and put my cigar out
Once my high is gone with the wind
I grab my lighter then i flick then i again

Briefly take a chronic break
Weed headache
Big mistake
Im high so i put my blunt down
Turn up my music and dance all around

I can't hear the phone
I can't hear the door
I never leave home 'less
Its time to school

Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hold the smoke
Now let it go
Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hold the smoke
Now let it go

I remember when i started smokin weed
Pickin' out the stems and the seeds
I didn't have enough to buy me a beer
My homeboy told me to hit this here(?)

I grabbed the blunt
I took a hit
I thought to myself
"i like this shit"

It's better than beer
So annalyze this
I don't have to go take a piss

I don't know how to roll
But the people i roll with
Know how to roll blunts like a pole

Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hold the smoke
Now let it go
Hahah
Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hold the smoke
Now let it go

Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hahahah
Hold a smoke, uh
Now let it goo
Hahahah uhh haha uhh

Drivin' cross country though minnesota
State f**kin' trooper straight pulled me over
He said i was drivin' fast as hell
He took a deep breath and asked "what's that smell?"
I knew i was busted, at this point
So i handed him a beautiful, perfectly rolled joint

He looked at it once
He looked at it twice
He told me, "you roll your joints real nice"

Afroman don't give a f**k
Light that blunt and get stupid stuff
Smokin' to me is so much fun
People bitch cause i don't get nothin' done

If you are a little kid
Please don't do the things i did
Anti-drug message? let me see..
Don't smoke weed
Give it to me!

Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hold the smoke
Now let it go

Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hold the smoke
Now let it go

Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hold the smoke
Now let it go

I ain't fucking, I ain't phoney, I ain't frontin’
I am stuntin’ everything I say is real
You dealin’ with the boss, yeah

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Rick Ross:]
Look in my pockets I see a lot of dead people
Wrist game mean, mother pearl so evil
Christian Louboutin, sucker for a sneaker
Pull up in Pakistan like I’m Evel Knievel
Elroy Jetson I stay spaced out
Never lay my Jesus piece face down
It’s not a Rollie, I’m sorry its for Karan
She not a singer, but dammit I made her humm
Name Ricky but really I’ve been a willie
See you looking at it but this watch a quarter milly
I got houses, hobby homes in Abu Dhabi
Never go wrong GPS my Ferrari

[Repeat Chorus:]
See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

Send on my jacky baby, call her terry bracelet baby
Bart one was spent 'bout 20 G, Gucci drop three eighty baby
Multicolor carrot tee, my necklaces are heavy mane
Hit the club then leave the club then come back with another chain

Mighty mouse is icy dog, Bart shit is just stupid
Yellow, blue, black, green and white, the diamonds match the groupies
Digitally enhance stones, pink is like a movie
Truly I'm a walkin' lick, Gucci man the talkin' brick

If you ain't gonna talk to chickens dog who you talkin' to?
7:30 in the kitchen, Nate, Nate about to go to school
Saturday I'm cookin' chickens, momma about to go to work
Sunday Gucci cookin' chickens, granny about to go to church
See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

Heavy wrist activity got me livin' lovely
Cocka nina, heaven land, cocka nina shawty
Breakin' down ten chickens, dog about to cook the shake up
All these extra grams might as well go buy a Jacob

Gucci man for mayor, Gucci man so player
Repin' East Atlanta, that's ten minutes from Decatur
Almost match are cars and are belts going to match are gators
You can't swang like Gucci 'cause you don't got enough flavor

Heavy on the lickerish, industry ridiculous
Bitches I'm magnificent, I'm not very articulate

Gucci what's the penalty, shawty what's the business
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas
Gucci what's the penalty, shawty what's the business
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas
See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

My girlfriend say she love me but it's just the jewelry
Multicolor carrots got your girlfriend kinda curious
First I drop my verses and then I go and drop the chorus
Then I'm out the booth back to my trap, you know I'm mournin'

'74 restored it, Beethoven recorded
Say you charging 30 like that Gucci can't afford it
Gucci chargin' 40 dog, that's a couple birdies
Gucci stoopid jewelry dog, I don't think you herd me

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

[Verse 1: Etta James]
There is something on your mind
By the way you look at me
There is something on your mind, baby
By the way you look at me
And what you're thinking brings happiness
Oh, and it brings misery

Please, please, don't try to tell me
I think I, I understand
No, no, don't try to tell me, baby
'Cause I think I, I understand
You want me to try and forget you
Well, I'll do
Baby, I'll do the best I can

[Interlude: B.B. King]
You know it hurts you when you're in love with someone and you know that someone don't love you. It carries a heavy burden on your heart to know that the someone that you're in love with is in love with your best friend. And I'll tell you, when someone else is rocking your, rocking your cradle, you know, better than you can rock your cradle yourself, then there's only one thing for you to do
You just pack your clothes, turn around, and slowly walk out of the door
Look over your left shoulder as you go out, then you hang your head and you say:

[Verse 2: B.B. King]
Oh, please don't try to tell me
Uh-huh, I think, I understand
No, no, no, no
Please don't try to tell me
Because you think, you think I understand
Oh, you want me to try
To try to forget you, baby
And I'll tell you, I'll do the best I can

[Interlude: B.B. King]
You know, after you have done all you could do and you can't take no more, then you go downtown, you get your big baseball bat and you come back on the scene where they both are still together, and then you just go and kick down the door. Now as you kick down the door you just start beating the hell of everybody that you can see, everybody that comes through the door, and just as you make up your mind that you're gonna try to forgive her, then out comes another one of your friends, and that really blows your mind. So you go and think about, you say to yourself, "Baby, I realize I've done wrong but please forgive me." And with a smirky smile on her face then she look up at you and she say:

[Verse 3: Etta James, B.B. King]
If you ever think about me
(Oh, I think about you, baby)
If you ever charge your mind
(Oh, you're staying on my mind, baby)
If you ever think about me
(Oh, I think, I think about you all the time)
And if I ever cross your mind
(You stayed on my mind)
Well, you know, you know, you know I'm yours
And I know, I know you got to be mine
(Yeah)

[Outro: Etta James, B.B. King]
There is something on your mind, B
I can tell by the way you look at me
(Oh, there's something, on my mind, Miss James)
There is something on your mind
(Oh, can you tell, there's something on my mind?)
By the way you look at me
(Oh, the way I look at you, you look good to me)
And what you're thinking brings happiness
(Yes, baby)
Oh, oh, and it can bring misery
(Yes, that's right)
Let's keep it between us
These people meddlin' in our affairs, they're not our friends
Let's keep it between us
Before doors close and our togetherness comes to an end
They'll turn you against me and me against you 'til we don't know who to trust
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
Let's keep it between us
We've been through too much tough times that they never shared
They've had nothing to say to us before
Now all of a sudden it's as if they've always cared
All we need is honesty, a little humility and trust
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
I know we're not perfect
Then again, neither are they
They act like we got to live for them as if there just ain't no other way
And it's makin' me kind of tired
Can we just lay back for a moment
Before we wake up and find ourselves in a daze that's got us out of our minds?
There must be something we're overlooking here
We better drop down now and get back behind the lines
There's some things not fit for human ears, some things don't need to be discussed
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
They'll tell you one thing and me another
'Til we don't know who to trust
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
Let's keep it between us
Before it all snaps and goes too far
If we can't deal with this by ourselves
Tell me we ain't worse off than they think we are
Backseat drivers don't know the feel of the wheel, but they sure know how to make a fuss
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
Can we keep it between us?
Yeah, it's Kells...
Kells and OJ (Ay Ay)

Give me something that I like, come on!
Cunning liar, eternal fire
Demon clever, promise forever
The curious try and always die

Live in fear, the devil is near
Can you feel his breath? Pray for death
The curious try and always die

"You men point those search lights up on the tower right now - move, move!"

Have no Savior, have no faith
Never look for Heaven's gate
Devil's children, no love inside
There is a soul, but it has died

Devil's children, no love inside
There is a soul, but it has died
And it cries, and it cries?

[Chorus]
Dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
Put your arms around him and hold him tight
Give up to the feeling and don't try to fight
He wants your soul and he wants it tonight
Dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
Put your arms around him and hold him tight
Close your eyes to love and die
Dance with the devil in the pale moonlight {sampled till end}

"You know, without you I just wouldn't wanna go on"

[Chorus]
Dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
Put your arms around him and hold him tight
Give up to the feeling and don't try to fight
He wants your soul and he wants it tonight
Dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
Put your arms around him and hold him tight
Close your eyes to love and die
Dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
Put your arms around him and hold him tight
Give up to the feeling and don't try to fight
He wants your soul and he wants it tonight
Dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
Put your arms around him and hold him tight
Close your eyes to love and die


Dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
Put your arms around him and hold him tight

"It's as though we were made for each other
Beauty and the Beast
Of course if anyone else calls you Beast
I'll rip their lungs out"
Dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
Put your arms around him and hold him tight

Got That Right
Got That Right
By Lynyrd Skynyrd
Well I've heard lots of people said they gonna settle down
You don't see their faces and they don't come around
Well, I'm not that way, I've got to move along...
I like to drink and dance all night
Comes to a fix, not afraid to fight
You got that right?
Said, you got that right?
Sure got that right!
Seems so long I been out on my own
Drivin' the land and I'm always alone
Guess I was born with a travellin' bone...
I like to drink and dance all night
Comes to a fix, not afraid to fight
You got that right?
Said, you got that right?
Sure got that right!
I tried all the things in my life
Things that I like, I tried twice
You got that right?
Said, you got that right?
Sure got that right!
When my time's over, out on my own
You won't find me in an old folks' home
You got that right?
Said, you got that right?
Sure got that right!
I'll see you again whenever spring breaks through again
Time may lie heavy between, but what has been, is past forgetting
Your sweet memory across the years will come to me
Though my world may go awry, in my heart 'twill ever lie
Just the echo of a sigh, goodbye

All my life I shall remember knowing you
All the pleasures that I found in showing you
The different ways that one may face
The changing light and changing shade
Happiness that must die, melodies that must fly
Memories that must fade, dusty and forgotten bye and bye

(repeat refrain)
Yeah, like I said that knowledge can mess up your life at times
(Oh it makes you so nervous, I got a blank, now what's with you Frank?)
Well, dig me, I started to school just like all kids do
(You mean, you were young once?)
I was a Mickey Rooney of my day, learned my lessons and got along fine
(So should you clamor.)
And then as time went on, I learned a lot of other things
(You clever boy!)
Uh huh, and I really had myself some jolly time
(I can imagine as much.)
I never played any favorites, 'cause I was much too smart
(You think you're too smart. Wait till you get further down.)
I had my boots on and I had them laced up tight
(You talk like that in your era?)
Wrote a book, Pearl, but then I made a mistake
(Most men do.)
Uh huh, I should have known from the start
(Most men don't.)
Aha, let me tell you what happened last night
(This is not this day's material?)
It's bad, 'cause it started with a gal
(Always does.)
And her name, it was Sal
(Sal, corny.)
Oh she was cute. She was as fine as a bird on the wing
(Yeah, you always could think up,)
(But you are much too bright to fall in love the first night.)
But uh, a little learnin' is a dangerous thing
(I told you that on the other side of the record.)
And then we danced for a time or two, till she said she was blue
(Uh, huh, there it is.)
And right away, I was doing the thing...
(Just rushing through life.)
'Cause I was hip to the fact that I could always jump back
(Do a thing.)
But a little learnin' is a dangerous thing
(Yes it is.)
She made with sweet talk
(Uh hmmm.)
That so hard-to-beat talk
(Know what, Frank?)
What's that?
(I know she even called you darling, lover man!)
You've been eavesdropping
(Yes, I have.)
That really sent me, coincidentally
I should have known enough then to scram
(No man is ever that clever -- that rhymes!)
Now I guess you know it all, least that's all I recall
(That's all you'll ever recall.)
Except the part about the man with a ring
(Oh you're going again.)
In case it's news to you, the smartest I said I'd do
(Oh you down.)
:A little learning is a dangerous, is a dangerous thing
(Oh, pure treachery, treachery!)
Stop, stop!
When I first met you, baby
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen
When I first met you, baby
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen
You just left your home then, woman
Ah, the sweetest thing I'd ever seen

But you wouldn't do nothing, baby
You wouldn't do anything I asked to
You wouldn't do nothing for me, baby
You wouldn't do anything I asked to
You know you ran away from your home, baby
And now you wanna run away from old B. too

You know I loved you, baby
I loved you before I could call your name
You know I loved you, baby
Baby I loved you, I love you before I could call your name
Well, it seems like everything I do now baby
Everything I do is in vain
My brother's in Korea, baby
My sister's down in New Orleans
Brother's in Korea baby
My sister's down in New Orleans
You know I'm having so much trouble woman
Baby, I wonder, what in the world is gonna happen to me

You know I love you
And I'll do anything you tell me to
You know I love you
And I'll do anything you tell me to
Well, there ain't nothing in the world, woman
Babe, it ain't nothing
Nothing in the world I wouldn't do it for you

You can treat me mean, baby
But I'll keep on loving you just the same
You can treat me mean baby
But I'll keep on loving you just the same
But one of these days, baby
You're gonna give a lot of money
To hear someone call my name

Yes, sweet sixteen baby... sweet sixteen...
Yes, the sweetest thing baby
The sweetest thing I ever seen
You know I'm having so much trouble, woman
Baby I wonder
Yes I wonder
Baby I wonder
Oh, I wonder what in the world's gonna happen to me

Cops surround me with pistols in hand
Three outstanding warrants for Joseph Foreman
Sleep in the county jail
Can't post no bail

I wanna wish you a...
Merry Christmas to all of you (merry Christmas)
Merry Christmas.... to all of you

Silent night
Hand cuffs are tied
People staring at me
At the red red light
Ninety five hundred I see a far

[?] in the custody car
Sleep in the county jail
Can't post no bail
Well, the bonnie ship was a good old ship
She was a-fishin' on a leading chain
And me an' John, oh was a long catch on
It was the last of the ones I've seen

So with a sword and a rope in belt
Feel all that your heart be sailed
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales

Well, we feud all night, the cabin gauge
It was a-more than feelin' bad
And with all kind friends we watched in fear
It was a naught time we ever had

So it's rise up my lads
Let your hearts never fail
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales

And all day long at Vera Cruz
We sailed 

[all the likes] to bind
With no heavy moan, any hearts of stone
No aid was tried for mine
So it's cheer up my boys
Let your hearts never fail
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales

Well, now along cape Fate, 'twas lit in red
All along cape Horn
And from Vera Cruz we sailed ahead
It was all in the time of storm

So, it's cheer on up my boys
Let your hearts never fail
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales

[Verse 1: André 3000]
One for the money yes uhh two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of somethin good
Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA, through the hood
Just tryin ta find that hookup
Now everyday we look up at the ceiling
Watchin ceiling fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes tryin ta find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, known that we could rock
Doin the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like freeze, we makin the crowd move but we not makin no G's
And that's a no no

[Verse Two: Big Boi]
Yeah, uhh, check it
Ahh one two, ahh one two doe, niggas
In the Cadillac they call us went from Player's Ball to ballers
Puttin the South up on the map was like Little Rock to bangin
Niggas say motherfuck that playin, they payin
We stay in layin vo-cals, locals done made it with them big boys
Up in dis industry, Outkast yea dem niggas they makin big noise
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
Ninety-six gon be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
...around this bitch

[Chorus]
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Back in the day when I was younger, hunger
Lookin to fill me belly with that Rally's, bullshit, pull shit
Off like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick I was, stoned like white boys
Smokin them white golds before them blunts got krunk, chunky asses
Passes gettin thrown like Hail Mary's and they lookin like Halle Berry
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sippin wine
We's just chillin, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smokin freely, me Lil B, Greet, Mon and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, mama I want to sing but
Mama I want to trick, and mama I'm suckin dicks, now
We movin on up in da world like elevators
Me and the crew we pimps like eighty-two
Me and you like Tony Toni Tone
Like this Eastpointe and we gone

[Chorus]
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way
That I just came from, some nigga was sayin somethin
Talkin bout "Hey man, you remember me from school?" smoke some
Naw not really but he kept smilin like a clown
Facial expression lookin silly
And he kept askin me, what kind of car you drive, I know you paid
I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes from all them songs that y'all done made
And I replied that I had been goin through tha same thing that he had
True I got more fans than the average man but not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week, I live by the beat like you live check to check
If you don't move yo' feet then I don't eat, so we like neck to neck
Yes we done come a long way like them slim ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon stop so we just gonna continue

[Chorus]
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors

[Intro]
It's on tonight (This is brought to you)
She said no, but I know it's on tonight (By Jim Jonson and Mr. 305)

But baby, don't play me and tell me that you don't like to get crazy
Your mind says no, but you're body says yes

And leave you fully in bliss

[Verse 2]
Now she's hot and heavy
Now she said she ready
And I said, "Baby, let's start"
Nice, slow and steady
Then I'm gon' give it to you however you ask for it
I'll catch it, you throw it, and baby, you know it, you know it
I'm certified, (Certified)
Around the globe
I mark my territory wherever I go
Baby, don't think twice, let's ride tonight
I promise a good time, and now it's like

Ay-oh-ay-oh-ay-oh (Now say yeah)
Ay-oh-ay-oh-ay-oh (Now say yeah)
Keep bustin'!
Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
You don't have to be beautiful to turn me on
If we can not make babies
Maybe we can make some time
(Baby, you're so creamy)

She said how'd you like to waste some time
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind
Nikki, oh

Don't worry, I won't hurt you
I only want you to have some fun
Baby, baby, baby I'm a star (Star, ooh)
Might not know it now
Baby, but I are, I'm a star, eh (Star, ooh)
I don't wanna stop 'til I reach the top, oh
Ow!

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?
All I can do is just offer you my love
All I can offer you is my love
I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted one time to see you laughing
Only want to see you laughing in the purple rain

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today to get through this thing called life

Sexy dancer, I want your body, want your body
Sexy dancer, dance
Sexy dancer, I want your body, want your body
Sexy dancer, dance
Ahhh!

Work it baby, work it
Let's work
Let's work
I've had my eyes on you
Ever since you walked in the room
Come on and take my hand
Don't try to understand
Hey baby, nothing can stop us now
I'm gonna show you how, oh yeah
Show you how to work
Come on, let's have some fun
We'll work 'til the morning comes
Yeah yeah, I wanna see you work
Come on
Every Friday night I call yo ass up on the phone
A deeper voice answers and say you're not at home (Sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy)
If you think that I'm some fool who'll go for that silly line
Honey, put down all your money you win everytime, oh  (Sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy)
Oh, irresistible bitch - I love the way you walk (You sexy mutha...ow!)
Irresistible bitch - I love the way you talk
Irresistible bitch - I love the way you kiss (You sexy mutha...ow!)
Ain't it a shame?
Huh, I wish I could resist

I ain't trying to pressure you baby
But all I ever wanted to do
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out
All night long make you shout
Ooh, lover, yeah!
I wanna be the only one you come for
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm goin' down to Alphabet Street
I'm gonna crown the first girl that I meet
I'm gonna talk so sexy, she'll want me from my head to my feet
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Talk to me lover, come and tell me what you taste
Didn't your mama tell you life is too good to waste?
Talk to me lover, come and tell me what you taste
Didn't your mama tell you life is too good to waste?
Too good to waste, too good to waste
Didn't your mama tell you life is too good to waste?

Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight

The moon up above shines down upon our skin
Whispering words that scream of outrageous sin
If that's what we are
We all want a love bizarre

If I was your girlfriend
Ooh, if I was your girlfriend
Would you let me wash your hair?
Could I make you breakfast sometime?
Would you let me pick out your clothes?
Would you let me drive you to work?

I was working part time in a five and dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I's a bit too leisurely
It seems that I was busy doin' something close to nothin'
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Guess I shoulda known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
Guess I must be dumb, she had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say - "What have I got to lose?"
And honey, I said little red Corvette

This is it
Time for you to go to the wire
You will hit
'Cause you got the burnin' desire
The kinda girl you wanna teach
She's a peach

(Go!)
(Oops, upside yo ass)
(Oops, upside yo ass)
(Oops, upside yo ass)
(Oops, upside yo ass)
(Oops, upside yo ass)
Ladies and gentlemen, Prince!
Intense silence
As she walked in the room
Her black robes trailing
Sister of the moon
And a black widow spider makes
More sound than she
And black moons in those eyes of hers
Made more sense to me
Heavy persuasion
It was hard to breathe
She was dark at the top of the stairs
And she called to me

And so I followed
As friends often do
I cared not for love, nor money
I think she knew
Well, the people they still love her
And still they are the most cruel
She asked me
Be my sister, sister, sister of the moon
Some call her sister of the moon
Some say illusions are her game
They like to wrap her in velvet
Does anyone, ooo...know her name
I met him first out at the edge of nowhere
A last chance oasis on the plains
The sky was threatening as he came up to me
Said could you help me beat the rain

Where does it take you this road you travel
He smiled the same place as yourself
To that point out there where all roads vanish
Going to Vegas man where else

Play it straight and play it true my brother
Cause you're miles from anywhere
As it happens in the world of shadows
Time and distance vanish there

I was just another deadbeat loser there the last time
I couldn't even read the signs
But I've got this feeling and there's magic in the cards now
I'm going back to take what's mine

Play it straight and play it true my brother
Cause you're miles from anywhere
As it happens in the world of shadows
Time and distance vanish there
What damned illusion in that neon lightning
A run of luck is in the air
Shining brighter than any flush of diamonds
A magic carpet of despair

Play it straight and play it true my brother
Cause you're miles from anywhere
As it happens in the world of shadows
Time and distance vanish there

Play it straight and play it true my brother
Cause you're miles from anywhere
As it happens in the world of shadows
Time and distance vanish there
Rock me baby, rock me all night long
Rock me baby, honey, rock me all night long
I want you to rock me baby
Like my back ain't got no bones

Roll me baby, like you roll a wagon wheel
I want you to roll me baby, like you roll a wagon wheel
Want you to roll me baby
You don't know how it makes me feel

Rock me baby, honey, rock me slow
Yeah, rock me pretty baby, baby rock me slow
Want you to rock me baby
Till I want no more
On my word of honor
All my love belongs to you
Please put your faith in me
You see how true I'll be

On my word of honor
You can trust me with your heart
And I pledge mine to you
It's yours my whole life through

Baby, lips never kiss you
Again if they're telling you a lie
And forever, ever, ever, ever and ever
I cross my heart and hope to die

On my word of honor
You mean everything to me
I swear by stars above
I'll keep my word, my love

Baby, lips never kiss you
Again if they're telling you a lie
And forever, ever, ever, ever and ever
I cross my heart and hope to die
On my word of honor
You mean everything to me
I swear by stars above
I'll keep my word, my love
Julie
Oh
And I know

Like a mirror, Sunday morning
When the dark clouds hung above
I saw you kneeling 'neath a garden
I saw the grim and stood above

What kind of meaning in a gun shot
It doesn't matter what they say
I never felt I aimed at no one
And who's gonna take the gun away

Julie
Pretend for me
That I'm someone in your life

Julie
I'm yours till the end
All the days and memories
I'm not a man of single reason
It's in every single man
This beat of jealous retribution
And every spurned heart makes its plan

Well, I know that you really loved him
And I know that if there's a God above
Through million times we'll remember
How the trail slips away

Julie
Pretend for me
Even only for a while

Julie
My soul is on the line
All the days and memories

Julie
Remember me
All the days of your life

Julie
I'm lost over you
Passion always ends this way
End this way

Do you wanna float on? Yeah

[Chorus]
Float on, float on, float on your love
Float on, float on, float on your love

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
I call my baby's name
She gives me everything
She takes me higher and higher
She plays with my desire
She knows my pleasures zone
And works it all night long
Her love is slow and slick
Told me don't come too quick

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I pray our love
Floats on and on and on
Hear me calling out to you, girl
It's all that I can do, girl

Float on, float on, float on, float on

Float on, float on

[Verse 2: Angela Winbush]
I know what's on his mind
He wants it all the time
He's always at my door
Keeps asking me for more
Says he can't get enough
Sometimes he likes it rough
You know I'm gonna treat him right
Gonna do it day and night

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I pray our love
Floats on and on and on
Hear me calling out to you, boy
That's all that I can do, boy

[Chorus]
Float on, float on, float on, float on

[Verse 1]
Walkin' lonely streets, lookin' for a sign
Livin' lonely dreams, life with no design
Like lonely people do, livin' in the past
Only findin' love that didn't last
Then the shadows of my life felt the sun and saw your face
As your love fell all around me making perfect time and space

[Chorus]
Then you turned my world around
When you held out your hand
You turned my world around
Bringin' love to a lonely man

[Verse 2]
Now I walk with you, Spring has come at last
No more lonely dreams, they're all in the past
And each day knows the joy that sharing love can give
Love's the only life that we can li-ive
Now the shadows of my life feel the sun, I see your face
As your love falls all around me making perfect time and space

[Chorus]
And you turned my world around
When you held out your hand
You turned my world around
Bringing love to a lonely man

Hold up, born in '88
How old is that? Old enough

So that explain why I love college
Gettin' brain in the library 'cause I love knowledge
When you use your Medulla Oblongata
& give me scoliosis until I comatoses
& do it while I sleep yeah a little osmosis
& that’s my commandment you ain’t gotta ask Moses

She said she want whatever she like
But she gotta bring your friend
& We could have 1 hell of a night, through the day
She blamed it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
She had her hair did, it was bound to fall
Down, down for a damn, Cudi already said it
A pokerface book I already read it
But man, her head was gooder than the music
Electro body known to blow fuses
A stripper from the south lookin' for a payday
Said bitch you should do it for the love like Ray Jay
But they say you be on that conscious tip
Get your hair right & get up on this conscious dick
I embody everything from the Gali to the party
It's the way I was raised on the south side safari, so...

Then did a rainbow for the rainy days

Imagination is funny
It makes a cloudy day sunny
It makes a bee think of honey
Just as I think of you

Imagination is crazy
Your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy
What to do, what to do

Have you ever felt a gentle touch
And then a kiss, and then and then
Find it's only your imagination again

Imagination is silly
You go around willy nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too
Lately you're be acting strange towards me baby
And your heart seems to grown straight cold
You used to laugh at everything I said baby
Now you play me like my jokes are old

And girl we used to talk about everything
Like make love until we're old and grey
And all these photo... I took
You don't give me the same love
And when I ask you, you say everything is ok
Well I'm not feeling the love no more
And although I see you standing there I can't find you anywhere
Well I'm not feeling the love no more
Tell me how where we go wrong

Feels like I'm living all alone in this old house
Cause you're distance brings the worst of you

It's like a battle of silence... for
Cause it seems I'm just a ghost to you
And girl we used to talk about everything
Like make love until we're old and grey
And all these photo... I took
You don't give me the same love
And when I ask you, you say everything is ok
Well I'm not feeling the love no more
And although I see you standing there I can't find you anywhere
Well I'm not feeling the love no more
Tell me how where we go wrong

I remember we used to make love through the night
And we we're doing it 'til the morning light
... put you are not there

Well I'm not feeling the love no more
And although I see you standing there I can't find you anywhere
Well I'm not feeling the love no more
Tell me how where we go wrong

Well I'm not feeling the love no more
And although I see you standing there I can't find you anywhere
Well I'm not feeling the love no more
Tell me how where we go wrong

Know Why They Wanna Beat Badly, Look At All That Ass On Her
Look How That Pussy Sit Up In Them Shorts, You Gotta Want Her
Love When She Act Like She Bo-Legged & Bend The (Corner ?)
She Proud To Be Fuckin Me, Cause I'm Stuntin On 'em
It Feel Good To Be Fuckin A Real Nigga Don't'uh
Ain't Called Her In 2 Days, Gotta Let Her Mind Wonder
But When She Miss Me, She Call To Tell Me To Jump On Her
Thats Why I Don't Mind Breakin Her Off, Cause She Ain't With The Drama
If You Done Ripped Her Before, You Know How To Cuff Lil Mama
You Know She Gotta Be Somethin, Cause I Done Beat Her Under
Im Baby Snatchin, I'm Tellin Ya, I Promise
I Exposed Her To Real, & Now She Hate Lame
Member She Used To Run From Me, Now She Like Pain
She Call Me Sometimes Just To Ask Is It Her Thing
Ever Since I Ran Up In Shawty She Ain't Been The Same
(Chorus: T-Pain)
Even Though I'm Not Your Man, You Not My Girl
Ima Call You My Shawty
Cause I Can't Stand To See You Treated Bad
I Beat His Ass For My Shawty
And We Ain't Did Nothin That We Ain't Supposed To Do
Cause You My Shawty

Brand new Kakhi's on my ass
Colt 45 in my glass...
Cadillac Coupe Deville
Hit The Corner on three wheel
I got my soundsystem beating real good
Hittin switches while I'm throwin up the hood
I never play the radio
I buy underground from the mom-n-pappa sto'
I cruise late night by the clubs
Smokin on a dub while my woofers just sub
Baby I'm from haddisburg
Those are my Caddies up against the curb
I got gold Daytona's on my car
Sport T-shirts, kakhi's and all stars
I like regular people, not stars...
I don't play areas, just bars
I don't act funny, I don't act funny
Just because I got some money... (2x)
If you lookin for the bomb (2x)
If you lookin for some music (2x)
Well let me help you choose it (2x)

I'm so glad I got my website
I ain't worried bout mtv
I got 20 videos, buy 'em all on dvd
I'm so glad I got my website
I ain't worried bout mtv
I just got my hydraulics
Come on and caddy hop with me!

Caddy hop baby, caddy hop (3x)
Caddy hop baby, you don't stop...

The homies call me afroman
I rap with a live funk band
If you can't buy my music don't sweat
Order it of the internet
I'm never on mtv, but everybody got my cd
I'm never on the radio, but everybody knows afro

You say you looking for some music (2x)
Well let me help you choose it (2x)
If you want the bomb (2x)
I'm so glad I got my website
I ain't worried bout mtv
I got 20 videos, buy 'em all on dvd
I'm so glad I got my website
I ain't worried bout mtv
I just got my hydraulics
Come on and caddy hop with me!

Caddy hop baby, caddy hop (3x)
Caddy hop baby, you don't stop...

Make you caddy hop, at the red light
Don't trip, go ahead, that shit looks tight
Don't pass by the homies, unless you hit the switches
Don't have hydraulics, and act like a bitch!
When you hit the switches get your shine on
Think about the days, you got your grind on
Smokin that weed, drinkin that brew
You like the lowrider? I like the lowrider too!

Caddy hop baby, caddy hop (3x)
It's the bomb! afromanmusic - dot com

In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear:
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream, last night - yes I did
I never dreamed it could be
Yet there you were - in love with me

I found your lips close to mine - so I kissed them
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake, such a break never happens
How long can I guy go on dreaming

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say that you do baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true
I call ya
You ain't in
What's this cold reaction
Where you been?
Ooh baby
Layin' it on the line
If this is last call
And you say that's all you can take
It's fine

I'm sorry but
It don't make sense
You'd be a fool
If you just run out on first offense
Ooh baby play it smart
Before you go south with your big mouth
Better check your heart

Danger there's a breakdown dead ahead
Maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn.. might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down
I told ya
No more lying
No more tears a falling
Stop your cryin'
Ooh baby
I'm your man
Before you go back to your side track
Baby understand

Danger there's a breakdown dead ahead
And just maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn.. might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down
No no no
No no no no
No no no no no no no

Danger there's a breakdown dead ahead
And just maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn.. might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down
No no no

Danger there's a breakdown dead ahead
And just maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn.. might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down down down down
No no no oh oh oh
This song was first released on the Dreamland Express album. It is the only album it has been released on

Another day is over and I'm on my way home
Knowing you'll be waiting is all I need to know

'Cause I'm in the mood to be desired
Wrap your arms around me
I'm in the mood
Let's build a fire
Till the embers retire, we'll be
Lost, in a world of ecstacy

Forget about my troubles
Forget about my woes
You're the one who comforts me
Whenever I feel low

'Cause I'm in the mood to be desired
Wrap your arms around me
I'm in the mood
Let's build a fire
Till the embers retire, we'll be
Lost, in a world of ecstacy
You're everything I could imagine
Fillin' me up with such passion
Eternity is not long enough for you and me

'Cause I'm in the mood to be desired
Wrap your arms around me
I'm in the mood
Let's build a fire
Till the embers retire, we'll be
Lost, in a world of ecstacy

[Intro]
Ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
I felt it, the wire touched my neck and
Then someone pulled it tighter, I never saw it coming
I started to black out and then someone said good mornin'
I took it as a warning, I should've seen it coming
So now I'll take a chance on this thing we may have started
Intentional or not I don't think we saw it coming
It's all addin' up to something
That as for some involvement, that as for a commitment
I think I see it comin' if we stepped out on that limb

[Pre-Chorus]
My heartbeat beats me senselessly
Why's everything gotta be so intense with me?
I'm tryna handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

[Chorus]
It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause you're the best I've got
So take a long shot

[Verse 2]
I realize that there is all this doubting
Things we're both scared about that
We'll never see 'em coming, throw caution to the wind and
We'll see which way it's blowing into this fully knowing
We'll never see it coming 'til it's much too close to stop

[Pre-Chorus]
My heartbeat beats me senselessly
Why's everything gotta be so intense with me?
I'm tryna handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

[Chorus]
It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause I'm the best you've got
So take a long shot

[Bridge]
Oh, I waited for fact to come of fiction
And you fit my description
I never saw you coming, but we'll make it even though

[Chorus]
It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause you're the best I got
So take a long shot

[Outro]
You didn't expect this
Oh, you never saw me coming
You didn't expect this
Oh, you never saw this coming
I take the long shot
I take the long shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot
'Cause you're the best I've got
Oh, I’m taking this chance on you, baby
I’m taking this chance on you, baby
I’m taking this chance
Casey Jones was an old engineer
Call for his family tonight, they will fear
All I need is my water and coal
Look out the windows, see my drag wheel roll
One sunday morning in a driving rain
Around the curve came a passenger train
In the cabin stood Casey Jones
Bold engineer but he's dead and gone
Mrs. Casey when she heard the news
Sitting at her bedside she was lacing up her shoes
Children, children now catch your breath
You will draw a pension if your Papa's dead
Children, children now can you hear
Tell me Mama what do you mean by that?
Get your hat, put it on your head
Go to town, see your Daddy's dead
Casey said just before he died
Fix the blinds so that the bums can ride
If they ride, let them ride rock
Put their trust in the hands of God
Casey said just before he died
Two more roads that I want to ride
People said, what roads, Casey, can they be?
Gold Colorado and the Santa Fe

[Verse 1]
Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see
Into your imagination
We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in the world of my creation
What we'll see will defy explanation

[Chorus]
If you wanna view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Wanna change the world?
There's nothing to it

[Verse 2]
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free
If you truly wish to be
Oh

[Chorus]
If you wanna view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Wanna change the world?
There's nothing to it

[Outro]
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free
If you truly wish to be

[Verse 1]
I wanna be mad when you're coming home too late
I wanna cry when you lie to me
I wanna come anywhere you want me to
And I wanna be jealous, oh, just like I owned you

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody say ooh, ooh
Ooh, oh ooh
Ooh, oh ooh
Ooh, oh ooh

[Chorus]
I wanna love before I die
And if it kills me, I'll go with a smile
I wanna love before I die
Just like the movies, I'll save you tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Love me right now
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 2]
I wanna wake up
Everybody say ooh, oh ooh, ooh, oh ooh
But you right on top of me
I wanna be scared, oh, 'cause my baby is a freak

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody say ooh, oh ooh (c'mon)
Ooh, oh ooh
All the people say, ooh, oh ooh (c'mon)
Ooh, oh ooh

[Chorus]
I wanna love before I die
And if it kills me, I'll go with a smile
I wanna love before I die (before I die)
Just like the movies, I'll save you tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Love me right now
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

[Bridge]
You know you want it, so hop upon it
The people watching, so let's just shock them
You know you want it, so hop upon it
The people watching, so let's just shock them, dance

[Chorus]
I wanna love before I die (before I die)
And if it kills me, I'll go with a smile (huh)
I wanna love before I die (I wanna love, huh)
Just like the movies, I'll save you tonight

[Outro]
Love me right now
Yeah
I'm gonna live till I die
I'm gonna laugh 'stead of cry
I'm gonna take the town and turn it upside down
I'm gonna live, live, live till I die

They're gonna say "What a guy!"
I'm gonna play for the sky
Ain't gonna miss a thing I'm gonna have my fling
I'm gonna live, live, live till I die

The blues 'll lay low I'll make 'em stay low
They'll never trail over my head
I'll be a devil till I'm an angel
But until then, Halelujah! Gonna dance, gonna fly
I'll take a chance ridin' high
Before my number's up I'm gonna fill my cup
I'm gonna live, live, live, live, live until I die

I'm gonna live till I die
I'm gonna laugh 'stead of cry
I'm gonna take the town and turn it upside down
I'm gonna live, live, live till I die
They're gonna say "What a guy!"
I'm gonna play for the sky
Ain't gonna miss a thing I'm gonna have my fling
I'm gonna live, live, live till I die

The blues 'll lay low I'll make 'em stay low
They'll never trail over my head
I'll be a devil till I'm an angel
But until then, Halelujah! Gonna dance, gonna fly
I'll take a chance ridin' high
Before my number's up I'm gonna fill my cup
I'm gonna live, live, live, live, live until I die

[Intro]
(One, two, three)

[Verse 1]
You've been alone
You've been afraid
I've been a fool in so many ways
But I would change my life if you thought you might try to love me

[Chorus]
So please give me another chance to write you another song
And take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart, if you would let me start all over again

[Verse 2]
I'm not a saint
I'm just a man who had heaven and Earth in the palm of his hand
But I threw it away
So now I stand here today askin' forgiveness
And if you could

[Chorus]
Just please give me another chance to write you another song
And take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart, if you would let me start all over again

[Verse 3]
Little girl, you're all I've got
Don't you leave me standing here once again
'Cause I'll give you my life
Yes, I would, if you would let me try to love you

[Chorus]
So please give me another chance to write you another song
And take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

[Outro]
..Again
No, no, no
You know I love you
Give me one more chance
No, no, no
I'll make you a deal like any other candidate
We'll pretend were walking home cause your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like the street
There is a bar at the end where I could meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall "I smell the blood of les tricoteuses"
Who wrote up scandals in other bars

I am having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces Charles Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys get it here thing

So you scream out of line
"I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Anytime?
Tres butch little numberwang "Hey girlie, I want you
When it's good it's really good and when it's bad I go to pieces"
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying til we break up our minds
'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding hands
Santa Claus is coming to town...

Christmas is a joyous time of year
But for an underprivileged child, this isn't always true
This is Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys
Alan, Michael, Carl, Brian and myself would like to ask
All of you to join in with us in donating a toy to an
Underprivileged children organization, so they, too
Might possibly share in a very, very happy Christmas this year
Thank you
Wind it up all round me, pretty girls come at me
I ain't got no problem, I think it's so unfair
Patience it's opportune, that's what I've been told
But I got to get my hand on some lovin'
Before I'm too old, too old, yeah, yeah

I get and I'm probably patient, between my sugar and I
Said I'm gonna rock do one of those patsy demo
You're my surprise, sure I got it all in my soul
Wanna get more cuz I got to get my hand on some lovin
Before I'm too old,much too old, yeah, yeah

I said I need a women, need some lovin'
One love yeah, yeah
I hear that I over valley
Pretty women, pretty women
And I ain't got nobody, think is so unfair
Patience they say it's a virtue that's what I've been told

But I got to get my hand on some lovin'
Before I'm too old, too old, yeah, yeah
Before I'm not too old
Before I'm not too old, yeah
I need you so, to keep me happy
If I can't have you, I cannot go on

I need your arms, around me tightly
Oh, I'll need them nightly, when you're not around

When day is gone... Oh, I need you so
I long to hear... your little knock upon the door

When you leave me, I try not to worry
Please, come back in a hurry, because I need you... I need you so
This world that I live in is empty and cold
This loneliness cuts me and tears at my soul
I'm no child of destiny, no fortune's son
I've just chased you so long now, I'm too weak to run

So here I return to a back street of thrills
Back to any warm shoulder till she's got her fill
And then I treat shame like an old friend from home
That I can lean on till the misery is gone

A new day is here yet nothing is new
You're still gone and I tremble for you

I cry out at bedtime no, please not tonight
But again there's your footsteps and I turn on the light
Of course you're not there, no, you never are
Then I try to forget that there's always a bar

And well, I win that battle, yes, sometimes I do
But sleep doesn't come when I tremble for you

(Ball)
Welcome to the Crystal Ball
(We ought to use this)
Inch by inch, row by row
Gonna make this garden grow
All it takes is a rake and a hoe
And a piece of fertile ground

Inch by inch, row by row
Someone bless these seeds I sow
Someone warm them from below
Till the rain comes tumblin down

Pullin weeds and pickin stones
Man is made of dreams and bones
Feel the need to grow my own
Cause the time is close at hand

Rainful rain, sun and rain
Find my way in natures chain
Tune my body and my brain
To the music from the land

Plant your rows straight and long
Temper them with prayer and song
Mother Earth will make you strong
If you give her love and care
Old crow watchin hungrily
From his perch in yonder tree
In my garden Im as free
As that feathered thief up there
I don't know why but I'm tired of my mind
Pain is over me, overloading
I don't know why but you're trying to be kind
Take off your silver smile, throw your head back
And cry

I don't believe but I'm trying to decide
Which game is best for me, which can I bare
You don't perceive so I'm leading you away
Home were you've never been, non-returning

So cry

Throw a rock upon the road and it breaks into pieces
Shake brach upon the snow and the sun is defeated
Pull the curtains on yesterday and it seems so much later
Put a bullet in my brain and I'll make all the papers

I don't know why but I'm tired of my life
The clouds are in my eyes, overtaking
Breaking Bread, Breaking Bread
We are gathered here together to break bread
Breaking Bread, Breaking Bread
We are gathered here together to break bread

It's not the barley or the wheat
It's not the oven or the heat
That makes this bread so good to eat
It's the needing and the sharing that makes the meal complete

Breaking Bread, breaking bread
We are gathered here together to break bread
Breaking Bread, breaking Bread
We are gathered here together to break bread

Upon the water prayed his cast
The last is first, the first is last
For everyone who eats this bread
There are thousands maybe more that will be fed

Breaking Bread, breaking bread
We are gathered here together to break bread
Breaking Bread, breaking Bread
We are gathered here together to break bread

[Verse 1]
Old money flow, yeah I did mine bigger
Ape shit flow so King Kong, nigga
You got big money, man? How long nigga
Can’t talk right now, I’m in Hong Kong, nigga
My Polo rounds, fuck her for only a photo now
Sitting on cinnamon, Cocoa Brown
Wanna be me, but they don’t know how; so profound
Who cares what they be on, I’m in the sun with aviators
I’m my favorite song, I came to ball
And aim at y’all, you know the semi-automatic with no safety on
Alright? Bow down, my ladies want a shout out
Take her, flip her over, lower back I leave that blah-dow
Ass backwards, chris-cross
T-Rex, Chris Bosh
Nigga we eating so Rick Ross
Brown rice, fish sauce
Fly as a kite, man, I must be
Claiming to be what them thugs be
These niggas making it dusty
‘Cause I’m aiming at you like I just sneezed…

[Verse 1]
I'm in a freefall, like a snowflake falling
Down, down, down, down, down
I close my eyes inside my head I stumble
Helpless to the ground
Down, down, down, down, down
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Smoke rings around me and bright sparks of fire
Flash by as I go
I've got the feeling and it takes me higher
Than I'll ever know
Go, go, go, go, go
Ohhh

[Guitar Solo: Andrew Latimer]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I'm in a freefall, like a snowflake falling
Down, down, down, down, down
I close my eyes inside my head I stumble
Helpless to the ground
Down, down, down, down, down
Oh yeah

[Verse 4]
Smoke rings around me and bright sparks of fire
Flash by as I go
I've got the feeling and it takes me higher

Go, go, go, go, go
Ohhh

You're the one I need
Bang, bang, bang, here we come, here we slam
It's the Fun Factory with the B S B's
Y'all you guys, get on your knees tryin' to scream or touch me, please
Backstreet Boys, are you with it? A J, hit it

Smack it up, flip it and move it all around
Here it is if you wanna get with this
Put you at the top of my list, oh

When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see

No I won't be afraid
No I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

[Chorus:]
So darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Whenever you're in trouble would you stand by me?
Oh, stand by
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me

[Chorus:]
Everything over?
Sounds can't be the end yet
Nah nah nah we can't go that route
Uh-ahh
That's what I'm sayin though!
*applause*
Yeah, everyone gather round, gather round
Now I'm gon' start it off first (why don't you start it off first)
And you gonna follow me, it goes like this

I'm lookin at this girl who's been livin a lie
But I don't know why she's livin a lie
(Perhaps she'll die)
I'm lookin at this girl tryin to be fly
But behind the scenes she breaks down and cries
See she breaks down and cries caise she's livin a lie
But I don't know why she's livin a lie
(Perhaps she'll die)
I'm lookin at this girl she's always high
Cause she likes to get by by stayin high
She's always high cause she always cry
Cause she's livin a lie...
And I don't know why she's livin a lie
(Perhaps she'll die)
Yeah, yeah you got it, here we go (check it out)

I'm lookin at this girl wit her bloodshot eyes
You could really tell now by the size of her eyes
She got bloodshot eyes, cause she's always high
Cause she always cry, cause she's livin a lie
But I don't really know why she's livin this lie (here we go, one more time)
(Perhaps she'll die)

(Yeah, yeah) Last time, last time

I'm lookin at this girl tryin to hide her face
Cause she thinks she looks bad and her life is a waste
See her face she hides cause of her bloodshot eyes
Cause she always high cause she always crys
Cause she's livin a lie...
And I don't know why she's livin a lie
(Perhaps she'll die) Rrrrrrrahhh!

You don't really need-a, lyrical teacha
When I reach you through the particles and ways of the speaker
What I got to say is positive and negative
You draw whatever energy you need to live, give and take
Build and destroy, life and death
Inhale, exhale, of breath
The point is yes, everything in life is a choice
East and West, wack rapeprs or DJ KRS-One
Dunn I come like the ancients with a drum
Come along you can hum along or run along
Sing a song if you wanna sing a song
This meta-lyrical poet will surely put it on
I don't wear or count of frauds
But I can prophesize by lookin in your eyes
If you're right or wrong, it could be all
It's always the little things that control the big things
Undirected mind waves will bring a string
Of unexpected anything until you cipher
Whether niggative or negative you don't need either
You need to direct your thinkin through your speakin
Prevent the negative from leakin out into the atmosphere
Do I make myself clear? Achieve a major goal this year
But don't ever step here
*DJing of 'Spark Mad Izm' by Channel Live and KRS-One*
Expertism, is lyr, lyr, lyr, lyricism
My flow, my flow, my flow'll take you over
My ex, my ex, my expertism
Is lyr, is lyr, is lyr, lyr-i-cism
My flow, my flow, my flow'll take you over
My, my flow'll take you over
My, my flow'll take you over, like
My, my flow'll take you over, like...
I know that she loves you now
But your heart doesn't keep any vows
And that's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way to hurt that girl
It's a terrible way you treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world

Her heart isn't for a game
So tell her , you don't feel the same
For that's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way , you hurt that girl
It's a terrible way you treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world

Oh, so sad ,leaving her behind
And if you give me the chance to take her hand
And try to change her mind
For it's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way you hurt that girl
It's a terrible way to treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world
For it's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way you hurt that girl
It's a terrible way to treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world

Oh, you never know how you hurt me, woman, how bad I feel inside
I believed you when you said you loved me, oh, but I know you lied

Oh, when I lay down in darkness, I keep hearin' your sweet voice
When I lay down in darkness, baby, I keep hearin' your sweet voice
And I remember your church, woman, oh, and how I rejoice

Mm, can you take me where I came from?
Can you take me back?
Baubles, bangles, hear how they jing, jinga-linga
Baubles, bangles, bright shiny beads
Sparkles, spangles, your heart will sing, singa-linga
Wearin' baubles, bangles and beads

You'll glitter and gleam so
Make somebody dream so that

Some day he may buy you a ring, ringa-linga
I've heard that's where it leads
Wearin' baubles, bangles, and beads

Instrumental

Baubles, bangles, hear how they jing, jinga-linga
Baubles, bangles, all those bright, shiny beads
Sparkles, spangles, your heart will sing, singa-linga
Wearin' baubles, bangles, and beads

You'll, you'll glitter and gleam so
You're gonna make somebody dream so that
Some day he may, he may buy you a ring, ringa-linga
I've heard that that's where it leads
If you're wearin' baubles bangles and them cool, cool beads
(Jim uh huh, Jim uh huh, Jim)

Jim, I did everything that I could
But your fever just wouldn't die down
So I tied your horse to the wagon bed
And last night I brought you to town

But when I got there you were gone Jim
And there was nothin' nobody could do
I bought you a suit and a tie Jim
And today I wore one too

Jim I wore a tie today
The first one that I ever wore
And you'd have said I looked like a dummy
Out of a dry goods store

Jim they said a lot of things
But I don't know a thing they said
My mind kept wanderin' off down the trail
Back to the times that we've had
(Wind her through sun and the rain)
And for gold on the cuff
We've done everything in the book I guess
And a lot they'd never thought up
Well Jim, you're ridin' on ahead
I guess that's how it has be
But when you reach those streets paved with gold Jim
Stake a claim out for me...
(We are reincarnated souls from that time)
And we are living on earth
Heat air and water (This time)

(We are reincarnated souls from that time)
And we are living on earth
Heat air and water (This time)

In the beginning was the word
And the word manifested its self in the flesh
Which even became man, all because of the divine plan
Man being lowered and the angel
Over all the earth was he given dominion
He devised his own destruction
(But the word lives on and on)

(He who is weary)Let him come hither
(He who has eyes to see)Let him look yonder
(All who are thirsty)Let them drink clear water
(Drink water, Drink water)
(We are reincarnated souls from that time)
And we are living on earth
Heat air and water (This time)

(We are reincarnated souls from that time)
And we are living on earth
Heat air and water (This time)

Nothing is new under the sun;
All has been here since time begun
With all the years we spent
(Only changing names protect the innocent)
Like seed that is planted by the water
A prayer to die before new birth
Changing its form to another
Taking on a structure just as the first

(He who is weary)Let him come hither
(He who has eyes to see)Let him look yonder
(All who are thirsty)Let them drink clear water
(Drink water, Drink water)
So far this love is delightful
The face of seduction was you
But I listened for each and every footstep
In this Real Cool World

Questioning saintlike and fantastic heroes
Feeling like lost little children in fabled lands
So I listen for each and every friendship
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Starry-eyed life but somehow believing in nothing
You whisper sweet nothing but reading between your lines
I listen color me doubtful
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World
You came from nowhere
You came from nowhere
You held me you shook me
Hey

It's a Cool World
It's a Cool World

It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Mmmm
Real Cool World
I have had my eyes on you
Oh, since the day I learned to laugh at myself
Caught you laughing too
Then you went your way, oh, and I went mine
It´s strange that in another place
That joke should hit me in my face

But you, oh, you make it so hard, baby
To say no, no, no, oh
You, yes, you, baby, make it so hard
To say no, no, no, no

All that glitters is not gold
Just like good jokes get old
That spark that makes you think of me
Don't make things like they used to be

You might say that I have changed
It's just that things are rearranged
And as I once looked out for you
Now it's your turn to see me through
Cause you, oh baby, you make it so hard, girl
To say no, no, no, no
You, oh baby, you make it so hard
To say no, no, no, no

You know I tried to get you out of my mind
But now I'm to the point I find
I just can't leave and not have kissed you
You know I could never resist you

Cause you, oh, you make it so hard
To say no, no, no, no
You, oh, you're making it so hard, baby
To say no, oh, to say no, no, no, no

You are making it so hard
(Girl, you know what you're trying to do)
To say no, no, no, no....

[Verse 1]
There's a man back a-ways
Who believes at where he is
And there's a girl
Up ahead who says she knows

[Verse 2]
And the street overflows
With the folk who understand
For the guy who can't be seen
He's the Shadow Man
And the Shadow Man is close at hand

[Verse 3]
Take a turn and see his smile
Made of nothing but loneliness
Take a walk and be a friend
To the Shadow Man

[Chorus]
You can call him Joe, you can call him Sam
You should call and see who answers
For he promises to come running, guided by the truth
For the Shadow Man is really you

[Bridge]
Look in his eyes and see your reflection
Look to the stars and see his eyes
He'll show you tomorrow, he'll show you the sorrow
Of what you did today

[Chorus]
You can call him foe, you can call him friend
You should call and see who answers
For he knows your eyes are drawn to the road ahead
And the Shadow Man is waiting round the bend
The Shadow Man is waiting up ahead
Shadow man
Is waiting up ahead
Is waiting up ahead
Met a lot women who could love alright
But nothing like the woman I met this night
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

Now men don't blame me because I've been around
I don't understand what's she's putting down
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

Now she don't drink liquor and very little gin
But she'll show you how, you just tell her when
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

She's got a peal handled pistol
A knife and a razor too
You can't ever tell her, she'll always tell you
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about
Now you can whip it, whop it
Or hang it on the wall
Or throw it out the window
She'll pitch herself a ball
She's dynamite, well she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about
Ow, oh oh oh oh oh

Live life given now, tomorrow can wait
Dance all through the night, sleeping all day
Stuck inside a box, you gotta get out
Stand up, get up, live your life now, come on
Stand up, get up
Come on, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on
Live life given now, tomorrow can wait
Dance all through the night, sleeping all day
Stuck inside a box, you gotta get out
Stand up, get up, live your life now
Come on, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, get up
Stand up, get up
Let's go right now
People lining through this life we lead
Never knowing what we'll find out
So we're living, working and waiting for the day
There'll be something that's coming to take the pain away
We wait for nothing inside your ways
You gotta let that fun girl through
Live life given now, tomorrow can wait
Dance all through the night, sleeping all day
You're stuck inside a box, you gotta get out
Stand up, get up, live your life now
Sometimes it feels
How love indeed
And we're just floating
Searching infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity
Come on and dance here tonight, tomorrow can wait
Dance all through the night, sleeping through the day
Stuck inside a box, you gotta get out
Stand up, get up, live your life now, come on
You and me don't see eye to eye
On every little thing
We've missed a lot of sunshine
And caught a lot of rain
If you want to leave I can't make you stay
But there is something I have to say

No matter how high you get
Or how low you go
There's one thing darling
You ought to know

There's a world full of strangers out there
A world full of strangers
Beware
There's a world full of strangers out there
And if it gets too strange
Just come on home

Restless hearts, looking for a love
Are waiting in the street
They're all prepared to give you
The bitter with the sweet
If you wake someday and you reach for me
Well you know, this is where I'll be
No matter how high you get
Or how low you go
There's one thing darling
You ought to know

There's a world full of strangers out there
A world full of strangers
Beware
There's a world full of strangers out there
And if it gets too strange
Just come on home
Let me tell 'bout a gal I know
She's my baby and she lives next door
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
She brings my coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I got no friend
I know she'll go with me down to the end
Everybody asks me how do I know
I smile a damn and say she told me so
That why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now if I call her on the telephone
Tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there ain't nobody hanging 'round
She just kisses me, and then holds me tight
And tells me, baby, everything's gonna be alright
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just, I love her so
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying 'wish you were here
I know all the best ways to break out of here

I helped a young laddie called Ivan
I bundled him over the wall last night
Then he climbed back and he grabbed me tight
He uttered some words that I can't say to you
'Cause he remembered that he was a screw

Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note wishing 'Happy New Year'

My name is Henry though some say I'm thick
I've spent half me life in and out of nick
Me mum sends me presents to keep me in style
Soggy old cakes and hundreds of files
I sussed all them files, I'm a clever young man
Now I'm just stupid with manicured hands
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Nobody's left and the screw are in tears

Spoken:
"Double 3, 427 ?" "Here, sir."
"Double 3, 428 ?" "Here, sir."
"Double 3, 429? Double 3, 429 - Where is he?"
"He went out for a cup of tea at the local football match, sir."
"Oh. well he might have invited me..."

Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Nbody's slept and the screws are in tears

We tried digging tunnels but gave up the ghost just past the Kensington yards at the most
Our limbs was aching, we felt pretty pooped
Our clothes they was tatty, our arrows did droop
We crawled back to safety, our hearts filled with gloom
'Cos we'd dug ourselves through to the smallest room

Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note wishing 'Happy New Year'
Spoken:

[SFX: knock knock knock]
"Hello, who is it?"
"Double 3, 429, guv"
"Oh, hang on a minute...

[SFX: Doors opening]
Hello, sonny Jim!
Been wondering where you were!
Did you have a nice Christmas?"
I know you wanna leave me, but I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg, plead for sympathy
I don't mind, 'cause it means that much to me

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Well I heard a quiet man is half a man, with no sense of pride
If I have to cry to keep ya I don't mind weepin'
If weepin' gonna keep ya by my side

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walkin' away
Let my friends laugh, for this I can stand
'Cause I wanna I keep ya, yeah, yeah, I can
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go x2

I got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
Ev'ry day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come and plead with you, baby
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out the door

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, don't you go

[Verse 1: Novel]
Girl, you fucked up for the last time (Last time, last time)
You think you got everyone figured out (Figured out, figured out)
We're living in a glass house (Glass house, glass house)
'Cause everything's shattering all around (All around, all around)

[Verse 2: Novel]
Now tell me what you're mad about (Mad about, mad about)
I'm tired of all of the nonsense (The nonsense, the nonsense)
And if you were to leave me now (Yeah, yeah)
I'd probably do nothing to stop it

[Chorus: Novel]
'Cause won't be missing you anymore
Missing you anymore
Kissing you anymore
Missing you anymore
Touching you anymore
No loving you anymore
Is that what you really want?
Is that what you really want?

Hey, you sinners, open all the doors
Have I got news for you
About that money loving preach of yours

Friday night you'll find him taking pictures
Of a model in a cheap hotel
Sunday morning he's raving from the pulpit
Threatening to send us all to hell, well, well

Don't throw, don't throw, don't throw
Don't throw any stones
If you can't live by what you teach
You better leave alone

Don't throw, don't throw, don't throw
Don't throw any stones
Unless you practice what you preach
You'll never find love

Can't find love
Can't find love
Can't find love
Can't find love
Don't throw, don't throw, don't throw
Don't throw any stones
If you can't live by what you teach
You better leave alone

Don't throw, don't throw, don't throw
Don't throw any stones
Unless you practice what you preach
You'll never find love

Hey, you sinners, well, you never can tell
The glory train is leaving in the morning
But the preacher's there to say farewell, well, well

Can't find love
Can't find love
Can't find love
Can't find love
Can't find love
Can't find love

Yet be you who is without sins, cast the first stone
(the first stone, the first stone, the first stone)

Can't find love
Can't find love
You can't find love
You can't find love
Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, help me stand
Lord, I'm tired, Lord, I'm so weak
Lord, You know I am worn
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home

When my way, it gets kind of dreary
Precious Lord, somewhere near
When my light is almost gone

Hear my cry, Lord, hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home
Oh

I wanna know your name
You just kill me, could you at least do that?
I wanna know your name
Or better yet, stand there
Just do that

I wanna know your name
Your name
You just kill me, could you at least do that?
I wanna know your name
Your name
Or better yet, stand there
Just do that

Hey yeah

I wanna know your name...
Know your name...
I wanna know your name...
Know your name...
Uh!
Oh yeah

I wanna know your name
You just kill me, could you at least do that?
I wanna know your name
Know your name
Or better yet, stand there
Just do that

Hey yeah!
Oh yeah!

I wanna know your name...
Know your name...
I wanna know your name...
Know your name...

Uh
Writer(s): Cahn/Van Heusen

A little voice, keeps talking to me
From (a) way down deep inside
What does this voice, keep saying to me
It says: "pass this affair and pass it wide"

You may be a puzzle, but I like the way the parts fit
Still that little voice says: "Go get your track shoes -put them on and get"

We could go the distance
And find us romance
I like your persistence
Your style and your stance
There's only one problem - the tiniest problem
I like to lead when I dance

Your eyes do the speaking
They talk with each glance
My will-power's creaking
I might take a (the) chance
And though you're the charmer - who could bend my armor
I like to lead when I dance
I like to steer the car - whenever I drive
And hold the door ajar - when we arrive

So if it's decided - that this is romance

My sweet, I'll repeat - in advance
I like to lead when I dance

(I like to lead when I dance)

When Adam bit the fruit - as fashions were then
He got that fig-leaf suit - for which Amen

So if it's decided - I'm wearing the pants
Then Eve, I'd say we've - got romance

I like to lead - I set the speed
I like to lead when I dance
(When I dance, when I dance, when I dance)
Sunday, Monday or Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday
I want you near, every day in the year
Oh, won't you tell me when we will meet again
Sunday, Monday or always
If you're satisfied, I'll be at your side
Sunday, Monday or always
No need to tell me now what makes the world go 'round
When at the sight of you, my heart begins to pound and pound
And what am I to do, can't I be with you
Sunday, Monday or always

Always and forever I must be with you
Beginning Sunday and Monday and then forever
Oh, won't you tell me when we will meet again
Sunday, Monday or always
If you're satisfied, I'll be at your side
Sunday, Monday or always
No need to tell me now what makes the world go 'round
When at the sight of you, my heart begins to pound, pound, pound
What am I to do, can't I be with you
Sunday, Monday or always
(Angel doll)
(Angel doll)
You excite me every time you speak
When you touch me I get, oh, so weak
I have never met a girl like you, baby
You're the one that I'll give my whole life to
All I wanna say is angel doll
When I met you there with holiness
You're my everything I must confess
I have never known such tenderness
Baby, you can't compare this love we share
That takes away my feels, yeah
This love and real I can't conceal
And I'm so, so, so glad you're here
Angel doll, it will be a great catastrophe, baby
And my whole world would comin' down on me
If our love would ever seize to be
That's why I call you, angel doll
You're the substance of my every prayer, baby
I'll be happy with you anywhere
Let me shield you with my loving care
Heaven must have sent you, honey
You're an angel in disguise, yeah
'Cause all the love I wanted so long
I can see it in your eyes
Angel doll, you're the reason that I carry on, baby
I can't make it, I can't make it by myself alone
You're the one that I'm depending upon
Angel doll, you know that I love you
Angel doll, I put no one above you
Angel doll, you knock me off of my feet
Angel doll, you make my whole life complete
Angel doll...
Outside the rain begins
And it may never end
So cry no more
On the shore a dream
Will take us out to sea
Forever more forever more
I'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost
When I pass by, all the people say
"Just another guy on the lost highway."

Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies make a life like mine
Oh, the day we met, I went astray
I started rollin' down that lost highway

I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
I'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost
When I pass by, all the people say
"Just another guy on the lost highway."

Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies make a life like mine
Oh, the day we met, I went astray
I started rollin' down that lost highway
I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord, I've paid the cost on the lost highway

Now, boys, don't start your ramblin' round
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord, I've paid the cost on the lost highway

Now, boys, don't start your ramblin' round
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway
Freedom for the stallion
Freedom for the mare and her colt
Freedom for the baby child
Who has not grown old enough to vote
Lord, have mercy, what you gonna do about the people who are praying to you?
They got men making laws that destroy other men
They've made money "God"
It's a doggone sin
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way
Big ship's a-sailing, slaves all chained and bound
Heading for a brand new land that some cat said he upped and found
Lord, have mercy, what you gonna do about the people who are praying to you?
They got men making laws that destroy other men
They've made money "God"
It's a doggone sin
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way
Some sing a sad song
Some got to moan the blues
Trying to make the best of a home
That the man didn't even get to choose
Lord, have mercy, how you gonna be with people like John and me
They've got men building fences to keep other men out
Ignore him if he whispers and kill him if he shouts
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way
Oh, Lord, you got to help them find the way
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way
G-goobely-goo
Ah-h-h-hm
Ah yeah
Now check it out
I would walk into the bathroom to take a crap
I sit down, and then I write me a toilet stool rap
Whether I'm constipated or have diarrhea
I always come out with a funky fresh idea
Even if you don't think it's funky fresh, and
To all the little kids I'm makin a good impression
Cause a lot of my hits are written on the john
I hope my legendary style of rap lives on
This's a hidden secret where classics come from
Everybody has done it, even my man Run
Only in there I am the king of the throne
Hey, hey, you know I can't be alone
No girls, no guys, no dogs, no cats
No parents, no nieces, no nephews, no brats
That's the only way that I can get privacy
And you know where I write my funky fresh rhymes live, you see...
Me sittin on a toilet
Waitin for my bowels to move
I got a doodoo rap
I got a doodoo...
Yo, bust it
Let me tell you a little something bout this episode
It was four in the morning, chillin on my commode
It was me, my pad, and pen, and my bad breath
All of a sudden I came up with somethin that was real def
I was thinkin, what a real beatbox could do
What if I put a hype beat with the "p-pf 1-2"?
Then I write some words, so I really can use it
I think I would name this one Make The Music
Like if I was the man that they call Clark Kent
Cause I go into the bathroom for rhymes I invent
Then I come out on stage like Superman
But never show the people my masterplan
Instead of movin towels, or movin vowels
Only think I'm doin, is movin bowels
A tv in the bathroom just might spoil it
Only thing I can say is...
I'm sittin on a toilet
Waitin for my bowels to move
I got a doodoo rap
I got a doodoo
Doodoo
Doo-oo-oo
Doo-doo-doo-doo
Rrrhaaa
Come on, come on

Do this, ugh, come on, come on
Time to get wreck and kick the so on and so on
The I C E-T, O.G. M.C., L.A.P.D., H A T E S
(Ho)
Watch the mic blow
I flip scripts and the Dump drops the ammo

Time to get wreck with the new style
It's '93 and MC's are gettin' buck wild
But I ain't a nigga
That's gonna get left with a big zero as a figure
I'm gonna end up with a big sum
'Cause if you don't like one jam, I always got another one

Different, specifically I don't copy
Tear up the track if the flow sounds sloppy
I don't play one game
I bust about a dozen cuts on my LP's, none the same
I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Never been new to this, nigga, new to this
I ain't new to this, fool, new to this
Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist

Boom bam, I drop fat slang
When I used to hustle, used to be down with the crack game
When I was young, I used to roll with a street gang
If you wanna squabble, muthafucka, it ain't no thang

I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Blow your dome, I hit quick as a pugilist
Ugh, ah, what's up? Now your eyes swoll'
Thought I went soft 'cause my records went gold

(Sucker)
Buster, you'se a muthafuckin' punk fool
Caught you in your eye while you reached for your tool
Now it's mine and you're blind
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop goes the nine

Yeah, what you're dissin' 'bout, friend?
Sayin' I went out but you ain't never been in
I got R E S P E C T in the industry
That's somethin' that you'll never see
I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Never been new to this, nigga, new to this
I ain't new to this, fool, new to this
Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist

They can get a smack for that
Yeah, yeah

On and on to the funk track
Back glass shakin' like shit, that's where the trunk's at
That's 'cause my shit's made for
Niggas that are hardcore

Brothers is quick to hook a left to your right jaw
Girls, come on, girls, come on, girls, come on
Get your clothes off and the fun on
Girls, come on, girls, come on, girls, come on
Get your clothes off and the fun on

It's time to check cash
Jump in my 4, hit the switch and lay the ass
While the Klan try to kill me
But I wrote 'riot' on my muthafuckin' will, gee

So when I'm gone, it's on
Caps goin' off on the streets like popcorn
Talkin' 'bout Simon till the early morn'
Word is bond but now I just cool
Bumpin' my Gang Starr tape by my pool
I ain't new to this
I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Never been new to this, nigga, new to this
I ain't new to this, fool, new to this
Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist

Check, check, I got problems with the press
Caught the punk in traffic, stabbed the sucker in his neck
(Ugh)
Punk reporter tried to diss me
(Ugh)
Now the muthafucka's history

(Ha)
I got to make a break hardcore fat tape
Word, I don't fantasize, I don't exaggerate
Just kick correct with the 1 2 mic check
Still quick to swing, take a sucker to the deck

I'm not the nigga you should step to like a sucker
Walk up talkin' shit, you best to be a good ducker
Your posse best to run from my gun
Keep my nine off safety and E holds the other one
(Yeah, sucker)

I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Never been new to this, nigga, new to this
I ain't new to this, fool, new to this
Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist

They can get a smack for that
And you don't stop
Fuck, fuck around and get your punk ass dropped

Yeah, Ice-T
'93 for the underground
I ain't new ta this
(Chorus:)
Mac Bre-Z:Is you rollin (repeat 3 times)

Went to the strip club and request that im da man

(Chorus)

(Verse 2:)
Shawty tellin me she ain't neva suck no dick
Neva took a pill or neva ate a bitch
You a lie but I ain't gonna get upset right now
But I wish I had a lie detector test right now
You say you marry well bitch you might be
But I bet your husband ain't Icy like me
She stand on B.C. in my ashy black tee

When dem dope man nikes and dem jore ass jeans-Jordache Jeans

I dont pay her but I still keep that thrax on me
Imma the shit in East Atlanta baby ask about me
Pop one pop two two halves thats three

Top the top on that thang let you see my seats

(Chorus)

(Verse 3:)

To keep me happy
If I can't have you
I cannot go on

I need your arms
Around me tightly
I miss them nightly
When you are not at home

When day is done
Oh I need you so
I long to hear your lil'
Knock upon the door

When you leave me
I try not to worry
Come back in a hurry
'Cause I need you so

When day is done
Oh I need you so
I long to hear your lil'
Knock upon the door
When you leave me
Baby I try not to worry
Please come back in a hurry
Because I need you so
Gone are the days I'm holding you tight
Gone are the times I thrill with delight
Oh how I've missed you and your tender kiss
I've been a fool too long

I took your love then broke your heart
Can you forgive me, we'll make a new start
Guess life ain't worth living if you are not giving
I've been a fool to long

I've played the field but could not conceal
The way I feel about you
Everyone guessed I had no happiness
Loving you the way I do

You carried my heart around in your hand
Yes I still love you, please understand
Life ain't worth living if you are not giving
I've been a fool to long

[Verse 1]
Every day I think of you
Can't believe it's true that I'm so into you
And I don't know where I'm goin'
I never felt this way before
All I wanna do is to love you, baby
Behind closed doors

[Chorus]
Ooh, I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
Don't let go
All of the good times that we shared

[Verse 2]
Every day's a holiday
We could celebrate making love together
Ooh, let's keep this fire burning
Every day is new, girl
When I think of you, I get so excited
Ooh, you keep my whole world turnin'

[Chorus]
I just had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
Don't let go
All of the good times that we shared

[Bridge]
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
Girl, I can't let you go
Sure as Heaven above
We found love

[Verse 3]
You and I can fly away
Maybe to L.A. or some lovely island
Take a stroll along the ocean
Building castles in the sand
Doin' all the things we planned together
Ooh, I love you so much, baby

[Chorus]
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
Don't let go
All of the good times that we shared

[Outro]
Once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
Can't let it go, girl
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
Can't let it go, no, no
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Ooh, I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
Can't let go
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I once had your lovin', baby
Can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
Can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go, ooh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Hearing the bells go ding dong
Hearing the choir sing songs
Letting us know its Christmas
Time for the world to spread love

I open my eyes
And to my surprise
I've come to realize that....

All around the world, it's Christmas
All around the world, it's Christmas
All around the world, it's Christmas
And I'm so glad to be
Sharing peace and harmony with you

Looking out of the window
Seeing the winter white snow
Kiss under the mistletoe
I see the angel's halo

I open my eyes
And to my surprise
I've come to realize that....
So, come on, come on
A child is born
Onto us, a King

So, joy to the world
Woman, man, boy and girl
With this love and Christmas brings

I open my eyes
And to my surprise
I've come to realize that....

I open my eyes
And to my surprise
I've come to realize that....

I open my eyes
And to my surprise
I've come to realize that....

I open my eyes
And to my surprise
I've come to realize that....
Something wonderful happens in summer
When the sky is a heavenly blue
You fall in love - you fall in love
With someone who loves you too

Something wonderful happens in summer
When the moon makes you feel all aglow
You fall in love - you fall in love
You want the whole world to know

You carve initials on a tree
You kiss and exchange a ring
June and July go by
Your heart sings: "ting-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling"

Something wonderful happens in summer
And it happens to only a few
But when it does - yes when it does
You'll feel wonderful - it happened to you
Come on now, don't you want to see
This thing that's happening to me?
Like moses has power over sea
So you've got a power over me
Come on now, don't you want to know?
You're a refuge, somewhere I can go
And you're air that, air that I can breathe
You're my golden opportunity
And oh, oh yes, I would
If I only could
And you know I would
Now baby, I, oh baby, I, I wish
Come on now, don't you want to see
Just what a difference you've made in me
And I'll be waiting no matter what you say
And I'll keep waiting for days and days, and days
And oh, oh yes, I would
If I only could
And you know I would
Now baby I, oh baby, I wish
I wish, I wish
If the sky's gonna fall down, let it fall on me
If you're gonna break down, you can break on me
If the sky gonna fall down, let it fall on me
Oh Lord, let it fall on me
Here is somethin' baby, I want you to do
I ain't barrin' nobody baby, I mean you and your lyin' friends too
Don't cry baby, don't even spill a tear
Yes, you just pack your clothes baby
Baby and get on outta here

I gave you a chance and that you know
You got greedy and thirsty baby and you spent more and more
There's no need cryin' baby, don't even spill a tear
You just pack your clothes baby, baby and get on outta here

You and your friends you say you had fun
You went every place woman, that you wanted to go
And when I tried to talk to you baby
You didn't listen to a word I say
And now baby you must be crazier, that juice has gone to your head
Ain't no need of cryin' woman, baby, don't even spill a tear
You just pack your clothes baby
I mean and get on outta here

[Verse 1]
I was up this mornin', ah, blues walkin' like a man
I was up this mornin', ah, blues walkin' like a man
Worried blues, give me your right hand

[Verse 2]
And the blues fell mama's child, tore me all upside down
Blues fell mama's child, and it tore me all upside down
Travel on, poor Bob, just can't turn you 'round

[Verse 3]
The blues, is a low-down shakin' chill, yes, preach 'em now
Is a low-down shakin' chill
You ain't never had 'em I, hope you never will

[Verse 4]
Well, the blues is a achin' old heart disease
Do it now, you gon' do it? Tell me all about it
The blues, is a low-down achin' heart disease
Like consumption, killing me by degrees

[Verse 5]
I can study rain, oh, oh, drive, oh, oh, drive my blues
I been studyin' the rain, I'm 'on drive my blues away
Goin' to the 'stil'ry, stay out there all day
I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh, I've got a feeling

Oh please believe me, I'd hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, oh yeah
And if you leave me, I won't be late again
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Yeah, I've got a feeling

All these years I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you

I've got a feeling that keeps me on my toes
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I've got a feeling, I think that everybody knows
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, I've got a feeling, got a feeling, oh yeah
Everybody had a hard year
Everybody had a good time
Everybody had a wet dream
(Oh yeah)
Everybody saw the sunshine

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Everybody had a good year
Everybody let their hair down
Everybody pulled their socks up
Everybody put their foot down, yeah

I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide
Oh no, oh no
I've got a feeling

I've got a feeling, I've got a feeling, yes, I've got a feeling
That everybody knows, that keeps me on my toes
The other day they waited, the sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated, "He has to die, you know he has to die."
All the children learnin', from books that they were burnin'
Every leaf was turnin', to watch him die, you know he had to die

The summer sun looked down on him
His mother could but frown on him
And all the other sound on him
He had to die, you know he had to die

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
You ask if I remembered, when we first met
Girl, tell me how could I ever forget

[Verse 1]
There, you were standing there
Aw, with ruby lips and the golden hair
Your beauty seemed to hypnotise me
I had that feeling I was no longer free

[Chorus]
But when I ask you for a dance (For a dance)
You wouldn't even give me a chance (Me a chance)
And it hurt me through and through
That was the first time I cried over you

[Verse 2]
You had my heart dangling
Like a puppet on a string
To you I meant nothing, darling
But to me, it meant everything

[Chorus]
Girl, you know since then through the years (Through the years)
I've shed so many tears (So many tears)
And all because of you
I couldn't cry if I wanted to

[Bridge]
I don't know why I still love you
'Cause you don't even want me around
Year after year it's the same old thing
You build me up, to let me down

[Verse 3]
So go on and hurt me (Hurt me)
Aw, like you did
This time it'll be different
Mmm, my tears you'll see no more

[Chorus]
'Cause I've cried so through the years (Through the years)
Until I run out of tears (Run out of tears)
And all because of you
I couldn't cry if I wanted to

[Outro]
I'll never shed another tear
I couldn't cry no more, darling
Seems as though the pain
Have gone the tears from my eyes
Never cry, never
Never no more
I'll never shed another tear
Walk with my baby

Do the same at night
But still my baby
Ain't treating me right

Tell me baby baby baby baby
What can I do?
Do I have to shut your mouth
Just to get along with you?

When I'm home at night
I can't read a book
Without you being huffed up
Giving me a dirty look

Tell me baby baby baby baby
What can I do?
Do I have to shut your mouth
Just to get along with you?

She's so jealous, man
Till it's a sin
She don't even trust me
Out with men
Tell me baby baby baby baby
What can I do?
Do I have to shut your mouth
Just to get along with you?
Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it
Don't blame me
Can't you see when you do the things you do
And I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling
Don't blame me
I can't help it if that doggone moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love
Blame your kiss, as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me
Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today - ya

Father, father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
Oh, what's going on

What's going on
Ya, what's going on
Ah, what's going on
In the mean time
Right on, baby
Right on
Right on
Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today
Oh

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me
So you can see
What's going on
Ya, what's going on
Tell me what's going on
I'll tell you what's going on - uh
Right on baby
Right on baby

[Luda] Nigga, I'm in the middle of howhere! Shit!
I guess growing isn't hard to do
Just stand against the wall
Once I was just two feet high
Today I'm six feet tall

But knowing who to listen to
Is something else again
Words just whistle ‘round my head
Like seasons in the wind

All across the water the clouds are sailing
They won't let me look at the sky
All I want to do is try and find myself
Come and let me look in your eyes

In searching for the way to go
I've followed all the rules
The way they say to chooses between
The wise men and the fools

I listen to the words they say
I read what I should read
I do whatever's right to do
Try to be what I should be
Someone let me in I think the sky is falling
Seems I've gotten lost on my way
All I want to do is try and find myself
Come and let me look in your eyes

Ah, but wisdom isn't underground
Nor on a mountainside
And where am I to take myself
There's no place here to hide

All across the universe the stars are fading
Seems we've gotten lost on our way
All I want to do is try and find myself
Come and let me look in your eyes
Come and let me look in your eyes
Come and let me look in your eyes
Saturday night in Toledo, Ohio is like being nowhere at all
All through the day how the hours rush by
You sit in the park and you watch the grass die!
Ah, but after the sunset, the dusk and the twilight
When shadows of night start to fall
They roll back the sidewalk precisely at ten
And people who live there are not seen again!
Just two lonely truckers from Great Falls, Montana
And a salesman from places unknown
All huddled together in downtown Toledo
To spend their big night all alone!

You ask how I know of Toledo, Ohio? Well I spent a week there one day
They've got entertainment to dazzle your eyes
Go visit the bakery and watch the buns rise!
Ah, but let's not forget that the folks of Toledo
Unselfishly gave us the scale
No springs, honest weight, that's the promise they made
So smile and be thankful next time you get weighed!
And "wiv and wet wiv", let this be our motto
Let's let the sleeping dogs lie
And here's to the dogs of Toledo, Ohio
Ladies, we bid you goodbye!

[Hook]
I got a grind, won't stop, Hustle won't quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit
I got high price lifestyle, super bad bitch
If I want it, bet I got it
If I don't bet all I gotta do is
Go, Get It - Stay up out my business
Ball til I fall, Flossin' til Im finished
Go, Get It - Stay up out my business
Im living just to kill it, stacking millions to the ceiling

[Verse 1]
Eveyday above ground, all I wanna do is ball
Put my money over bitches, put my hustle over all
Louie down to the drawers, Luis Vuitton kicks
Got a Mad Hatter swagger, bitch I’m stupid dumb sick
With a group of young bitches and they stupid dumb thick
I’m the marathon man, all I do is run shit
A sophisticated convict, superficial, still official
Multimillion dollar shit
Money is the object, hot shit
Bitch I got a sauna on my arm
See bigger with no diamond (?)
They just talk about they got it
I’m the upper echelon, though
Bitch I‘m bout that action, you could go on with that convo
I have done more than you dream bout
Got your dream bitch and your dream house
On lean passing them beans out
With a bad crew, the whole team high
Go on boy, get seen by, bro you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough, that’s all I see
I g.o.g.e.t.i.t

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I live life, up late night
Get shitfaced when I take flight
I get paid, no sick days
My outfit’s on switch blade
Don’t sniff yay, but I blow dro
Bank roll on loco
Still ride with that 44
Don’t let my P-O know
Bad white bitch super thick
I’m Ice T, she Coco
She got another bitch, other bitches
Her ass fat, face so-so, no paper trail
No phone call, no emails, no photos
Just backshot, with that fat butt
And low blow headbutts in slow-mo
Purple label polo and Akoo, that’s all I do
Man I strive and roll my denim in my new Margiella shoes
Man, we be cool if we just parle
On Margharita Molly and the strongest pack around (?)
We menagin’ for a hobby
We kick it how we kick it
Know you envy how I’m living
Just can’t resist this pimping
Get the million bout my business
Bro you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough that’s all I see
I g.o.g.e.t.i.t

[Hook]

[Intro]
"okay, for anyone who's still listening
This is a song called I Froze Up
'Cause I did
What? Don't distract me. "

[Verse]
You're the light wiping out my batteries
You're the cream in my airport-coffees
I don't know why I stick with you
If I had a choice
Like lambs into the slaughter
Like cows to the thunderbolt
You're the Genie of my lamp
I could have been anyone
But one day I froze up
But one day I froze up
But one day I froze up
Like this...
Oh, little boy...
Little boy, little boy
Oh, little boy...
Little boy, little boy
If you try to strangle the skylark
Try to cut it up, to see how it works
Stalactites and stalagmites
Rows of never open doors
Coz one day I froze up
Coz one day I froze up
Coz one day I froze up
Like this...

Everything (Everything)
Is Everything(Is Everything)
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually
(2x)

I wrote these words for everyone
Who struggles in their youth
Who won't accept deception
Instead of what is truth
It seems we lose the game
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules? We're so confused
Easily led astray
Let me tell ya that
Everything is everything
(Everything is everything)
Everything is everything
After winter, must come spring
Everything is everything
I philosophy
Possibly speak tongues
Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist
Rap this in fine linen
From the beginning
My practice extending across the atlas
I begat this
Flippin' in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
You can't match this rapper / actress
More powerful than two Cleopatras
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti
MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of Sister Betty
L. Boogie spars with stars and constellations
Then came down for a little conversation
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum
Now hear this mixture
Where hip hop meets scripture
Develop a negative into a positive picture

Now everything, is everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually
Sometimes it seems
We'll touch that dream
But things come slow or not at all
And the ones on top, won't make it stop
So convinced that they might fall
Let's love ourselves then we can't fail
To make a better situation
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow
All we need is dedication

Let me tell ya that
Everything is everything
(Everything is everything)
Everything is everything
After winter, must come spring
Everything is everything

Everything is everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

La la la la la la la la (until song fades)
I looked at you baby
And what did I see
I saw love in your eyes
Made me feel so warm inside

Now look at me baby
And what do you see
You see love in my eyes
Gleaming just for you

And now we know it's
Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll only be together

Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people
The pine-scented air
Smells so good in the snow
In our toboggan we'll go
Screaming down the mountainside

The touch of your cheeks
When they're rosy and cold
Feels so cozy to hold
Just to take you close
And make you warm and

Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll only be together

Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people

Lyin' down on our backs
Lookin' at the sky
Looking down through the valley so
Deep and wide
Aren't you glad we finally got away
Glad we finally got away
Aren't you glad we finally got away

Now I looked around baby
And what do I see
I see love in your eyes
And I'm so glad that we
Finally had some

Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll only be together

Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people
You stabbed your knife right in my back
Was it just something that I might have said
Does this mean we're falling out
I guess this means that our love has fallen out
If you wanna make a go
I guess we're falling out
It was just one gone and gone away
I guess we're falling out
Guess we're falling out
Da, da, da, I wanna stay

(An ad-libbed verse)
I guess we're falling out
It was just one long race
I guess we're falling out
Falling out
Yeah, yeah, yeah, falling out, falling out, yeah
Two, three, four
Make it a whole, a whole, a hey
On, and on, and on babe
Ohh
Yeah, yeah, it's a
Falling out
Hey
Make it a whole, a whole, a hey
On, and on, and on babe
Ohh
Yeah, yeah it's a
Falling out, falling out, yeah
Two, three, four
I guess we're falling out
It was just one gone and gone away
I guess we're falling out
Guess we're falling out
Da, da, da, I wanna stay
Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah
Mamita why we gotta keep going through this
Talk to her Frankie

(verse 1)
Just Yesterday you said you loved me
That there was nobody else above me
That i was yours and you were mine
That there was no limits to our skies
But then you had to put our love on hold
When it came to making love it wasn't you anymore
And now your telling me to leave
I gotta walk out the door
Can't you see that this is killing me
Its hurting my soul
Oh baby

Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you goooo
No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let you go
(Nooo)
Can't you see Im slowly dying
But Im gonna keep on trying
Please dont ask of me to let you goooo
Pitbull

(Verse 2)
Let me start
By telling you I love you with all my heart
But i can't understand the reason
When you tell me your leaving
Girl me and you were suppose to be forever and ever
Now instead of being in love
Its like we are use to each other
How could we do this to each other
We use to ride for each other
Die for each other
Cry for each other
Now its like all we wanna do is say is bye to each other
I can't let this happen
I refuse to lose you
I love you baby
Its the truth as usual
I wanna make you happy
Girl it ain't hard to see
You mean the world to me
We had been though it all
Thick or thin right or wrong
I can't let you go 'cause this love is too strong
Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you go

But Im gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you go

Pitbull

(Verse 3)
Look baby just tell me what you want
Look baby just tell me what you need
Look baby i know im far from perfect
But the game and the money they can take cause its worthless
I know its hard to deal with my life
I know its hard to deal with all the gossip
I done seen em wit this one
I done seen em wit that one
But everything they say is monotonous
Can't you hear it in my voice
Mami you know your my heart my soul my love
And I swear to you baby
I just want to give you my heart my soul my love
I know we can work this out
I know we can
Baby lets try
But one thing I won't do is let this love die
(Is let this love die)
Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you goooo
No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let you go
(Nooo)
Can't you see Im slowly dying
But Im gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you goooo

Ken Y

(hook)
Believe me, yes Im trying to let you go
But the only thing I get from it is all this crying
Tell me how am I suppose to let you goooo
No no noooo

Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you go
No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let you go
(Nooo)
Can't you see Im slowly dying
But Im gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you gooo
(no i just can't let you go)
Suffer you little children
Remain passive and fearful
Suffer don't grow out of it
Revel, and let's celebrate
The poor love of this poor world
The sad love the vampire

Suffer you little children
Remain passive and fearful
Suffer don't grow out of it
Revel, and let's celebrate
The poor love of this poor world
The sad love the vampire

We who're young and beautiful
We who can stand up and walk
Our lives we will learn to control
We who're young and beautiful
Respond revolution when
We hear the word suffering

We who're young and beautiful
Respond with revolution
When we hear the word suffering

We who're young and beautiful
We who can stand up and walk
Our lives we will learn to control
We who're young and beautiful
Respond revolution when
We hear the word suffering
I'll have a blue Christmas without you;
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
Just won't mean a thing if
You're not here with me

And when those blue heartaches start hurting
I'll have some blue memories for certain;
You'll be doing all right
With your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
Just won't mean a thing if
You're not here with me

And when those blue heartaches start hurting
I'll have some blue blue memories for certain;
You'll be doing all right
With your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
Yes I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
Down in front of Casey's old brown wooden stoop
On a summer's evening we formed a merry group
Boys and girls together we would sing and waltz
While Tony played the organ on the sidewalks of New York

East Side, West Side, all around the town
The tots sang "ring-a-rosie," "London Bridge is falling down"
Boys and girls together, me and Mamie O'Rourke
Tripped the light fantastic on the sidewalks of New York

That's where Johnny Casey, little Jimmy Crowe
Jakey Krause, the baker, who always had the dough
Pretty Nellie Shannon with a dude as light as cork
She first picked up the waltz step on the sidewalks of New York

Things have changed since those times, some are up in "G"
Others they are wand'rers but they all feel just like me
They'd part with all they've got, could they once more walk
With their best girl and have a twirl on the sidewalks of New York

[Verse 1]
I've been diggin' you for such a long time
You don't even know that I'm alive
Something 'bout the way you walk just really blows my mind
Sorry but I'm sick of all this jive
Ok?

[Chorus]
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

[Verse 2]
Something 'bout your body baby really get me hot
I'm sweating girl and it's all because of you
I don't want your credit cards or anything you got
Feel you up is all I wanna do
What do you say?

[Chorus]
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

[Interlude]
I ain't looking for a one night stand
I only wanna feel you up
I don't really wanna be your man
I only wanna feel you up
Physical attraction babe
It's what it's all about
Hot and cold reaction
Feel you up
Turn you out

Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

[Verse 3]
What's the verdict? I don't like suspense
How can you resist my burning touch?
Something 'bout the way you walk just really blows my mind
I never wanted anything so much
Ok?

[Chorus]
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

[Interlude]
I've been diggin' on you (for such a long time)
I've been diggin' on you (I've been diggin' on you)
(I've been diggin' on you)

[Chorus]
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

[Interlude]
I ain't looking for a one night stand
I only wanna feel you up
I don't really wanna be your man
I only wanna feel you up

Feel you up sugar sugar
Sugar sugar

[Chorus]
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

[Outro]
Let me touch your body baby, come on
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
I wake up and think of her
No matter what I do
She's always on my mind
A time a day or two

Seems to me the things you've loved the most
You always lose
But once you've got them
You've always got the blues

In time, well you may find someone else
That can comfort you
But not someone to light the fire
No, not the way she used to do

You lose the things that made it
What it was when it was new
And once you've got them
You've always got the blues

That new love only can replace
Just so much of you
That leaves a lot that gets lost between
Number one and number two
In time, well you may find someone else
That can comfort you
But not someone to light the fire
No, not the way she used to do

You lose the things that made it
What it was when it was new
And once you've got them
You've always got the blues
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Yeah
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I pick up all the pieces and make an Island
Might even raise a little sand
Yeah

Cause I'm a voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child baby

You better listen when I say

I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back to ya one of these days
Ha ha ha

I said I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back one of these days
Oh yeah
If I don't meet you no more in this world then uh
I'll meet ya on the next one
And don't be late
Don't be late

Cause I'm a voodoo child voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child
Hey hey hey

I'm a voodoo child baby

I don't take no for an answer

Question no
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Heatwaves on the runway
As the wheels set down
He takes his baggage off the carousel
He takes a taxi into town

[Verse 2]
Yellow schools of taxi fishes
Jonah in a ticking whale
Caught up at the lights in the fishnet windows
Of Bloomingdale's

[Chorus 1]
Watching those high fashion girls
Skinny black models with Raven curls
Beauty parlor blondes with credit card eyes
Looking for the chic and the fancy to buy

[Verse 3]
He opens up his suitcase
In the continental suite
And people thirty stories down
Look like colored currents in the street

[Verse 4]
A helicopter lands on the Pan Am roof
Like a dragonfly on a tomb
And business men in button downs
Press into conference rooms

[Chorus 2]
Battalions of paper-minded males
Talking commodities and sales
While at home their paper wives and paper kids
Paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid

[Verse 5]
Yellow checkers for the kitchen
Climbing ivy for the bath
She is lost in House and Gardens
He's caught up in Chief of Staff

[Verse 6]
He drifts off into the memory
Of the way she looked in school
With her body oiled and shining
At the public swimming pool

[Bridge 1]
The more I'm with you, pretty baby
The more I feel my love increase
I'm building all my dreams around you
Our happiness will never cease
'Cause nothing's any good without you
Baby you're my centerpiece

[Bridge 2]
We'll find a house and garden somewhere
Along a country road a piece
A little cottage on the outskirts
Where we can really find release
Cause nothing's any good without you
Baby you're my centerpiece

[Outro]
Shining hair and shining skin
Shining as she reeled him in
To tell him like she did today
Just what he could do with Harry's House
And Harry's take home pay
I never dreamed there could be
A someone made just for me
And I'm letting her have her way
I'm here to see what she has to say
Ah, the poor girl always wins the day
I'm stayin' ahead of the game
And she's a-doin' the same
And the whiskey flyin' into my head
The fiddler's arm has gone dead
And talk is beginning to spread
When did our love go bad
Whatever happened to the best friend that I had
It's been so long since I held you tight
Been so long since we said good night
The taste of tears is bittersweet
When you're near me my heart forgets to beat
You're there every night among the good and the true
And I'll be 'round waiting for you
Well the king of them all is starting to fall
I lost my gal at the boatman's' ball
The night has a thousand hearts and eyes
Hope may vanish, but it never dies
I'll see you tomorrow when freedom rings
I'm gonna stay on top of things
It's the middle of summer and the moon is blue
And I'll be 'round waiting for you
Well, another deal gone down
Another man done gone
You put up with it all
And you carry on
Something holding you back
But you'll come through
I'd bet the world and everything in it on you
Happiness is but a state of mind
Anytime you want you can cross the state line
You don't need to be rich or well to do
I'll be 'round waiting for you
Before I hit the party (baby)
You know i need (what you need man, what you need man, what you need man)
Some coke 45 (baby), and a bag of weed (a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man) chorusx2

Friday night, time to party
Smoke marijuana, drink bacardi
Get drunk and I,before I leave
Put my hand on my wrist, push back my sleeve
Look at the time, i'm on my marijuana watch
Got a big thick girl rubbin on my crotch
My marijuana watch reads, 4ro:20
I'm getting fucked up while i make mo' money
The party don't start till 11:30 (porno time, watch so nerdy)
Thin girl with me got a big ol' butt
Whenever i want i can bust a, what
Jump off in the shower, 30 minutes to an hour
Stop out the shower on a thick white cloth
Big boodie bastray tryin me out

Before I hit the party (baby)
You know i need (what you need man, what you need man, what you need man)
Some coke 45 (baby), and a bag of weed (a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man) chorusx2

I turned on the music to help me pick, something sick
To keep the girls on my dick
Looked in the closet what did i see, hemp suits lookin back at me
Afroman be dressin pimpalicious, and women find me magicly delicious
Turn up the sterio, hit the blut, slick the fo' fo'
Weed, beer, plastic cup, afroman's pre-game warm up
Do it till the liqor and the weed kick in
My sight get blurry and my edge spin
Now i am offially fucked up
Pour the rest of the beer in my styrofoam cup

Before I hit the party (baby)
You know i need (what you need man, what you need man, what you need man)
Some coke 45 (baby), and a bag of weed (a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man) chorusx2
(Chorus)
I always have fun in Washington (Washington)
Dancin from the evening till the moning sun (oww)
It's your northwest partner (eyy) afroman (afroman)
I come back and visit evry chance i can (bucccoc)

Angela from Washington
Washed my dick and balls with her tongue
She liked to walla-walla in Walla Walla
First I make her holler then I make her swalla
I got Jane from Spokane
Hooked on my dick like rock-cocaine

Sleepless in Seattle
Wake 'n bake take my rattle snake
Flylin' in your pussy like a sea hawk
I grab you by the sholders then I hit the sea walk (ugh)
I'm not a dick but I went to Cheney
Pulled out my dick and got some brain
I had a rich girl in Kettle Falls licking on my ghetto balls
Met a fat girl in Kennewick
Pulled out my long black skinny dick
Fine lady cop from Yakima
She had the coffe I had the creamer
(Chorus)
I always have fun in Washington (Washington)
Dancin from the evening till the moning sun (oww)
It's your northwest partner (eyy) afroman (afroman)
I come back and visit evry chance i can (bucccoc)

Got a blowjob in Toppinish just don't stop till' ya finished
Took a ride to the sunny side to the money and ride fro daddy thats right
Processed a girl in the city of Prosser
Come to find out she's a salad tosser (slurpping sound)
Met this girl from Oroville
She gave me oral with oral skill
Met this girl from Omak
We went to the park and we got tore back
Couldn't tell a tale, I had to take a bath in Soap Lake (ugh)
Met this girl in the city of Wheeler
Rode that ass like an 18 wheeler
All the way to Colfax
Bummpin' cold track making cold stacks

(Chorus)2x
I always have fun in Washington (Washington)
Dancin from the evening till the moning sun (oww)
It's your northwest partner (eyy) afroman (afroman)
I come back and visit evry chance i can (bucccoc)
When I was a leaner
I sought truth night and day
I asked our Lord to help me
And he showed me the way

Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain:
That Jesus Christ is born

He made me a watchman
Upon the city wall
And if I am a christian
I am the least of all

Go, tell ...
Watching my life, passing right in front of my eyes
Hell of a story, oh is it boring?
Can’t claim to care, never been reluctant to share
Passing out pieces of me, don’t you know nothing comes free?

What mom don’t know has taken its toll on me
It’s all I’ve seen that can’t be wiped clean
It’s hard to believe what it’s made of me

Passing my life, living it out in her sight
Listening closely, hearing her mostly
Can’t shake concern, seems that every time that I turn
I’m passing out pieces of me, don’t you know nothing comes free?

What mom don’t know has taken its toll on me
It’s all I’ve seen that can’t be wiped clean
It’s hard to believe what it’s made of me
Dry your eyes and take your song out
It's a newborn afternoon
If you can't recall the singer
You can still recall the tune

Dry your eyes and play it slowly
Like you're marching off to war
Sing it like you know he'd want it
Like we sang it once before

From the center of the circle
To the midst of the waving crowd
If it ever be forgotten
Sing it long and sing it loud

Come, dry your eyes

And he taught us more about giving
Than we ever cared to know
But we came to find the secret
And we never let it go
And it was more than being holy
Though it was less than being free
And if you can't recall the reason
Can you hear the people sing

Through the lightning and the thunder
To the dark side of the moon
To that distant calling angel
Who descended much too soon

And come, dry your eyes
Come, dry your eyes
In the morning when the moon is at it's rest
You will see me at the time I love the best
Watching rainbows play on sunlight;
Pools of water iced from cold night,in the morning
'Tis the morning of my life

In the daytime I will meet you as before
You will find me waiting by the ocean floor
Building castles in the shifting sands
In a world that no one understands
In the morning
'Tis the morning of my life

In the morning of my life the
Minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day

In the ev'ning I will fly you to the moon
To the top right hand corner of
The ceiling in my room
Where w'll stay until the sun shines
Another day to swing on clothe's lines
May I be yawning
It is the morning of my life
It is the morning of my life
In the morning
In the morning
In the morning
You got my letter
But you must not read your mail
You got my letter baby
But you must not read your mail
Well I'm a happy man if I can get to you
And I'm a sad man if I fail

Should have known better
Than to leave it to the postal lines
I should have known better baby baby baby
I'm like a man running out of time
Mmm hmmm
I laid my heart out in that envelope
Now I'm laying it on the line mmm hmmm

Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo
Yes I'm laying it on the line mmm hmmm
Ooh hoo hoo hoo
And you could take a big load off of my mind

I hope you're gonna read it now
And give me some kind of sign
Don't take much to read it now
You don't have to read between the lines
And shine a little light on me
And take away this mystery
I need a reason to be here
I need a reason to be
And you're the reason to me
Don't fail me now
Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo hoo hoo

I laid my heart out in that envelope
Now I'm laying it on the line mmm hmmm

I know you're gonna be here
I know you're gonna be here soon
And make it so much better
By the light of the big old moon
Send me some good news
To chase away these yearning blues
You give me reason to be here
You give me reason to be
And you're the reason for me
Don't fail me now baby

Hoo hoo hoo
Woah oh hoo hoo
Hoo hoo hoo
Woah oh hoo hoo

You give me reason to be
You give me reason to be here
I need a reason to be
Oooh hoo

[Intro: Taio Cruz & Pitbull]

Look at them move, Look at them shake
Look at they features, beautiful creatures
And make love to them
On beautiful beaches
I'm ready for the world
But the world ain't ready for me
Patience is a virtue, wait and see
Don't believe? Ay baby

Writer(s): Meredith Wilson

Darling you and I know the reason why a summer sky is blue
And we know why birds in the trees sing melodies too
And why love will grow from the first hello until the last goodbye
So to sweet romance there is but one answer, you and i
I been there - been there
Done that - done that
You got guns? - we got guns...
Yo, I got straps - we got straps...
A million muthafuckas on the planet Earth talk that hard
Bullshit - 'cause it's all they worth...

No question, it's all about the D - O - E
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree
Ain't tryin' to stock around for the Illuminati
Got to buy my own island by the year 2 G...
Since way back I've been collecting my fee
With the 48-tracks and the M - I - C
Got a palace in the Hills overlooking the sea
It's worth 8, but I only paid 5 point 3
Worldwide, got the triple beam, I slide
Listenin' to yo demo in a stretch limo
It's how I ride - cartel style
Full, stacked to the max now
A million-dollar smile, people wonder how
'Dre Day' every day. Trips to Montigo Bay
With more chips than Frito Lay
Flossed jewels in a tire, ain't nuthin' fly
Straight or illegal - it's still the root of all evil...
Coz...
(Chorus) x 2
Young black Rockerfeller. Hell, a swiss and mozarella
Pockets sweller, gettin' money like a bank teller
'Cause a fool and his dough soon split
So when you come across a fool get all that she be gettin'
Ladies, get your paper too
Don't expect for no man to support you
Keep it true
'Cause most brothers are raised to decide for the pesos
My woman is independent, makin' dough by the case loads
I'mma keep buildin'... make it killing
Kick back, relax, and grow old with my millions
That's where it's at. You got drama, I got the gat
But we're both black so I don't wanna lay you flat
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get
Private Jet, 600 coupes that I runs if...
I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet
Spend a mill, no sweat, water the line with my wet...

(Chorus) x 2
This is for the millionaires
Throw a stack in the air and watch brothers start plottin'
Honeys start to stare
'Cause game is money and money is game
And broke brothers make the 45 flame with no shame
Now many people die over these dead green guys
Ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise
It's the root of all evil and sins
Yet and still it makes the world go around
Like my 20-inch rims...
Moolah y'all
Platinum plaques cover my walls
Grindin', diamonds shinin', and without one flaw
Get the cash, the grass, the ass will bounce
Luciano and all amounts, that's all that counts 'cause...
I been there...
And done that...

Been there, done that...
The Aftermath!

[Intro]
Out of all the girls I've loved before
Out of all the stages I've performed on
Out of all of the cities I've been to
I bless the day that I found you

[Verse 1]
I bless the day I found you and that's my word
It's nothing for me out there in those streets
You took my heart and you set it on fire
And now my love forever burns
You keep taking me higher

[Chorus]
I been looking for love
In all the wrong places
And now I finally found
Someone who cares for me
No matter the storm
It was you who helped me face it
And now it's safe to say
That you really care for me

[Verse 2]
Just like the wings
You took me, flew me away, yeah
And now my ground is underneath my feet
This man had nowhere to go
Then you gave me direction
And now the rest of my days
I can't help but give you the praise

[Chorus]
I been looking for love
In all the wrong places
And now I finally found
Someone who cares for me
No matter the storm
It was you who helped me face it
And now it's safe to say
That you really care for me

[Bridge]
You saw my needs, forgave my faults
You cleansed my heart, you changed my thoughts
You brought the sun into my life
When my world had seemed dark, yes you did
And you're the only one
Who was there when I needed a friend
You're the only one who can place joy
When there's pain in my heart

[Chorus]
I been looking for love
In all the wrong places
And now I finally found
Someone who cares for me
No matter the storm
It was you who helped me face it
And now it's safe to say
That you really care for me

I been searching all around yea
Traveling town to town yea
And I could not seem to find someone who cares for me
And it looks like where ever I go trouble would come following me
Am so glad to know it was your grace that set me free
Thank you Jesus

[Verse 1]
Where are you now
Are you in some hotel room, does it have a view?
Are you caught in a crowd
Or holding some honey who came on to you?

[Chorus 1]
Why do you have to be so jive?
Okay, hang up the phone, it hurts
But something survives though it's undermined
I'd still like to see you sometime

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling so good
And my friends all tell me that I'm looking fine
I run in the woods
I spring from the boulders like a mama lion

[Chorus 2]
I'm not ready to change my name again
But you know I'm not after a piece of your fortune and your fame
'Cause I've tasted mine
I'd just like to see you sometime

[Bridge]
Pack your suspenders
I'll come meet your plane
No need to surrender
I just want to see you again

[Verse 3]
We're in for more rain
I could sure use some sunshine on my apple trees
It seems such a shame
We start out so kind and end so heartlessly

[Chorus 3]
I couldn't take them all on then
With a headful of questions and hypes
So when the hopes got so slim, I just resigned
But I'd still like to see you sometime
I'd sure like to see you

[Verse 1]
Frosty the Snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

[Verse 2]
Oh, Frosty the Snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day

[Verse 3]
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

[Verse 4]
Oh, Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

[Verse 5]
Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, "Let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away"

[Verse 6]
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there
All around the square
Saying, "Catch me if you can"

[Verse 7]
He led them down
The streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler "Stop!"

[Verse 8]
Frosty the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying, "Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day"
I'll be, I'll be back again some day
Male Verse
I can't forget the night we met how bright were stars above
That precious memory lingers yet when you declared your love
And then you went away and now each night and day

I wonder why you keep me waiting, Charmaine, my Charmaine
I wonder when bluebirds are mating, will you come back again
I wonder if I keep on praying, will our dreams be the same
I wonder if you ever think of me too ..
I am waiting my Charmaine for you ...

Female Verse
You went away on dreary day I knew you had to go
Mid tears and cheers I heard you say "Charmaine, I love you so"
Tho old years turn to new my heart keeps calling you

"I wonder why you keep me waiting" Charmaine cries in vain
"I wonder when bluebirds are mating, will you come back again
I wonder if I keep on praying, will our dreams by the same
I wonder if you ever think of me too"
Charmaine's waiting, just for you
Baby, here I stand before you with my heart in my hand
I want you greet it mama hopin' that you'll understand
Oh baby, mama please don't dog me around
Well, I'd rather love you baby, than anyone else I know in town

Well, because you're so nice and lovely
And you have such pleasant ways
If you take to your home I'll be there the rest of my days
That's the truth mama
Yes, you know I wouldn't lie
Well, if I don't love you baby
I swear I hope I die

Oh baby, don't you want a man like me?
Yeah baby, don't you want a man like me?
Well, you think only about our future
And forget about your used to be

Well now, this is my confession mama
And I'm thrilled by all your charms
It seems that I'm in heaven when you hold me in your arms
Now baby, you can have me for yourself
Well now, you was meant for me baby
And I don't want nobody else
Oh baby, don't you want a man like me?
Yeah baby, don't you want a man like me?
Well, you think only about our future
And forget about your used to be
Autumn in New York
Why does it seem so inviting
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first-knighting

Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel
They're making me feel
I'm home

It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain

Dreamers with empty hands
They sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Autumn in New York
You'll need no castles in Spain
Lovers that bless the dark
On benches in Central Park

It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

[Intro] 

[B.O.B talking]:
Aye Elpee, I think these motherfuckers forgot where I was from
It's that nigga B.O.B. EZ Elpee is up on the beat. (DJ Scream)

[Chorus]
I'm cruisin' through Decatur tryin' to find some of that 'dro
And I see too many haters cause they can't handle they hoes
I say I can't do no better because this is all I know
Ooooh, all I know, all I know, all I know

[Verse One]
Cause I was raised in the D-E-C
A/aye I'm from Decatur
Where we get high and ride in sky scrapers
Get money now and ride or die later
Get shot and robbed by your own neighbor
When the cops ridin' by, it ain't safer
They'll probably shock ya ass with them tasers
'Round here, we ain't big on education
Niggas droppin' out but be at the graduation
But this cities where I'm glad to be
Rep it to the fullest, don't get mad at me
Niggas steady hatin' but they clap for me
Cause I got to spit it ill like a rap disease
'Fo 'sho, girl I got that mojo
Give it to you so slow
That ain't like them other niggas who be havin' no stroll
And girl I'm layin' it down
Reppin' for my city, what's the name of my town?

[Chorus]
I'm cruisin' through Decatur tryin' to find some of that 'dro
And I see too many haters cause they can't handle they hoes
I say I can't do no better because this is all I know
Ooooh, all I know, all I know, all I know

[Verse Two]:
The east side of the A-T-L
Aye we sit tall
This is the home of slang and shit talk
Gold diggin' hoes don't get no doe
They just get on all fours and get big balls
At night, watch out, the cars get jacked up
And my clothes turn into target practice
Everybody better start haulin' asses
Cause the gas station clerk never saw what happened
Now it's on the news
Now I'm in my school
Niggas chillin' at the water fountain with a tool
'Bout to cut a fool about 3:42
And the po-po waitin' outside for the queue
They put the cuffs on him, and take him downtown
Now they in the penitentiary a juvenile
I ain't talkin' shit, I'm just reppin' for my town
This is for Decatur and this is how I sound

[Chorus]
I'm cruisin' through Decatur tryin' to find some of that 'dro
And I see too many haters cause they can't handle they hoes
I say I can't do no better because this is all I know
Ooooh, all I know, all I know, all I know

[Outro] 

[B.O.B]:
This shit is all I know. Yeah. Born in South Carolina...raised up in Decatur
I'm an '80s baby. I'm kinda cool but the hood kinda made me crazy
You see what I'm sayin'? And this is, and this is, and this is how it go

[Verse 1]
And I met her, at a time when
There were possibilities of being friends
It was just like, home, to a tired man
I found comfort. So sad it had to end

[Chorus]
Thought I found, the perfect place
But I find myself back on the road again
Can't look back, 'cause I see your face
So I find myself back on the road again

[Verse 2]
Thought this time that things would be different
All the while, they seem to only stay the same
You gave me so much to believe in
Girl, this loneliness is driving me insane, oh

[Chorus]
Thought I found, the perfect place
But I find myself back on the road again
Can't look back, 'cause I see your face
So I find myself back on the road again
Thought I found, the perfect place
But I find myself back on the road again
Can't look back, 'cause I see your face
So I find myself back on the road again

[Bridge]
If only I knew what I know now
Both our lives wouldn't feel so wasted
Tryin' to figure out the way how
Live my life again
If only I knew what I know now
Both our lives wouldn't feel so wasted
Tryin' to figure out the way how
Live my life, on the road again

[Chorus]
Thought I found, the perfect place
But I find myself back on the road again
Can't look back, 'cause I see your face
So I find myself back on the road again

[Intro]
Oh yes
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1: Wanya]
You can find them on the cover of a magazine
The finest woman you'll ever see
It would be my fantasy
To have them all surrounding me
All of them in love, it seems
They wanted things that they can only get from me
The best thing about it all, is I can have it if
I only keep dreaming

[Pre-Chorus]
From the shores of Milan to the streets of Miami, beautiful women
From the beauty salons to the beaches in Maui, beautiful women
From the coffee shop to the restaurants can you hear me? (Yes)
Every place, every town if you just look around
You'll find beautiful women

[Chorus]
Black, Puerto Rican, Haitian, Dominican
Beautiful women
Indian, Cuban, Jamaican, all of the nations
Beautiful women
East Coast, West Coast, city to the meadow, 'burbs to the ghetto
Beautiful women
From Cairo, to Rio, to Montego
Beautiful women, yeah

[Verse 2: Shawn]
You know there's no way I could ever be without their sensualities
And every time I think that I break free
It's like they always find me
Everywhere I go, it's like a video
And you know exactly what I mean
If there could only be three more of me
Then I could keep all these beautiful women

[Pre-Chorus]
There they go doin' what they do to
Make a man go crazy but it just ain't fair
'Cause they've got us in a daze
What makes me so amazed
Is that they know it
'Cause they're beautiful, woo, woo, woo

[Interlude: Spanish dialogue]

[Chorus]
Black, Puerto Rican, Haitian, Dominican

[Verse 1]
It's really been weighing on me
Tell me what did I do
To have ya'll hatin on me?
When I don't have nothin' to prove
Sometimes I shake my head
When I'm layin' down in my bed
Thinkin' 'bout the things been said
When you really don't know me yet

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta clear up some things
There have been many things said about me
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconceived
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya
Give it a rest
You must admire me
Spend so much time with me consuming your head

[Chorus]
(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh

[Verse 2]
It's really been weighing on me
I'm not myself lately
I feel a little incomplete
But I'm not gonna lose no sleep
I keep it all in my mind
'Cause it gotta get better in time
Why don't you live your life?
And let me live mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta clear up some things
There have been many things said about me (Said about me)
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconceived (Preconceived)
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya
Give it a rest (Give it a rest)
You must admire me
Spend so much time with me consuming your head

[Chorus]
(And I can't take no more)
(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies
(I can't take no more)
(Hey) No more, no more, no more, ooh

Leave me alone

Just leave me alone

Leave me alone
You're about to believe in love again
I'll take you there and bring you back again
The night is short
Tomorrows are long
Come go with me
While the feeling is strong

Midnight believer
The night believes in you
Midnight believer
The night believes in you

I believe that the night tells us everything
The moves to make with the feel that we bring
You've got the love locked up inside
I've got the touch so there's nothing to hide

Midnight believer
The night believes in you
Midnight believer
The night believes in you
Incidentally there should be some changes made
You've got to work if you should have to save
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
You've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net

Wait a while and straighten out the tie you wear
You've got to take it easy if you dare
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
You've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net

Don't be blind, you've got a thinking mind
Stop the bells that ring so loud
Don't nod your head, you'll draw a crowd
Just think of everything you've worked so hard to bring
The lemon sings my song. He's known it all along

You want a piece of me? (You want a piece of me?)

I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own

But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doin' a thing called Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well, Crocodile Rockin' is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will

Oh, Lawdy Mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was-a out of sight

La la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la
But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans

But they'll never kill the dreams we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought that Crocodile Rock would last

Well, Crocodile Rockin' is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will

Oh, Lawdy Mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was-a out of sight

La la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la

I've been buked and I've been scorned
I've been buked and I've been scorned
Children, I've been buked and I've been scorned
Tryin' to make this journey all alone

You may talk about me sure as you please
Talk about me sure as you please
Children, talk about me sure as you please
Your talk will never drive me down to my knees

Jesus died to set me free
Jesus died to set me free
Children, Jesus died to set me free
Nailed to that cross on Calvary

I've been buked and I've been scorned
I've been buked and I've been scorned
Children, I've been buked and I've been scorned
Tryin' to make this journey all alone
There are dreams that sail away to sea
And some that stay at home
There are dreams in need of company
And some that stand alone
There are dreams that stay inside all day
And never see the light
And if dreams come true
I swear to you
I'll dream of you tonight

In a corner bar the local star
Destroys a passing chord
He sits behind a Mason jar
And dreams of his reward
Then he takes his break
And he counts his take
A dollar buys a beer
A quarter of his life is gone
And what's he doing here

Times are hard
The old backyard is covered in cement
The people seem afraid to dream
And dream don't cost a cent
There are dreams that stay inside all day
And never see the light
And if dreams come true
I swear to you
I'll dream of you tonight
And if dreams come true
I swear to you
I'll dream of you tonight
When I pretend, everything is what I want it to be
I looked exactly like what you always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can't forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can
But I can't pretend that this is the way, it'll stay, I'm just
(Trying to fend the truth)
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be so I'm
(Lying my way from)
You
(No, no turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you is me
I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in
And now you think this person, really is me and I'm
(Trying to fend the truth)
The more I push, the more I'm pulling away, 'cause I'm
(Lying my way from)
You
(No, no turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you, the very worst part of you is me
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me, like this
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me, like this
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me, like this
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me, like this
You
(No turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)

And nobody's falling in love
Everybody here needs a shove
And Nobody's getting any touch
Everybody thinks that it means too much
And nobody's coming undone
Everybody here's afraid of fun
And nobody's getting any play
It's the saddest night out in the U.S.A

[Instrumental]
She left twenty-nine broken hearts
Broken in twenty-nine parts
Now there are twenty-nine fellas complainin' to their moms
About the lady from 29 palms

She got twenty-nine Cadillacs
Twenty-nine sables from Sach's
They came from twenty-nine fellas who never had their arms
Around the lady from 29 palms

She's a yip-yip-yippy-eyed dolly
A new kinda gal of the west
And yip-yip-yippy by-golly
Whatever she does, she does her best
She rides twenty-nine trails to bliss
Knows twenty-nine ways how to kiss
She is a gal that you dream of, you'd love to have your arms
Around the lady from 29 palms

She left twenty-nine broken hearts, baby
Broken in twenty-nine parts were their broken hearts, mmm oy-da doy-da
Twenty-nine fellas complainin' to their moms
About the lady from 29 palms
She got twenty-nine cadillacs, baby
Twenty-nine sables from Sach's and them Cadillacs, mmm boy-da doy-da
Twenty-nine fellas who never had their arms
Around the lady from 29 palms

She's a yippety-yippety-yippety-eye-oh, what a dolly
A bronco that no one can break
And yippety-yippety-yippety-eye-oh, by-golly
She's never giving, but how she takes
She's got twenty-nine diamond rings
Got, got, got 'em without any strings (wow!)
A dynamite dream-boat, a load of atom bombs (who? )
The lady from 29 palms
The lady from 29 palms

[Intro]
Uh uh, mm mm
Say fellas
You ever have one them girls that just... bad?
Nah, I ain't talkin' about fine, I'm talkin' about bad
Cuss all the time, steal, man she rob her own moms
Down at the post office got two pictures
I'm talkin' about one of Bebe's kids, y'all - bad
Hear me?
Oh, she fine too
Fine

[Refrain]
Don't know why, I want that girl
Don't know why, I want that girl

[Verse 1]
'Twas the middle of the summer
Rather late in the day
This pretty thang, she walked up to me
She said she was good to play
She told me to close my eyes, oh
So she could get a kiss
I said, "Sure, honey" and obliged
Girl snatched my medallion and called me a bitch, running!

[Refrain]
Don't know why, I want that girl
Don't know why, I want that girl

[Verse 2]
I found out her place of employment
Dry cleaning: "We do fine"
To manifest a little unenjoyment in her life
Was all that was running through the middle of my mind
There are many elements: wind, fire, water
But none quite like the element of surprise
See my baby, she gave me that medallion
And it, uh, you know, it mean a lot to me
So, so I walked up in that piece with a disguise on
And I said, "Hey!
I don't know what your name or your game is
But you better get your G-hind down on the floor
'Cause you see, I'm in a mood to do something koo-koo to you"
So she gave me that kiss and ran out the back door, ow!

[Refrain]
Don't know why, I want that girl
Don't know why, but I want that girl
Don't know why, I want that girl
Don't know why, but I want that girl

[Verse 3]
Oh, turning around the corner
Thought that she would get by, huh
Much to her surprise
Michael Yardbird dropped both his crutches downstairs
Tripped baby on her backside
Holdin' on the banister, sliding down slow
You know he about to fall down all them stairs, yo
My medallion's on the center line
She dropped my piece in the middle of the street
The taxi cab about to run it down
(Beep beep, oh yeah)
But when the bling-bling caught the driver's eyes
He slammed on his brakes and jumped out his ride
And as he was just about to put his fat neck up in my jewels
(Uhn uhn uhn, nigga!)
Yardbird bounced down the stairs of that house
Crushing the bad girl like the Union Army crushed the Deep South
And when the driver turned his head to get his peek on
I entered at my medallion and broke the other way
Sister was limpin' but she was kinda good to play

[Refrain]
Don't know why, I want that girl
Don't know why, I want that girl
Don't know why, I want that girl
Don't know why, I want that girl
(Don't, man)
(Why)
I saw her through the window today
She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon cafe
I started to keep going
But something made me stop
She used to love me a lot

She looked lonely and I knew the cure
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought I'd walk on in
And I give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot

I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said where have you been it's been awhile
She was glad to see me
I could almost read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe I said good-bye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot
I remember how good it was back then
And I said it's not to late to start again
We could spend a night together
Take up where we left off
She used to love me a lot

Then I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
Yes I'm in need of something
But it's something you ain't got
But I used to love you a lot

I thought she loved me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe she said good-bye
She just left me standing in there, I never been so shocked
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
Hush little baby, don't you cry
You know your mother was born to die
All my trials, Lord, soon be over
Too late my brothers, too late

But never mind
All my trials, Lord soon be over
The river of Jordan is chilly and cold
It chills the body but it warms the soul

All my trials, Lord soon be over
I've got a little book with pages three
And every page spells liberty
All my trials Lord, soon be over

Too late my brothers, too late
But never mind
All my trials, Lord soon be over
If living were a thing that money could buy

You know the rich would live
And the poor would die
All my trials Lord, soon be over
There grows a tree in Paradise
The Christians call it the tree of life
All my trials Lord, soon be over
Too late my brothers, too late
But never mind
All my trials, Lord soon be over
Leave when I ask you to leave, Lucy
Please fall away from me, Lucy
Oh, go, little girl
See that I'm so broken up about you, Lucy
Mean treatin' me and done me harm, Lucy
Been in love with you and your charms, Lucy
Oh, go, little girl

I'm in love with you, Lucy
You got my heart, you got my heart, oh no
You tear me apart, you just won't let me go
You hold on so tight, so tight I just can't breathe
Now Lucy leave, Lucy

Leave when I ask you to leave, little girl
Please fall away from me, little girl
Yeah, go, little girl
See that I'm so broke up about you, Lucy
Yeah, girl

[Verse 1: Paul Williams & (The Temptations)]
Hey, girl, I want you to know
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go
And hey, girl, I tell you no lie
Something deep inside of me is going to die
If you say "So long" (Bye bye)
If this is "Goodbye" (Bye bye)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Bye bye)

[Verse 2: Paul Williams & (The Temptations)]
Hey, girl, this can't be true
How am I supposed to exist without you? (Bye bye)
And hey, girl, now don't put me on
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone? (Bye bye)
How will I live? (Bye bye)
How can I go on? (Bye bye)
How can I go on? (Bye bye)
Hey, girl

[Verse 3: Paul Williams & (The Temptations)]
Hey, girl, now sit yourself down
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground (Bye bye)
And beg you, hey (Bye bye), beg you to stay (Bye bye)
Don't go away (Bye bye)

[Outro: Paul Williams & (The Temptations)]
Hey, girl (Hey girl, hey girl)
No, no, don't go away
Hey, girl (Hey girl, hey girl)
Pretty girl, don't go away
I'm begging you to stay (Hey girl, hey girl)
Little girl, don't go away
Hey, girl (Hey girl, hey girl)
Little girl, don't go away
Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle
And sat on a hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim
My brother's rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head
I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me
Why had I run
And then it come to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead
I hung my head
I hung my head
Here in the court house
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in the chair
Explain to the court room
What went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury
What verdict they find
I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on a hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain
And he'd come to fetch me
To see what they'd done
And we'll ride together
To kingdom come
I prayed for God's mercy
Cause soon I'd be dead
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head

Am I an object in your life that would bring you things, some satisfaction
You put me on the square mile, I'm fascinated fed by delusion

Above me, below me and around attracted
Irredeemably by the void to falling
Falling like a puppet who's heart would awaken
During the fall would wake up, oh shit

Am I an object in your life that would bring you things, some satisfaction
You put me on the square mile, I'm fascinated fed by delusion

Irredeemably by the void to falling
During the fall would wake up, oh shit
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hotspot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They took all the trees, put them in a tree museum
And they charged the people
A dollar and a half just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

I said, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Ah ha ha ha

[Verse 1]
Lady Luck and four leaf clovers
Won't ease this hurt I feel all over
My life was one special occasion
'Til you leavin' left me this situation
(Oh, ho, ho)

[Chorus]
I'm standin' on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standin' on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Waaa!

[Verse 2]
My car got repossessed this morning
Harder times I haven't seen in years
Girl, you better throw me a life preserver
'Cause I'm about to drown in my own tears
(Ah, ha, ah)

[Chorus]
I'm standin' on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standin' on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Ooh, hoo

On shakey ground
Standin', standin', standing on shakey ground, waa!

[Soprano Saxophone Solo]

[Outro]
Got to say it, got to say it, got to say it, got to say it
I'm standin' on shakey ground, woo!
Ever since you put me down, and ah ha
Standin' on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Just 'cause I love my niggas, Ruff Ryders

Get down or lay down
All I wanna hear is, "Right here, my nigga"
We here, nigga
You won't take this from me, baby
You will not take this from me, baby, ya know

My niggas keep niggas on they fuckin' job
My niggas know what it's like when shit gettin' hard
My niggas stay pullin' you other niggas cards
My niggas, it's God, my niggas, we'll shine
My niggas, just knew it was a matter of time
My niggas let me know to keep fuckin' with the rhymes
My niggas ain't no longer livin' with crime

My niggas keep you niggas knockin' on wood
My niggas know how to take it back to the hood
My niggas will put you down right where you stood
My niggas, they could, my niggas, they will
My niggas take you straight to the back an' get ill
My niggas give it straight to the bank when we kill
My niggas put niggas on ice 'til they chill
My niggas is still my niggas is dogs, my niggas
The crowd is waiting for the bullfight
Matador
My final fight the place is packed once more
But Anita won't throw me a rose this fight
The one she wears is not for me tonight

She's watching now with her new love I know
Walk proud and slow
Be strong and sure give the crowd a show
They want blood you know!
You're still their idol as you were before
Kill just one more!
Remind Anita, you're the greatest Matador

The time is come, forget Anita in the stands
Be a tall and strong and brave and noble man
Be better than you've never been before
Make this your greatest moment Matador

She's watching now with her new love I know
Walk proud and slow
Be strong and sure give the crowd a show
They want blood you know!
You're still their idol as you were before
Kill just one more!
Remind Anita, you're the greatest Matador
What are you fucking crazy?
Damn ...
It's getting hard to breathe
I'm trying to make her see
That she do not really know
That I'm trying to find a way
And tell her every day, that she just goes along
So I. ..
I do not wanna be
The only one that knows
That somebody could come along and just
Take her right from me
I'm standing shaking ground
And I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it

Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost
I'm already lost

I wish that I could see
What is making you
Feel that you Should be concerned
My love is like a Gunshot
All It takes is one shot for me to blow it all away
I do not wanna feel like I'm just wasting time
It's gotta be with you and no one else
Do you notice me
I need to know right now
Cause I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it

Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost

Maybe I'm trying too hard
But girl you make me nervous
Should you have by now noticed me
And what will it take it
To a heavenly Because your
Drawing chains and
Driving me insane!
Chorus:
Girl, I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost

A magical thread of joy that joins our hearts together
So happy, together love is better in that soulful old man sunshine
When red is black and petals blue
And in my sleepless head our love's been dead a week or two
Sometimes good times are stuck inside of you
And then they're gone. But I don't know why
A lot of things have changed since you said goodbye

There are reasons for you to love me
But I gave you none
So I tap my glass and nod my chin
And wonder who you've been in rhythm with

Sometimes just time, cars can't escape
When clouds are playing close, not often too far away
Blue has no value, power, or hue
Open skies, relationless
Carelessness is what I miss
And that's how I think of you

Sometimes good times WERE all we HAD to do
So I tap my glass and nod my chin
And wonder who you've been in rhythm with
So I tap my glass and nod my chin
And wonder who you've been in rhythm with
I’m afraid that I’m never afraid
I’ve got combat boots
And I’m American made
For your eyes girl
Mormon lover on a delicate day
Gonna marry the boss
Get carried away
War cries girl
I’m not immune to Canadian snow
Now teach me everything
That I should know
With your eyes girl
Freeze on the radio
I’ve got to leave and more
Freeze on the radio
I’ve got to bleed into snow
Hold on
Let go
We know
Do you shine like a temple inside
Can I open your core
So gentle and wide
Like your eyes girl
Rack ‘em up stretch ‘em out
When they’re tight
This acetylene torch is giving me sight
War cries girl
Black and blue from the hullabaloo
Do the caribou bite
When they look into you
And your eyes girl

[Verse 1]
There is a name that is so precious
A name so wonderful to me
His name is worthy of all praises
Because of Him I am made free

[Chorus]
That name is Jesus
Oh, how I love him
The one who gave His life for me
Because of love that so unconditional
I will have life eternally

[Verse 2]
His name speaks peace unto my storm clouds
This name speaks calm unto my fears
And when I feel that no one loves me
His loving presence is so near

[Chorus]
That name is Jesus
Oh, how I love Him
The one who gave His life for me
Because of love so unconditional
I will have life eternally

[Refrain]
Praise that name
Praise that name
Praise that name
Praise that name

[Verse 3]
Some day I'll leave this earthly dwelling
Through time and space my soul will soar
And finally see the face of Jesus (Face of Jesus)
And praise the name forever more

[Chorus]
That name is Jesus (Jesus)
Oh, how I love him (I love him)
The one who gave (Jesus) His life for me
(His life for me)
Because of love so unconditional
I will have life eternally, oh

[Outro]
(Praise) Righteous is that name
(That name Jesus) Oh, glorious
(Praise) Is that name
(That name Jesus) Oh, wonderful
(Praise) Is that name
(That name Jesus) Praise
(Praise) That name

Oh I like it, baby
I like it, too, baby. Can't have it no other way ...
What can I do to prove it to you that I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do

I was so wrong, right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you?

I know that I made you cry and I'm so sorry dear
So what can I say dear after I say I'm sorry?

Baby I'm so, I'm sorry
Got to prove that I'm so sorry

I made you cry and I'm so sorry dear
What can I say dear, what can I do?
What can I say, what can I do
After I say I'm sorry?
Maybe I'm right and maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless
I'm in love with you

Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
Maybe I'm in for cryin' the blues
But nevertheless
I'm in love with you

Somehow I know at a glance
The terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start
Then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret
Maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless
I'm in love with you

Maybe I'll live a life of regret
And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get
But nevertheless, nevertheless
Nevertheless, I'm in love with you
I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
He said, "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
Whatcha tryin' to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, mean, big and bad, Lord
Pointin' that gun at me
"Oh, wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble wit' chu
And I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you"

"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
For sure
Well, the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son, well it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door

"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
Show me the back door
I Wonder Why it is the sky's so quiet tonight
There's not a cloud in sight
Just burning stars
It seems strange to me, the way the waves obey
The moon that shines above
And draws them to eternity
I Wonder Why it is that you are here with me
I Wonder Why

I Wonder Why it is the sea's so calm tonight
The sands are ghostly white
Beneath the moon
It seems strange to me to stand in endless space
And know that in this place
I'm held within its timeless sway
I Wonder Why it is that you are here with me
I Wonder Why

The wisdom of the world with all its mystery
Is strangely haunting me on this great shore
I know no book can teach, but I can feel tonight
The sky above, the sea below
And you my love
Tonight the world is mine, we're on the edge of time
I Wonder Why
I Wonder Why it is the sky's so quiet tonight
There's not a cloud in sight
Just burning stars
It seems strange to me, that breeze in holy light
We soar in wingless flight
Amidst this vast eternity
Tonight this world of mine is on the edge of time
I Wonder Why
I Wonder Why
I Wonder Why
I Wonder Why

Sand and sea, sea and sand
And the warm bright sun up there above
Summer days, happy days
With my love

Sand and sea, sea and sand
Hear the wings in flight of the lovely dove
Summer nights, happy nights
We were makin' love

The blinking stars are dancing on the whitecaps
Crazy stars, they've had too many nightcaps
I touch your hand, the hand that lies beside me
Paradise can't be far if you'll guide me

Sand and sea, sea and sand
And the angels sing from above
Happy days, hey, happy nights
Makin' love

Sand and sea, sea and sand
And the angels sing from above
Happy days, happy nights
Makin' love
We're in love
Oooh-oooh makin' love

Sand and sea
Sea and sand
How many tears must we cry before learning
Things that we have they're for real and we're losing
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away

Why do you believe that we've got something coming
You took it all, left me standing here with nothing
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away
Too far away

In your world you must be dreaming, if you think you can survive
Taking all and giving nothing that's a crime
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away

All I need is understanding and the right to survive
Only you could see the warnings, and pass them by
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away
Too far away
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away
How many tears must we cry before learning
Things that we had they're for real and we're losing
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away
Too far away, too far away, too far away
Everybody gonna dance tonight

[Verse 1: Shawn Stockman, Nathan Morris]
Lay your head on my pillow
Stay for a while (Don't you go nowhere)
I'm getting hungry for something that only you can provide
I know we met in the club
But that don't mean, that don't mean nothing to me (Oh no no)
You know I know what I'm doing
So listen, listen to it, ooh

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Gonna put some music on
It's gonna make you wanna love me all night long, oh oh

[Outro: Boyz II Men]
Hey, hey, oh oh oh oh ooh yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Just give me a second, darling, to clear my head
Just put down those scissors, baby
On the single bed
The sand in the hour glass is running low
I came through thunder, the cold wind, the rain and the snow
To find you awake by your window sill
A sight for sore eyes, and a view to kill

I broke down in horror at you standing there
The glow from the moon shone through cracks in your hair
I shouted with passion "I love you so much"
But feeling my skin, it was cold to the touch
You whispered "Where are you?"
I questioned your doubt
But soon realized you were talking to God now

But you've got blood your hands and I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low, let's dance like we used to
And there's a light in the distance, waiting for me
I will wait for you
So get off your low, let's kiss like we used to
I looked in the mirror, but something was wrong
I saw you behind, but my reflection was gone
There was smoke in the fireplace as white as the snow
A voice beckoned gently "Now it's time to go"
A requiem played as you begged for forgiveness
"Don't touch me!" I screamed
"I've got unfinished business."

But you've got blood your hands and I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low, let's dance like we used to
And there's a light in the distance, waiting for me
I will wait for you
So get off your low, let's kiss like we used to

But you've got blood your hands and I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low, let's dance like we used to
And there's a light in the distance, waiting for me
I will wait for you
So get off your low, let's kiss like we used to

Lauryn: Hello?
Wyclef: Yo, it's me
Lauryn: Hey, what's going on?
Wyclef: Nothing, i'm here in Haiti
Lauryn: What you doing?
Wyclef: I'm playin with my kid
Lauryn: *laughs*
Wyclef: So, uh...
Lauryn: What's the deal?
Wyclef: I'm here with Pras
Pras: Yeah
Lauryn: Yo, Pras, what's going on?
Pras: I'm here with Wyclef in Haiti
Lauryn: Yeah
Wyclef: Yeah, man
Pras: We playin with my kid
Wyclef: *laughs* Fuck you man!
Pras: Fuck you!
*both laughs*
And I wake up in the morning, with my hair down in my eyes
And she says hi, and I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are going off to school goodbye
And she reaches out and takes my hand
Squeezes it, says, how you feelin' hon?
And I look across at smiling lips that warm my heart and see my morning sun
And if that's not lovin' me, then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
There's no such thing as Dr. Seuss, Disneyland, and Mother Goose’s no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis when the winter comes
There's no such thing as make-believe, puppy dogs, and autumn leaves and B.B. guns
Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
And ask if she could get away and meet me, and grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin' and hurries down to meet me, and I'm always late
But she sits, waiting patiently and smiles when she first sees me
Cause she's made that way and if that's not lovin' me

Then all I've got to say.(chorus)
Don't make me pay for his mistakes, baby
He's the one who did you wrong
Yes, don't make me pay for his mistakes, baby
He's the one who did you wrong

Well, he's the one who gave you six babies
And I'm the one who tried to give them a home, yes I am

I said, I'm tired of you tellin' me baby
About how your man did you wrong
How he used to take your welfare cheque
And leave the kids without home
But I'm the one who's working
I'm the one trying to give them a home

Yes, I'm the one who's gonna love you baby
I'm the one who gonna give them a home
Oh yes I am

I said I don't understand
What make a good woman treat a man so bad
She take a no good man
And give him everything she had
She'll reach back in the cookie jar
And give him every dime
And let the kids run around hungry
Sleepin' and a cryin'
So don't make me pay for his mistakes, baby
He's the one who did you wrong
Yes, he's the one who gave you six babies
And I'm the one who gonna give them a home
Oh yes I am

Yes, he's the one who gave you six babies
And I'm the one tryin' to give them a home
Hold on
Don't make me pay baby
Don't make me pay for his mistakes, baby

He's the one who did you wrong
Laaawwwdddd baby
He's the one
How did I ever let yo slip away
Never knowing, I'd be singing this song someday
And now I'm sinking to rise no more
Ever since you closed the door
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin', you would be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin', you would be mine
Funny, funny how time goes by
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye
Why oh, why oh, why should one have to go on suffering
When everyday, I plead come back to me
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin', you would be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin', you would be mine
And you had enough love for the both of us
But I, I did you wrong, I admit, I did
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin', you would be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin', you would be mine
I'd never hurt you
(If I could turn back)
Never do you wrong
(If I could turn back)
And never leave your side
(If I could turn back)
If I could turn back the hands
There'd be nothing, I wouldn't do for you
(If I could turn back)
Forever honest and true to you
(If I could turn back)
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you
(If I could turn back the hands)
(If I could turn back)
That would be my will
(If I could turn back)
Darlin', I'm begging you to take me by the hands
(If I could turn back the hands)
I'm going down, yes I am
(If I could turn back)
Down on my bended knee, yeah
(If I could turn back)
And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me
(If I could turn back the hands)
(If I could turn back)
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall
(If I could turn back)
Then I'd come to realize how much I love you
Love you, love you, love you
(If I could turn back the hands)
When I first met you, baby
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen
When I first met you, baby
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen
You just left your home then, woman
Ah, the sweetest thing I'd ever seen

But you wouldn't do nothing, baby
You wouldn't do anything I asked to
You wouldn't do nothing for me, baby
You wouldn't do anything I asked to
You know you ran away from your home, baby
And now you wanna run away from old B. too

You know I loved you, baby
I loved you before I could call your name
You know I loved you, baby
Baby I loved you, I love you before I could call your name
Well, it seems like everything I do now baby
Everything I do is in vain
My brother's in Korea, baby
My sister's down in New Orleans
Brother's in Korea baby
My sister's down in New Orleans
You know I'm having so much trouble woman
Baby, I wonder, what in the world is gonna happen to me

You know I love you
And I'll do anything you tell me to
You know I love you
And I'll do anything you tell me to
Well, there ain't nothing in the world, woman
Babe, it ain't nothing
Nothing in the world I wouldn't do it for you

You can treat me mean, baby
But I'll keep on loving you just the same
You can treat me mean baby
But I'll keep on loving you just the same
But one of these days, baby
You're gonna give a lot of money
To hear someone call my name

Yes, sweet sixteen baby... sweet sixteen...
Yes, the sweetest thing baby
The sweetest thing I ever seen
You know I'm having so much trouble, woman
Baby I wonder
Yes I wonder
Baby I wonder
Oh, I wonder what in the world's gonna happen to me

Verse 1
I'm just a telephone call away
You can pick it up and call me any day
And ima listen to all you got to say
Cause I'm the type of man that never turn a woman away
Think of this as an invitation
Your heart to mine in a conversation
So when things get to much to bare like the jackson 5
"i'll be there"
Just call me up on the telephone
Call me up when you're all alone
And I'll give you a verbal massage
Until your man gets home
Or if you want to you know what you could do, well
You could always hop in your car and you could come and ring my bell
Chorus
Ring my bell, ring my bell
(ring my bell, ring my bell)
Ring my bell, ring my bell

Ri-i-ing!!!
Verse 2
I hate to see you cry, tear after tear while this guy
Plays you like your life is a game
I've seen his type and there all the same
Breaking your heart without a care
Girl if I was in you shoes he'd be outta there
Your man is wak good for nothin' but flack
I'd tell him to pack and hit the road jack
Who loves ya baby I do you know
He doesn't care about you let him go
Where he at now? you don't know
Layin' up under some whole double waste
Just let me chill, no need for me to get ill
Cause yo I'm the best and yo time will tell
But I'll be here so ring my bell
Chorus
Verse 3
Now I know this sounds like a fairy tale
But this ain't no children's book
I'm here, for you to take me dear
Just open your eyes and look at what the future holds for you
And if you lunch then you might ruin
Something great don't make a big mistake
Pay attention to what you're doing
Life is full of pitfalls, ups and downs
It's sort of a mission
Now you're on a rocky road
But you could get up just make that decision
That you want the one to love adore you and hold you and treat you well
So when you're ready to be treated that way
Baby you can ring my bell
Chorus
(repeat till fade)
Oh, come on, come over here and meet my happiness
Oh, out she is, meet my happiness
Yeah, she's gonna take care of me an' make me happy
Yeah, from now 'til the lonely years
Yeah, she loves me with her heart and steel of a mind
Yeah, she loves me with her heart, people
With her heart and steel of a mind
I know my love is gonna last, it's just gotta last
Oh no, until the end of time, alright

Oh, there I was just a standin' there
Oh, I say, there I was, people, I was just standin' there
I had no one to love me, I had no one to care

Oh, but she offered, she offered her love to me
Somethin' no one has ever done
Oh, my baby offered her love to me
Somethin' no one has ever done
Yet, I have no regrets now, this is one thing I know
Take it away
Wanna hear you play till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you wanna stay till there's no one else around?

Take it away
Wanna hear you play till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you wanna stay till there's no one else around?

Lonely driver out on the road
With the hundred miles to go
Soul survivor carrying the load
Switches on his radio

Take it away
Wanna hear you play till the lights go down (down, down)
Take it away
Don't you wanna stay till there's no one else around?

Take it away
Wanna hear you play till the lights go down (down, down)
Take it away
Don't you wanna stay till there's no one else around?
In the audience, watching the show
With the paper in his hand (in his hand, in his hand)
Some important impresario
Has a message for the band, oh

Take it away
Wanna hear you play till the lights go down (down, down)
Take it away
Don't you wanna stay till there's no one else around?

You never know who may be listening to ya
(Never know who may be listening to ya)
(You never know who may be listening to ya)

Take it away
Take it away

After hours, late in the bar
By a darkened corner seat
Faded flowers wait in the jar
Till the evening is complete

(Aah, aah)
(Aah, aah)
Sometimes I think I'm gonna lose my mind
But it don't look like I ever do
I loved so many people everywhere I went
Some too much and others not enough
I don't know, I may go down or up or anywhere
But I feel like this scribbling might stay
Maybe if I hadn't of seen so much hard feelings
I might not could have felt other people's
So when you think of me, if and when you do
Just say, well, another man's done gone
Well, another man's done gone
People talkin' but they just don't know
What's in my heart and why I love you so
I love you baby like a minner loves gold
Come on sugar let the good times roll
So, many people live and make believe
That they keep a lot a dough up their sleaves
Well, my love baby isn't the kind that folds
Come on baby let the good times roll
Let the good times roll, oh come on baby
Come on baby and let daddy do you so
Hey yeah, baby let the good times roll
A love is nice, if it's understood
It's even nicer when your feelin' good

Come on sugar let the good times roll
Hey, yeah, let the good times roll
Feel me baby, come on, good times roll
Come on and let me fill your soul
Hey, let the good times roll

Mississippi River so big and wide, blond haired woman on the other side
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
I was working in the lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the mash
He did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash
It caught on in a flash
He did the mash
He did the monster mash

From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They did the mash
It caught on in a flash
They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The zombies were having fun
The party had just begun
The guests included Wolf Man
Dracula and his son

The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, "The Crypt-Kicker Five"

They played the mash
They played the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They played the mash
It caught on in a flash
They played the mash
They played the monster mash

Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist
And said, "Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?"

It's now the mash
It's now the monster mash
The monster mash
And it's a graveyard smash
It's now the mash
It's caught on in a flash
It's now the mash
It's now the monster mash
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my monster mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living, this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you

Then you can mash
Then you can monster mash
The monster mash
And do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash
You'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash
Then you can monster mash

[Verse 1]
Wake me I’m dreaming, is my heart still beating
Cause this life has never felt so good
So hot she’s steaming, with no rhyme or reason
Sexy has never looked so good
Right here right now, this look on your face
I don't want it to fade
So strong I know, this just won't break
Like a diamond

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's let this feeling go on
And on, and on, and on
Going on, and on, and on
Let's let this feeling go on
And on, and on, and on
Going on, and on, and on

[Chorus]
Make it last forever
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Make it last forever
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Make it last forever
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Make it last forever
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Make it last forever

[Verse 2]
Last night we rocked them, tonight we popping
Tomorrow do it all again
This life we living, is just the beginning
Hell yeah, you know there's more to come
Right here right now, this look on your face
I don't want it to fade
So strong I know, this just won't break
Like a diamond

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's let this feeling go on
And on, and on, and on
Going on, and on, and on
Let's let this feeling go on
And on, and on, and on
Going on, and on, and on

[Chorus]
Make it last forever
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Make it last forever
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Make it last forever
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Make it last forever
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Make it last forever

[Bridge]
On, and on, and on, and on
Going on, and on, and on
Let's let this feeling go on
And on, and on, and on
Going on, and on, and on

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Make it last forever
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Make it last forever
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Make it last forever
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Make it last forever

[Verse 1]
Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground
You in mid-air
Send in the clowns

[Verse 2]
Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around
One who can't move
Where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns

[Bridge]
Just when I'd stopped opening doors
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there

[Verse 3]
Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry, my dear
But where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns
Don't bother, they're here

[Verse 4]
Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer
Losing my timing this late
In my career?
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns
Well, maybe next year...
Well Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time
Yeah Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time
I'm thinking something like Olivia is
What I need to find

There's only one man in this world who gets to
Sleep with her by his side
There's only one man in this world who gets to
Sleep with her by his side
I'm thinking something like Olivia could
Keep me through the night

Now I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
No, I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
But if Olivia herself were at my door
I'd have to say I'd let her in
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia

I keep thinking something like Olivia is
What I need to find
Writer(s): B. Lane/R. Freed

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due
I like potato chips, moonlight motor trips, how about you?

I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill
And James Durante's looks give me a thrill

Holding hands in the movie show, when all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it, how about you?
San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
You've scalded me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen 'em die
And long ago I stopped askin' why

San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and have scarred me through and through
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman why can't you understand

San Quentin, what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bent my heart and mind, and you may my soul
Your stone walls turn my blood a little cold

San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And the whole world regret you did no good

San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
Outside the rain begins
And it may never end
So cry no more
On the shore of dream
Will take us out to sea
Forever more, forever more

Close your eyes, ami
And you can be with me
'Neath the waves
Through the caves of ours
Long forgotten now
We're all alone
We're all alone

Close the window
Calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out
Let it all begin
Learn how to pretend
Once a story's told
It can't help but grow old
Roses do, lovers too
So cast your seasons to the wind
And hold me, dear
Oh, hold me, dear

Close the window
Calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out
Let it all begin
All's forgotten now
We're all alone
We're all alone

Close the window
Calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out
Let it all begin

Throw it to the wind, my love
Hold me dear
All's forgotten now, my love
We're all alone

[Verse 1]
To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go

[Verse 2]
To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star

[Verse 3]
This is my quest to follow that star
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
To fight for the right
Without question or pause
To be willing to march
Into hell for a heavenly cause

[Verse 4]
And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest

[Verse 5]
And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star
The fight the unbeatable foe
To dream the impossible dream

[Verse 6]
And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star
To fight the unbeatable foe
To dream the impossible dream
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Back to New Orleans
You know it hurt me so
Baby please don't go

Turn your lamp down low
Turn your lamp down low
Turn your lamp down low
Don't drive me from your door
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't leave

Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Back to New Orleans
You know it hurt me so
Baby please don't go
Turn your lamp down low
Turn your lamp down low
Turn your lamp down low
Don't drive me from your door
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't leave
Baby please don't go

[Intro]
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I always thought
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I will see you again
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I always thought
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I will see you again
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
Now I've seen fire
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I've seen rain
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
Seen sunny days
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I thought would never end
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I always thought
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
Girl, I'll see you
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I always thought

[Verse 1]
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
Now I just can't remember who to send it to

[Chorus]
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

[Refrain]
Girl, I thought that I'd see you
Girl, I thought that I'd see you
Girl, I thought that I'd see you

[Verse 2]
So won't you like down on me, Jesus
You gotta help me make a stand
You just got to see me through another day
My body's achin', and my time is at hand
And I just can't make it any other way

[Chorus]
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you

[Refrain]
Girl, I thought that I'd see you
I thought that I'd see you
I thought I'd see you, babe

[Verse 3]
Walking my mind back to easy times, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
There's hours of time on the telephone line talking about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

[Chorus]
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
Oh, but I always thought that I'd see you again

[Refrain]
Girl, I thought I'd see you, babe
Thought that I'd see you
Thought I'd see you

[Outro]
I always thought
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
Girl, I'd see you again
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I've seen fire
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I've seen rain
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
Seen sunny days
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I thought would never end
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)

[Verse 1]
I am down in the sea of confusion
’Neath the waves of no recovery
Swept away by a distant voice calling
Ain't no use in trying to rescue me

[Chorus]
I am falling
Back into your spell
Back into your cell of no return
No way to rescue me

[Verse 2]
I still see you
Reaching out to take your hold on me
Through a crack in the moon
I believed you
But I know this time there ain't no use

[Chorus]
I am falling
Back into your spell
Back into a cell of no return
No way to rescue me

[Chorus]
Falling
Back into your spell
Back into your cell of no return
No way to rescue me

[Chorus]
I am falling
Back into your spell
Back into your cell of no return
No way to rescue me

[Outro]
Back into your spell
Back into your cell of no return
No way to rescue me
I'll soon become a wreck
They're breathin' on my neck
Dick Haymes, Dick Todd, and Como

They're really coming fast
Who knows I may be passed
By Dick Haymes, Dick Todd, and Como

The fact that girlies scream
They say will cause me grief
But if they ever stop
I'll find that I'm back on relief
It'll mean the end of me
Good news for Tommy D
And Dick Haymes, Dick Todd, and Como

Why should it get their goat
Each time I bend a note
Dick Haymes, Dick Todd, and Como

At my pictures, they throw rocks
They're both at Twentieth Fox
Not Dick Todd, but Dick Haymes, and Como
They say that I need weight
I'm just a mass of joints
I'd like to put on weight
But where the heck can I get points
If at RKO I pout, they look at me and shout
"Dick Haymes, Dick Todd, and Como"

Everytime I sing
I'm compared with Bing
By Dick Haymes, Dick Todd, and Como

Bing's four boys are sublime
But they won't give me time
Dick Haymes, Dick Todd, and Perry
(that's the other guy's first name)

I'll never sing like Bing
I know I don't compare
I'll grant them he's got voice
If they'll grant me, that I've got hair

But then why all this fuss
There's room for all of us
Dick Haymes, Dick Todd, and Como
There's just one Crosby
There's room for all of us
I hear music when I look at you;
A beautiful theme of ev'ry
Dream I ever knew
Down deep in my heart I hear it play
I feel it start, then melt away

I hear music when I touch your hand;
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me
Why can't I let it go
Why can't I let you know
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring
The music is sweet
The words are true -
The song is you
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons, in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know I could not leave her there

I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know I could not leave her there

Ten years the waves roll the ships home from the sea
Thinkin' well how it may blow in all good company
If I tell another what your own lips told to me
Let me lay 'neath the roses, and my eyes no longer see

I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know I could not leave her there

One pane of glass in the window
No one is complaining, no, come in and shut the door
Faded is the crimson from the ribbons that she wore
And it's strange how no one comes round any more
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know I could not leave her there

Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons, in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know I could not leave her there

[Verse 1]
I wanna live alone
Because the greatest love is always ruined by the bickering
The argument of living
I wanna live alone
I could be happy on my own
Spend test of my life
With the vaguest of feeling
I...

[Chorus]
Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You'll know that I'll be here
I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You'll know that I'll be here
I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

[Verse 2]
So I'm gonna live alone
I'm not saying that our love is the greatest
But I'm in love with you
Wanna stay in love with you

So I'm gonna live alone
Yeah, I'll be happy on my own
For the rest of a life
With the vaguest of feeling
I...

[Chorus]
Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You'll know that I'll be here
I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

[Bridge]
In New York City
When I get in the taxi
I said, "man" to driver
He said, "man,"
"Oh, I can imagine having drink with that guy,"
He's alright
Oh, he's alright
He's alright
Yeah, he's alright
He's alright

[Chorus]
Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here
I'll be here
Wishing I could be there
Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

I want to live alone
So I'll never be alone
(repeated)

[Verse 1]
It's a new day and I feel good
If I wanna spread my wings, I know that I could
I got a feeling that tonight begins
A healing where we all win

[Chorus]
I can see the fireworks, I can see the fireworks
I can see the firewooorks
I can see the fireworks, I can see the fireworks
I can see the firewooorks

[Post-Chorus]
Laa da diee jam nam nahh
Awie jam nam nahh
Awie jam nam nah
Ohweyooo

[Verse 2]
I feel emotions deep inside my bones
Like an ocean when the wave gets strong
I feel today is my victory
I gotta get out there and make history

[Chorus]
I can see the fireworks, I can see the fireworks
I can see the firewooorks (said it looks like I can see them)
I can see the fireworks, I can see the fireworks
I can see the firewooorks

[Post-Chorus]
Laa da wiee jam nam nahh
Awie jam nam nahh
Awie jam nam nah
Ohweyooo

[Verse 3]
I had a vision, it was real to me
Like a new song and my heart that sings
Just like the striking of a lightning ball
I feel the power of a miracle

[Chorus]
I can see the fireworks (oohw), I can see the fireworks (fireworks)
I can see the firewooorks (said it looks like I can see them)
I can see the fireworks, I can see the fireworks
I can see the firewooorks (fireworks, fireworks, fireworks)

[Bridge]
Said the sky is glowing
With peace love and harmony
These days is runnin with joy
'Cause there's been a victoryyyy

[Chorus]
I can see the fireworks, I can see the fireworks
I can see the firewooorks (said it looks like I can see them)
I can see the fireworks, I can see the fireworks
I can see the firewooorks
(Across the sky, over the water, throughout the city)

I can see the fireworks (hey), I can see the fireworks
(I can see the fireworks), I can see the firewooorks
(Ooh, like a rainbow)
I can see the fireworks (bursting in the sky)
I can see the fireworks (like a high beam cloud)
I can see the firewooorks (raining down over the town)

[Outro]
Laa da diee jam nam nahh
Awie jam nam nahh
Awie jam nam nah
Ohweyooo

Laa da diee jam nam nahh
Awie jam nam nahh
Awie jam nam nah
Ohweyooo
Turn, and turn again
Turn, and turn again

I shake
And stare the sun
'Till my eyes burn

I shake
At the mothers
Brutal vermin

I shake
And stare
At the watery moon

With the same desire
As the sober philistine

Turn and turn again

Worm, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again
The screw
Is a tightening atrocity

I shake
For the reeking flesh
Is as romantic as hell

The need
To have seen it all
The voyeur
Of utter destruction
As beauty
I shake

Turn and turn again

I shake
Turn and turn again
I shake

I shake
I shake

Research has pierced
All extremes of my sex

Needle point life
Blinds the will to be next

[Verse 1]
Every time I think of you
The woman all my life been waiting
There's nothing that I'd rather do
Than love you endlessly
Don't know what you see in me
Girl you bring out the best in me
And I realize when I look in your eyes
There's nothing that I can do

[Chorus]
Catch me I'm fallin'
Head over heels in love with you
Hopelessly fallin'
And no one can do
Catch me I'm fallin'
And my heart is like brand new
I'm falling in love, falling in love
With you

[Verse 2]
Every time I see your face
Its like sunshine on a cloudy day
It's a feeling that can't be replaced
Like the feeling when we embrace
Out of everything that you do to me
For your love I'll do almost everything
And I realize when I look in your eyes
There's nothing that I cannot do

[Chorus]
Catch me I'm fallin'
Head over heels in love with you
Hopelessly fallin'
And no one can do
Catch me I'm fallin'
And my heart is like brand new
I'm falling in love, falling in love
With you

[Bridge]
Now tell me how much you love me
And show me how much you need
I'm waiting right here for you
Whenever you need

[Outro]
I'm fallin', fallin', fallin' in love with you
I'm fallin', fallin', fallin' in love with you
I'm fallin', fallin', fallin' in love with you
Well, i need you
Through the night
When morning comes
I love the light
But in the night-time
That dark is black
Come on baby
You got to help me get back

I love you, oh yeah
I really love you, oh yeah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Do one thing
Do one thing for me
If you've got love
Then let me see

If you feel it in your heart
Then show it right now
You know i love you baby
I gotta get to you, get to you somehow
Oh yeah, i really love you
Oh yeah, i really love you
You know it's true

I really love you
Day and night
Yeah, i really love you
In the morning light
I really love you
Sure be right
Come on little baby
Gotta find out somehow

Yeah, yeah, really love you
Oh yeah, really love you

I love the things
You say and do
I can't get over
How much i love you

You know you do something
Special to me
And that's the way
I want it always to be, yeah
Oh yeah, i really love you
Oh yeah, i really love you

I need your love
Like a bear needs a break

I need your heart, baby
Hopping on a plate

I need the sunshine
Of your smile
Help me walk
Help me walk that extra mile

Little baby, i love you
Oh yeah, you know i really love you
Oh yeah, you know it's true
Oh yeah, i love you

I love you
Make believe your on a boat with no water around
Picture yourself at a circus, without any clowns
Pretend that you're on a highway, without any end

Then empty the ashtray
Sweep up the floor
Put a lock on your door
If somebody calls in the morning
Just say we don't live here no more

Draw me a picture of an island without any seas
Show me a map of the whole world without boundaries
Build me a home without windows or doors to go in

Then empty the ashtray
Sweep up the floor
Put a lock on your door
If somebody calls in the morning
Just say we don't live here no more

Dream of a time when the tides ebbing now rise again
Then you will know that to die is not really to end
Living and dieing are both your most intimate friends
So empty the ashtray
Sweep up the floor
Put a lock on your door
If somebody calls in the morning
Just say we don't live here no more

If somebody calls in the morning
Just say we don't live here no more
I got the call today, I didn't wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore
These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
... People filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age
The trust and self-assurance that can lead to happiness
They're the very things we kill, I guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
Doesn't keep me warm

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you, Baby
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I figured out, I have to learn again
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

There are people in your life who've come and gone
They let you down and hurt your pride
Better put it all behind you; life goes on
You keep carrin' that anger, it'll eat you inside
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So I'm thinkin' about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore
That mean ole, mean ole Frisco
And that long train, the Santa Fe
That mean ole, mean ole Frisco
And that long train, the Santa Fe
Yes, they've taken my baby away
And they blew back after me

I ain't got no, I ain't got nobody here
I ain't got no, I ain't got nobody here
Well, if I don't hear from her soon
I think I'll leave myself

Oh, I wonder
Do she ever think of me?
Yes, I wonder
Do my baby think of me?
Well, she should be worried
And should hurry back home to me

Well, if you see my baby
Tell her I need her bad
Oh, if you see my baby
Tell her I need her bad
Well, since she left me
Seems I've lost every friend I have
I've been tryin' not to worry
And tryin' to do the best I can
I've been tryin' not to worry
And tryin' to do the best I can
But now since she's gone
I'm a lonely lonely man
The worst that I've ever been hurt in my life
The first time I ever have wanted to die
Was the night when you told me you loved someone else
And you asked me if I could forget

When I stop dreaming that's when I'll stop loving you
You may teach the flowers to bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble and teach it to grow
You may teach all the raindrops to return to the cloud
But you can't teach my heart to forget

When I stop dreaming that's when I'll stop loving you

DJ, turn it up {looped}
Let's go

3121

Bring mommy, she's local, right

3121, come on

Through the gates, knock on the door
Put your clothes in the pile on the floor
Take your pick from the Japanese robes and sandals
Drink champagne from a glass with chocolate handles

Don't U wanna come? 3121
Gonna be so much fun - 3121
That's where the party be - 3121
U can come if U want 2, but U can never leave!
Look over there (look over there), there's another turn on
Butterflies scared that they're gonna be awake all night long (All night long)
Dancing in your belly like a ballerina
In spite of your efforts 2 calm them down

Don't U wanna come? 3121
It's gonna be so much fun - 3121
That's where the party be - 3121
U can come if U want 2, but U can never leave!

House party, y'all
It's going down people, like the wall of Berlin

Lock the door (lock the door) till U see the sun (Till U see it)
We gon' party like there ain't gon' be another 1
Futuristic fantasy
This is where the purple party people be, yeah

This is where the party be - 3121 {x2}

Breakdown
Guitar!
(3121 (3121)) {distorted vocals}

Don't U wanna come? 3121
It's gonna be so much fun (Yes it is) - 3121
That's where the party be - 3121
U can come if U want 2, but y'all can't never leave! (Not ever!)
It's going down y'all, like the wall of Berlin {looped}
Without a song, the day would never end
Without a song, the road would never have been
When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend
Without a song

That field of corn, would never see a plow
That field of corn, would be deserted now
A man is born, but he's no good no how
Without a song

I've got my trouble and woe, but sure as I know
The Jordan will roll
I'll get along, as long as a song
Is strung in my soul

I'll never know, what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know, what makes the grass so tall
I only know, there ain't no love at all
Without a song
I could have married Imogene, or Josephine or Mame
And I could have married Sally Lou, or let's see, what's her name?
But I thought and thought and thought and thought and now my heart's at rest
'Cause I have sixed out to a vent, and you can have the rest

I got a gal I love in North and South Dakota
There ain't no difference in my love, not one iota
I guess that two gals puts me one above the quota
Still I get a gal in North and South Dakota
Oooo, oooo, wish I knew which of my true loves is true
I got a gal I love in North and South Dakota
There ain't no difference in my love, not one iota
Just wait till they hear about the gal in Minnesota
It's a situation, partner, that vexes
Guess I go back to the gal I love in Texas

I guess I've even lost that gal in Minnesota
It's a situation, partner, that vexes
If I had the nerve I could go back to Texas
Oooo, oooo, guess I'll go back to the gal I love in Texas
Hey, Pedro, hold it on!
The coldest of monsters erupted in a dance
Repulsive depiction I will learn to regard
In a dance it came up
Bloody beast from the id
Understand give a hand
Potpourri
Come to me

It’s a painful effort to remember these things
Fill me up so that I almost choke
Each memory is a mixture of excrement and honey
Tell me why tell me why tell me why
Mmm, why can't we live together?
Tell me why tell me why
Mmm, why can't we live together?

Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we be together?
No more war, no more war, no more war
Mmm, just a little peace
No more war, no more war
All we want is some peace in this world

Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we be together?

No matter, no matter what color
Mmm, you are still my brother
I said no matter, no matter what color
Mmm, you are still my brother

Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we be together?
Everybody wants to live
Everybody's got to be together
Everybody wants to live
Everybody's got to be together

Everybody's got to be together
Everybody wants to be together

I said no matter, no matter what color
Mmm, you are still my brother
I said no matter, no matter what color
You are still my brother

Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we be together?
Gotta live together
Together!

(not Frank's version, this is the traditional)
On the (first) day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Twelve lords leaping, Eleven ladies dancing, Ten pipers piping
Nine drummers drumming, Eight maids milking, Seven swans swimming
Six geese laying, Five gold rings
Four calling birds, Three french hens, Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

(this is Frank's version)
On the (first) day of Christmas, we gave our loving dad (my children gave to me)
Twelve dozen kisses, Eleven jars of jelly, Ten silken (linen) hankies
Nine games of scrabble, Eight pairs of cufflinks, Seven books of fiction
Six woolen nightshirts, Five ivory combs
Four meerschaum pipes, Three golf clubs, Two silken scarfs
And a most lovely lavender tie

[Verse: Mike Shinoda]
Looked in the ocean, looked in the sea
Found her often watching for me
Left the door open, left the door wide
And she often kept it inside, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And if you're badder than fact phone z
Phend it back to me
Sitting front pitter badder than b
Even badder than phint to phone badder
Than the patter in friends
Who gutter the prat
The friday on the patter you plumped
You're getting thrown even badder than bomb
Don't trust
If you don't, then your fighting for what?

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
We're fighting for a place we can call home
Looking for a way not to be alone
We're fighting for a place we can call home
Looking for a way not to be alone
Not to be alone

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Da na na, da na-na, na na, na-na, na na na na

We're fighting for a place we can call home
Looking for a way not to be alone
We're fighting for a place we can call home
Looking for a way not to be alone
Not to be alone
Well, my head's in misery
My heart's in a sling
I'm a walking Doctor Bill
People, my whole life is full of pain
Yes, I need my baby
People, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind

Well, I walked my bedroom floor
Hung down my head and cried
I didn't exactly have the blues
I just want satisfied
Yes, I need my baby
People, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind

Well, I can't sleep sound at night
I just cat-nap through the day
I can't hold out much lounger
People, livin' this-a-way, yeah!
Yes, I need my baby
People, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind
I'm gonna leave here walkin' buddy
With my clothes in my hand

Before she gets her another man, yes!
Yes, I need my baby
People, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind

She's a fine lookin' woman
Her shape is a dream
She's the lovin'-est female
People, I've ever seen, yes!
Yes, I need my baby
People, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind
Do you really want
To love someone
Who does not love you

Do you really want
To stab your
Enemy in the back

Stab him in front

I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry
I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry
I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry
I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry

I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry
I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry
I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry
Do you want to be the offshoot of delusion
Do you think they'll mind your decision

I'm sorry
I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry
I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry
I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry

Do you feel you owe the errant foe
Anything at all

I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry
I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry
I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry

Do you want to be the offshoot of delusion
Give in to resignation

I'm sorry
I won't, I won't, I won't, I'm sorry
I won't, I won't, I won't, I'm sorry
I won't, I won't, I won't, I'm sorry

Do you feel you owe the errant foe
Anything at all
I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry
I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry
I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry
A small Cafe Mam'selle, our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet, and so were you Mam'selle
And as the night danced by, a kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle just like wine does

No heart ever yearned the way that mine does for you
And yet I know too well someday you'll say goodbye
Then violins will cry, and so will I Mam'selle
Where is the one
Who'll end the search I'm making
Where is the one
Who'll change my dream to waking
Behind some far off secret door
There's my love
There's my life
In store
The journey's long
Much longer than I reckoned
In any throng
I'll know her in a second
Some lucky day
I'm bound to find her
And when I do
I'll find love
The journey's long
Much longer than I reckoned
In any throng
I'll know her in a second
Some lucky day
I'm bound to find her
And when I do
I'll find love

[Verse 1]
No matter what people say
I'm gonna do it my way
I'm strong enough and alive, I know that I can survive

Won't take advise that you give
I've got my own life to live
I'll make it right to the rain, and be winner of the game (We're all winners of the game)

[Chorus]
Winners of the game
Winners of the game

Winners of the game
I'll fight for glory
One life, one destiny
Winners of the game
We've got one story
One life to be

Winners of the, winners of the, winners of the game

[Verse 2]
You push to be what you see
All magazines and TV
He's in his heart as it seems if you just follow your dreams

Is it a truth or a lie?
To work and sleep till you die
Wanted still all be the same
And be winners of the game (We're all winners of the game)

[Chorus]
Winners of the game
I'll fight for glory
One life, one destiny
Winners of the game
We've got one story
One life to be

Winners of the game
I'll fight for glory
One life, one destiny
Winners of the game
We've got one story
One life to be

Winners of the, winners of the, winners of the game
This must be heaven, tonight I cross the line
You must be the angel, I though I might never find
Was it you I heard singing, Oh while I was chasin' dreams
Driven by the wind, like the dust that blows around
And the rain fallin' down, but I never know
Got to be heaven, cause here's where the rainbow ends
If this ain't the real thing, then it's close enough to pretend
When that wind blows, when the night's about to fall
You can hear the silence call, it's a certain sort of sound
Like the rain fallin' down

Holes in what's left of my reason, holes in the knees of my blues
Odds against me been increasin', but I'll pull through
I never could read no road map, I don't know what the weather might do
But when that rich wind whines and I see the dark star shine
I got a feeling there's no time to lose, no time to lose

Never know now, just don't never know, no
Well it's been heaven, but even the rainbows will end
Now my sails are fillin' and the wind is willin'
And I'm as good as gone again
I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance
Just a Saint of Circumstance, just a tiger in a trance
And the rain fallin' down, well, you never know, just don't know
Listen, sure don't know what I going for, but I'm gonna go for it for sure...
When I was a child, my family would travel
Down to western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my mem'ries are worn

And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry, my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

Well sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry, my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

And the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man
And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry, my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry, my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

I heard it in the wind last night
It sounded like applause
Did you get a round resounding for you
Way up here
It seems like many dim years ago
Since I heard that face to face
Or seen you face to face
Though tonight I can feel you here
I get these notes
On butterflies and lilac sprays
From girls who just have to tell me
They saw you somewhere

In some office sits a poet
And he trembles as he sings
And he asks some guy
To circulate his soul around
On your mark red ribbon runner
The caressing rev of motors
Finely tuned like fancy women
In thirties evening gowns
Up the charts
Off to the airport
Your name's in the news
Everything's first class
The lights go down
And it's just you up there
Getting them to feel like that
Remember the days when you used to sit
And make up your tunes for love
And pour your simple sorrow
To the soundhole and your knee
And now you're seen
On giant screens
And at parties for the press
And for people who have slices of you
From the company
They toss around your latest golden egg
Speculation well who's to know
If the next one in the nest
Will glitter for them so

I guess I seem ungrateful
With my teeth sunk in the hand
That brings me things
I really can't give up just yet
Now I sit up here the critic
And they introduce some band
But they seem so much confetti
Looking at them on my TV set
Oh the power and the glory
Just when you're getting a taste for worship
They start bringing out the hammers
And the boards
And the nails
I heard it in the wind last night
It sounded like applause
Chilly now
End of summer
No more shiny hot nights
It was just the arbutus rustling
And the bumping of the logs
And the moon swept down black water
Like an empty spotlight
Clearing skies and drying eyes, now I see your smile
Darkness goes and softness shows a changing style
Just in time, words that rhyme, well bless your soul
Now I'll fill your hands with kisses and a Tootsie Roll
Reality, it's not for me and it makes me laugh
But fantasy world and Disney Girls, I'm coming back

Patti Page and summer days on old Cape Cod
Happy times and making wine in my garage
Country shade and lemonade, guess I'm slowing down
It's a turn-back world with a local girl in a smaller town
Open cars, and clearer stars, that's what I lack
But fantasy world and Disney Girls, I'm coming back

Mom, hi, Rick and Dave, hi, Pop, well good morning, Mom!
Love, get up! Guess what? I'm in love with a girl I found
She's really swell cause she likes church bingo chances and old time dances

All my life I spent the nights with dreams of you
The warmth I missed for the things I wished are coming true
I got my love to give and a place to live, guess I'm gonna stay
It'd be a peaceful life with a forever wife and a kid some day
It's early nights and pillow fights and your soft laugh
But fantasy world and Disney Girls, I'm coming back
Oo oo oo
Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year
Oo-oo

Well a way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
There's a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year working out on his sled

It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)

Just a little bob sleighed we call it old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas man just watch her peel

It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
Run run reindeer
Run run reindeer (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Run run reindeer
Run run reindeer
He don't miss no-one
And haulin' through the snow at a frightenin' speed
With a half a dozen deer with the a-rudy to lead
He's gotta wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every pad with a little surprise

It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
Oo oo oo
Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year, oo
Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year, oo
Well I've heard lots of people say
They're gonna settle down
You don't see their faces
And they don't come around
Well I'm not that way
I got to move along

I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight
You got that right
Said, you got that right
Sure got that right

Seems so long I been out on my own
Travel light and I'm always alone
Guess I was born with a travellin' bone
When my times up, I'll hold my own
You won't find me in an old folks home
You got that right
Well you got that right
Said, you got that right
Sure got that right
I tried everything in my life
Things I like I try 'em twice
You got that right
Sure got that right
Travellin' around the world, just singing my song
I got to go, Lord I can't stay long
Here comes that ol' travellin' jones once again
I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight
You got that right
Said, you got that right
Well you got that right
Sure got that right
I got real bored on a Friday night
I couldn't find a damn thing 2 do
So I pulled out a suit
About the same color as my BMW
I drove 2 the party and I pimped on in
Just 2 see what I could see
Everybody knew what I was lookin' 4
I was lookin' 4 some company

I saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar
She looked kinda all alone
So I pimped on over and I asked her name
The child was bad 2 the bone
I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek
The only kind of rap it takes
She knew I was bad when I pulled out a leash
She said, "How much money U make?"

Jerk it, jerk it
Talkin' about the jerk out
Jerk it, jerk it
Talkin' about the jerk out
I took her 2 my crib and I tied her up
I figured that's what she liked
Maybe I was wrong but what the hell
It didn't matter 2 me - she was white
I said "How come people in your neighborhood
Don't like it when a brother's rich?
Ain't my blood the same color as yours?
Answer that question, bitch!"

It just pisses U off 2 see me drivin' that fancy car, don't it?
Bet U'd rather see me drivin' one of those (ester grate ones)
Like the one your daddy drives, wouldn't U?
Let me tell U one thing - that's dead!
About as dead as U'll be if U don't rearrange your brain
Catch my drift?
Turn it up!

Oh, nasty me!

Girl, U think U wanna turn it up?
Where's my checkbook?
That's right, check it out
An awful lot of O's, wouldn't U say? (Mm hmm!)

Hit it
Cross over, uh!
(Ooh, (thunder)) {x2}

Turn it up

Jerk out - Jerkin' everything in sight
Jerk out - Got 2 make some love 2night

Jerk out
Don't cha all just hate it when we walk into y'all's joint
And just jerk out everything in sight?
Don't it make U mad? (Jerk out) {x2}
It'd make me mad!

Everybody in the house say "Jerk out" (Jerk out)
"Ow!" (Ow!)
Say "Jerk out" (Jerk out)
"Ow!" (Ow!)
Everybody say "Jerk out" (Jerk out)
"Ow!" (Ow!)
Everybody say "Jerk out" (Jerk out)
"Ow!" (Ow!)

People, let me turn it up
Which coat should I wear 2night?
If U think I'm vain, U're right
Look out, somebody say "Vanity" (Vanity)
Jerk out (Jerk out) {x8}
Ow! (Ow!) {x2}

Everybody jerk out and do it right
I'm talkin' 'bout the jerk out
Oh Lord, hey yeah
Got 2 make some love 2 night

I'm master of the jerk out
Jerkin' everything in sight
I'm talkin' 'bout the jerk out, Lord yeah
Got 2 make some love 2 night

Turn it up, uh
Jerk out, yeah

Wait a minute, talkin' 'bout the jerk out
Woah, yeah, yeah, jerkin' everything in sight
Jerk out, yeah
Jerkin' everything in sight
I'm talkin' 'bout the jerk out, woah yeah
Gots 2 make...
I got 2 make a little love 2 night, jerk out!
Go ahead and ask me, you know that I don't lie
But I've found another woman who's caught my eye
But I wasn't lookin' for someone new
But then you weren't around when I needed you

So look what I've got to come home to
She don't mistreat me like you used to do
Just look what I've got to come home to
If you treated me right I'd be comin' home to you

You never did nothin' to make me stay
Now you wanna know why you throw'd me away
I'll give you a reason, it's easy to see
When I was around, you didn't have time for me

Look what I've got to come home to
She don't mistreat me like you used to do
Just look what I've got to come home to
If you treated me right I'd be comin' home to you

Yeah, look what I've got
Take a look what I've got
Look what I've got to come home to
It's too late now for you and me
To be the same as we used to be
You've had your chance, we've tried to make it again
But now you walked out and she's walked in

So look what I've got to come home to
You never loved me like this little girl tries to do
Look what I've got to come home to
If you treated me right I'd be comin' home to you

Hey, look what I've got
Look what I've got
Take a look what I've got
Look what I've got
Take a look what I've got myself

Look what I've got
Take a look at myself
Take a look at me
Take a look at myself
Look what I've got
Everybody's got the dancin' fever
Everbody'd love to rock and roll
Play it loud and baby play it better
Funky music gotta stretch your soul

Just relax and let the rhythm take you
Don't you be afraid to lose control
If your heart has found some empty spaces
Dancin's just a thing to make you whole

I am one who dances with the mountains
I am one who dances with the wind
I am one who dances on the ocean
My partner's more than pieces more than friends

Were you there the night they lost the lightning
Were you there the day the earth stood still
Did you see the famous and the fighting
Did you hear the prophet tell his tale

We are one when dancing with the mountains
We are one when singing in the wind
We are one when thinking of each other
More than partners much more than pieces more than friends
Two
One, two, three

Hey baby, won't you take a chance?
Say that you'll let me have this dance

Let's dance, come on, let's dance
Do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
Come on, come on, let's dance

Hey baby, woh, you thrill me so
Hold me tight, don't let me go

Hey hey, hey, come on, let's dance
Do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
Come on, hey, come on, let's twist, alright

Hey, baby, if you're all alone
Maybe you'll let me walk you home
Hey, hey, come on, let's dance
Do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
Come on, hey, come on, let's dance

Hey, baby, things are swinging right
Yes, I know that tonight's the night

Come on, hey, come on, let's dance, oh
Do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old thing that you wanna do
Come on, oh come on, let's dance

Hey, let's dance, come on, let's dance
Come on, hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
Come on, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 1]
Saw you standin' over by the wall
Lookin' like you havin' no fun at all
If you want me and you have The Ball
Just give me your number baby, I'll give you a call

[Chorus]
Hey baby, can I talk to you?
Can I walk with you?
Can I stay with you?
Can I play with you tonight?

[Interlude]
No!
Lord, I wanna play with you
No!
Can I play with you?

[Verse 2]
I noticed that you were not havin' fun
Maybe it's because you ain't talkin' to anyone
Just give me a sign, pretty mama, and I'll be your number one
You and I creep to my house and then we'll take off everything

[Chorus]
Hey baby, can I talk to you?
Can I walk with you?
Can I stay with you?
Can I play with you tonight?

[Breakdown]
No!
Shh
Can I play with you, mama?
Pretty mama
No! No!
I can tell you never really understood
The difference between bad and good
I can turn you out girl, you know I could
Let me talk, let me talk, let me talk, can I talk to you?
Oww!
I wanna play with you
Lemme talk, lemme talk, lemme talk to you, mama

[Chorus]
Hey baby, can I talk to you?
Can I walk with you?
Can I stay with you?
Can I play with you tonight?

[Breakdown]
I wanna play with you
Let me talk, let me talk, let me talk to you now
No
Girl, can I play with you?

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Lookie here
In times of desire, baby, you could light me up
Fuck me anyway you want to, I could sober up
Pounding in your lonely home, brother gonna rock the house
Tie one hand behind your back, make you scream and shout
Get up on the dance floor, we'll go round and round
Love yo ur body all the way up, all the way down
Baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah, can I play with you, mama?
Yeah!
Oooh Lord
No!
Well, I bought me a guitar, put it in tune
Went out there the month of June
'Twas a hot dog night and a stick in a roar
Everybody was a-down on this side
There was a holy cow (holy cow)
Mean cow (mean cow)
Double jaw (double jaw)
Cow (cow)

Well, I'll tell you a story about how to become
An all American boy, you can beat on a drum
Beat on a drum from five to six
You'll be rock 'n' rollin' soon gettin' your kicks
It's a good job (good job)
Join the band (gigging in the band)
Bring your hand (pick your hand)

Clean your hand and come up tight
Roll a smoke and down at night
Hold on a train, on a whiskey jar
Settle it down there you are
Hold it steady
Pick it up now
Now hit it (makin' the girls giggle)
Yes, you'll be makin' 'em little girlies giggle
You'll be makin' 'em all just jump up an' down an' wiggle
Empty their socks, in their britches
All you'll find that soon you'll be itches
Itches all over
Itch in your pants
Itch while you dance
Itchin' on down to the corn' of France

Well, I know a boy yesterday
He become a guitar and he floated away
He played his bars and he played 'em all
He's just on there havin' a ball
Kicking a hot storm up over the ocean
He took himself a notion

He got some lotion and
He put it on his guitar, put it on him
Next time you knew you can call him Jim
Down the road, boy, they call him Slim
They don't care if they're carry him
Just a minute now, you'll see what I mean
(Uncle Sam, in this land, rippin' up draft cards, an' all that)

Well, sooner or later a man's gonna come
He gonna take a look at you, look at your drum
He'd be a man and he'll take you home
Yeah, he'll take you out to his farm
He'll give you a good one
He'll give it to ya
(Well, you meet, girls don't giggle no more)
Well, sooner or later you're bound to meet his wife
And you'll come in 'n' have the time of your life
Just pickin' the gum, pickin' up a star
Pickin' up goin' and goin' to the bar
You and your manager (pickin' my nose)

Well, you'll want to know about the manager soon
He'll just take you outside and put you on the moon
He'll buy you new clothes, new pair of shoes
You'll be walk' away with the drummer blues
You'd be a fine drummer
Pick 'em as a comer
Dog hummer
The woman in you brings out
The man in me
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy

But baby sharper than a knife
Help me to know you
Show me the night to satisfy
A sinner with the flash of an eye
There'll never be another me

I never knew love could wind me up
I don't do my stuff
"till you go walkin' by
And maybe old enough to try

I never knew anyone in between
The devil and the angel
All in one and maybe old
Enough that I can ride
Your love let me burn
Let me slide down to your soul
You can pull me in
You can push me out
But your baby needs love
Somebody to hold
Show me what to do
The woman in you brings out
The man in me
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy

But baby, stronger than the wind burn
In the fire out of the night
I'll teach you how to tremble
If you give me the night

THere'll never be enough to me
I never knew I could find the best
But searchin' out the rest there
Is no doubt and maybe we can
Sweat it out

I never knew we could find
A way this crazy situation
Over me and we forget about
The world outside

My love in your eyes
There's no world
There is no time
You can hold me in
You can throw me down
But your baby needs love
Somebody to hold
Show me what to do
The woman in you brings out
The man in me
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy

[Chorus]
Yeah, there's a price to pay for the girls you lay
Life's gonna hand you a bill one day
Before your freedom or your life get took
Get a wife or a playboy book
One more time
There's a price to pay for the girls you lay
Life's gonna hand you a bill one day
Before your freedom or your life get took
Get a girl, a wife, or a playboy book

Sittin' at a red light
Tryin' to get my head right
This girl pass with a monster-ass
Mentally distracted
I mannishly reacted
My penis expanded
Her number I demanded
The questions I asked her were nice and discrete
But now she's in my passenger seat
Turn on the beat
Went to my castle
Fucked without a hassle
Oh it felt great, in her asshole
She was sexy, seductive, her name was Morgan
I loved the way she sucked my reproductive organ
I road it and road it
Finally unloaded (uhh)
Went to the bathroom because I couldn't hold it
Oh I looked down and I was trippin'
Because I seen blood drippin'
Off the tip of my penis
It don't take a genius to figure she's a virgin
Scrubbed my dick with detergent
I'm in the mix, if you know what I mean
Cuz the girl's only sixteen
Your nipples are hard
Your booty is soft
But cutie, I need to drop you off, pass my keys
Smashin' down the street
Tryin' to get rid of the broad
But her mama standing in the front yard
Lookin' at me weird cuz I'm gangsta geared
I look kinda old with a fro and a beard
She looked at me as if I was Satan
I smashed off on my hundred spoke daytons
Turned the shit up had the bass go whoppin'
Stressin' like a mothafucker goin' back to Compton
Turned down the street and I was skatin' homie
Sheriff department straight waitin' on me
We just need to ask a few questions homie
Why the fuck you putting these handcuffs on me?
Got to the station, now they tellin' me
That shit I did was a felony
Maybe you can release your rap tape
When you through doing time for statutory rape

[Chorus]
Bucccccca
Padapapadaa...

Met this girl named Kim working at M&M
She was nice and slim
She got a man but she don't talk to him
You know, let her tell it
Sniff that pussy you can probably smell it
Anyway she got a baby, of course, of course
Her and her man is goin' through a divorce
We kept talkin' so good so far
We started walkin' back to my car
Fired up the engine went to my house
Pulled down my pants, started cheatin' on my spouse
With a slow tempo I fucked the broad
But she's a nympho, bitch like it fast and hard
Oh my god this girl is odd
Lost my vision as I shot my wad
Put on my pants, cocked up my gat
I gotta get rid of this hood rat
Cuz she's callin' other men on my telephone
It's time for this bitch to take her ass home
After ejaculation, took the bitch home with no conversation
No more Luther or S. Gate
I pulled out my all-white too short tape
I'm playin' dopamine beat, and the shit still hit
I'ma make the bitch walk if she talk some shit
Got to her house, banked on the curb
Threw my head back, fired up some herb
She asked me do you wanna come in?
I said wait a minute woman
Who do you live with?
She said I'm single I don't play that shit
I don't lie, I tell every guy
You gotta call me first before you come by
I said alright
Put my car in park
Then I walked inside
I hit the alarm on my '83 caddy
She was yippin' and yappin'
About her baby daddy
Talkin' with a hoochie pitch
She called her baby daddy a lil ol' bitch
Talkin' shit loud and fast
Bitch talkin' bout she kicked his ass
Said she socked him, like a lil ol' hoe
But we was disturbed by a knock on the door
Damn, who is that? where's my gat?
I hope I don't die fuckin' with this hood rat
I'm tryin' to be one of those Palmdale playas
But now I'm caught in some chaos
But now I'm caught in some chaos
But now I'm caught-
Hey anyway man
The TV and the radio was playin'
I couldn't quite figure out what they was sayin'
They voices started escalatin'
And I'm sittin' on the couch debatin'
Should I stay? should I leave?
Should I grab the bitch by her fuckin' weave?
Sock her in the eye, bitch don't lie
You knew your baby daddy was fixin' to come by
And you invited me in
Now look at the shape I'm in
My palms are sweaty
My muscles was tense
I stood up fool I couldn't take the suspense
I walked to the door kinda nervous
I'm not ready for a funeral service
Opened up the door, calm and cool
I got eye contact with the fool
She talked about him as if he was small
Come to find out he like seven feet tall
I spoke, he spoke
He gave me a pound with his hand
I walked right past the man
Jumped in my '83 Cadillac
Drove down the street then I never came back
Went to the house, grabbed the mic and started rappin'
About the scandalous shit that coulda happen

[Chorus]
Buccca
Padapapadaa...
Train roll on
On down the line, won't you
Please take me far away

Now I feel the wind blow
Outside my door means I'm
I'm leaving my woman at home, Lordy

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Oh my baby's gone with the wind

And I don't know
Oh where I'm going
I just want to be left alone

Well when this train ends
I'll try again oh but
I'm leaving my woman at home, Lordy

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on
Tuesday's gone
Train roll on
Many miles from my home, see I'm
I'm riding my blues away, yeah

Well Tuesday you see
Oh she had to be free, Lord but
Somehow I got to carry on, Lordy

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind, oh
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on
Roll on
'Cause my baby's gone
I'm riding my blues babe
Trying to ride my blues
Ride on train
Ride on train
Ride my blues babe
Come back to me babe
Come back to me oh train
Roll on train
Wooaahh...
Ride on train
Tuesday
All of my life I've been so happy
While I have had you by my side
And now you say you're gonna leave me
For to become someone else's bride

Oh the river of love it has gone muddy
And the flowers they are dying on the shore
And the blue skies have all turned to darkness
And the nightingales will sing no more

What can I do to hide my sorrow?
What can I do to ease my pain?
And how can I keep these tears from fallin'?
Oh darlin' won't you come back home again?

Oh the river of love it has gone muddy
And the flowers they are dying on the shore
And the blue skies have all turned to darkness
And the nightingales will sing no more

Tomorrow I will take you to the station
And see that you're safely on that train
And when that 2:19 has departed
I'll never ever see your smile again
Oh the river of love it has gone muddy
And the flowers they are dying on the shore
And the blue skies have all turned to darkness
And the nightingales will sing no more
And the blue skies have all turned to darkness
And the nightingales will sing no more
Tell me at midnight before the moon starts fading
Tell me at midnight, why go on masquerading
The sky is so full of stars, and I can hear soft guitars
The still of the night is clear, the thrill of my life is near
Kiss me at midnight, let us love now or never
Tell me at midnight, your heart is mine forever
One... two...
Steal my heart... and hold my tongue
I feel my time... my time has come
Let me in... unlock the door
I never felt this way before

And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummer begins to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know which way I've come

Hold my head... inside your hands
I need someone... who understands
I need someone... someone who hears
For you I've waited all these years

For you I'd wait... 'til Kingdom Come
Until my day... my day is done
And say you'll come... and set me free
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
In your tears... and in your blood
In your fire... and in your flood
I hear you laugh... I heard you sing
I wouldn't change a single thing

And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummers begin to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know what I've become

For you I'd wait... 'til kingdom come
Until my days... my days are done
Say you'll come... and set me free
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me

Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
You're nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
You might be king, you might possess, the world and its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness, when you're growing old

The world still is the same
You'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love
That last train done left town
That last train done left town
I heard the whistle moaning low
That last train done gone down

My sweet baby's on that train
My sweet baby's on that train
I wonder if I will see her again
That last train done gone down

I heard that whistle moanin' low
I heard that whistle moanin' low
I'm begging and pleading, please don't go
That last train done gone down

I'm sorry for what I've done
I'm sorry for what I've done
Too late good-bye, my sweet baby cried
That last train done left town

That last train done left town
That last train done left town
I heard that whistle moanin' low
That last train done gone down
Now that we're alone
No more hide and seek
You are the highest dream to me
And as you softly sleep
Then I can tell you what it means
Locked in my arms like lovers lie
I will not let you slip away
I sthis the summer of them all
Is this my night of nights
That you came to stay

Here you are, owner of my heart
Just the way that love should be
And there is something I must say to you
If you promise to believe
That it's you I'm living for
And, I could not love you more

Seasons may come and seasons go
But these are the truest words I know
Face to face, eye to eye
This is the summer of our lives
One love that cannot die
Here you are, owner of my soul
Never let you say goodbye
And there is something I must say to you
We leave the world outside
And you have come to me at last, we start
Open up your heart
Let my deepest love inside
I'm only doing what I have to do
If you promise to believe
That it's you I'm living for
And, I could not love you (more)

[Intro: Usher]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
(Why you lie to me?)
Oh whoa
(You was everything I needed)
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
(I can't go on not knowing the truth)
Sweet lies, girl (Listen)

[Verse 1: Usher]
My stomach aches and sweat in my palms
This is so sudden
(What I'm supposed to do?)
I thought that love calls between our hearts
We're truly touching
(Be careful what you ask for)

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
One day I'll meet that special girl (Special girl)
Just for me (Just for me)
She'll have open ears (Open ears)
She won't ignore me
I'll bet I'll meet some special girl (Special girl)
She'll save the day (She'll save the day)
And she'll get it (Oh oh)
When I say girl

[Chorus: Usher]
I don't wanna go on
In this life
Wondering why (Baby, why)
Why (Baby, why)
I'd rather the bitter truth
When it comes to you (When it comes to you)
Than those sweet lies (Sweet lies)
Lies (Sweet lies)

[Verse 2: Usher]
Why oh why this song
Don't you love me
(I love you, put that on everything)
Well, maybe where I went wrong
Was calling you honey
(Shorty, shawty, don't matter)

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
One day I'll meet that special girl (Special girl)
Just for me (Just for me)
She'll have open ears (Open ears)
She won't ignore me
I'll bet I'll meet some special girl (Special girl)
She'll save the day (She'll save the day)
And she'll get it (Oh oh)
When I say girl

[Chorus: Usher]
I don't wanna go on
In this life
Wondering why (Baby, why)
Why (Baby, why)
I'd rather the bitter truth
When it comes to you (When it comes to you)
Than those sweet lies (Sweet lies)
Lies (Sweet lies)

[Bridge: Usher, Usher & Vanessa Marquez]
(Whoa) What I'm supposed to do?
(Whoa) Sit around here all day thinking about this?
(Whoa, oh, oh, oh yeah) Man, please
(Whoa, oh) I'm lacing up my Bathing Apes and I'm out
I'm out tonight
You'll see
I bet it was sweet on your lips
When you told me (Let me show you)
Ayy ayy (It hurt me)
My heart is just twisting slowly (I let you do it)
No one to hold me

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
One day I'll meet that special girl (Special girl)
Just for me (Just for me)
She'll have open ears (Open ears)
She won't ignore me
I'll bet I'll meet some special girl (Special girl)
She'll save the day (She'll save the day)
And she'll get it (Oh oh)
When I say girl, oh

[Chorus: Usher]
I don't wanna go on
In this life
Wondering why (Baby, why)
Why (Baby, why)
I'd rather the bitter truth
When it comes to you (When it comes to you)
Than those sweet lies (Sweet lies)
Lies (Sweet lies)

[Outro: Usher, Vanessa Marquez]
I'm sorry I messed up on you, baby
Oh, I heard it a million times, baby
Don't you lie to me, baby
And I promise I won't lie to you again
Usher:
Don't you lie, don't you lie to me, baby, yeah, yeah
Wildling
You make my heart sing
You pull your bow string...
And shoot me
Wildling

Wildling, I think I love you
But I wanna know for sure
I want to take you into that cave and kiss you... down there
'Cause I've never done it before!
Yeah!

Wildling...
Ooh, clap your hands everybody
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? ohh
The sun is shining nah
Nothing but blue sky
The storm has gone away
Here comes the perfect day
The burdens up off my shoulder
Plus my struggles over
Climbed the mountains and we made it here

Chorus:
Can you feel it? can you feel it? can you feel it? can you feel it?
Can you feel it? ooh can you feel it yeah, can you feel it? can you feel it oohh, can you feel it? can you feel it?
Show your hand if you feel it...
The wind is underneath
About to spread my wings
Take off like a bird
Cause i've been set free....

[Chorus]
There is a house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun.
And it's been the ruin of many a-poor girl
And me—oh, God—I'm one

[Verse 1]
My mother was a tailor
She sewed these new blue jeans
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord
Down in New Orleans

[Verse 2]
Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

[Verse 3]
He fills his glasses up to the brim
And he'll pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life
Is ramblin' from town to town

[Verse 4]
Oh, tell my baby sister
Not to do what I have done!
But shun that house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun

[Verse 5]
Well it's one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train!
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

[Verse 6]
I'm a goin' back to New Orleans
My race is almost run!
I'm goin' back to end my life
Down in the Rising Sun

[Chorus]
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a-poor girl
And me—oh, God—I'm one

[Verse 1]
Johnnie keep walking, Jack does too much coke
Jim Beam and Jameson, they just gave me joke
When I see Pernod, I say "oh, hell no"
Kahlua's a turn off, I tell him to Smirnoff
Captain Morgan, shot the sparks
When we hang out, he shoots arrows through my heart
Blue tattoo, chilling up in Malibu
He got 99 bananas, but he's not my boo

[Chorus]
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me

[Verse 2]
When I met Seagram's
He sent Chivas down my spine
Got me on the dancefloor
Then we start to wine
His ex, Sambuca
She just a hookah
I put it on a chilla but
I want tequila

[Verse 3]
I'll get you off your fucking face
I told you what to do
You want your mother
Your something-or-other
I'll get you off your fucking face
You wound up in another place
Your brother
You fucking nutter

[Chorus]
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me

Eh, whatcha say?
Eh, whatcha say?

I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed

I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed

[Chorus]
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed
I got a shot of tequila in me
I got sticky, sticky, icky, icky weed

Eh, eh, eh, whatcha say?
Eh, eh, eh, whatcha say?
Blue moon, you saw me standin' alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me sayin' a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper "please adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper "please adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
If you wanna know what time it is, you don't have to ask
If you wanna know what something is, you don't have to ask
If you wanna know whats real or not, you don't have to ask
If you wanna know what time is now, you don't have to ask
You don't have to ask, you already know

If you wanna leave just close your eyes, you don't have to ask
If you wanna go and lose your mind, you don't have to ask
If it's peace that you're looking for
You got the key to every door, you already know

If there's a way out you'll find out and free all and be all beyond
You never wonder what sky you been under that made you forget all this time

If you're looking for it, you don't have to ask
You can see it plain as day, you don't have to ask
If you try to find us true, just take a look at you, you don't have to ask
I'm working on the building
It's a true foundation
I'm lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord

I'll have a good time
Working on the building
I'm going to heaven
To get my reward

When you see me praying
I'm working on the building
I'm lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord

Well I'll never get tired
Working on the building
I'm going to heaven
To get my reward

When you hear me singing
I'm working on the building
I'm lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord
Well I'll never get tired
Working on the building
I'm going to heaven
To get my reward

When you hear me crying
I'm working on the building
I'm lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord

Well I'll never get tired
Working on the building
I'm going to heaven
To get my reward

I'm working on the building
It's a true foundation
I'm lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord

Well I'll never get tired
Working on the building
I'm going to heaven
To get my reward
It's your thing
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

It's your thing
Do what you wanna do now
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

If you want me to love you, maybe I will
I need you woman, it ain't no big deal
You need love now, just as bad as I do
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do now
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to
It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

I'm not trying to run your life
I know you wanna do what's right
Ah, give your love girl, do whatever you choose
How can you lose, with the stuff you use?

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
Don't let me tell you
Who to sock it to

Let me hear you say it's my thing (It's your thing)
I do what I wanna do...
Ezekiel saw the wheel, way up in the middle of the air
Ezekiel saw the wheel, way in the middle of the air
The big wheel run by faith, little wheel run by the grace of God
Wheel within a wheel, 'way in the middle of the air
Wheel, wheel, wheel, wheel in the middle of the air
Wheel, wheel, wheel, wheel in the middle of the air

[Whispered]
I wanna see you move

[Spoken]
Can you turn me up a little bit more?

Oh, baby, baby (Do you like it?)
Oh, baby, baby (Huh?)
Oh, baby, baby, baby

My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a si-gn, hit me baby one more time

Oh, baby, baby, baby
Crazy!
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Crazy!

You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited
I'm in too deep
Whoa oh, cra-zy
But it feels all right
Baby, thinking of you
Keeps me up all night
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it
Uh, uh, uh

I'm a, slave for you
I can not hold it
I can not control it
I'm a, slave for you
I won't deny it
I'm not trying to hide it
Yeah! Baby, baby

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby

Oops, oops
Oops, oops
Oops, oops
Oops, oops

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
Innocent, innocent, innocent...

But now, I'm stronger than yesterday (Sing it!)
Now, it's nothing, but-a my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I am stronger
Ger, ger, ger...

[Spoken]
Stop!

[Whispered]
Yeah
Like that?

Everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face
It's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby
Need you, baby, need you, baby, need you, baby...
What I am to do to with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so over-protected
Protected, protected, protected, protected...

[Spoken]
I wanna see you move
Move, move, move, move...

With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With the taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?

[Laughing]

[Verse 1]
A gust of southern wind came and took my girl away from me
Now my tears could fill an ocean, my tears could fill a sea
I wonder if she thinks about me, I wonder
I wonder

[Verse 2]
Many women come and go, they say my heart's uncarin' (Uncarin')
Maybe they don't hold me like she does (No they don't)
No, it's unbearable
I wonder if she knows that I've turned down their hug and kissin'
'Cause it's her that I'm missin'
I wonder if she really knows, I wonder

[Chorus]
I wonder if she knows how much I love her
I wonder if she knows how much I need her face around
I wonder if she cares about me, I wonder

Well, go on and get it one time
Well, well, well, well

[Verse 3]
Maybe she'll come on Monday, then again maybe not
Maybe she'll let me get her excited, get her sweaty, get her hot
I wonder if I'll finally do what I've been dreamin' so long
I wonder if she knows that she is makin' love so strong (So strong)

[Verse 4]
I wonder what ground's below her, I wonder what sky's above
I wonder if she knows how much I extra absolutely, so complete and sweetly love her
I wonder if she knows how much I love her, I wonder

[Verse 5]
All the other girls I know are dumb, dumber than a post
But my girl knows everything (Everything), I'm the king so I need to boast
Still I wonder if she'll really ever know (I wonder if she knows)

[Chorus]
I wonder if she knows how much I love her
I wonder if she knows how much I need her face around
I wonder if she cares about me, I wonder
I wonder if she knows how much I love her
I wonder if she knows how much I need her face around
I wonder if she cares about me, I wonder
Fool in the night on the stair
With the light by the window
Out in the jungle of life she was
Yearning to go
All of the years I've been there for the tears
She will sell you
Out in the city she search for the face
That she knew

Did you believe that a love so alive
Could be over

Caroline
Fallen Angel
Caroline
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Fallen Angel
I'm so lost
Tonight, lonely tonight
Lonely tonight
Fool is the father who clings to the
Child he is losing
Mother too weary to question
The wisdom of youth
There with your head in your hand
As you pray to her picture
Out in the rain she would search
For somebody to hold

Did you believe you could find
What you need with a stranger

Caroline
Fallen Angel
Caroline
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Fallen Angel
I'm so lost
Tonight, lonely tonight
Lonely tonight

Did you believe that a love so alive
Could be over

Caroline
Fallen Angel
Caroline
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Fallen Angel
I'm so lost
Tonight, lonely tonight
Lonely tonight

[Verse 1]
Feather in your cap if you catch a robber
Dirt in your face if your scheme falls through
Pay close attention to my story
You'll find every word is true

[Verse 2]
Junk man standing on the corner
Selling death, no conscience has he
In the name of God, won't somebody stop him
(Stop him, think about the children)
Its a matter of life and death, can't you see

[Verse 3]
Ain't no time to stand back and point your finger
We've got to face reality
No, no, no, no
Don't turn your back on this problem, people
Too much depends on you and me

[Verse 4]
Desperate with no sense of values
Just an evil mind lurking through the night
Because of you, the streets ain't safe no more for walking
'Cause you're feeling so up-tight
Take a look around
Don't be afraid
Take a look around
It's tearing the younger generation down
No don't be afraid
Take a look around
People it's up to you and me
Take a look around
It's tearing the younger generation down
I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All my sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain

If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so
Though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain
I'll do my craing in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
How did you find there was somebody
More than you want me
I never understood
Maybe I have never had you
I have been lonely for you lately
I can't wait another day
And when you let me get you close to me
You run and leave me

Paying the price of love
The start of my end over you
When you're doin' it for someone
Who'll never be free
Now is all there will ever be

No more to live without you
All the nights I dream about you

Deep in the dark of the night
I'm a man on a mission
But safer with you home
Never would I make you sorry
You are the only drug I crave
And I've been saving everyday
I held it all inside, I pray
You don't forget you got me
Paying the price of love
My heart in my hands over you
But the battle is just not fair
You'll never be free
That emotion is always replaying

You know the strongest heart
Is broken when it falls
You turn and walk away
And let it die
I got this picture in my head
Of you in someone else's bed
And I am torn apart
I'm torn apart inside

I'll build my world around you
I was nothing when I found you
Paying the price of love

Paying the price of love
The start of my end over you
When you're doing it for someone
Who'll never be free
Now is all there will ever be

Paying the price of love
My heart in my hands over you
But the battle is just not fair
You'll never be free
That emotion is always replaying
I search the world to find the girl
I need, I need
I know she's also searching out
For me, for me

I keep on going way past the 11th hour
I keep on going way past the 11th hour
To find you

I keep on going way past the 11th hour
I keep on going way past the 11th hour
To find you

I search the world to find the girl
I need, I need
I know she's also searching out
For me, for me

I keep on going way past the 11th hour
I keep on going way past the 11th hour
To find you

I keep on going way past the 11th hour
I keep on going way past the 11th hour
To find you

I will...

I keep on going way past the 11th hour
I keep on going way past the 11th hour
To find you

I keep on going way past the 11th hour
I keep on going way past the 11th hour
To find you

I will...
Starry night, this is the fable of the rose
The rose I gave my love
So young and tender, so in bloom
Filled with a faint perfume
Is lying crushed and faded in a room
Starry night, this is the fable of the rose
The rose I gave my love

Beyond all dreams of her caress
I may as well confess
She only loved me slightly nonetheless
Yet her smile so strangely taunts me
All the thrill of it haunts me
And so it goes, the fable of the rose
Dance around
A little flame
Candles burn out your name
Empty chair
Stands so bold
Your not here anymore
I live my life from lie to lie
And I'm a train wreck on the the inside
I wish I could be but I think I am
Over you and up again
I live in pieces
Everyday makes a hole an it
Tears away at my tired soul
I don't sleep (I can't sleep without you)
And I can't cry (I'm always crying)
Empty house full glass of wine
I live my life from lie to lie
And I'm a train wreck on the the inside
I wish I could be but I think I am
Over you and up again
I live in pieces
Dance around a little flame
Candles burn out your name

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
Don't pretend
Don't pretend
Don't pretend that you will never love again
(Don't pretend that you will never love again)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Little Miss Teary Eyes, you have no reason to lie to me
And put your coat down, why you waving goodbye to me?
I've been reassessing the situation, sittin' silently
And finally realize why you can't look eye to eye with me
And I knew about him the whole time
The hotels, phone calls, pssh, the whole nine
But I guess that's what friends are for
And I've come to a conclusion
That you're nothing but a very selfish person

[Pre-Chorus: Travie McCoy]
Open up my chest and you'll see
A cold cavity where my heart used to be
Makin' amends is out of the question
When you look into his pupils and I'm the reflection
Ha, ha

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
Don't pretend (Oh, no, oh, no)
I'm never gonna give you up (Oh, no, oh, no)
I'm never gonna let you down, turn around
Don't pretend that he is just a friend (Oh, no, oh, no)
Oh, no, I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never gonna let you down, turn around
Don't pretend that you will never love again

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
Okay, let me calm down
Here: have a seat, baby, maybe we can talk now
Guess I only have one question for you
Was I just another step in a progression for you?
And if so, why ain't you tell me that?
I wouldn't have sprung forward, I'd have fell back
But I guess that's what friends are for
The only word that comes to mind
Is that you're nothin' but a little brat

[Pre-Chorus: Travie McCoy]
Open up my chest and you'll see
A cold cavity where my heart use to be
Makin' amends is out of the question
When you look into his pupils and I'm the reflection
Ha, ha

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
Don't pretend (Oh, no, oh, no)
I'm never gonna give you up (Oh, no, oh, no)
I'm never gonna let you down, turn around
Don't pretend that he is just a friend (Oh, no, oh, no)
Oh, no, I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never gonna let you down, turn around
Don't pretend that you will never love again
Don't pretend that you will never love again
Don't pretend that you will never love again

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
We know it's nothing but the best, right?
But at night, I pray to God he won't rest right
You probably think I'm still bitter, well, you guessed right
How in the hell did we find ourselves in this mess, right?

[Outro: Travie McCoy]
I will bid farewell, Boobie
Sever the ties and I'mma keep it moving
Yeah
I love the ocean on a peaceful morning
I love the freedom of a single man
I love the woman who just drives me crazy
I just can't help it that's the way I am

I don't like war
I don't like politicians
Don't like the one who has an angry hand
I don't like guns
I don't like nuclear missiles
Don't like the one who doesn't give a damn

It's all right, it's all right
We can make love, we can fight
It's all right, it's all right
We can make love, we can fight
We can make love

I love the Lord
I love the little people
I love the one who is a gentle man
I love the rivers in the rocky mountains
I just can't help it that's the way I am
I've been to boston and I've been to china
I've been around the world and back again
I've got a hunger that just keeps me running
I just can't help it that's the way I am

It's all right, it's all right
We can make love, we can fight
It's all right, it's all right
We can make love, we can fight
We can make love
Sittin' by the windows all alone
Tryin' to understand just what went wrong
The girl I love has gone away
But the reason why she left, she didn't say

Perhaps she just got tired of makin' plans
And promises of things we never had
Well, I done my best, yet things got kind of worse
But for me, my best was good enough
Good enough

I tried to keep an open mind
That she would come to realize, in time
But as I go from day to day
I tell myself that there's no other way

Perhaps she never, never understood
That this man was doin' the best he could
I wish the girl all the very, very best of luck
But for me, my best was good enough
Oh, my best, my best, baby

Oh, perhaps she never, never understood
That this man was doin' the best, the best he could
I wish the girl all the very best of luck
But for me, my best was good enough

My best, my best was good enough

But for me my best was good enough

I know, I know my best was good
Oh, my best was good enough
I wanna wish this girl
All the best of luck, I do
Oh, but for me, my best was good enough
Yes, it was

Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know my best is good enough, yeah
I wish you, baby
I wish you, baby
All the best of luck
Ah, yes, I do

[Alto solo by Beverly Jenkins]

(chorus)

[Gonna find me a gypsy and get my fortune told,]

[I'm gonna find me a gypsy and get my fortune told.]

[I'm gonna say please, missus gypsy, tell me what the future will hold.]
(Hurry your deck of cards and your crystal ball)
(For there you will see that you will pray for light)
(The future will almost certainly be whatever you want it to be,)
(But with rockets and picks, from music and jetsam)
(There's no butt that you can push, and push,)
(Let your imagination burst into flame)
(And it will let you do whatever you damn well to do, do,do)

Given a choice I would choose to have a magic wand that I could use
To draw a melody, from that enchanted blade of grass
And cheese and wood and wind and sea
I would stand there, dig a grave, and quietly say
Ladies and Gentlemen, play for me, play for me
(and the orchestra plays a beautiful melody)
I happened to notice a girl in a light shade of blue
I happened to see her, the sight of her leaves me confused
She may not be you
But she looks just like you
She may not be you
But she looks just like you

You should've seen the way she wore her dress
And her white stiletto shoes
You should've seen the way they looked on her
Just like the ones that I bought you
I searched for days on end to no avail
'Til I found them in Peru
She must've been to Lima just as well
Because she had them too
You should've seen her eyes, her lips, her face
She looked as sweet as honeydew
You should've seen the way she walked away
Oh, she swayed her hips like you
I was only several steps from her
But she never noticed me
I took another sip of fine liqueur
It was quite a sight to see
I happened to notice a girl in a light shade of blue
I happened to see her, the sight of her leaves me confused
She may not be you
But she looks just like you
She may not be you
But she looks just like you

You should've seen the way he stroked her hair
And the smile that lit her face
You should've seen the way he kissed her lips
Did it have the same sweet taste?
Though my mind, it might be running wild
In constant search of you
It's funny how my eyes keep seeing things my heart would not believe are true

I happened to notice a man in a dark shade of blue
Who happened to be with a woman who leaves me confused
She may not be you
But she looks just like you
She may not be you
But she looks just like you

Maxine, she looks just like you
Maxine, she looks just like you
Maxine, Maxine
Here's a story how it goes
Or so they say
How a girl came along
Took a young boy and stole him away

(But) She loved him so
Treated him nice
They fell in love once
And they fell in love twice
Nothing went to waste, no
Not one little taste

So whatever you decide
Baby's (Honey's) all right with me
I'll understand
Wanna be your undercover man
Undercover man

So that's the story how it goes
Or so they say
How a girl came along
Took a young boy and stole him away
Said they was crazy
When they jumped the fence
They (ain't) never been seen
Or heard of since
Nothing went to waste, no
Not one little taste
So whatever you decide
Baby's (Honey's) all right with me

Wanna be your undercover man

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

She said that living with me
Is bringing her down yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

I don't know why she's ridin' so high
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away, yeah

Is bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around
Ah, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

My baby don't care, my baby don't care
My baby don't care, my baby don't care
My baby don't care, my baby don't care
(June 7, 1969)

1
I feel the ocean swaying me ...
Washing away all my pains
See where I was wounded
Remember the scar ?
Now you can't see a thing ...
And I feel no pain --

Singing about the Valley of Sunsets
Green and blue ... Canyons too
Singing about Atlantis love songs
The Valleys of Neptune is arising

2

Mercury liquid ... Emerald's shining
Telling me where I came from --
Honey Sun ... Pourquise Bed he
Lays in -- ... on the Burning
Edge Horizon
I'm sailing on the Bluebird's mission ...
Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam --
See the wind make love to all
The ocean ... Joy spread and
The massage got home --

Singing about the Valley of Sunsets ...
Purple and gold ... the Armies of the Lord
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips ...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising --

3

Look out East coast, but you're
Gonna have a neighbor
A rebirth land ...
The praying Burning Sands

We know there were worlds
So much older ...
And they shall rise, and
Tell us much more the truth of man --

4

I see visions of sleeping peaks
Erupting ...
Releasing all hell that
Will shake the Earth from end to end --
And this ain't bad news, good news
Or any news ... it's just the truth
Better save your souls while
You can --
Singing about the New Valleys
Of the Sunrise ... Rainbow clean
The world is gonna be ...
Singing about getting ready for the new tide ...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising
Prettier than all the world
And I'm so proud, I'm so proud of you
You're only one fella's girl
And I'm so proud, I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of being loved by you

And it would hurt, hurt to know
If you ever were untrue
Sweeter than the taste o a cherry so sweet
And I'm so proud, I'm so proud of you

Compliments to you from all the people we meet
Yes, and I'm so proud
Believe me I love you, too
I'm so proud of being loved by you

And it would hurt, hurt to know
If you ever were untrue
Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
Yeah, and I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of being loved by you
I want to go where no one's gone before
And my faith will find the way
And I'm not afraid
Now I am here with all that is true
So many times
You lived with my strength and my pain
You are my friend

I'm ready to walk that line
Ready to fight, for
I'm not alone in the night
You're always in sight and it's so right
For once in your life, let your soul shine through
And know I will go
That extra mile for you

In all the years, you suffer for your love
And my tears will fade away
Heaven above
Now I can steer my ship to the shore
Borne on the wind
All's fair in love and in war
Steady and sure
I'm ready to walk that line
Ready to fight, I'll
Weather the storm in the night, you're always around and it's so right
For once in your life let your soul shine through
And know I will go
That extra mile for you

Ready to walk that line
Ready to fight, I'll
Weather the storm in the night
You're always in sight and it's so right
For once in your life let your soul shine through
And know I will go
That extra mile for you
B:Hello, what you doing here, who are you?
The Flying Dutchman: Het jy my tv ??
B: My codename is Mikhail Breznikov, but you can call me Bongi
The Flying Dutchman: *snort* nice name, where'd you get it? the Waterfront?
B: Don't you think I've been mocked enough, because my father, Sipho, did not put a click in my name?
The Flying Dutchman: Versin!
B: I was taken by the Russians as a slave, but I maintain my Sowetan heritage with this afro
The Flying Dutchman: Verstaan jy Afrikaans?
B: stop! English only - I do not understand your language
The Flying Dutchman: mm? why am I here?
The Flying Dutchman: Ja waars ons kinders?
B: I said English. Can you handle it?
The Flying Dutchman: Hmm?
B: Because you are cute and i like to lick the chocolate starfish
If you are wondering why my voice is not in sync with my lips
It is because when I was a little boy my best friend Jacob Zuma taught me how to talk shit
And just like him I have mastered it, and I now talk through my ass as well

[Verse 1: Shawn Stockman]
From your ankle bracelet to your belly ring
From the tat on your back with the angel wings
Staring at your mouth waiting to hear anything
Baby, I get so lost in you
When you walk it looks like your floating
'Cause your vibe to me is mad potent
Like a Hemingway novel you got me open
Hoping I can get into you

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris]
Going further from your hips to your collar bone
And those directions to your love and your skin tone
Coffee, caramel, butter soft, that's you
I'm amazed all the ways that God blessed you
In a crowd of a thousand women, it's just you
Can't wait to make one out of us two
Hey, I just wanna melt with you
Baby, can I melt with you?

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
From the moment that I saw you
Right then I knew that I had a crush on you
Can't wait to get close to you, to touch on you
Girl, I got a crush on you
No one can show you better
Than me, girl, what's your pleasure?
Whatever it is I'll do, 'cause I've got a crush on you

[Verse 2: Nathan Morris, Shawn Stockman]
I love the way you pop your gum
And the way you lick your lips when you want some
Walkin' 'round the crib with your boy shorts on
Or bare feet arched like you got heels on
(On the phone with your girls, smiling and laughing)
The real conversation is between me and you
As soon as you hang up we can make something happen
('Cause I've been watchin' you, watch me, watch you)
I love the way we hug and stuff
The way we laugh afterwards 'cause the sex was rough
Clean up, go downstairs, bust a grub
And back upstairs to make some more love (Damn)
You're exactly what I needed, boo
I could see how a man would fall in love with you
Hey, that's the way it is with you
That's the way it is with you

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
From the moment that I saw you
Right then I knew that I had a crush on you
Can't wait to get close to you, to touch on you
Girl, I got a crush on you
No one can show you better
Than me, girl, what's your pleasure?
Whatever it is I'll do, 'cause I've got a crush on you

[Bridge: Boyz II Men]
Girl, it's true and all the things you do
I'm high as a cloud and I don't wanna come down
This thing that we have found is so beautiful
You should know, oh oh oh

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
From the moment that I saw you
Right then I knew that I had a crush on you
Can't wait to get close to you, to touch on you
Girl, I got a crush on you
No one can show you better (Show you better, baby)
Than me, girl, what's your pleasure? (What's your pleasure?)
Whatever it is I'll do, 'cause I've got a crush on you
From the moment that I saw you (Hey)
Right then I knew that I had a crush on you
Can't wait to get close to you, to touch on you
(I can't wait, yeah)
Girl, I got a crush on you
No one can show you better (Oh no)
Than me, girl, what's your pleasure? (No place'll be better, hey)
Whatever it is I'll do, 'cause I've got a crush on you

[Outro: Wanya Morris]
Whatever it is I'll do 'cause I've got a crush on you, yeah
Morris-Stockman-Morris, Ph.D., The Remedy
Absurd and sensible
Quite unacceptable
Let go, pull your leg off
Control, out of control

It's the bed wetting thing
That brought us here doctor
It's the bed wetting thing

You tripped, dog on a leash
You had never noticed

Nothing to do with me
Says he weeing his feet

Well it won't go away overnight
But it will go away in the end

You did such a great job
With the boiler last time
Please can you mend my baby
He hasn't moved for three weeks
Don't they use coffins when they are that small
I don't want lizards poured in my house

Sir my chin has been getting rather hot lately
So lick your chin stand on a tall building in the stiff breeze

Don't know what to do, It's saturday night
I seek good advice from who knows what's right
Why don't you ring friends and go for a few drinks
And then go see a movie

Did you prescribe my daughter a pound of heroin
I'm sorry, I can't see, I think I've blinded myself
Did you prescribe my daughter a pound of heroin
I'm sorry, I can't see, I think I've blinded myself
It isn't a spot, it is a baby
You're not a doctor, you're a wanker
If you cannot toss your heart gaily in the ring
Love me while the moment lingers
If you cannot cross your heart that I'm everything
Try at least to cross your fingers
Talk to me, baby, tell me lies
Tell me lies as sweet as apple pie
Whisper you tremble with a wild desire
To light the fire in my eyes
Tell me I'm marvelous, exaggerate!
Prevaricate if you must
Just talk to me, baby, soft and low
Then if you decide it's really so
Swear you be mine forever, otherwise just talk to me
And tell me lies, lies, lies, lies
Great, big, great big lies

[Intro]
Oh baby
If I could explain the joy I feel

[Verse 1]
Ooh, if I could explain the joy I feel, and a
Ooh, this love making, baby, it's so real, and a
Ooh, like winter time by the fireplace, and a
Ooh, like trapped in walls and there's no escape, and a
Ooh, like a precious jewel with no price tag, and a
Ooh, like waterfalls coming down on me, and a
Ooh, like a tidal wave coming from the sea, and a
Ooh, like a favorite scene in a big movie

[Chorus]
You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that, baby (ooh)
You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that, baby
(If you wanna know)
You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that, baby
(Ooh, just like)
You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that

[Verse 2]
Ooh, like you and me making history, baby
Ooh, like a 99th anniversary, and a
Ooh, like a baby when it speaks its first words, and a
Ooh, like an uplifting song the first time heard, and a
Ooh, like a shelter when the storm gets rough, and a
Ooh, like a mountaintop from the bottom up, and a
Ooh, like an expensive suite at the best hotel, and a
Ooh, like a work of art when its unveiled

[Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby
(Like that)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby
(Oh oh oh oh oh, if you wanna know)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby
(Just like that, yeah)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that (ooooh)

[Verse 3]
Ooh, like a great blue skies on a summer day, and a
Ooh, like sitting close in a small cafe, and a
Ooh, like making love to someone you love, and a
Ooh, like breaking up then making up, and a
Ooh, like a warm embrace when you come around, and a
Ooh, like the sweetest words when you're feeling down, and a
Ooh, like lost inside of a masquerade, and a
Ooh, like a celebration in a big parade, and a
Ooh, like a secret told to the one you trust, and a
Ooh, like kissing you in an all white tux

[Chorus]
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby
(If you wanna know)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby
(Just like that, if you wanna, wanna know)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby
(Just like that)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that
(Like the moon, yeah when it glows at night)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby
(And like the sun, oh yeah, when it shines real bright)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby
(And just like the ocean when the whale jumps high, so high)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby
(Like the eagle when it soars the sky, you wanna know)
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby
Hi Rog, this is Brian of the Beach Boys
Thanks a lot for playin' our new record Dance, Dance, Dance
And all the other records in the past
Do you know we're going to England real soon?
I hope I can tell you all about the Beatles and the Stones when I get back
There's a whole lot of talk around town
About the way you're carrying yourself
Whole lot of talk around town, woman
About the way you're carrying yourself
You're jiving everybody in town
But old B., that's me
I know what you've been putting down

You got a rambling mind
Just don't wanna stay at home
You got a rambling mind, woman
You just don't wanna stay at home
You ain't got no job in town
And I know what you've been putting down

Everybody wants you, baby
Everybody but me
I said every
Everybody wants you, woman
Everybody but me
You've been jiving everybody in town, baby
But I know what you've been putting down
You went out late last night
To a dinner show and a dance
You went out late last night, baby
A dinner show and a dance
You must've been a perfect clown
'Cause I know what you've been putting down

Yeah, you came home
Early this morning, woman
With a new hat, a new dress
And a new pair of shoes
Came home early this morning, woman
With a new hat, a new dress
And a new pair of shoes
You ain't been visiting
Your relatives in town
I know what you've been putting down

[Verse 1]
Diamonds are forever
They are all I need to please me
They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me

[Verse 2]
Diamonds are forever
Hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see every part
Nothing hides in the heart to hurt me

[Chorus]
I don't need love
For what good can love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone
They'll luster on

[Verse 3]
Diamonds are forever
Sparkling 'round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
And men are mere mortals who
Are not worth going to your grave for

[Chorus]
I don't need love
For what good can love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone
They'll luster on

[Outro]
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever
Forever and ever
Turn out the light, sleep won't come
I think about what's going wrong
Lying so close, so alone
Please turn to me, I'm almost gone

Hold on, I feel our love is changing
Hold on, please don't let me disappear
Hold on, there's time to rearrange things
Hold on, I'm not me without you here

Put out your hand, touch desire

Where there's a spark, could be a fire
Open your arms, let me see
If there's still love in you for me

Hold on, I feel our love is changing
Hold on, please don't let me disappear
Hold on, there's time to rearrange things
Hold on, I'm not me without you here
La da da da da la da da
Oh yeah
La da da da da la da da
Oh, yeah yeah

You are too wonderful, to be what you seem
Should there be eyes like yours?
Should there be lips like yours?
Should there be smiles like yours?
Honest and truly
When I watched you walk with him
Tears filled my eyes
And when I heard you talk with him
I couldn't stand his lies
And now before he tries it
I hope you realize it

Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
He don't care

(Guess you know I waited for you)
He'll do the same to other girls
That he did to you
But then one day he'll run in to one
That's gonna hurt him too
Before he makes you over
I'm gonna take you over
Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
He don't care

(Guess you know I waited for you girl)
All the dreams you shared with him
You might as well forget
I know you need a truer love
And that's what you'll get
And now that you don't need him
Well he can have his freedom

Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
You know my little girl
She's a country girl
Yes my little girl
She's a country girl
But she means more to me
Than anything in this world

Yeah she fix my breakfast lunch and dinner
And she bring it on home on time
She fix my breakfast lunch and dinner
And bring it all home on time
Yes you know I'm glad to be back home
Hey with this little girl of mine

You know I'm glad glad glad
I'm glad to be back home at last
Whah I'm glad glad glad
I'm so glad to be back home at last
Since I've seen my baby
Yeah how many days have passed
Yah you know I flew into the station
About six forty-five
Yeah my plane it made it into the station this morning
About six forty-five
Yes you should've seen my baby's face
To see my plane arrive

Yes it made me feel so good
To walk in through the door
Yes it made me feel so good to walk into the door
You know and find everything the same
Even my pallet layin on the floor

And I said hi hi baby I won't worry no more
Whoa I said hi hi hi baby, I won't ever worry any more
You know I got home this mornin
And I ain't goin outa that door
This song appears on two albums, and was first released on the windsong album, and has also been released on the changes album

There's lonely hearts in arkansas
There's truckers in des moines
All there to keep me company in the early morn
A world unknown to daytime
Is forever going on
The airwaves of the nation
Between midnight and the dawn

Late night radio
Take it everywhere i go
My best friend when i'm lonely
Is my late night radio

Well i turn the dial
A little bit past one-o-one point two
In time to catch the news
And see who's shooting who
Then i hunt around for old songs
They're so good to hear again
To think of how it was
Imagine how it might have been
Late night radio
Take it everywhere i go
My best friend when i'm lonely
Is my late night radio

La la la i sing along
¡®cause i never know the words
La la la la la la la la
I'd love to call a talk show
But i haven't got the nerve
La la la oh oh oh radio

The lord is still my shepherd
But these preachers got to go
This time of night my interest
Lies in u.f.o.'s
So i turn the dial a little
Past fifty-six point three
To find myself a lullaby
To rock me off to sleep

Late night radio
Take it everywhere i go
My best friend when i'm lonely
Is my late night radio
Late night radio
Take it everywhere i go
My best friend when i'm lonely
Is my late night radio

Words and music by bill and taffy danoff

[Verse 1]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

[Verse 2]
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glorious stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia
Christ the savior is born
Christ the savior is born

[Verse 3]
Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth
CHORUS:
In my deuce and a quarter feelin' funky funky fine
And I'm rockin' that stupid shit
In my deuce and a quarter feelin' funky funky fine
And I'm rockin' that stupid shit

Rollin' in my deuce deuce 5
Convertible top down so I can see the honeys passin' me by
It's a beautiful day in my neighborhood
But 5 or 10 minutes, a criminal puts me in a bad mood
And some would say that's just a black man's perspective
But nowaday, I find that it's reflective
Of what I see goin' down everyday
My brothers and my sisters gettin' played
So we revert 2 committin' dope, many brothers get hurt
By another brother who don't like salt in his dirt
Cuz in the streets, see, that's the way it is
U keep your mouth shut and stay out of other people's biz
See, the system wasn't made 4 me or U
And as a matter of fact, it wasn't made 4 a poor white who...
Gets their weekly hit
Or should I say that weekly check and start depending on that shit like a glass dick
These are some of the feelings that I'm holdin'
But everything's fine while I'm rollin'...
CHORUS

(Don't everyday)

How many, how many times must we commit crimes
Against people no better off than us, but in our own minds?
A-havin' it, grabbin' it, tastin' it
And when U step off, I finally rub your face in it
See, the local's preacher is not suited 4 the have-nots
The poor get poorer and the rich continue 2 clock ... not!
That means U end up with the booty
And we all know a broke man is a man with no friends
And that's basically the way society is
And money talk, pusher walk and sleepin' on the politics
Soon we must live 2 consolidate
As we continue 2 consume instead of producin', seal our on fate
(In my deuce and a quarter feelin' funky funky fine)
People right now really don't give a damn
(And I'm rockin' that stupid shit)
Cuz in the 20 mile radius, there's probably not one black and...
Hispanic taken 4 granted and left 2 clean their own shit up, huh
No need 4 panic, I'm out
That's bullshit!

CHORUS
In my... in my... in my...
Rockin' that stupid shit
Rockin'... rockin'... rockin' that stupid shit
Well I stood stone like at midnight
Suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair 'til it was just right
And commanded the night brigade

I was open to pain and crossed by the rain
And I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone
Came out with my soul untouched

I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd
But when they said sit down, I stood up
Ooh-ooh, growin' up

The flag of piracy flew from my mast
My sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate
She couldn't sail but she sure could sing

I pushed the B-52 and bombed 'em with the blues
With my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school
Never once gave thought to landing, no
And I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd
When they said come down, I threw up
Ohh-oh, growin' up

I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere
You know it's really hard to hold your breath
And I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared
I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress

Well my feet finally took root in the earth
But I got a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe
In the engine of an old parked car

I hid in the mother breast of the crowd
But when they said move down, I moved up
Oh-oh-oh, don't you know that I'm growin' up
I said, oh-oh-oh, I can't help it that I'm growin' up
For someone who's got everything, life can still be rough
If things are what you're lookin' for, there's never quite enough
And all the tea in China won't make a house a home
You can be a millionaire and still be sleepin' alone

There might be some one night stands to ease the pain inside
Or someone you can call around if you've lost all your pride
Please don't be mistaken. I don't mean to put that down
I know there's times when anything is better than sleepin' alone

Sleepin' alone can make a bottle just about your dearest friend
Sleepin' alone can make you swear to God this night will never end

You know it's not company you are lookin' for
You know it's not just pleasure, you know it's somethin' more
You know it's not the answer if it's not like comin' home
If the one who's there doesn't really care, it's worse than sleepin' alone

Sleepin' alone can make a bottle just about your dearest friend
Sleepin' alone can make you swear to God this night will never end
For someone who's got everything, life can still be rough
If things are what you're lookin' for, there's never quite enough
And all the gold that glitters won't make a house a home
You can be a millionaire and still be sleepin' alone
You might be a millionaire and still be sleepin' alone

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Lately I've got this funny feelin'
Somethin' don't feel the same
But he's tellin' me I'm the one to blame
Yes, I know that he still gives me good lovin'
But when he's deep inside
There's somebody else on his mind

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Aretha Franklin]
Don't waste your time
But it gets so hard to know
Just walk away
You say that I gotta let go
Seen it a million times before
You shouldn't take his stuff no more
Can't waste my time
Girl, it's not hard to know
Should walk away
Yeah, you've gotta let him go
Seen it a million times before
Shouldn't take his sh... no more

[Verse 2: Aretha Franklin & (Mary J. Blige)]
Sister girl, sister girl
It's much deeper than what you're thinkin', ooh
When somethin' don't feel the same
You better believe his love has changed
(M: And I've been tellin' you, tellin' you)
And what your're tellin' me
('Cause it's been hurtin' me, hurtin' me)
He's got a sweetie on the side
Stop making truth out of his lie

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Aretha Franklin]
Don't waste your time
But it gets so hard to know
Just walk away
You say that I gotta let go
Seen it a million times before
You shouldn't take his stuff no more
Can't waste my time
Girl, it's not hard to know
Should walk away
Yeah, you've gotta let him go
Seen it a million times before
Shouldn't take his sh... no more
Shouldn't take it, don't you take it

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige & Aretha Franklin]
What's the point of love when you've got no trust?
What's the point of stayin' when you've seen enough?
What's the point of givin' what he don't deserve?
(He don't deserve it; no, he don't deserve it)
What's the point of feelin' like there's nothin' inside?
What's the point of sayin' that you still got your pride?
What's the point of givin' what he don't deserve?
(This is a lesson for all my ladies)

[Outro: Mary J. Blige & Aretha Franklin]
(Don't waste your time, walk away)
Oh, I'm so tired to walking away over and over
(Seen it a million times before, you shouldn't take it)
No, I shouldn't take it
The boy is a fool, oh, yes he is
(Don't waste your time, walk away)
Shouldn't take it
(Seen it a million times before, you shouldn't take it)
Sister girl, you shouldn't take it
(Don't waste your time, walk away)
You ain't gon' be my friend no more
(Seen it a million times before, you shouldn't take it)
Cut him loose
(Don't waste your time, walk away)
It's a lowdown dirty shame
(Seen it a million times before, you shouldn't take it)
Oh, oh, oh, he worked his game on you
I know
(Don't waste your time, walk away)
Oh, sister girl, you need to walk now
Yes I do, yes I do, yeah
Oh yeah
Dinah:
Even Superman supports the good health plan
He knows what it will do, it's all up to you, it's all up to you
Frank:
Spread the health alarm to every town and farm
And preach the good health view, it's all up to you, it's all up to you
Dinah: You'll find being healthy means more than a well-filled hearse
Frank: What good's being wealthy when you can't buy a doctor or a nurse?
Dinah: When the job is done
Frank: We'll wind up number one

(Musical interlude)

Frank: We need vitamins and medicines and beds to spare
Dinah: Places where the sick can go and get some care
Frank: Lots of new equipment to combat disease

Dinah: Free examination for the kids and class
Frank: A kid whose health is good will have a chance to pass
Dinah: If we do these thing and we will be the state
(Musical interlude)

Frank: Do your state a favor, the task is yours alone
Dinah: Be a real life saver, and chance is that you will save your own

Frank: Get in there, get yourself someone to help

I don't like this groove
Try and give me something I can croon to
Catch my drift?

That'll work

That's right, I can't control it

Tonight I can no longer hold it
Get it up

[Chorus 1]
Big boys bickering
That's what they're doin' ev'ryday
Big boys bickering
Fuckin' it up for ev'ryone, ev'ryone

[Verse 1]
Guess while they're betting on the track
They're tryin' to win your money back
All of the taxes that you paid
Went to fund a masquerade

[Chorus 2]
Big boys bickering
That's what they're doin' all the day
Big boys bickering
Fuckin' it up in ev'ry way, ev'ry way

[Bridge]
We stand here waiting
Underneath the tower block
Who will win and who will lose?
Which way do the big boys choose?
Which of us will never know what goes on?
(Who will win, who will lose?)

[Verse 2]
So while they argue through the night
Shakin' their sticks of dynamite
Babies are dying through the day
They wanna blow us all away

[Chorus 3]
Big boys bickering
And so the game goes on and on
Big boys bickering
Fucking it up for ev'ryone, for ev'ryone
For ev'ryone, for ev'ryone, for ev'ryone
For ev'ryone, ev'ryone

[Outro]
Fucking it up for ev'ryone (fuckin' it up for ev'ryone)
Fucking it up for ev'ryone
Ev'ryone, ev'ryone
Ev'ry, ev'ry, ev'ry, ev'ry, ev'ryone
Baby, oh no, I've been stuck here
I've been searching so long
Baby don't go, millions of people were wrong
In the dark of the cold light of day
I will still be here
If my heart and my soul had their way
You would still be here

Another lonely night in New York
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down
'Cause my baby's no longer around
And my feeling can never be found

Another lonely night in New York
And my sorry eyes are looking out on the world

Baby, you said, a guy like me was way out of line
And knowing today, your leaving was a question of time
In the mist of a sweet summer rain, you will find me here
Should the sparkle of stars lose their way
I'll be holding near
Another lonely night in New York
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down
'Cause my baby's no longer around
And my feelings can never be found

Another lonely night in New York
And my sorry eyes are looking out on the world
In the dark of the cold light of day
You will find me here
If my heart and my soul had their way
You would still be here

Another lonely night in New York
And I'm just a soul in the heart of the city
Just another lonely night in New York
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down
Just another lonely night in New York
Yeah, it's Kells...

Must you dance every dance with the same fortunate man?
You have danced with him since the music began
Won't you change partners and dance with me?
Must you dance quite so close with your lips touching his face?
Can't you see
I'm longing to be in his place?
Won't you change partners and dance with me?
Ask him to sit this one out. while you're alone
I'll tell the waiter to tell him he's wanted on the telephone
You've been locked in his arms ever since heaven-knows-when
Won't you change partners and then
You may never want to change partners again
Before Lord God made the sea or the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air
For the little dark star in the wind down there
And he stated and promised he'd take special care
So it wouldn't get lost no more

Now, a man don't mind if the stars get dim
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over him
Keeping track how it all goes on

But I've been walking through the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
Forgetting his promise and the word he'd say

And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars big stars blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars big stars blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars

[Spoken Intro]
Ooh, here she comes
She got them gold hot pants on again
Yeah, man
I wanna talk, but I dunno
She's a peach

[Verse 1]
She was dark, she was tan
She made me glad to be a man
She was young, she was smart
Just one glance and she stole my heart
The kinda girl you wanna teach
She's a peach

[Verse 2]
Summertime, feelin' fine, getting wild
All that's on my mind
Here she come, dressed in red
Get her done is all that's in my head
Her hot pants can't hide her cheeks
She's a peach

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
She was pure, every ounce
I was sure, when her titties bounce
Every way, she's a winner
Turn a gay preacher to a sinner
No one you want your mama to meet
She's a peach

[Ad lib]
This is a girl plays hard to get

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
I would die if I kissed her
I would try but I'm last on her list
She's so cool and I'm so ugly
I'd be a fool to think that she could love me
This kinda girl's always out of reach
She's a peach
I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
I said I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues, woman
Baby, how blue can you get?

You're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
I said You're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
How blue can you get baby
The answer is right here in my heart

I gave you a brand new Ford
But you said: I want a Cadillac
I bought you a ten dollar dinner
And you said: thanks for the snack
I let you live in my pent house
You said it just a shack
I gave seven children
And now you wanna give them back
I said I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues
Baby, how blue can you get?

[Verse 1]
You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close, I move away

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

[Chorus]
Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right
Be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be so shy, uh, oh
Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

[Chorus]
Sometimes I run (Sometimes)
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right
Be with you day and night
All I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right
Be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time

[Bridge]
I'll just hang around and you'll see
There's nowhere I'd rather be
If you love me, trust in me
The way that I trust in you
Ah, ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes I run (Sometimes)
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you (Ooh, ooh)
But all I really want is to hold you tight (Hold you tight)
Treat you right
Be with you day and night (Day and night)
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes I run (Sometimes)
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you (Ooh, ooh)
But all I really want is to hold you tight
I'll treat you right
I'll be with you day and night (Day and night)
All I really want is to hold you tight

[Outro]
Be with you day and night

(House!)
Give it up, give it up, give it...
House in order {x2}
Yesterday I found an earring

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

[Verse 1]
So long ago
Certain place
Certain time
You touched my hand
On the way
On the way down to Emmeline

[Pre-Chorus]
But if our paths never cross
Well, you know I'm sorry, but

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's edge
(Aaron)
(Aaron)

[Verse 2]
So it's hard to find
Someone with that kind of intensity
You touched my hand, I played it cool
And you reached out your hand to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But if our paths never cross
Well, no I'm not sorry, but

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's edge
(Aaron)
(Aaron)

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's edge
(Aaron)

[Verse 3]
So long ago
It's a certain time
It's a certain place
You touched my hand and you smiled
All the way back you held out your hand

[Bridge]
If I hope and if I pray
Ooh, it might work out someday

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

If I live to see the seven wonders (If I live to see the seven wonders)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end (I'll make a path there)
I'll never live to match the beauty again (I'll never live to see that beauty, that beauty, that same, same beauty again)

If I live to see the seven wonders (If I live to see there)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
(Well, if I hope and I pray)
(Well, maybe it might work out someday)
Let live what must live, die what must die
Birth comes with a death, comes with a rise

Ne retenez pas, résistez pas
Faites vivre ce qui, ce qui doit vivre
Laissez mourir ce qui doit mourir

There are two sides to one's same thing, there are two sides
Breathing is like a tide rolls in, then retires

Foster the frank questions

The plants in my garden
Flourish, seed and perish
She is watching by the poplars
Colinette with the sea-blue eyes
She is watching and longing and waiting
Where the long white roadway lies

And a song stirs in the silence
As the wind in the boughs above
She listens and starts and trembles
'Tis the first little song of love

Roses are shining in Picardy
In the hush of the silver dew
Roses are flowering in Picardy
But there's never a rose like you

And the roses will die with the summertime
And our roads may be far apart
But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy
'Tis the rose that I keep in my heart
Somebody ought to have told me
Told me you couldn't be true
Somebody ought to have told me now
But that wouldn't be like you

But no one's gotta tell me
After all you put me through
You dropped me like a habit
Of which you had a few

Your scent is on the glass tonight
Swirling in the wine
Scrambling the back of my brain
The irony sublime

It's warm bouquet and pungent flame
Light this ancient street
The avenue of no name
I'll fall into its beat

Nobody loved like you....
Time
Won't you let me be
After all that we've been through
I talk to myself 'cause I ain't got nobody else
Nobody else but you

I've walked for miles
I've walked a long time
To get to the place that I've got to.... yeah
There's nothing left and nobody.... nobody
Nobody left but you

Time
Please set me free
Why couldn't you be true
I walk that walk.... yeah
I talk that talk
But there's nobody left but you... you

Time
Won't you let me be
After all that we've been through
I talk to myself 'cause I ain't got nobody else
Nobody left but you.... you

[Verse 1]
Well, up in the evening down in Mobile, Alabama
Working on the railroad with the steel driving hammer
Gotta make some money to buy some brand new shoes
Trying to find somebody to take away these blues
"She don't love me" hear them singing in the sun
Payday's coming and my work is all done

[Verse 2]
Well, later in the evening when the sun is sinking low
All day I've been waiting for the whistle to blow
Sitting in a teepee built right on the tracks
Rolling them bones until the foreman comes back
Pick up your belongings, boys, and scatter about
Got an off-schedule train comin' two miles about

[Verse 3]
Well, everybody's scrambling and running around
Picking up their money, tearing the teepee down
Foreman was a panic, 'bout to go insane
Trying to get the workers out the way of the train
Engineer blowing the whistle loud and long
Can't stop the train, we gotta let it roll on

[Intro]
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby

[Chorus]
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby

[Verse 1]
Sit down on the couch
Take your shoes off
Let me rub your body before I tear it off
The honey lover man is ready to flex
Girl, flex, time to have sex
We'll start right here and work our way around
I won't stop until I hear the "ooh ahh" sound
Don't front you know about the rodeo show
So show me some ID be-fore I get knee deep in-to you
I don't see

[Chorus]
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby

[Verse 2]
This is going on 'til the early morn'
And my word is bond, so baby, flex the thongs
I got what you want, you got what I need
Homie lover friends is all I wanna be
It's the pretty round brown driving me wild
Ooh child, things are gonna get a little freakier
And I will have you singing like a mockingbird ... word
Don't front you know ... about the rodeo show
So show me some ID be-fore I get knee deep in-to you
I don't see, yeah

[Chorus]
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby

[Bridge]
Ah yeah, break it down
This is the remix on the wild tip comin' at ya for the '94
Check it out

Baby, turn the lights off
I'm gonna set it off
Driving you out of your mind
With a little bump n' grind

[Chorus]
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night
Got into a fight
Well, I feel so broke up
I want to go home

So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home, yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home

The first mate he got drunk
And broke in the captain's trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone
Why don't you leave me alone? Yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home
So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Let me go home
Why don't you let me go home?
(Hoist up the John B's sail)
Hoist up the John B
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home
Let me go home

The poor cook he caught the fits
And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home
Why don't they let me go home?
This is the worst trip
I've ever been on

So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Let me go home
Why don't you let me go home?
Son of a Tokyo Rose
I was bound to wander from home
Stranger to whatever I'd awaken to
Spun the wheel, took a shot in the dark
One way ticket and a runaway heart
A sailor's dream came true the night I dreamed you

Through the neon doorways
Down the stony streets I fell
All hands high side, all eyes erect, I follow
Sailing shadows, reds and blues
Curtains drawn but I saw through
The window to your soul, and I found you

Whoa, the harbor lights of Venus
Shining through the breeze
That brings me back to you my love
To you my love, to you my love

My eyes must be betraying
But that lonesome jukebox playing
Something about the harbor lights is calling me
Back to some Jamaican Bay
Doesn't seem so far away
Keep the change, but I'll repay these memories
Dawn came in this morning
Like some old junked out melody
The words she spoke when we awoke still haunt me
What you feel too won't reveal you
Let me steal you from my life

Whoah, the harbour lights of Venus
Shining through the breeze
That brings me back to you my love
To you my love, to you my love

(Repeat)
I didn't think it could happen again
I'm just too old and set in my ways
I was convinced I would always be lonely
All of the rest of my days
Maybe I give up on romance
In my longing to give up the pain
I just didn't believe I would ever love again

I was like one who had shut myself in
Closed the windows, locked all the doors
Afraid of the dark and the beat of my heart
Yet knowing there had to be more
Though it sounds like a great contradiction
It's the easiest thing to explain
You see, I was afraid I might never love again

What does it take for a blind man to see
That there's more there than just meets the eye
What are the ways that the magic comes in
That can turn a song into a sigh
Sometimes I think that I'm dreaming
Or maybe I'm going insane
Or maybe it's just that I'm falling in love again
Here I am standing beside you
Oh life's such a wonderful game
Look at me now, I'm falling in love
Look at me now, I'm falling in love
Look at me now, I'm falling in love again

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, because I'm moanin' low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

[Verse 2]
All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country, Sweet Suzie
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down

[Verse 3]
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moanin' low
And I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gotta get up in the morning and go

[Verse 4]
Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well I got no chance of losin' this time

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down

[Outro]
Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well I got no chance of losin' this time
Well she's thirty-six in the bust
Twenty-eight in the waist
Forty-four in the hips
She's got real crazy legs
You upset me baby
Yes you upset me baby
And I'm telling you people
She's something fine that you really ought to see

Well she's not too tall
Complexion is fair
Man she knocks me out
The way she wears her hair
You upset me baby
Yes you upset me baby
Like being hit by a falling tree
Woman, woman what you do to me

Well I've tried to describe her
It's hard to start
I'd better stop now
Because I've got a weak heart
Well you upset me baby
Yes you upset me baby
Well like being hit by a falling tree
Woman, woman what you do to me
Well I've tried to describe her
It's hard to start
I'd better stop now
Because I've got a weak heart
You upset me baby
Yes you upset me baby
Well like being hit by a falling tree
Woman what you do to me

[Verse 1]
High school party, senior year
Boys and girls are all sippin' on beer
I like soda, where's the soda?
Am I the only fucking person here that likes soda?
I see you from across the crowd
I said the party is bumpin' and the music is loud
You're really drunk and you're lookin' sad
It's like a date rape ad
Girl, then we start to dance and
Girl, baby this is romance
Girl, I'm startin' to grow down below
Shit, why did I wear sweatpants?
Girl, your body's like what
Conjunction junction that's a fine ass, but
I'm like a cashew in a lollipop
Just keep suckin' 'til you get to the nut
And I said let's rob an Asian kitchen
Or stroll down the block
Either way girl, we're takin' a wok (walk) ...Nothing?
You're gonna love me the way my uncle did
Except you're not gonna go to court for doin' it
Be a guillotine or my girl instead
Either way, you're givin' me head
I'm gonna love you, baby the right way
Shawty with a body lookin' hotty when I say girl
When I say girl
We go into the bedroom exchanging nervous laughter
Why's it called dry humping if I always need a towel after?
You spread your naked legs and I see that wound that never healed
Even though you're yellin' for me, I can tell your lips are sealed
We're both aware of my erection, you ask if I have protection
I say
"Well no, I tried to buy 'em once, I was in the convenience store, my old babysitter walked in and I had to hide them near the Tic-Tac's, I was so embarrassed, I peed myself a little bit"

[Break]
Girl, ooh girl

[Verse 2]
Insert a euphemism
A sexy mental prism
Increase my pelvic rhythm
Fill you with my syllogism
I know your body and I know how to please you
Don't thank me, thank Wikipedia
Guys don't go down, well I am-
What the fuck is that?
I should have brought my diagram
Ooh, did you feel that?
That was an educated guess
Ooh, did you feel that?
Uh, that one was a sneeze, my bad
High school party, senior year
None of that happened cause I wasn't invited
Then Gabriel came and said to Joseph alone
"Do not be afraid to make Mary your own
But go to your betrothed and then be married
The child is Heaven sent"

And it came to pass
That there went out a decree
From Caesar Augustus
That all the world would be taxed

And each went to be taxed to his own city
So Joseph also went
With his lady innocent
With his lady innocent

The lions in the mountains
Let them pass and followed
Close by night to guard them

From Galilee to Bethlehem
She journeyed with only a donkey to ride
With Joseph walking beside
Came to David's city
While she was great with child
Through a country dark and wild
Through a country dark and wild

And on the far horizon
Rose a strange and brilliant
Star as though to guide them

[Verse 1]
Hold on and don't give up
Don't you worry
You don't have to cry
'Cause He, He sees what you're going through
Yes, He does

[Chorus]
God is willing, and He is able
This did not catch Him by surprise
So just trust Him
And just, oh, step aside

[Verse 2]
Be still and don't question it
These obstacles, they were allowed
He wants to take you higher and higher
If you will hold on

[Chorus]
God is willing and more than able
This did not catch Him by surprise
So just trust him
And just step aside

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, I know he's faithful
My God is faithful
To do what he said he'll do
Now, if He said it, just believe it
There's nothing He can't do
You must stand on his word (Stand on his word)
Cast all your cares on him (Give them to him)
'Cause he knows and he loves you
He did it for me, that's why I can say
Step (Step), just step aside (Gotta step aside)
God can work a miracle for you (Step)
Step aside (Gotta step aside)
You got to let go (Step)
And let God (Gotta step aside)
Let go (Step)
And let God be God (Gotta step aside)
Move yourself out of the way (Step)
Move your pride out of the way (Gotta step aside)
He'll never leave you, nor forsake you (Step)
That's what I know, it ain't just what I heard (Gotta step aside)
So I thank you, Lord (Thank you, Lord)
For being awesome to me (Wonderful)
You're marvelous (Marvelous)
Praise him, praise Him (Gotta step aside)
Oh, (Step) step aside (Step)
Let go, let go, let go (Step)
Let go, let go (Gotta step aside)
He knows what you go through (Step)
He knows what you can bear (Step)
He can do what you can't do (Step)
So step, so step, so step aside (Gotta step aside)
Thank You, Lord
And You're in control
So I step aside
Well, I feel so bad, I wonder what's wrong with me
Well, I feel so bad, I wonder what's wrong with me
I think I'll call my baby, find out just what the matter
Can be

Last night I dreamed about my baby
I woke up and the tears were runnin' all down my face
Now, when I woke up, early this morning
The tears were runnin' all down my face
You know I was dreamin', that some other man was takin'
My place

I said, I dreamed about you baby
I dreamed you didn't want me 'round no more
I said, I dreamed about you baby
You know I dreamed you didn't want me round no more
Now, That's the reason I'm callin' you this evening
Baby, tell me, 'cause I've just got to know

Break:
I've been worried all day long
I just don't know what to do
I've been worried all day long
You know, I just don't know what to do
You know it may sound silly to you woman
But tell me that dream was not true
Deep night, stars in the sky above
Moonlight, lighting our place of love
Night winds seem to have gone to rest
Two eyes, brightly with love are gleaming
Come to my arms, my darling, my sweetheart, my own
Vow that you'll love me always, be mine alone

Deep night, whispering trees above
Kind night, bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer
Deep night, deep in the arms of love
Come to my arms, my darling, my sweetheart, my own
Vow that you'll love me always, and be mine alone

Deep night, whispering trees above
Kind night, bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer
Deep night, deep in the arms of love
Written by Peter Green

Watch out for me, woman
And don't mind nobody else
Watch out for me, woman
And don't mind nobody else
Ain't got no crystal ball
But the future ain't hard to tell

Break:

I love the woman
I just can't stand to leave her be
I love the woman
I just can't stand to leave her be
Now we got to get married
An' might even raise a whole family

Watch out for me, woman, an'
And don't mind nobody else
Watch out for me, woman
And don't mind nobody else
Ain't got no crystal ball
But the future - ain't hard to tell
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must the white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?

Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they are forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?

Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take 'til he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Ever since the world begin
Man have received the right to live from god above
But there is only right that you can give
That is the right for me to have your love

That's why I'm gonna sit in till you give in
And give me all your love
That's why I'm gonna sit in till you give in
And give me all your love

No use resisting i'll keep insisting
Stop your conniving girl I ain't jiving
I'm gonna sit in till you give in
And give me all your love

No use resisting i'll keep insisting
Stop your conniving girl I ain't jiving
I'm gonna sit in till you give in
And give me all your love

Night time day time sunshine or rain
I'll be ridin that freedom train
I'm gonna sit in till you give in
And give me all your love
I'm gonna sit in till you give in
And give me all your love
I'm gonna sit in till you give in
And give me all your love

Tonight at eight in the morning at four
You'll find me sitting at your front door
I'm gonna sit in till you give in
And give me all your love

Tonight at eight in the morning at four
You'll find me sitting at your front door
I'm gonna sit in till you give in
And give me all your love

[Verse 1: Shawn Stockman]
I hurt so bad each time I see you walk away with him
It's obvious he's trying not to but he notices
Stuck in this dream between you and me
He'd have to be blind not to see, oh oh
He doesn't treat you right or give you what your heart deserves
I wanna treat you like a queen and always put you first
I'll be your king, together we'll be royalty
We can rule the world

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris, Boyz II Men]
(Don't you know)
I'll never stop loving you, girl (Oh no, oh no)
Baby, all you gotta do is say the word
And I'll be by your side
And I'll be right there
I will never ever let you down I swear
Just imagine how good our life can be
Bringing all your dreams into reality
I will give you the world, I will give you love
Never let you down because

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
At the end of the day (At the end of the day)
When it's all said and done (When it's all said and done)
When it comes right down to it (Down to it)
Baby, you're the one (You're the one)
You're the one I want (You're the one)
At the end of the road
When it's all said and done (When it's all said and done)
When it comes right down to it (Down to it)
Baby, you're the one (You're the one)
You're the one I want (You're the one)

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
Go on and let go of his hand and try a better man
I wanna take you all around the world and back again
Places to see, we'll make memories
We're gonna remember forever, ooh
He doesn't understand the way a woman needs to feel
I wonder if he even notices your sex appeal
It's so obvious, you're taking my breath away
I need to get a chance, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris, Boyz II Men]
(Don't you know)
And I'll never stop loving you, girl (Oh no, oh no)
Baby, all you gotta do is say the word
And I'll be by your side
And I'll be right there
I will never ever let you down I swear
Just imagine how good our life can be
Bringing all your dreams into reality
I will give you the world, I will give you love
Never let you down because

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
At the end of the day (At the end of the day)
When it's all said and done (When it's all said and done)
When it comes right down to it (Down to it)
Baby you're the one (You're the one)
You're the one I want (You're the one)
At the end of the road
When it's all said and done (When it's all said and done)
When it comes right down to it (Down to it)
Baby, you're the one (You're the one)
You're the one I want (You're the one)

[Bridge: Boyz II Men]
At the end of the day, I've been searching for somebody like you
(For so long)
Now there's only one thing standing in between true love
Girl, you gotta tell your man to step away
It'll be okay, trust me
Girl, you'll see

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
At the end of the day (At the end of the day)
When it's all said and done (When it's all said and done)
When it comes right down to it (Down to it)
Baby, you're the one (You're the one)
You're the one I want
At the end of the road (At the end of the road)
When it's all said and done
When it comes right down to it (Down to it)
Baby, you're the one
You're the one I want (Baby, you're the one)
At the end of the day (At the end of the day)
When it's all said and done (When it's all said and done)
When it comes right down to it (Down to it)
Baby you're the one
You're the one I want
At the end of the road
When it's all said and done (When it's all said and done)
When it comes right down to it (Down to it)
Baby, you're the one (Baby, you're the one)
You're the one I want

[Outro: Wanya Morris]
Baby, you're the one I want, yeah
Oh, ah, yeah, ah yeah, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah, baby, you're the one, yeah
Dreams of you, dreams of you
Are so fine, so fine, baby
Since I woke up
So is my state of mind
Since we've been apart, baby
God has healed my heart
Used to go out looking for love
Now love is looking for me
And sweet music keeps me happy
Not so long ago, darling, I was feeling sad
Who would've kissed my lips
I would've still felt bad, ah baby
There were times I've wondered if I was insane
Ah baby, I simply let my tear drop fall like rain
Oh baby, but when I kiss your lips
The clouds begin to roll away
Uh, down to my finger tips
I feel the happiness each day
Oh, my Mama said to me
She told me, son love goes where you take it
So, stay with the spirit, boy
I feel that you gonna make it, yeah
Got me wondering, yeah
'Cause music's been my therapy
Taking the pain from all my anatomy
Music has never let me down
It's my symphony, always stayin' in me
Who'd know that the world ain't right, ah baby
Lots of people uptight
I'll go crazy if something ever happened to my musical thrill
And darling your love is just like music
Music is the soul of the man
Music makes a happy day
Music makes the clouds roll by, baby
Your music kissed my tears and set my eyes
Your music makes me want to sing
Your music is a joy to bring
Music is my heart and soul
It's more precious than gold
You're like a song in my heart
I love every part
A song, you're like a song
Happiness today is just a song away, just a song
I love your music, baby
I don't worry 'bout a thing
Oh, turn on your music, baby
See my happiness beam
Your love is music
Oh my darling, yeah
Your love is music, ah baby, yeah
And music is my life
Turn on some music more
Hey, turn on some music more
I got my music, hey, hey
I love my music, hey
We need the music
I got my music, hey
I love the music, oh
Turn on some music
Get off the music, ah
Turn up the music
Let's have the music, ha
Strange things have happened
Like never happened before
My baby told me
I would have to go
I can't be good no more
Like I once did before
I can't be good no more, baby
Honey, because the world is goin' wrong

Feel bad this morning
Ain't got no home
No use to worry
'Cause the whole world is goin' wrong
I can't be good no more
Once like I did before
I can't be good no more, baby
Honey, because the world is goin' wrong

I told you, baby
Right to your head
If I didn't leave you
I would have to kill you dead
I can't be good no more
Once like I did before
I can't be good no more, baby
Honey, because the world is goin' wrong
If you have a woman
And she won't be kind
Praise to the Good Lord
To get her off of your mind
I can't be good no more
Once like I did before
I can't be good no more, baby
'Cause the world is goin' wrong

When you've been good
You can't do no more
Just tell her kindly
"There's the front door."
I can't be good no more
Once like I did before
I can't be good no more, baby
Honey, 'cause the world is goin' wrong

Just pack up my suitcase
And give me my hat
I ain't no need to ask you, love(?)
I ain't coming back
I can't be good no more
Honey, like I once did before
I can't be good no more, baby
Honey, 'cause the world is goin' wrong

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
Politicians come to power, take it slow
People need, what you know
You're a leader so you have to play along
Show the hand, right or wrong
When you're feelin' that you know the way to turn
Either way, still get burned
It's the pride that makes you feel that you belong
It's the pride, that keeps you strong

[Chorus: Ronald Isley, The Isley Brothers]
Don't you think it's fascinating? Yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't you think it's fascinating?
It's the pride that you feel, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)
It's the pride that you feel, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
What makes you want to do the best you can?
What makes you, a better man?
What makes you try again before too long?
What keeps you, standing strong?
What makes you say the things you wanna say
To make it a better day?
It's the pride that makes you feel that you belong
It's the pride that keeps you strong

[Chorus: Ronald Isley, The Isley Brothers]
Don't you think it's fascinating? Yeah, yeah
Don't you think it's fascinating? Oh, oh, oh
It's the pride that you feel, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)
It's the pride that you feel, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down it s the pride)
Oh, it's the pride that you feel, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)
When you finally break it all down, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)
Oh, it's the pride that you feel, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)
When you finally break it all down, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)
Oh, it's the pride that you feel, it's the pride
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)
(When you finally break it all down, it's the pride)

[Instrumental break]

[Outro: The Isley Brothers]
When you finally break it all down, it's the pride
When you finally break it all down, it's the pride
When you finally break it all down, it's the pride
When you finally break it all down, it's the pride
When you finally break it all down, it's the pride
When you finally break it all down, it's the pride
When you finally break it all down, it's the pride
When you finally break it all down, it's the pride
When you finally break it all down, it's the pride
When you finally break it all down, it's the pride
When you finally break it all down, it's the pride
When you finally break it all down, it's the pride
Sinking ships
Watching them sail and the sun as sinks in the sea
Crashing planes
Only the eyes of the doomed with a smile on their face

So I say to myself Is it real?
So I look inside myself
Can I feel?

Coloured cups
Windows that slide up and down with a squeak in the side
Funny day
Banging the door to a close as it's hurting my knee
Thought I heard a blackbird singin'
Up on Bluebird Hill
Call me a whinin' boy if you will
Born where the sun don't shine
And I don't deny my name
Got no place to go, ain't that a shame?

Thought I heard that KC whistle
Moanin' sweet & low
Thought I heard that KC when she blow
Down where the sun don't shine
Underneath the Kokomo
Whinin' boy -- got no place else to go

So many roads I tell you
So many roads I know
So many roads --
So many roads --
Mountain high, river wide
So many roads to ride
So many roads
So many roads
Thought I heard a jug band playin'
"If you don't -- who else will?"
From over on the far side of the hill
All I know the sun don't shine
The rain refuse to fall
And you don't seem to hear me when I call

Wind inside & the wind outside
Tangled in the window blind
Tell me why you treat me so unkind
Down where the sun don't shine
Lonely and I call your name
No place left to go, ain't that a shame?

So many roads I tell you
New York to San Francisco
All I want is one
To take me home
From the high road to the low
So many roads I know
So many roads - So many roads

From the land of the midnight sun
Where ice blue roses grow
'long those roads of gold and silver snow
Howlin' wide or moanin low
So many roads I know
So many roads to ease my soul
Who wants to be a millionaire? I don't
Have flashy flunkies everywhere? I don't
Who wants the bother of a country estate?
A country estate is something I'd hate

Who wants to wallow in champagne? I don't
Who wants a supersonic plane? I don't
Who wants a private landing feel through? I don't
And I don't 'cause all I want is you

Who wants to be a millionaire? I don't
Who wants uranium to spare? I don't
Who wants to journey on a gigantic yacht?
Do I want a yacht? Oh, how I do not

Who wants a fancy foreign car? I don't
Who wants to tire of caviar?
Who wants a marble swimming pool too? I don't
And I don't 'cause all I want is you

Who wants to be a millionaire? I don't
And go to every swell affair?
Who wants to ride behind a liveried chauffeur?
A liveried chauffeur, do I want? No sir
Who wants an opera box I'll bet? I don't
And sleep through Wagner at the met? I don't
Who wants to corner Cartiers too? I don't
And I don't 'cause all I want is you

One heart (One heart)
Let's join together and I'll feel all right (Let's join together and I'll feel all right)

So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom
Have pity on those whose chances grows thinner
There ain't no hiding place when the King comes along, yes

Hear my plea
(One heart)

You can't see the sun when you're crying
A tear can hide the brightest sky blue
You can't hear a song when you're sighing
No matter how the birds sing for you

Suppose you make believe your eyes were cloudy window pane
I'm sure you'd clean them up to look for rainbow when it rains
You can't see the sun when you're crying
So smile and let the sun shine through

Suppose you make believe your eyes were cloudy window pane
I'm sure you'd clean them up to look for rainbows when it rains
You can't see the sun when you're crying
So, smile and let the sun shine through
Like a resstless leaf
In the autumn breeze, once i was a tumbleweed
Like a rolling stone cold all alone
Living for the day my dream would come
Never cared for school, or any golden rules
Papa used to all ways say I was a useless fool
So I left my home to show him they was wrong
And headed out on the road singing my song
Then one sunny day, the man he looked my way
And everything I dreamed of it was real
Money, girls and cars, and big long cigars
And i caught the first plane home so papa could see...

When I went home to show him they was wrong
All that i found was two tombstones
Somebody tell me please was i right or wrong
Woa it's such a sad song
First i got lost then i got found
But the ones that i love were in the ground
Papa i only wish you could see me now
Take a listen papa....
Oooh I learned how to play my guitar
Gunna be a superstar
*Instrumental*

...play one for mama now

*Instrumental*

(female backups)
First I got lost, then I got found
The ones that I loved were in the ground
Won't you tell me please was I right or wrong?

If there is any way, you can hear what i say
Papa I never meant to do ya no wrong
All the money, girls, and cars, and all the world's big long cigars
Papa I just want you to know they couldn't take your place.....

When I went home to show them they was wrong
All that i found was a two tombstones
Sombody tell me please was i right or wrong
Lord it's such a sad song
First I got lost
Then I got found
The ones that i loved were in the ground
Somebody tell me please was i right or wrong
Do I worry 'cause you're stepping out
Do I worry 'cause you've got me in doubt
Though your kisses aren't right
Do I give a bag of beans
Do I stay home every night
And read my magazines

Am I frantic 'cause we've lost the spark
Is there panic when it starts turning dark
And when evening shadows creep
Do I lose any sleep over you
Do I worry, you can bet your life I do
I walk in my bedroom floor
I hung my head and cry
I gotta find my baby
You know I can‘t be satisfied
I gotta find my baby
I declare I wouldn't lie
You know if I don‘t find my baby
I believe I‘m gonna lose my mind

Yeah she‘s a fine lookin' woman
Her shape is a dream
She‘s the loveliest woman people
I declare I ever seen
I gotta find my baby
I declare I wouldn't lie
You know if I don‘t find my baby
I believe I‘m gonna lose my mind

I walk in my bedroom floor
Hung down my head and cry
You know I'm crazy 'bout my woman
And I just can‘t be satisfied
I gotta find my baby
I declare I wouldn't lie
You know if I don‘t find my baby
I believe I‘m gonna lose my mind
You know I got to got to
I got to find my baby
Hey yes I say
I gotta find my woman
I gotta find my woman
If I don't find my woman
I think I‘m going out of my mind
Till the morning comes
It'll do you fine
Till the morning comes
Like a highway sign
Showin' you the way
Leavin' no doubt
Of the way on in or the way back out

Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

Till we all fall down
It'll do you fine
Don't think about
What you left behind
The way you came
Or the way you go
Let your tracks be lost in the dark and snow
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

When the shadows grow
It'll do you fine
When the cold winds blow
It'll ease your mind
The shape it takes
Could be yours to choose
What you may win, what you may lose

Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy

[Verse 1]
You, you'd fall in love with anyone
I think you'd fall in love with anyone
Who fell in love with you
And they frequently do

So take comfort
Cruel comfort
Before you start to wonder
How you got locked inside your room

[Chorus]
And how long will it
Take before you start to hate yourself and go
Straight to the arms of someone else and I'll just
Wait 'til those arms belong to me and I'm not
Saying that you love me
I'm not saying any
Thing

[Verse 2]
Tell me, do you let them down gently
Does it only make it harder
To let the feeling linger
To drag it out a little longer
Does it put your mind at ease?
But you're the one who brought 'em here
You're the one who has to take 'em when you leave

[Chorus]
And how long will it
Take before you start to hate yourself and go
Straight to the arms of someone else and I'll just
Wait 'til those arms belong to me and I'm not
Saying that you love me
I'm not saying any
Thing

[Chorus]
And how long will it
Take before you start to hate yourself and go
Straight to the arms of someone else and I'll just
Wait 'til those arms belong to me and I'm not
Saying that you' love me
I'm not saying any
She's got so much blues
Her best friend can't help her
Her best friends a woman
How can a woman help her
Woman's got the blues

She just feels like crying
She just feels like dying
Woman's got the blues

She just feels like dying
She just feels like crying
Woman's got the blues
Woman's got the blues
I do not talk, I am just a rapper

Sick boy make moves like a chess piece
And that move real quick like Nestle
Let me make it clear for a second like Pepsi
I was never worried bout my wallet bein empty
Cause when it was empty, I was still happy
Walkin with my Walkman, freestyle rappin
High school bullies like what the fuck happened
Nigga off the hook like I fuckin shot the captain

And this is me relaxing, rapping is my hobby
I did this in my bedroom where I separate my laundry
Watchin old episodes of Shining Time Station
You are now listening to my mouth on vacation (ation)
Why you doing this, what's your motivation?
I am just a rapper, I don't need the paper
No Will Smith went off without a hitch man
C-H-I-L-D it's the ISH man
Do sixteen bars no wristband
I'll always be childish, call me Maggie Simpson
Run the track like my tongue's an Olympian
I've always been this good, you just weren't listening
Imma try to make my street cred stack up
I mean I'm rapping over Grizzly Bear, what the fuck
Gather swagger up, before I take it all
You started rapping when you wasn't good at basketball
I started rapping cause I fucking need some Adderall
I can't do one thing, I'm just too good
I can't do one thing, I am Tiger Woods
I make you iPod hotter than a lighter would

Picture me in sixth grade, overweight, overbite
Got my fake Adidas on, whiting out the fourth stripe
Kid named Vincent got it out for me, I hate that guy
Frodo from Chicago, really small and shy
You better recognize, cause I'm no better now
Cause I was always sick, my life's a hospital
And that's some funny shit, that turd is Apatow
That female dog is blind, well bitch look at me now!

I'm wearing tight jeans, and nobody's laughing
More pussy than recycled sanitary napkins
Bitch sitting shotgun in my Tracy Chapman
I did exactly what you niggas said would never happen

I'm doing me so big I can hardly walk
These rappers need ER like they're Charlie Park
Stay hard like my suit made by Tony Stark
This kinda music make your balls drop, Dick Clark
Yes I'm grown and sexy, and I'm worth the wait
Girls act like I'm the only dude on earth to date
Put these words on your head and let them percolate
We need to separate church and state
I used to have to pay for gas in my momma's Saturn
And now I'm paying for a mortgage as a working actor
If living my life is what you say you're chasing after
Nigga stop talking shit and just be a rapper (be a rapper)
Ready - set - go man go
I got a gal that I love so

I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready ready ready to rock 'n' roll

Goin' down to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie

She's my rock 'n' roll baby, she's the apple of my eye (chorus)
Well, the flat top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumpin', the cats are goin' wild

The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style (chorus)
Gonna kick off my shoes, roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock 'n' roll baby, pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left, I shuffle to the right
Gonna rock 'n' roll 'til the early early night
'Twas in the merry month of May
When green buds all were swelling
Sweet William on his death bed lay
For love of Barbara Allen

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling
Saying you must come, to my master dear
If your name be Barbara Allen

So slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she drew nigh him
And the only words to him did say
"Young man, I think you're dying"

He turned his face unto the wall
And death was in him welling
Goodbye, goodbye, to my friends all
Be good to Barbara Allen

When he was dead and laid in grave
She heard the death bells knelling
And every stroke to her did say
Hard-hearted Barbara Allen
Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow
Sweet William died of love for me
And I will die of sorrow

And father, oh father, go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow
Sweet William died on yesterday
And I will die tomorrow

Barbara Allen was buried in the old churchyard
Sweet William was buried beside her
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar

They grew and grew in the old churchyard
Till they could grow no higher
At the end they formed, a true lover's knot
And the rose grew round the briar
Into outer space with Lucia Pamela
The moon is the place where there's space for Lucia
Into outer space with Lucia Pamela
The moon is the place where there's place for Lucia

Before Armstrong took his steps
She'd been there with friends
They took all instruments and
Recorded on the moon
Gathered variety of sounds
From where the air is different

I'm so full of ideas
And here is a good one
Lucia has a dream
A dream that comes in colour of
International colouring
For your entry she's waiting

Into outer space with Lucia Pamela
The moon is the place where there's space for Lucia
Into outer space with Lucia Pamela
The moon is the place where there's space for Lucia

[Chorus]
Angelique-O, Angelique-O
Your mama got to take you back
Angelique-O, Angelique-O
Teach you all the things you lack
Angelique-O, Angelique-O
Your mama got to take you back
Angelique-O, Angelique-O
Teach you all the things you lack

[Verse 1]
He never got time to sweep the dirt
Mama got to take you back
He never got time to wash a shirt
Mama got to take you back
He never got time to cut and peel
Mama got to take you back
You think you can make it on sex appeal
Mama got to take you back

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama's got to take you back
Teach you all the things you lack
When she sends you back to me
We'll live together in harmony

[Chorus]
Angelique-O, Angelique-O
Your mama got to take you back
Angelique-O, Angelique-O
Teach you all the things you lack
Angelique-O, Angelique-O

[Verse 2]
He never learned how to make a stew
Mama got to take you back
Your biscuits, Lord, I can hardly chew
Mama got to take you back
De pants I'm wearing is full of holes
Your mama got to take you back
While you're running around in a big mink stole
Mama got to take you back

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama's got to take you back
Teach you all the things you lack
When she sends you back to me
We'll live together in harmony

[Chorus]
Angelique-O, Angelique-O
Your mama got to take you back
Angelique-O, Angelique-O
Teach you all the things you lack
Angelique-O, Angelique-O
Your mama got to take you back
Angelique-O, Angelique-O
Teach you all the things you lack
I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand
Walking thru the streets of Soho in the rain
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fook's
Going to get himself a big dish of beef chow mein
Hi ho, the werewolves of London
If you hear his howling around the kitchen door
You better not let him in
Little old lady got mutilated last nite
Werewolves of London again
Hi ho, werewolves of London
He's the hairy-handed gent who ran amuck in Kent
Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair
You better stay away from him, he'll rip your lungs out Jim
I'd like to meet his tailor
Hi ho, werewolves of London
Well, I saw Lon Cheney walking with the Queen
Doing the werewolves of London
I saw Lon Cheney Jr. walking with the Queen
I saw a werewolf dringing a pina colada at Trader Vic's
And his hair was perfect
Hi ho, the werewolves of London, draw blood
Traditional Gaelic/John Morris
In this quiet place I stand alone
From my homeland far away
And my empty heart cannot recall
The forgotten dreams that brought me joy

Had I ways to shed the wasted years
I would travel to my kin
And with strength and faith in God above
There in Ireland I would gladly die
Baby

While the Angelus was ringing, calling for the evening pray'r
I could hear the choir singing and I saw you standing there
Silently I stood beside you, how my heart was beating then
For my dreams have all come true, I was safely back with you
Never more to roam again
Then the great cathedral spire seemed to come alive and say
Through the voices of the choir, there will be a wedding day
Then a golden ray of sunlight, from a window in the sky
Shone upon us from above, heaven's blessing on our love
Now our love will never die

Then a golden ray of sunlight, from a window in the sky
Shone upon us from above, heaven's blessing on our love
Now our love will never die
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us
Somewhere
There's a time for us
Some day a time for us
Time together with time spare
Time to look, time to care
Some day!
Somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere
There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're half way there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow
Some day
Somewhere
The girl that I marry will have to be
As soft and as pink as a nursery
The girl I call my own
Will wear satins and laces and smell of cologne

Her nails will be polished and, in her hair
She'll wear a gardenia and I'll be there
`stead of flittin', I'll be sittin'
Next to her and she'll purr like a kitten

A doll I can carry, the girl that I marry must be

Her nails will be polished and, in her hair
She'll wear a gardenia and I'll be there
`stead of flittin', I'll be sittin'
Next to her and she'll purr like a kitten

A doll I can carry, the girl that I marry must be
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell

She had sweethearts a-plenty and men of high degree
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be
Oh, her true love e'er to be

"Oh daughter, oh daughter, your body I will confine
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind
Oh, would ever suit your mind

"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine
Oh, would have this heart of mine

Now Jackie's gone sailing with trouble on his mind
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind

She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away
"Before you step onboard, sir, your name I'd like to know."
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."

"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannonball

"I know my waist is slender and my fingers they are small
But they would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."

The war soon being over, they hunted all around
Among the dead and dying her darling love she found
Oh, her darling love she found

She picked him up all in her arms and carries him to town
And sent for her physician to quickly heal his wounds
Oh, to quickly heal his wounds

This couple, they got married, so well they did agree
This couple they got married, so why not you and me
Oh, so why not you and me
Where I live in the desert, it's so peaceful and warm
And the cares of the world drift by, like clouds reflected in a quiet pool
But there always comes a time, when a man has to think of the future
(War, war, war!) Has to think of his children, (war, war, war!)
And the world they will live in (war, war, war, war!)
I'm not sure if I can do anything to help them, but I can try, I can try
Time to build us a fire, seven hundred feet high
We can fashion a fire (fire) that will reach the sky (reach the sky)
We can feed the flames with the unkind deeds we've done (with the fire)
'Cause we've got to get ready, for World War None
(What we want is to burn our sins in a sort of furnace,)
(We'll be stoking the fire with the lies we know)
All our false suspicions we can burn them one by one
That will help us get ready for World War None
(A little love is more effective than a rifle,)
(A little faith will take you farther than it can)
(The rule we follow is the one forever spoken)
(They haven't got the truth on their lips)
Keep on feeding the fire, till the fire is hot
With those un-neighborly feelings we deny we've got
Keep on trying for peace, until that peace is won
Then you're practically ready for World War None
(A whispered word or touch is louder than a bugle)
(A silent prayer is so much stronger than a sword,)
(And the bombs that can't replace the stained glass window)
For which we should thank the good Lord, thank the good Lord)
(Thank you, thank you, thank you)
If we cherish our fire (if we cherish our fire)
It could possibly be (it could possibly be)
Bright enough to be seen, (bright enough to be seen)
Far across the sea (far across the sea)
When those other countries (when those other countries)
See what we have done (what we've done)
Maybe they'll help us get ready (get ready, get ready)
For World War None
(World War None!)
Did you know
All my reserve was just pretend?
Did you know
I was only posin' as your friend?
Did you know?

Did my eyes play on your face too long?
Did they say how much I needed you?
Did the words I try to say in jest
Seem to come out soundin? much too true?

Did you know
Could you see through my disguise?
Did you know
Or does my love come as a surprise?
Did you know?

I can't believe you haven't guessed
They was much too much coincidence
All those times we met by chance
All where my un-purpose accidents
Did you know?
Doesn't matter anyway
Did you know
Someone else has said the things?
I want to say

So I'll go, I never should have waited 'round
In hopes that you would finally see
But in case I get a second chance
Now you know just what you mean to me
Did you know?

[Verse]
Dddd-doctor ffff-funkenstein
We love you doctor funkenstein
Your funk is the best
Take my body, give it a ride
Don't fuck with the rest
We love you doctor funkenstein
Your funk is the best
Take my body, give it a ride
Don't fuck with the rest
No, yeah, yeah
Shut up!

[Verse 1]
Hey Jack, I better shake it off
Put her out of my head
The thinking of all, just another young girl last night

Oh brother! I left a woman
In that morning day
Been on that trip so many times
Good-God! was really yesterday

I've tried so many, many, many, many, many
Many ways
I've lied and taken off into the day
Leaving another girl to
Weep over the breakfast tray
Loved her before I knew her name
Hit me! Jack, 'cause I'm
Gone! love her way

[Chorus]
Come back, my babe
Come back my babe
Feel holy again, I gave her

[I gave her] oww, baby, baby
Gotta give her, oww, baby, baby
That kind of love
Can only destroy
I gave her, oww, baby, baby
Gettin' down, if I'm gonna be, the baby wants it
Gonna be me

[It's gonna be me]

[Verse 2]
There was no rein to check me
When all tho-ose little things walked on by
Oh! but I couldn't feel this, stammer out a word
When that angel stuck in my mind
Oo, oo, oo, oo
Lookin' for love won't hold me back

[No!]
I'm gonna love her way

[Chorus]
Come back my babe
Feel holy again
I gave her
Gotta give it, love
Oww, baby, baby

That kind of love
Can only destroy
I gave her, oww, baby, baby
Gotta get it now, If I'm
Gonna be her baby
It's gonna be me, yeah

[saxophone solo]

[Verse 3]
Just playing that latest record
Waitin' for the telephone to ring
Wiped-out and bitter, with a
Bag clutched in her hand
All the cars sound like they're
Pulling in the drive
Umm, no, no, no, no, no, uhh

I see her now
A little tear running down her check
Laugh! Let down
People looking for me

[Bridge]
I want to race down her street
And knock hard, hard, hard on the door 'til
Until she breaks down in my arms like a
Treasured toy and I feel the pain
I'll be so strong again and again

[Chorus]
Come back my baby, yeah
I'm holy again
I'll take ya, oww, babe, baby, baby
We're gonna have, oww, baby, baby
My kind of love
Can only bring you joy
I'm gonna, oww, baby
Yeah, got far
Give you, baby, baby
'Cause it's gonna be me 

[It's gonna be me]
Umm, hmm, hmm

[Verse 1]
The first love of your life wasn't true to you and it broke your little heart
He loved you, then he left you, confused, misused and in the dark
Won't you let me walk into your world of darkness and confusion?
Let me show you there's another side to love that's more than a sweet illusion

[Verse 2]
If you just believe, just believe in love again
You'll find there's two sides to love and what you experienced wasn't the real thing
'Cause true love is an emotion that can soothe your very soul
It brings joy to a heart of sadness and warmth to a life grown cold

[Bridge]
Don't give it up
Don't hang your head down
Life can be beautiful
Just open your heart, stretch out your arms
Let love work a miracle
Though your dreams are shattered and torn
Girl all your dreams can be reborn
'Cause it's never to late for your dream to come true

[Verse 3]
Just believe, just believe in a heart that's true
You'll find there's two sides to love and all my love it's so true it won't make you blue
'Cause true love won't bring troubles, it would bathe your troubles away
It will ne're leave every dark cloud in the light and make room for a brighter day
Two sides to love
Let me show you the other side
What you saw was the bad side
Let me show you the real side
Let me show you the true side
It makes me giggle
It makes me giggle
Just havin' my baby around me
It makes me giggle
Sometimes I wiggle
‘Cause I'm so glad she found me
Sometimes I wake up feelin' crabby
She gives me love as sweet as candy

It makes me giggle
It makes me giggle
Everytime I see my little boy child
It makes me giggle
Sometimes I wiggle
Sometimes I even jump for joy, child
He knows just how to make me happy
He gives me love and calls me Daddy

If I ever felt better I can't seem to recall
It just blows me away to be part of it all
It makes me giggle
It makes me giggle
Just singin' these love songs for you
It makes me giggle
Sometimes I wiggle
There ain't nothin' that I'd rather do
I'd like to give one to the whole human race

If I ever felt better I can't seem to recall
It just blows me away to be part of it all

I feel the ocean swaying me ...
Washing away all my pains
See where I was wounded
Remember the scar ?
Now you can't see a thing ...
And I feel no pain --

Singing about the Valley of Sunsets
Green and blue ... Canyons too
Singing about Atlantis love songs
The Valleys of Neptune is arising

Mercury liquid ... Emerald's shining
Telling me where I came from --
Honey Sun ... Pourquise Bed he
Lays in -- ... on the Burning
Edge Horizon
I'm sailing on the Bluebird's mission ...
Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam --
See the wind make love to all
The ocean ... Joy spread and
The massage got home --

Singing about the Valley of Sunsets ...
Purple and gold ... the Armies of the Lord
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips ...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising --

Look out East coast, but you're
Gonna have a neighbor
A rebirth land ...
The praying Burning Sands

We know there were worlds
So much older ...
And they shall rise, and
Tell us much more the truth of man --

I see visions of sleeping peaks
Erupting ...
Releasing all hell that
Will shake the Earth from end to end --
And this ain't bad news, good news
Or any news ... it's just the truth
Better save your souls while
You can --
Singing about the New Valleys
Of the Sunrise ... Rainbow clean
The world is gonna be ...
Singing about getting ready for the new tide ...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm
And your arm, but I'm lookin' for the one. Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have an ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
I gotta take all they bad a** to ShowBiz
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, we all got up in
They all went to din and then I had to pay
If you f***in' with this girl then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard, she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to f*** with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

[Chorus: Kanye West & Ray Charles]

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of yo' kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
Baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV, any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, GEICO for your money
Uh, if you ain't no punk
Holla, "We want prenup" (We want prenup!)

It's just another lazy summer afternoon
Summer breeze blowing into my bedroom
Before I even put my feet on the floor
I start strumming the chords on my guitar
It's just a C sharp minor, to the B major
It sounds kinda like the summer breeze to me
And it makes me want to sing
It ain't complicated
Just a little syncopating
Maybe it's understated but I like it, I like it, oh
It's just a simple song
It's not gonna hurt if you sing along
Maybe if it moves you, you can dance
Cause all you really really want
Is a tune you can hum till the break of dawn
And everybody knows that it's the jam
And it goes a little something like
Lalalalalalaa
It's just a simple song
Lalalalalalaa
Everybody sing along
Lalalalalalaa, lalalala, yeah
It's just another crazy Friday night
All my friends hanging on the beach round the bonfire
Someone writing on guitar, and they knew the chord
It's just a C sharp minor, to the B major
It sounds really good with the ocean waves
And it makes everybody sing
It ain't complicated
Just a little syncopating
Maybe it's understated but I like it, I like it, oh
It's just a simple song
It's not gonna hurt if you sing along
Maybe if it moves you, you can dance
Cause all you really really want
Is a tune you can hum till the break of dawn
And everybody knows that it's the jam
And it goes a little something like
Lalalalalalaa
It's just a simple song
Lalalalalaa
Everybody sing along
Lalalalalalaa, lalalala, yeah
Lalalalala, it's just a simple song
Ooooh, yeah, yeah. Oh
It's just a simple song, oh yeah
Ooh
It's just another simple song
It still sounds good if you sing it wrong
Maybe you can move so you can dance
Cause all you really really want is a tune you can sing till the break of dawn
And everybody knows that it's the jam
And it goes a little something like
Lalalalalalaa, 3 chords and a melody
Lalalalalaa, it's just a simple song
Lalalalalalaa, lalalalalaa
Lalalalalaa, and this is my simple song
Love may be a gamble or a lead pipe cinch
Leave your heart a shambles, never give an inch
But however it goes, when it's under your nose
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance

Love may be a fire or a puff of smoke
Moment of desire or it's go-for-broke
But however it's planned, when it's close as your hand
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance

You may be the one in a million
Who's lucky to win that prize
You may be the one in a million
Who gets it between the eyes

Love may be the ocean or a drop of rain
Soothing as a lotion or a constant pain
You won't know what you've got till your heart's on a spot
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance

Love may be a double or a base on balls
Tiny water buffalo on Niagara Falls
Though the cards in the game never turn up the same
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance
Love may be a Grable or a two-ton truck
Regal as a sable or a Donald Duck
But you mustn't avoid what's as basic as Freud
Take a chance, take a chance, yeah

Love is real devotion or it's inhumane
Still without emotion or a hurricane
So remembering this, when it's close as a kiss
Take a chance, take a chance on love
Here's your chance, grab that chance, here is love

So you lost your trust
And you never should have
But you never should have
But don't break your back
If you ever see this
But don't answer life
In a bullet proof vest
With the windows all closed
I'll be doing my best
I'll see you soon
In a telescope lens
And when all you want is friends
I see you soon
So they came for you
They came snapping at your heels
They come snapping at your heels
But don't break your back
If you ever say this
But don't answer life
In a bullet proof vest
With the windows all closed
I'll be doing my best
I'll see you soon
In a telescope lens
And when all you want is friends
I see you soon
I see you soon
And oh, you lost your trust
And oh, you lost your trust
No, don't lose your trust
And oh, you lost your trust
I was last in line
For the one true vine
Endless winding prayer
I was dead at first
I had done my worst
And you came to me
Life had ceased
I was lost and tired
You set me free
From this mighty, mighty fire
Just in time to be
My one true vine
You still come to me
And you comfort me
The only one that I believe
I trust you
I hope that someday you will
Trust me too
I wanna be what you are to me
Life had ceased
I was lost and tired
You set me free from
This mighty, mighty fire
Just in time to be
My one true vine
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hotspot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They took all the trees, put them in a tree museum
And they charged the people
A dollar and a half just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

I said, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Ah ha ha ha
One, two, three

Now I'll tell you plainly baby, what I plan to do
Say I may be crazy woman, but I ain't no fool
Your daddy's rich mama, you're overdue
Now I ain't the one baby, been messin' with you
Got bells in your mind lady, and it's easy to see-uh
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe

Aww, you're tryin' to put a hook in me, baby, oh, no

Now you're talkin' jive woman, when you say to me
That your daddy's gonna take us in baby, take care of me
You know and I know woman, I ain't the one
I never hurt you sweetheart, I never pulled my gun
Got bells in your mind mama, and it's easy to see-uh
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe

Time for me to put my boots out in the street missy
Are you ready boots?
Walk on!
Well now alright there missy
Let me tell you a thing or two
How about it baby?

Now you're talkin' jive woman, when you say to me
That your daddy's gonna take us in baby, take care of me
You know and I know woman, I ain't the one
I never hurt you sweetheart, I never pulled my gun
Got bells in your mind mama, and it's easy to see-uh
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe

Oh, I must be in the middle of some kinda conspiracy

Ohhh, nooo!

Wooooo!

[Verse 1]
You could be my silver spring
Blue green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn ocean crashing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And did you say she was pretty?
And did you say that she loves you?
Baby, I don't want to know

[Verse 2]
I'll begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I said I loved you years ago
I tell myself you never loved me, no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And did you say she was pretty?
And did you say that she loves you?
Baby, I don't want to know

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no
And can you tell me, was it worth it?
Really I don't want to know

[Chorus]
Time casts its spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Time casts its spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

[Bridge]
I'll follow you down
'Til the sound of my voice will haunt you
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loves you
I'll follow you down
'Til the sound of my voice will haunt you
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loves you
I'll follow you down
'Til the sound of my voice will haunt you
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loves you

[Outro]
You could be my silver spring
Blue green colors flashing
It was a day in that blue month September
Silent beneath the plum trees' slender shade
I held her there
My love, so pale and silent
As if she were a dream that must not fade

Above us in the shining summer heaven
There was a cloud my eyes dwelled long upon
It was quite white and very high above us
Then I looked up
And found that it had gone

And since that day, so many moons in silence
Have swum across the sky and gone below
The plum trees surely have been chopped for firewood
And if you ask, how does that love seem now
I must admit, I really can't remember
And yet I know what you are trying to say
But what her face was like, I know no longer
I only know I kissed it on that day
As for the kiss, I long ago forgot it
But for the cloud that floated in the sky
I know that still and shall forever know it
It was quite white and moved in very high
It may be that the plum trees still are blooming
That woman's seventh child may now be there
And yet that cloud had only bloomed for minutes
When I looked up
It vanished on the air
A world of its own
The streets where we played
The friends on every corner were the best we ever made
The backyards, and the school yards
And the trees that watched us grow
The days of love when dinner time was all you had to know
Whenever I think of yesterday
I close my eyes and see
That place Just Over The Brooklyn Bridge
That will always be home to me
It'll always be home to me
There's a land that I have heard about
So far across the sea
There's a land that I have heard about
So far across the sea

To have you all, my dreamland
Would be like heaven to me
To have you all, my dreamland
Would be like heaven to me

We'll get our breakfast from the tree
We'll get our honey from the bees
We'll take a ride on the waterfalls
And all the glories, we'll have them all

And we'll live together on that dreamland
And have so much fun
We'll live together on that dreamland
And have so much fun

Oh, what a time that will be
Oh, just you, wait, wait, wait and see
We'll count the stars up in the sky
And surely we'll never die
And surely we'll never die, oh no
And surely we'll never die
Darling, let's stop this pretending
What more is there to say?
Here's to your eyes and my final demise
Oh, Simone, it's you
I knew from the start that my easily-touched heart
Was about to go out for a ride
Conquer the room with a touch of perfume
Oh, Simone, it's you

Oh, Simone, my heart is breakin'
Yes, my dear, I think it's goin' fast
Gotta let me know
Gotta let it show, for it to last
Oh, Simone, to hold you
Dance you into the night
And on into the dawn
And on and on and on to make it right

Make it romantic, make it up I don't care
Look up and sigh even if it's a lie
Oh, Simone, what can I do?
What charm could sway me
Then burn and betray me
But thrill me the way that you do
Second to none, so completely undone
Oh, Simone, it's you
Oh, Simone, my heart is breakin'
Yes, my dear, I think it's goin' fast
Gotta let me know
Gotta let it show, for it to last
Oh, Simone, to hold you
Dance you into the night
And on into the dawn
And on and on and on to make it right

It's time they told you, it's about time you knew
Straighten your gown throw a Manhattan down
Yes, Simone, it's true
What do you think, you're foolin' somebody
Do you think that I can't see?
There's no doubt, not a trace
It's all over your face
Oh, Simone, it's me, ooh

Oh, Simone, my heart is breakin'
Yes, my dear, I think it's goin' fast
Gotta let me know
Gotta let it show, for it to last
Oh, Simone, to hold you
Dance you into the night
And on into the dawn
And on and on and on to make it right, oh
Yes, my dear, I think it's goin' fast
So tremble if you must
For the dust is still breathing
And the trees are just the leaves
On a big breathing globe
And there's life in the rocks
And the seashells are listening
To the sound of the sea
As it slips on it's way
(Intro: T.I.)
Say Foxx? (Yeah... eah... eah...)
I had-I had a chick man-
(Yeah... eah... eah...)
She went and did me real
Wrong, I mean (Yeah... eah... eah...)
I did the same thing to her but-
She ain´t have no right to do
Me like that though dawg, for
Real (Yeah... eah... eah...)

(Verse 1: Jamie Foxx)
You, been seeing him, and I know
And I was with her, and you knew about it
But I was too bli-I-ind to see it baby
And you was out here doing
The same thing as me
I wanna ask, has he been by the crib?
Has he been in our, car?
And did you let him, drive?
Cause she's been by the house
She's been in the car
I´ve even let her push the
Porsche around a couple times

And it ain´t a point to feeling blue
You´re just like me and I´m just like you
(Chorus: Jamie Foxx)
You´re just like me

Popping bottles of that Bud
Giving all them dudes hugs

(Verse 2: Jamie Foxx)
Now it ain´t so easy for me
To be imagining what you been doing baby
So I don´t even have to ask (No)
Cause you ain´t the only one
That keeping secrets baby
So really, no sense in me playing "bye"
And I, can´t stay up though
Cause I did you wrong
And I was on some kush
When I let that *** up in our home
She's out from us just like me
And she played the game
Like one of my homies
Ohh, we were so the same
I don´t know why I can see you baby
And it ain´t a point to feeling blue
You´re just like me and I´m just like you

Just like me-e-ee-e-e (In the club
Throwing ones, man she)
Just like me-e-ee-e-e (24's on the Range)
Just like me... (Go on shawty do your thang)

(Bridge: T.I.) Hey!
Shawty who you fooling?
You know I´m way too cool for you
To run that game when we play me
Trying to do me like I be doing you
Say you heard I was screwing her
Just like I hear he doing you
Why you worry about me doing me
I see you doing you
I can make her better though
You gon let him ruin you
Just for the record
Know, I wouldn't have her
Unless I could have the two of you
I know why he pursuing you
That booty do be moving boo
Late night, straight pipe
That ain´t nothing new to you
Wait a minute
Can´t tell me
Wanna tell me
Something tell me this
If I woulda never woulda hit that chick
Would you even ever know that dude existed? Naw
Got me twisted
Yo ass goodbye I´ve kissed it
Now you all on his ***
Shawty look at this ***

(Chorus: Jamie Foxx)
Just like me
Shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that Bud
Giving all them dudes hugs

She don´t know how to act
On the floor back in the back
Man I can´t be mad

An ego, you know?)

Here we all work on the Mississippi
Here we all work while the rich boys play
Getting no rest from the dawn till sunset
Getting no rest till the judgment day
You don't look up, you don't look down
You don't dare make the rich boss frown
Bend your knees and bow your heads
And tote that barge until you're dead
Let me go away from the Mississippi
Let me go away from the rich man's

Show me that stream called the river of Jordan
That's the old stream that I long to cross

He don't say nothing, but he must know something

He don't plant taters and he don't plant cotton
And then that planters are soon forgotten
But Ol' Man River, he just keeps rolling along
You know, you and me, sometimes we have to we have to sweat
Sweat and strain, our bodies all aching and wrecked with pain
Tote that barge, lift that bale, get a little drunk
And you land, you gotta land, yes you land in jail

My secret
My secret

[Verse 1: Joni Mitchell]
I'm going to take you to my special place
It's a place that you
Like no one else I know
Might appreciate

[Chorus: Joni Mitchell and Peter Gabriel]
I don't go there with anyone, but
You're a special case
For my special place
My special place
For my secret place

[Refrain: Joni Mitchell]
My secret
My secret place
For my secret place
My secret
My secret place
For my secret place

[Verse 2: Joni Mitchell]
People talk to tell you something
Or to take up space
Guess I'm only talking
To be talking to your pretty face

[Pre-Chorus: Joni Mitchell and Peter Gabriel]
I don't talk much to anyone, but
You're a special case
My special place
My secret place

[Bridge: Joni Mitchell]
I was born and raised in New York City
I'm just getting used to Colorado
Oh street bravado, carry me
Why did you bring me to a place so wild and pretty?
Are there pigeons in this park, muggers after dark?
In these golden trees in the secret place?

[Refrain: Joni Mitchell]
My secret
My secret place
For my secret place
My secret
My secret place
For my secret place

[Verse 3: Peter Gabriel and Joni Mitchell]
I'm going to take you to my special place
It's a place no amount of hurt and anger can deface
I put things back together there
It all falls right in place
In my special space
My special place

[Bridge: Joni Mitchell]
Once I saw a film in New York City
That was shot in Colorado
Girl meets desperado
In the trembling mountain trees
Out of all of the girls that you see
In bleachers and cafe windows
Sitting--flirting with someone
Looking to have some fun
Why did you pick me?
For the secret place
I got to one, two, three, four

Well now, it's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
Well, people tell me love is for fools
Here I go, I'm breaking all the rules

It seems so easy
Seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy
It's so doggone easy
Doggone easy, doggone easy, doggone easy

Oh, it's so easy

Doggone easy, doggone easy, doggone easy

Yeah, it seems so easy
Seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy

And it's so easy for you, yeah, we're gonna do it

We're gonna down by the old juke joint, man
We're gonna be playing them record
We're gonna be dancing, man
We're gonna have such fun 'cause it's so easy

[Verse 1]
A red sun came rolling down a grey sky
And the frogs and dogs and night birds then
Started up singing sweet country lullaby
You see that patch of city lights
Somewhere in there's Cotton Avenue
That's where I'm going to take myself tonight
With a spit shine on my dancing shoes

[Chorus]
If you got a place like that to go
You just have to go there
If you got no place special
Well then, you just go no place special

[Verse 2]
I guess it's just the summer in the young blood
Ripe and juicy in the young blood
Teasing to go down to Cotton Avenue
To hear the shiny shiny music
See all the shiny people dancing to it
Anytime you go to Cotton Avenue

[Chorus]
If you got a place like that to go
You know you got to go there
If you got no place special
Well then you just go no place special

[Verse 3]
You see that summer storm brewing in the southern sky
By the time it hits here I'll be dancing high and dry
To rhythm and blues on Cotton Avenue
Poor boys'll be hanging around outside in the street
They got all the latest words
They're dancing to the latest beat
While they're hustling and sizing you
On Cotton Avenue

[Chorus]
If you got a place like that to go
You just have to go there
If you've got no place special
Well my dear
You just go no place special

[Chorus: Santigold]
I don't know what they told you
I am soldier baby
There's no fire I won't go through
Just to hold you baby
I'm with a backup rebel
Here for the night now
I know what you like
Just for tonight

[Hook: Santigold]
Bom bom, bom bom bom bom
Bom bom, bom bom bee-low
Bom bom bom bom, bom bom bee-low
I know what you like
Just for tonight

[Verse 1]
What's wrong with my red flannel?
What's that on your news channel?
All your B.S plans I know
That is why we wear camo
Yes we love our fans and so
Have convos and shake hands so
Think of those that can't go
Next time we gon' make the speakers blow
Crowd surf 'til they can't no more
Hop on stage and spaz all show
We 'preciate you spending that dough
Knowing every word from the intro
Interesting with your friend
Wear your shit
Wear my shit
Yes I rock that surf and so
Man sandals? Uh, no
You ask what I'm fighting
You wanna know when I'm fighting
Man your radio ain't exciting
Man your TV ain't exciting
Wanna know what you're hiding
Books I raise are dying
Wanna know what the hope you're buying
Looks like minds are frying
Screw you and your corporate quarters
We're taking your sons and daughters
It's time for social order
Musical social order
And now our lives are shorter
Got the drug inside the water
Get that news reporter
Now turn off your camcorder

[Chorus: Santigold]

[Verse 2]
Every time you come see us
Shows so rock the walls might bust
We go crazy cars are dust
Tell security “don’t you cuss”
Kick the stairs and cop your tee
Run backstage to our room please
If security comes and asks
"Where’s your pass?" Say you’re me
Flick off to whatever he says
Hop the fence and jump the stage
Make sure you’re seen, sure you’re heard
Snatch the mic and sing the words
If they kick you
