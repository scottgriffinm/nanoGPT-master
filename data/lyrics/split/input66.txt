[Hook + Chorus]
Cause, although they try to knock me down

[Supa Emcee]
Hey yo, What up, trailer trash!
Yo Future, how'd you get whitey to battle the Savior
That's like Darth Vader battling Obey Taylor
You can't mess around with the horror
I grab the mic and I'ma murder you, now you'll die tomorrow!
You can't kick with the lyrics I spit
I blow your head off and leave you dying in your blood, you bitch!
You still a trick and a hoe and Ima roll
I fucked your mama; she's a prostitute bro!
You thinking you white, but you ain't light
Ima murder you in the gang again, and blast you in de night!
I'm still ill, I'm still for real with Ken Loraine;
I got a gun on your boy, Ima blow out his brain!
You run with a bunch of whack faggots
I'ma eat out your meat like I'm in your body; I'm a maggot!
And yo matter of fact, you gettin' played
You ain't nothing but a white-boy dying of fucking aids!

[Intro]
Try to do this bitch in one take, or somethin'...

[Verse]
What's the point of bein' rich when you wake up alone?
What's the point of goin' home when it ain't nobody there?
Fuck that, I grab my bike and phone home in the air
And I pedal through the city with the wide frame steer
With that tall pale boy that I met last year
Grape, that's what I call him, love, that's what I fall in
Fell in, I ain't like sports growing up, but now I'm ballin'
I guess I'm a late bloomer
Ayo, look, high tide bottoms 'cause the neck on lunar
Them GOLF le FLEUR unos 'cause, we don't do Puma, nah
20k pairs, gone in 3 seconds
You ain't gotta like him and you ain't gotta respect him
For playin' chess with these niggas
That think that they're bench pressin'
Leg day is getting skipped, guess who really runnin' shit?
Young Teezy, it ain't easy, feelin' wheezy in this bitch
New slaves got y'all niggas feelin' breezy on the ship
Pour a Fanta in your poison so its easier to sip, huh?
Haha!
My shit leaked two weeks before that release date
First week, did dos, a thousand off, beat Meek
Shout out Meek! Two niggas first week top 3!
And I can't even get a song to play on the radio
But tripled in them ratings, TV channels still pay me tho, haha
P told me not to trip

Feel like I got the best album out, uh
I know I got the best album out, preach

[Outro]
Let me, let me hear that

Zone to zone, I'll roam in Rome
Solid as a rock, etched in stone
Retriever, retriever
Catch the bone
Big dog, baby
The rest are clones
Bass go boom with the baritone
Clearing shit up like a claritone
I'm really home, I'm barely gone
Look at my eyes, I'm really blown
Peoples is ready for me to rap
But I just took a whole bone to the neck
No sweat on the set
Sprinter van to the jet
Yeah, music, please

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, music, please
Dis finna be a breeze

I got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon I don't mind sharing
We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote "Take Care" but they push me to the point where I'm just not caring

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything's a go
But I already know that

Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything, I'm watching y'all close
I'm just more ready than—

[Verse 2: Drake]
You don't wanna question it, you just want definite, yeah
I jump out of relationships before I get left in it, yeah
The sex we have reminds me of the money and success a bit, yeah
'Cause even when I got it, I just gotta keep getting it
Even when I got it, I just gotta keep getting it
Big hotel suite, I'm the only one in it
Always going back to some shit that I already been it
Plenty fish up in the sea but I never go fishing
We got everybody sick, sending "get well soons" and a lot of well wishes
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything is a go

[Chorus: Drake]
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything, I'm watching y'all close
I'm just more ready than—
Yeah, I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
You don't wanna question it, you just want definite
You try to make it right, I destroy what's left of it, oh woah
The sex we have reminds me of the money and sucess a bit
'Cause even since I got it, I don't wanna stop getting it
Even since I got it, I don't wanna stop getting it, yeah
Big hotel suite, I'm the only one in it (Only one in it), yeah
Always coming back when we're done, yeah, we're already finished, oh no (Yeah)
Plenty fish up in the sea and I love to go fishing
We got everybody sick, lot of "get well soons," lot of well wishes (Oh)

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything is a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything is a go

Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything is a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than...

Count 'em, count 'em, count 'em, count 'em, count 'em

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Out of my mind, out of my mind
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
Too many times, too many times
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Break]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Break]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Nowhere to turn, no way, nowhere to turn, no
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
I never learn, (I never learn)
But my love (my love), he doesn't love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

[Pre-Break]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in

[Intro: Lana Del Rey]
Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
White lies and black beaches
Miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like makin' me crazy
Tell me, "have patience"
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks, just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons
In makin' me crazy
But you've got your reasons
White lies and black beaches

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)

Uh, her sophistication makes you wanna quit the bitch you datin'
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playin'
Boo, let's get acquainted (what?)
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation (yeah)
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it (What? Ooh)
But bang it like my fingers (Ooh, what?)
She pray to God I made it (What?)
But bankin' like my Franklins (Yeah)
My neighbors stopped the hatin' (Yeah)
What? (what? They been at it, check it out)
Huh? (We been out here, yeah)
Slide inside it (What?)
Diddy Boppin'  (What?)
Milly Rockin' (What? What?)
She just might become my lover for real (for real, for real)
I might fuck with her all summer for real (for real, for real)
They better not holla if I cuff her for real (for real, for real)
You can't escape my affection
Wrap you up in my daisy chains

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)

Goin' bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real (for real, for real)
Truthfully, between you and me, I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out (top out, hop out, hop out)
High tops in the summer
Hop out (top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer, babe

[Chorus]
Still don't give a damn about a bitch (Fuck 'em)

[Verse 1]
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is don’t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Outro]
This is a state of grace
This is a worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do

"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
"Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (Oh)

'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
So there's no need for us to hesitate
We're all alone, let's take control

[Pre-Chorus: Both, The Weeknd]
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey]
We dance on the H of the Hollywood sign
'Til we run out of breath, gotta dance 'til we die
My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
There's no more night, blue skies forever

[Verse 1]
Stings like a snake bite
What you want, what you got
I don't need it
Just like a sharp knife
Cuts me through, makes me bruise
I don't feel it

[Refrain 1]
Lovin' your suicide, and I don't got the time
No, you will not change my mind
You will not change my mind
Lovin' your suicide, and I don't got the time
No, you will not change my mind
You will not change my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm not gonna be one of those girls
Who falls under spells every single day
Oh, I'm not gonna be one of those girls
Who falls, no way, no way

[Chorus]
Love like a strobe light
Run from the trouble
Runnin' from the trouble now
Love like a strobe light
To me, me
Oh, whoah, oh, oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
I will not be like this
But now I am in such a crisis
You blind me
You turn it on and I'm like
"Whoah, oh, oh, oh"

[Verse 2]
Now that your poison
Is sinking through, sinking down
I can't help it
My mind is frozen
Get me out, work it, I want you melted

[Refrain 2]
Lovin' your suicide, 'cause now I've got the time
Oh, you always change my mind
You always change my mind
Lovin' your suicide, 'cause now I've got the time
Oh, you always change my mind
You always change my mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm just one of those girls, those girls
That fall under spells every single day
Oh, I love to be like all of those girls
Who fall, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Love like a strobe light
Run from the trouble
Runnin' from the trouble now
Love like a strobe light
To me, me
Oh, whoah, oh, oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
I will not be like this
But now I am in such a crisis
You blind me
You turn it on and I'm like
"Whoah, oh, oh, oh"

[Bridge]
Whoah, oh, oh, oh
You're just like a star, and you're shining so bright
Dancing through my bloodstream, your strobe light
Spin my heart round like a disco ball
Satellite lovin', now I want it all

Love like a strobe light
Run from the trouble
Runnin' from the trouble now
Love like a strobe light
To me

Oh, whoah, oh, oh, oh

You hit me like a strobe light in the dark
I said, you hit me like a strobe light in my heart
Oh yeah, you hit me like a strobe light in the dark
Oh yeah, you hit me like a strobe light in my heart

[Verse 1]
I got a pretty face, I got a messy heart
I got a stun gun, I'm standing in the dark
I'm such an angel, I'm so see-through
Transparent body and a voice you wanna speak to
I'm gonna reel you in, yeah, it's my favourite part
Swimming in the water, yeah, you're playing with the big sharks
Fall in love then you know I'll make your mind bleed
Crying in the corner, yeah, you'll wish you never met me

[Pre-Chorus]
What you see is not what you get, oh no
What you see is not what you get, oh no

[Chorus]
I'm not dull, see me in the night
You can try out the poison if you like
If you wanna catch me I'll be in the sky
Don't fall in love or I'll say goodbye
This ain't no love, love, love
Nothing too serious
Ain't no love, love, love
Noth-noth-noth-nothing too serious

[Verse 2]
I got a messy face, I got a broken heart
You got a stun gun, you shot me in the dark
You're such a devil, I couldn't see you
Transparent words and a mind that I'm too into
You're gonna reel me in, yeah, it's your favourite part
Swimming in the water, yeah, I'm drowning with the big sharks
Fall in love then you're gonna make my soul bleed
Crying in the corner, yeah, I'll wish this never started

[Pre-Chorus]
What you see is not what you get, oh no
What you see is not what you get, oh no

[Chorus]
I'm not dull, see me in the night
You can try out the poison if you like
If you wanna catch me I'll be in the sky
Don't fall in love or I'll say goodbye
This ain't no love, love, love
Nothing too serious
Ain't no love, love, love
Noth-noth-noth-nothing too serious

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
What you see is not what you get, oh no
What you see is not what you get, oh no

[Chorus]
I'm not dull, see me in the night
You can try out the poison if you like
If you wanna catch me I'll be in the sky
Don't fall in love or I'll say goodbye
This ain't no love, love, love
Nothing too serious
Ain't no love, love, love
Noth-noth-noth-nothing too serious
I'm not dull, see me in the night
You can try out the poison if you like
If you wanna catch me I'll be in the sky
Don't fall in love or I'll say goodbye

I've been dranking and busting too
And I been thanking of busting you
Upside your motherfuckin' forehead
And if your friends jump in, they'll be mo' dead
Causing confusion, Disturbin' Tha Peace
It's not an illusion, we running the streets
So bye-bye to all you groupies and gold diggers
Is there a bumper on your ass? No nigga!
I'm doing a hundred on the highway

Hit the stage and knock the curtains down
I fuck the crowd up - that's what I do
Young and successful - a sex symbol
The bitches want me to fuck 'em

[Verse 1]
Orange is the color of my love
Fragile orange wind in the garden
Fragile means that I can hear her flesh
Crying little rivers in her forearm
Fragile is that I mourn her death
As our limbs are twisting in her bedroom

[Chorus]
Lies, lies, lies
Lies in her eyes
Lies, lies, lies
Lies in her eyes

[Verse 2]
She tells me to close and count to ten
As she wanders freely through the forest
Can I close and open once again?
The question that I seek for reassurance

[Chorus]
Lies, lies, lies
Lies in her eyes
Lies, lies, lies
Lies in her eyes

[Verse 3]
Hound dogs crowing at the stars above
Pigeons fall like snowflakes at the border
She kneels down and holds the frozen dove
The moon drips like water from her shoulder

[Chorus]
Flies, flies, flies
Flies from her eyes
Flies, flies, flies
Flies from her eyes

[Outro]
Orange is the color of my love
Fragile orange wind in the garden
Fragile means that I can hear her flesh
Crying little rivers in her forearm
Fragile is that I mourn her death
As our limbs are twisting in her bedroom

[Chorus]
You're a boy who likes to play games
Drives girls so insane
They only want you to say their name
But you don't work that way
You're a boy who breaks the girls' hearts
Don't know what he wants
Shoulda told it straight from the start
That she will not fall apart

[Verse 1]
You're not boyfriend material
Got your back up straight against the wall
Eyeing up the girlies from the head to the toe
Ha, they think you're serious
Alright, you're kinda sweet
Gonna give all of the little girlies sugar to eat
Ooh, boy, gotta rot the teeth
But you can't stay long, yeah, you need to breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
Why don't you just come on and take a ride?
I'll melt you like an ice pack inside
Why don't you just come on and jump on in?
I don't care if you sink or you swim

[Chorus]
You're a boy who likes to play games
Drives girls so insane
They only want you to say their name
But you don't work that way
You're a boy who breaks the girls' hearts
Don't know what he wants
Shoulda told it straight from the start
That she will not fall apart

[Verse 2]
You're not boyfriend material
Gonna eat you up like cereal
You can come and test me, you can come and try me
I think you might just like me
You know you're kinda cool
Used to mess around with all the little girlies in school
Ooh, boy, gonna break the rules
Ooh, boy, gonna break the rules

[Pre-Chorus]
Why don't you just come on and take a ride?
I'll melt you like an ice pack inside
Why don't you just come on and jump on in?
I don't care if you sink or you swim

[Chorus]
You're a boy who likes to play games
Drives girls so insane
They only want you to say their name
But you don't work that way
You're a boy who breaks the girls' hearts
Don't know what he wants
Shoulda told it straight from the start
That she will not fall apart

[Intro: Ryan Beatty]
I'm around you when you answer
I'd feel better if you sent a sign
Lonely when your friends around
Solo 'til the sun go down
I just wish that I could read your mind

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Call me after midnight
Pull up on your lawn like
Baby boy, are you alright?
Call me after midnight
Call me after midnight
Pull up on your lawn like
Baby boy, are you alright?
Call me after midnight

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Wildin' out 'til tomorrow, could be my only lotto
Kicked out of my momma's house, back when I was suicidal
I ain't even smoke, he taught me how to shoot a gun
Why the fuck you get me drunk and leave me in the road?
I need a way out, so sure that I could get out, ugh
And I'mma hideout, highways I could find out, one
Ride that bank like a 6, you're the reason I lace
My shoes in different ass ways

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Call me after midnight
Pull up on your lawn like
Baby boy, are you alright?
Call me after midnight

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
It's never too late to be who you wanna be
To say what you wanna say
It's never too late to leave if you wanna leave
Or to stay if you wanna stay
But, baby, I got a feelin' in my bones
Can't get you out of my veins
You can't escape my affection
Wrap you up in my daisy chains

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky & Playboi Carti]
Uh, her sophistication make you wanna quit the bitch you datin'
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playin'
Boo, let's get acquainted (what?)
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation (yeah)
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it (Ooh)
But bang it like my fingers (What?)
She pray to God I made it (What?)
But bankin' like my Franklins (Yeah)
My neighbors stopped the hatin' (Yeah)
What? (what? They been at it, check it out)
Huh? (We been out here, yeah)
Slide inside it (What?)
Diddy Boppin'  (What?)
Milly Rockin' (What? What?)
She just might become my lover for real
I might fuck with her all summer for real
They better not holla if I cuff her for real
Niggas better run for cover for real
Goin' bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real
Truthfully, between you and me, I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm

[Verse 3: Lana Del Rey]
White lies and black beaches, miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like makin' me crazy
Tell me, "Have patience"
Baby, I need this, white lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches and blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks, just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons in makin' me crazy
But you've got your reason, white lies and black beaches

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey]
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Don't be a bummer
Don't be a

They ID her
Feelings up and down, I feel seesaw
Feel me up and down, I go "yeehaw" (haha)
Hear me out, I got an idea
You could be the one that I lean on
Wake up in the mornin' right next to
In my bed to the bath, take it beyond

Wore my heart upon ya shoulder
Love was drunken now it's sober boy

[Chorus]
Boy I was sleepin'
Happy that you woke me
Now I'm up (I'm up, I'm up, I'm up)

'Cause I didn't love the way you wanted
And who am I to blame? When I didn't trust you
Enough to let you in the way I wanted, stop, okay

Vodka on my lips (yeah, yeah), took too many drinks (yeah, yeah)
Makes me reminisce all the way down (woo)
To my happy place (yeah, yeah), you're my happy place (yeah, yeah)

[Intro: Steve & Stella Monye]
Steve, oh
Oh, I was burning out desire
So I needed a woman to put out this fire
She said: "Check it, check it, check it"

[Verse 1]
Sitting by my window
Watching the moonlight
In my home
Suddenly my mind
Is bringing out desire
In my home
So I got a woman
To put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Chorus 1]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire

[Verse 2]
Soon I had a phone call
From a woman
In my home
She was burning
Burning of desire
Just like I do
She wanted me to
Put out this fire
Burning in her soul

[Chorus 2]
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Interlude 1]
Oh
I haven't last
You can't believe it

[?]
She said: (I love it)
"Check it, check it, check it, check it
Check it, check it, check it, check it, check"
Oh

[Verse 3]
Suddenly my woman
Was in my arms
In my home
She was loving me
69 times
In my home (Are you sure?)
She was putting
Putting out the fire
Burning in my soul (Really?)

[Chorus 3]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
(You know I can do it without it)
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Interlude 2]
Oh
(I love it)
I haven't last
She can't do it without it
I just have to give out
You know what she said to me
She said: "C'mon, baby
Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it"
Oh my gosh
I just can do it without it
"Hello Steve
I want some more of that stuff"
Suddenly I got it all
I just had to put out the fire (Oh)
She said:
"Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it
Take it, take it"

[Chorus 1]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire

[Outro: Steve & Stella Monye]
Only you, baby
Only you, baby
Only you, baby (I love it)
Can put out this fire (Ah!)
Only you, baby (Burning desire)
Only you, baby
Only you, baby (Oh)
Can put out this fire
(She can't do it without it)
Only you, baby
(You know what she said to me again)
Only you, baby (Steve)
(You know what she said; I love it)
Only you, baby
(She said: "Steve...")
Can put out this fire
("...You are wonderful")
Only you, baby (Oh)
Only you, baby...

[Verse 1]
Memo finna start acting out if I don't see him soon
Yeah my best friend ain't backing out, it's still on sight, fool
I'm the only one out here on the night loops
I'm the only one out here on the night loops
Trophy case still light, body need a race stripe
And these minerals on my body break light
And these reds on my body brakelight
New man comin' up ahead on his own two
Is you a natural blondie like Goku?
Sleepin' on my belly in a loop like a serpent
Talking Heads ripplin' on the surface

[Pre-Chorus]
Eyes low, chin heavy, shoegazer
Moonwalkin', R.I.P. Stanley Kubrick
You had you some birthdays, could you prove it?
Show me the wisdom in your movement
Show me some wisdom in your movement

[Chorus]
Feelings you provide
Feelings you provide
I know, I know

[Bridge]

You couldn't live without it
Said I'd be your new best friend
But what more? Yeah
Ain't too late to out
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ahhh
Provide, provide
Pro...
Ooh, oooh, oooh
Tonight I might change my life, all for you
All for you (Provide)

[Verse 2]
Provided, diamond lane that didn't exist
Packed the Astro van and brought my kids through
Prada tee on the eldest, throw the Gildan on the children
Hand-me-down fits
Chest pass, see mist off rotation (Swish, swisha)
Stiff smile just like I'm Aphex Twin (Yeah, come to daddy, yeah)
Pat the Patagonia pockets, tryna find my zip (uh, where it's at? Yeah)
Blunt twist, tightropes, I'm not fallin' off (never that, no)
Watch friends, go pro through fisheye lens, drownin' off clear
I just saw JAWS, divin' under influence
Been feelin' like the Lord just out of reach for me (for me)
How I feel lettin' man speak
How I feel lettin' man speak for me (for me)
Holyfield, keep your ears split for me
Can't show my face if you spit for me
Spit for me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Eyes low, chin heavy shoegazer
Moonwalkin', R.I.P. Stanley Kubrick
You had you some birthdays, could you prove it?
Show me the wisdom in your movement
Show me some wisdom in your movement

[Chorus]

[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah believe in yourself, who else gon' believe in you
Who else gon' believe in you? Who else gon' believe in you?
Believe in yourself, who else gon' believe in you?
Who else gon' believe in you, who else gon' believe in you?

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Who else?
I knew all this back on the Shaw
When I had no bedrooms at all
Now it's tears in a wraith feeling soft
Now I'm based like I'm lost at a rave
Really miss my landaulet
Look at the stars, it's a plane
This plane right here cost me bank
That Bentley truck ugly, I'm straight
It's straight, but that's just not my style
That's just not my style
When Sage pushed it mongo
Way before the Uber
Was stranded as fuck at the house
We just landed we scuffing the ground
We been knew the earth was around
These goofies ain't looking for Mickey
They looking for mini me, copy my style
Copies is selling and I don't know why
Mostly I cockblock myself on the pop
400k I could spend it on lots
Can't pay for play Christmas day no Xbox
Last Christmas Day was in LA with Flack
Pourin' this red, sky gettin' blue
We couldn't tell if it's IMAX or not
Butterfly hinges on a cocoon

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah my doors go dat way
My doors go dat way, doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah my doors go dat way
My doors, Wraith, my doors, uh
I wanted to know what you said
So I looked you up on the phone
If red roses aren't meant for friends
Then I'm riding home alone

And it's a cold dark world out there
Isn't what it used to be?
I can't control what goes on out there
Frightening just to think of it
Don't you think of it?

Unbelievable, so incredible
And welcome to our future land
And what's a spectacle?
Why so skeptical
And unattainable as it is?

It's worth a damn
Worth a damn

Look at me, turn your head
Make your mind, go ahead
Let it go, honestly
Terrible news to hear
All alone once again lonely much?
Call a friend
Let em know how you feel
How you feel
Look at me, turn your head
Make your mind, go ahead
Let it go, honestly
Terrible news to hear
All alone once again
Isn't it just a travesty?
Never wanna go out
You used to scream and shout
Never wanna go out
'cept for now
You didn't wanna go out
Just to see it passing
You used to never go out
At all

I've got everything I need, right here
In between, these four walls everything,
So clear no windows in my room, no sun comes in
These limitations are blinding me

Deep inside the centre of the city
Evil lurks, evil lurks
Wash away with holy rain
Evil looks, evil looks
I'm not crazy
I'm just nervous
I'm on my toes
At the edge of the world
And my mind feels like an empty room
The inside black as coal
And it hurts to want something so bad
That you lose all self control

And I know
How you are sometimes
And I know
You're just a little turned around

Yeah, I can feel it getting late
And my body is getting tired
But there's no point leaving before they game
When my mind feels so wired
Yeah, you took me to this station and you showed me every sign
No one else could understand
You know I'm lost but I'll be fine
And you know
How I am sometimes
And you know
I'm just a little turned around

We had it all planned out
It's so hard to watch it burn
Burn
Watch it burn

[Verse 1]
I am dreaming of when I get back to Houston
I am dreaming of that fair and special place
I am dreaming of when Houston has no problems
In that city where they send you into space

[Chorus]
I am dreaming of when I get back to Texas
Corpus Christi, Harris County, Galveston
There's a harmony that hums down there in Houston
Oh, Houston you got to keep on keeping on

[Verse 2]
From Miami we are sending love to Houston
We are praying that you make it through the rain
I know nothing's gonna break the will of Houston
Oh, and we can't wait to go down there again

[Chorus]
I am dreaming of when I get back to Texas
Corpus Christi, Harris County, Galveston
There's a harmony that hums down there in Houston
Oh, Houston you got to keep on keeping on
Take it Jon!

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Oh, Houston got to keep on keeping on
Yeah, Houston got to keep on keeping on

All facts

[Verse 1]
DOOM get rude with the dude off CHiPs
The mood switch, he chewed off strips of a Broodwich
Danger make a groove off a glitch
Major boo booty twitch and a crew rich bitch
Always wanted to say that
Ever since the days of hallways taunting a stray cat
The one he often frequently slapped around
All the while waited and graduated cap and gown
Hated the rap sound, debated the crap
Until he felt he had it mapped down
Enough to have the game trapped and bound
Scratched in the crown was the names of lames who yapped a noun
Or verb for that matter
Had no data for a herb who chat chatter
Oh, Erik Estrada
Fat rat, the mask made 'em batty as a mad hatter

[Verse 2]
Known for his absurd word choices
And will ignore you if you ask him if he heard voices
Look, the energy is crazy
Far as he was concerned the enemy was lazy
Ahem, your attention please
Freeze, he came to seize the free cheese
Before he flees to Belize
In case he forgot to mention, squeeze these
Just keep it on a need to know basis
They knew he was a negro so no need to show faces
Back in the days of no laces
On a slow pace they used to say he might could go places
Ehh, whatever their case is
The card he played was ace of spades, but no races
A spastic, some called loony
When he spit a tune sarcastic as Paul Mooney

[Intro]
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Verse 1]
He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Drop]
I'm giving you that pleasure
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
I'm giving you that pleasure
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell

[Verse 2]
You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can let me know I'm wanted
Can let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I'll get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Break]
Cause we're hot like hell
Cause we're hot like hell
Cause we're hot like hell
(I'm giving you that)
Cause we're hot like hell
(I'm giving you that)

[Chorus]
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Bridge]
When we go down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you can take me right there
We can make it

[Chorus]
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell

[Verse 1]
I'm singing at a funeral tomorrow
For a kid a year older than me
And I've been talking to his dad; it makes me so sad
When I think too much about it I can't breathe

[Verse 2]
And I have this dream where I'm screaming underwater
While my friends are waving from the shore
And I don't need you to tell me what that means
I don't believe in that stuff anymore

[Chorus]
Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will

[Verse 3]
I have a friend I call
When I've bored myself to tears
And we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
But then we laugh until it disappears

[Verse 4]
And last night, I blacked out in my car
And I woke up in my childhood bed
Wishing I was someone else, feeling sorry for myself
When I remembered someone's kid is dead

[Chorus]
Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will

[Outro]
And it's 4 a.m. again
And I'm doing nothing
Again
I might be black but I ain't no widow
I've just been shadows in the dark
He may be yours, but he ain't my hero
I embrace this malice in my heart
I've been patiently waiting, but I'm angry now
You promised the lightning in the sky
I was told they would worship me, yell and scream my name
But they turned their backs on me and lied
So now I'm chasing spiders

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
It was cold, we were laying by the lake
And oh, that's when I made my first mistake
I was sold, yeah, I thought that it was fate
Oh no, that's when I first felt my heart break

[Pre-Chorus]
Lust, it made us hungry like the wolves
We choose to act like fools
We were young, thought we were wildly in love

[Chorus]
But I wasted all my youth on you
Wasted all my youth on you
Oh, wasted youth
Oh, wasted youth

[Verse 2]
You, you stole the better parts of me
Cruel, you took my good and left no peace
Soon, there'll be no beauty left to see
Truth, wish I could erase memories

[Pre-Chorus]
Lust, it made us hungry like the wolves
We chose to act like fools
We were young, thought we were wildly in love

[Chorus]
But I wasted all my youth on you
Wasted all my youth on you
Oh, wasted youth
Oh, wasted youth

[Bridge]
If I had the chance to take it back
I'd waste it again, waste it again

[Chorus]
Wasted all my youth on you (wasted my youth, wasted my youth)
Wasted all my youth on you (you-u-uth)
Oh, wasted youth
Oh, wasted youth

[Outro]
If I had the chance to take it back
I'd waste it again, waste it again

[Verse 1]
The ceiling starts to break, I make the same mistakes
Once or twice, a sacrifice must help for someone else
Hide the way it hurts to hear you're fine without my help
I'm not forever young, the girl you knew is gone
You and I are memories that never seem to fade
Tell the lie you wish that I had begged until you stayed

[Chorus]
Ooh, I wanna see you cry
Ooh, I wanna see your dark side
I'll be your satellite
I wonder why I wanna see you cry

[Verse 2]
I never seem to be, who you want from me
Every time you change your mind, you leave behind a ghost
Everything I knew is now at odds with what I know

[Chorus]
Ooh, I wanna see you cry
Ooh, I wanna see your dark side
I'll be your satellite
I wonder why I wanna see you cry

[Bridge]
What's missing?
Just listen
I'm no different

[Chorus]
Ooh, I wanna see you cry
Ooh, I wanna see your dark side
I'll be your satellite
I wonder why I wanna see you cry

[Verse 1]
You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Verse 2]
I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less l love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Bridge]
No
No, no, no, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you'll see me cry)
Ahhh
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Outro]
'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
Where does it come from?
Where does it come from?
How in the universe?

Where do they come from?
'Til we're invisible
Busted and blue

All my life
All my life
All my life
All my life
All my life
Beam a light on me
I am a satellite
And I can't get back without you

All my life
All my life
Beam a light on me
I am a satellite
And I can't get back without you
'Til we're invisible
'Til we're invisible

[Verse 1]
Where you at? Call your phone
Sitting here, all alone
Hand around a champagne glass (Oh well)
Guess I'm gonna get real trashed
People here turn me off
Picky boys (Ew!), shut up
Tick-tock, ticking like I'm a time bomb
Houston, now we got a problem

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, whoa, ooh-whoa-whoa
My head, it goes 'round, 'round, 'round
I'm about to wild out, out, out
Trigger, pull it like pow, pow, pow
It's about to go down, down, down

[Chorus]
I wanna pop the balloons (Pop!)
Bitch with a bad attitude (So what?)
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
I wanna pop the balloons (Pop!)
Fuck everyone in the room (Fuck you!)
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
It's not a party, it's not a party without you

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na na, nana na na
Na, na na, nana na na
Yeah, yeah, yeah, na na na
It's not a party, it's not a party without you

[Verse 2]
Tryin' hard to keep my cool
Hurry up, fuck are you?
Don't you remember last weekend?
Turned up until 6 AM

[Pre-Chorus]
My head, it goes 'round, 'round, 'round
I'm about to wild out, out, out
Oh, whoa, ooh-whoa-whoa
Trigger, pull it like pow, pow, pow
It's about to go down, down, down

[Chorus]
I wanna pop the balloons (Pop!)
Bitch with a bad attitude (So what?)
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
I wanna pop the balloons (Pop!)
Fuck everyone in the room (Fuck you!)
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh

It's not a party, it's not a party without-

[Bridge]
Liquor in my bloodstream
Now I'm gettin' so deep
Sinkin' in the swimming pool
My body's bruised and I'm a fool for you
Forget about it
I'ma work it out here
Wait a second, fuck that
I'm a brat, I'ma take this party back
Blow you up, dynamite
Hol' up, we go all night

[Chorus]
I wanna pop the balloons (Pop!)
Bitch with a bad attitude (So what?)
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
I wanna pop the balloons (Pop!)
Fuck everyone in the room (Fuck you!)
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh

It's not a party, it's not a party without you

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 1]
I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
And when they finally leave me, I'm all alone but
I'm lookin' down and my girls are blowin' my phone up
Them twenty questions, they askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I had to trash the hotel lobby

[Chorus]
But I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 2]
In every city I've got one with different ringtones
Flyin' from L.A. all the way to Puerto Rico
My girls are callin' me askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back
Didn't hit 'em back

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse
But I can't even lie you got me

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Bridge]
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me
Darling, I can't stop it even if I wanted
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me
Missed what you were sayin', I was miles away, yeah
Don't be mad, don't be mad
Not like I had a choice
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 1: Matthew Healy]
I'm in love with Jesus Christ
He's so nice
I'm in love, I'll say it twice
I'm in love (I'm in love)

[Verse 2: Matthew Healy & Phoebe Bridgers]
I'm in love, but I'm feeling low
For I am just a footprint in the snow
I'm in love with a boy I know
But that's a feeling I can never show

[Chorus: Matthew Healy & Phoebe Bridgers]
Fortunately, I believe, lucky me
I'm searching for planes in the sea, and that's irony
Soil just needs water to be, and a seed
So if we turn into a tree, can I be the leaves?

[Post-Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 3: Phoebe Bridgers]
I'm in love with the girl next door
Her name's Claire
Nice when she comes 'round to call
Then masturbate the second she's not there

[Chorus: Matthew Healy & Phoebe Bridgers]
Fortunately, I believe, lucky me
Searching for planes in the sea, and that's irony
Soil just needs water to be, and a seed
So if we turn into a tree, can I be the leaves?

[Post-Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Should I assume you didn't mean it like that?
Or should I assume you know exactly how you said it?
You know exactly how you meant it
Should I assume it's me, sweet disposition
Switchin' position, duckin' submission
Or should I assume it's a weekend thing, boy?
You could get ass all week, droppin' that ass
Just think about me, think about me

[Pre-Chorus]
And it sounds good, what's the difference if it sound good?
Split the difference if it's still good
What's the difference if it's still good
Just not yours exclusively?
Used to be all good
Trade it up, now it's all bad
Rang it up, credit all bad
Getting on, never saw that
Mystery number, call back
It better not be her again
Know you wish it wasn't
Know you wish I wasn't

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, so hard to love (so hard)
Darling, you make it too hard to trust
You keep running from me
I'm scared of love
Make it easy for me
I wanna be, it's difficult for me
I'm scared of love, yeah
And you're hard to trust
(You keep) why you running from me?
I'm backing up
Make it easy for me
Don't wanna be scared to love

[Verse 2]
Hopin' you will, hopin' you would
Wish a bitch would, dissin' me
Hopin' you would, kissin' me
Underneath the constellation
If it's any consolation
If it's worth the conversation
I don't do this all of the time
I just say that every time it's worth the lie
It's worth the crime, it's worth the bad karma
I bet you like it rough
Makin' bad decisions how we beggin', and you love it

[Pre-Chorus]
All good, what's the difference?
Still good, split the difference
All good, what's the difference if it's still good
Just not yours exclusively?
Used to be all good
All bad
Tell it, love, that's more than

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, so hard to love (so hard)
Darling, you make it too hard to trust
You keep running from me
I'm scared of love
Make it easy for me
I wanna be, it's difficult for me
I'm scared of love, yeah
And you're hard to trust
(You keep) why you running from me?
I'm backing up
Make it easy for me
Don't wanna be scared to love

[Verse 1]
Old friend
It's been a long time
Since I've seen you
Whoo ooh

[Verse 2]
These days
We know nothing
Just a memory
Youthful days

Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

[Verse 3]
All say
Your crime is over
Your hair is shorter
But you're still the same

[Pre-Chorus]
You know
The seasons change (Seasons will change)
You know
We'll always be the same (Always be)

[Chorus]
Oh it's nice to see you again
My friend (My friend), my friend (My friend)
Oh it's nice to see you again
My friend (My friend), my friend (My friend)
Oh it's nice to see you again (

[?])
My friend, my friend
Oh it's nice to see you again (

[?])
My friend, my friend
All again because of you, always be kind to you (Oh it's nice to see you again)
Old in the color blue, always be friends with you

[Outro]
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
So alone in the midday sun and I
Love it when she tells me to walk not run, oh
Sarah you're the lifeguard of my dreams
But you never notice 'cause I'm seventeen, oh

[Chorus]
Come on, take your eyes off the pool
Come on over, explain the rules
I know you're working
Baby don't you wanna
Come on Sarah
Meet me in the sauna

(Come on Sarah)

[Verse 2]
I love the sunscreen on your nose
And your goofy straw hat and your sun-burned toes
Give me a chance, I'll do whatever it takes
I think it's time you called a ten-minute break, so

[Chorus]
Blow the whistle, tell the kids not to dive
Throw me something just to save my life
I know how to swim
But baby I'm not gonna
Come on Sarah
Meet me in the sauna

(Come on Sarah)

[Verse 3]
I even heard you play the bass guitar
Sarah do you even know how pretty you are?
Take off your shades, look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy with those college guys, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on Sarah, don't be like that
We can sneak away while my dad swims laps
I know you're working
I know you wanna
Come on Sarah
Meet me in the sauna

[Chorus]
Come on, take your eyes off the pool
Come on over, explain the rules
I know you're working
Baby don't you wanna
Come on Sarah
Meet me in the sauna

[Outro]
Come on Sarah
Meet me in the sauna
Come on Sarah
Meet me in the sauna

[Chorus]
I wish I was a pirate
I’d sail the Seven Seas
And when I’d go out sailing
Won’t you come along with me?
Oh, it’ll be grand, grand
We’d sit on the beach
Holding hands in the sand, sand

[Verse]
I wish I was a pirate
With a hat and an eyepatch
And when we’d go out sailing
Yeah, you know we’ll never be captured
By the bad boys
We’d sit on the deck, drinking rum
With the bad boys

[Bridge]
Well, “Melancholy” was my name
And “Captain” was yours
We’d sail the Seven Seas
And then, we will pull up out of the shores
We’d eat Ben & Jerry’s ice cream
Play songs on the guitar
We’d take artistic photographs
But we’d never get that far, no

[Chorus]
I wish I was a pirate
I’d sail the Seven Seas
And when I’d go out sailing
Won’t you come along with me?
Oh, it’ll be grand, grand
We’d sit on the beach
Holding hands in the sand, sand

[Intro]
Baby boy, I wanna love you all the way
I'll be like a teddy bear, hold on to me
Boy, you make me tremble when you say my name
Cause I love, I love you, I love you all the way

[Verse 1]
You and me got matching signs
Scorpio and Gemini
Sex and drugs, tell me what you like
Baby, we can do it every day and night
Always know how to touch me right
So touch-touch-touch me right, touch me right
So don't let me go
Always gonna stand that ground for you
Even when you're tryin' to play it cool
And I'm always gonna be your boo, it's true

[Pre-Chorus]
Here right now, just me and you
Here right now, just me and you
So don't let me go

[Verse 2]
Call me up any time of day
I got you burning up like Pompeii
I'mma come and meet you in the pouring rain
We can do it each and every single way
Loving every word you say to me, say-say to me
So-so-so, need you to know
All day long beneath the sheets
I can be the lesson, teach you everything
Early in the morning I'll be such a freak

[Pre-Chorus]
Here right now, just you and me
Here right now, just you and me
So don't let me go
I need you to know

Baby boy, just promise me you'll always stay

[Outro]
Baby boy, I wanna love you
Baby
Baby boy
Baby
Baby boy, I wanna love you all the way

[Verse 1]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I've made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naïve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

[Verse 2]
You won't find me in church (No)
Readin' the Bible (No)
I am still here and I'm still your disciple
I'm down on my knees, I'm beggin' you, please
I'm broken, alone, and afraid
I'm not a saint, I'm more of a sinner
I don't wanna lose, but I fear for the winners
When I try to explain, the words run away
That's why I am stood here today

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

[Bridge]
Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end
Oh, won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray, pray, maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna pray

[Intro]
Woah, woah
I take it back
Take it back, back

[Verse 1]
Back when it was in style to do the yellow Hummer (Hummer, Chop Squad)
Back when I had a job every summer (Summer)
Back when I tried to be the number one stunner (Stunner)
Back when everybody in the band had a drummer (Brr)
Back when the medical insurance was just the hunnids (Hunnids)
Back before it was so easy to get a number
Back before George W. used to run it (Run it)
Back when me and all my dogs used to go huntin' (Huntin')

[Chorus]
Boy, we used to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
You know we had to get it in (You know I had to get it)
You know I used to get it in (You know I used to get it)
You know we had to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
Schemin', whole team just schemin'

[Verse 2]
Okay, me and my whole team seem to put it all together (Go)
It's time to make the moves that's gon' put us on forever
'Cause they stay down like my foot did on the pedal
Hold up, stay down like they shootin' at me
But they never, I can never take you bitches personal
I brought the money outside-in like it's reversible (Woah)
I'm QB on my team, yeah, so don't rush (Rush)
Bitch, start actin' like a grownup (Okay)
M-moving like a boss do
Tip enough that I can pay for law school (Yeah-yeah)
I was raised by a O.G. one (Free one)
Talk to me like I'm Obi Wan (Boy)
Business moves, you know we don't discuss
All twenties, talkin' area touch (Woah)
Still runnin' with the dogs like mush
'Cause the only ones we trust is us, and hell yeah

[Chorus]
We get it in, get it in, get it in (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
You know we had to get it in (You know I had to get it)

[Verse 3]
All I ever did was figure it out (Go)
Back when a nigga used to have to live on the couch (Uh-huh)
I had to brainstorm this shit just to get through the drought (Straight up)
I strategised it in my head, then started livin' it out (Go)
Man, these niggas want the perks without doin' the work (Work)
Drag my name through the mud without doin' the dirt (Damn)
I get your face on a shirt like I'm doin' your merch
They love to talk, I'm 'bout doin' it first, 'cause

[Chorus]
Boy, we used to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
You know we had to get it in (You know I had to get it)
You know I used to get it in (You know I used to get it)
You know we had to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
Schemin', whole team just schemin'
I'm talkin' plottin' and schemin'

[Verse 1]
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (No one has to know)

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Oh, are you ready for it?

[Refrain]
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night (Night), in my dreams (My dreams)
You should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), hmm (Eh)
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you (I know I'm gonna be with you)
So I take my time
In the middle of the night

[Refrain]
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?

[Chorus]
Boys, boys, boys
Boys
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout...

[Verse 1]
I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
And when they finally leave me, I'm all alone but
I'm lookin' down and my girls are blowin' my phone up
Them twenty questions, they askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back (back, back)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I had to trash the hotel lobby

[Chorus]
But I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 2]
In every city I've got one with different ringtones
Flyin' from L.A. all the way to Puerto Rico
My girls are callin' me askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back (hit 'em back, hit 'em back)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse, like
I can't even lie you got me

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Squad
Brick Squad in the building
Hit Squad in the building
1017 in the building
Slim Dunkin, Flocka, Gucci, Rocko

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm Windex Shawty, I'm cleaning the glass window
My niggas smoking indo, these suckas smoking pretendo
I used to like Keri Hilson, but she don't like me
I tried to wife up Kelly Rowland, but she declined me
I fucked Fantasia once and it was splashy
Lil Kim tried to stalk me, sexually harass me
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, my diamonds match my Chucks
So if you wanna buck, then tell them knuckle up
I'm sorry, I got preference for Ferraris, darling
Don't solve me like 

[?], I'm not an Atari
Too late to say sorry and 

[?]
I'm in that black and red slut with that cranberry guts
I'm fresh as fuck

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Slim Dunkin]
Leaving out the Rarri lot
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
I'm walking out of Walters, nigga
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Leaving out the jewelry store
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Me and my bitch, nigga
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, I say, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, I say, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck

[Verse 2: Slim Dunkin]
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, pistol on tuck
Oh shit, too late to swing, y'all niggas better duck
Little mama acting, say, "I couldn't fuck yesterday"
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, I bet she gon' say yes today
Niggas keep on testing me just 'cause they ain't fresh as me
Tell them boys don't mess with me, I'll crunch him like a Nestle
Mr. Postman, body parts in your mailbox
Nigga, try Gucc, 12 gauge to your dreadlocks
Stole Gucc's Ferrari just to match the fit
Stove Flock's 6 just to smash your bitch, Dunk
I ain't done, nigga, don't try to run, nigga
Why I call you Junior? 'Cause you my son, nigga

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Slim Dunkin]
Leaving out the Rarri lot
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
I'm walking out of Walters, nigga
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Leaving out the jewelry store
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Me and my bitch, nigga
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, I say, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, I say, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck

[Verse 3: Rocko]
X-ray me, homie, ain't no phony bone on me, homie
Get money shit in me, it ain't on me, homie
Short a couple bucks? It's cool, I'll hook you up
Rocko a real dude, that's why the hood show him love
Fall up in the booty club, might throw a dub
That's why all the shaky booty girls showing love
Lysol fresh, diamonds clear as Windex
Throw the cash, put the bottles on the Amex (that black card, nigga)
Charge it to the fame
I ain't know that was your main thing, charge her to the game
One time for the money, two times for the goons
Three times for 

[?], got me way fresher than you

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Slim Dunkin]
Leaving out the Rarri lot
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
I'm walking out of Walters, nigga
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Leaving out the jewelry store
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Me and my bitch, nigga
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, I say, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, I say, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck

Got kicks in the back of the cinema
Just wanted a taste
Lips rubbing skin and it's filled with stars
Heart melting away
One second, a rush and it falls through
Oh wait now I'm back in my bedroom
Can't stop all these feelings inside my brain
They won't go away

[Chorus]
Girls thinking 'bout boys in the night time
Boys wishing that girls were by their sides
All watchin' and waitin’ for the sign
Let's make love, let's make love
Boys watch all the girls while they're sleeping
Girls thinking 'bout boys while they're dreaming
Oh baby, we've all got that feeling
Let's make love, let's make love

[Verse 2]
Can't wait for the weekend to come around
This party will rule
Blue t-shirt and jeans, feeling kinda drunk
See, my country's cool
Electric the minute that we touch
Mum's calling but I don't give a fuck
Don't call me, my credit is really low
Now I gotta roll

[Chorus]
Girls thinking 'bout boys in the night time
Boys wishing that girls were by their sides
All watchin' and waitin’ for the sign
Let's make love, let's make love
Boys watch all the girls while they're sleeping
Girls thinking 'bout boys while they're dreaming
Oh baby, we've all got that feeling
Let's make love, let's make love

Oh baby, we've all got that feeling

About to give them some real street shit

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Big drop, gotta look big, nigga
I grew up small, I had to look big, nigga
I had the moddo, like "look big, nigga"
It ain't about what small or what look big, nigga
When this small barol in your face, it look big, nigga
Push big niggas to the point where they don't wanna push small niggas
To the point, get the point, nigga?
Crack dealer I been, since I don't know when
8, 9, 10, na, I don't know when
I know I started early, started young, started dumb
Started out as a runner, started out making my run
I whent from bits and pieces, to bricks and sneakers
Fox was like "here, give this to Kiesha"
Tell Kiesha to get that to T
Tell T "get that back to me"
Get the drill sargent, I lay it down like a drill sargent
Straight out of boot camp
My soldiers in the field marching
Hut 1, hut 2, hut 3

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Gotta get it, gotta get it, my money made
Gotta hustle, gotta hustle, gotta hustle, man
I'm on my grind, if I gotta shoot you, I do it, man

Cars clothes, drugs, hoes, you know

Murder, death, kill, anything goes
I'm addicted
I honor death before dishonor
I'm addicted
This ain't fiction, I livedI'm addicted

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Come through on the first?
Good, cause I make my best moves on the first
First of the third, I be workin theGotta break 'm all down, so every person gets surved
I'm addicted to this life for me

I can't coap with being broke, I never could
Plus I prommised myself I never would
Plus I can't forget the fact I have that
Wrist when it comes to whippin, bring that Crack back
I'm in the kitchen, I'm whippin, bringing that Crakck back
Cam, pass me the ice, BlackjOr should I say magic
Pardin my slang, it's pardt of my bad habits
Pardin my ring, it's just part of my swagger
You don't like it, nigga, pardin my swagger
I told a chick I'm addicted
To holding my dick with my right hand and posing for pictures
I told her quick "I'm sort of a pimp, bitch"
Or more of a hustler, and one you should get with
It's none like me
Not two, not three, not one like me
Can't none get it done like me
Not him, not him, damb sure not her like me

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]

Uh, yeah
Woo! Uh, it’s going down, niggas!
Yes! Khaled! Free!
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Freeway]
It’s that slow flow, F-R double-E, nigga
See them pussy niggas but you can’t see me
I’m sunk in the seat
Clutch my hammer close, I’m controlling the V
And love the cities on both the coasts
But still repping the East, yeah
They like, “Freeway, where you been?”
In North Philly, in the hood, cooking a ki’
Tell me, how crooked is he?
The mayor gave him the key to the city
Then he turn around and flood the city with nickels
To break the cycle, the nine-nickel chrome
The mini-mansion, his home
If Khaled call my phone, I’m in the place to be
G4, the M-I, get high, float in the friendly sky
I’m that fly, tell my pilot the fourth
Far as raps, I murder tracks, Philly
I kill the shit out a sixteen
Shit’s mean, spit a clip for the chorus, I
Tape and record it, put the murder on wax, I
Ship it out to Khaled and shoot a video for it, holla!

[Chorus: Freeway]
I’m from the East where them ARs shooting
Ruthless, niggas will leave you naked, for the record
Khaled from the South where them bammers be moving
Walk into yo’ house and will leave you tied up, for the dollar
Can’t forget the West, where them niggas be looting
Shooting over colors, they will kill ya mother, for the record
And where you at, nigga? That’s where you from, nigga
So rep where you from, nigga, wherever you at, nigga

[Verse 2: Freeway]
My shooter keep it moving, you niggas barely moving
Them bullets almost hit you, you scream, “A-hallelujah!”
I’m on grind, all-time with the Ruger
And Khaled, all these niggas 

[?], they want me to lose, but
I’m on my Ps and Qs and, I got my eyes open
Can make it happen with rapping, I get my Ps and Qs in
I know Katrina shooting, know Mr. Robert smoking
I supply the addicts, they grab the baggage and keep it moving
Keep it, holding, 6-series, not stolen
Drop the lop look like the roof stolen, call the cops
He be stacking like Lego, leave me holding all the blocks
Run up on him, treat you like the drop, roof open
All them stick-up boys scheming on them fat boys scoping
They be hoping that I’m slipping, I be praying that I’m not
Nigga, ’til then, I’m supplying the block
Free at Last almost here, you should keep your ears open, nigga!

[Chorus: Freeway & Malice]
I’m from the East where them ARs shooting
Ruthless, niggas will leave you naked, for the record
Khaled from the South where them bammers be moving
Walk into yo’ house and will leave you tied up, for the dollar
Can’t forget the West, where them niggas be looting
Shooting over colors, they will kill ya mother, for the record
And where you at, nigga? That’s where you from, nigga
So rep where you from, nigga, wherever you at, nigga
Yeah, yeah, check it, check it

[Verse 3: Malice & Pusha T]
95-South, homie, tell ‘em I’m en route
And I ain’t fronting nothing, neither, that ain’t what I’m ‘bout
No doubt; from Virginia, where the drought never touch us
Them dopes in the pillows, the home of the couch-stuffers
Pop clutches, drop-tops on all you motherfuckers
And all the baddest bitches pretending that they love us
Fucking the soul out us, we call ‘em "The Golden-Mouthers"
Paying for the service with Louis or Gucci pouches
Send ‘em to they spouses, we back in the street
Cooking up them ounces, from a quarter to a ki’
Call me "Place-Your-Order P," c’est la vie
If you want it, know, I got it for cheap, Re-Up Gang, niggas!
We cock and bang, niggas, we cop them things, niggas
Million records sold and still them same niggas
Bigger picture, grill with the angel fixtures
Where I’m at, they measure worth by your figures, ugh!

[Chorus: Freeway]
I’m from the East where them ARs shooting
Ruthless, niggas will leave you naked, for the record
Khaled from the South where them bammers be moving
Walk into yo’ house and will leave you tied up, for the dollar
Can’t forget the West, where them niggas be looting
Shooting over colors, they will kill ya mother, for the record
And where you at, nigga? That’s where you from, nigga
So rep where you from, nigga, wherever you at, nigga

[Intro: T.I.]
Ayy
You know a lot of niggas talk a lot of shit a lot of times, you know what I'm sayin'?
But when I come around, man, why them niggas don't be there, man? You know what I'm sayin'?
Why don't them niggas be present then man?
Why them niggas, they talkin' all that shit when I'm here, man?
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: T.I.]
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Run inside and hide out
They dip, slide, ride out
Why when I bring my guys out?
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Why when them 45s out?
They dip, slide, switch sides
'Cause they know we the shit, right?

[Verse 1: Young Dro]
I got them guns 

[?] the back of me
Ridin' down 

[?]
Gage on the seat, I wanna blow it like a 

[?]
Take a nigga eyesight, the opposite of Acuvue
My wrath is like Katrina, 

[?] evacuees
I wild like sporadicly
Jackin' me is actually suicide 

[?]
Choppers burn up your faculty
I'm mafia, I'm practically better than all them rappers be
You got a problem, need to step up 

[?] sat with me
Dappin' niggas who trap with me
Overkill, over trill
Flowin' down 

[?] showin' how them bands overfilled
Over real, I resemble God, I am Lord
Forgiveness is gave, my squad embrace God
Wake hard, take off soft
Metaphorically I sell niggas bricks, then off soft
Eight off boss, I'm so belligerent and diligent
Boot camp soldier, nine months, mind militant
Dro

[Chorus: T.I.]
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Run inside and hide out
They dip, slide, ride out
Why when I bring my guys out?
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Why when them 45s out?
They dip, slide, switch sides
'Cause they know we the shit, right?
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Run inside and hide out
They dip, slide, ride out
Why when I bring my guys out?
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Why when them 45s out?
They dip, slide, switch sides
'Cause they know we the shit, right?

[Verse 2: Big Kuntry King]
It's Mr. Hurricane, Kuntry King
Rollin' in the black 6
Mr. TIP the king, rollin in the Phantom, bitch
We keep them guns in the ride, even on the driver's side
We can handle any situation like MacGivor
Not to mention the ten Chevrolets right behind us
Ain't a nigga liver, bend it and ride like us
In the club, you see the VVS shining
Champagne and Luie bottles, let the liquor drown us
Let the 

[?] surround us with haters all around us
All I do is flash a big bank on them towers
Sucker dip, slide, ride out, they game ain't up to par
Like 

[?] my game is eager for a young trap star
If it's gangsta shit you want, pussy nigga, I'll bring it to you
You want your top popped off, I can do that for you
I'm here now, what you suckers wanna do to me?
Ain't no movin' me and all that talk ain't nothin' new to me

[Chorus: T.I.]
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Run inside and hide out
They dip, slide, ride out
Why when I bring my guys out?
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Why when them 45s out?
They dip, slide, switch sides
'Cause they know we the shit, right?
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Run inside and hide out
They dip, slide, ride out
Why when I bring my guys out?
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Why when them 45s out?
They dip, slide, switch sides
'Cause they know we the shit, right?

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Bet you wondering why I'm looking so relaxed in my ride
'Cause it's a AR in the back of my ride
Plus a 9 and a dime on the passenger side
So if a broad ain't find, I'm passin' her by
Wanna live like me? Well, you gotta be fly
A nigga tell you otherwise, the nigga gotta be high
I've accomplished all the things you could possibly try
And aqcuired all the shit a pimp could possibly buy
Set the streets on fire, how can you deny
That I'm the king? Give a damn if you a fan or you not
He a arrogant fucker, but goddamnit, he hot
And all the props he came in the game demandin', he got
Know a lot of people thought that I was runnin' my mouth
When I said I was king and I was runnin' the south
But it's still a few niggas out there runnin' they mouth
They gon' be found shot down with a gun in they mouth, nigga

[Chorus: T.I.]
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Run inside and hide out
They dip, slide, ride out
Why when I bring my guys out?
Them niggas dip, slide, ride out
Why when them 45s out?
They dip, slide, switch sides
'Cause they know we the shit, right?

[Chorus: Dre]
Khaled, tell them what the fuck this is, this is the movement
Move with us, I got a hundred goons with me
Khaled, tell them what the fuck this is, it's the movement
Move with us, I got a hundred goons with me

[Verse 1: Dre]
Chevy sittin on some big ryms, ride with me
My wrist so steady, try to take it, can't with me
I'm Dre, don't give a fuck who your clique is
We need to find out where the fuck your bitch is
I got cribs out of stait
Tell the chef fix the plate, that be something
Buddy, what you think this is, a fuckin game?
Let me tell you what you is, a fuckin lame
And I'm a G, go tell your partners
Designer jeans, I wear them often
I bought them cheap, about that profit
You fuck with me, end up in the coffen

[Chorus: Dre]
Khaled, tell them what the fuck this is, this is the movement
Move with us, I got a hundred goons with me
Khaled, tell them what the fuck this is, it's the movement
Move with us, I got a hundred goons with me

[Verse 2: Dre]
Brr, Brr, sellphone, it won't quit
Renisonts man, I be on some old shit
In a new whip, bumpin throwbacks
Color me bad, Neno Brown and Gold Jack
Rep Miami, we did it, put all your hope in me
I'm exactly what real niggas is supposed to be
Not the Dr. but it's still Dre
When I be in New York, I tell them I know Jay
You gotta deal with Dre
Bitches love Dre
When you see Dre, what you see is great
No Wilma, no Catrina, no hurricane
Compared to when I blow rappers hands off, I'm rapping soft

[Chorus: Dre]
Khaled, tell them what the fuck this is, this is the movement
Move with us, I got a hundred goons with me
Khaled, tell them what the fuck this is, it's the movement
Move with us, I got a hundred goons with me

[Verse 3: Dre]
I keep my paper straight stackin, and them birds I'm packin
They can't see my mansions, so I give them some glasses
I got a pentiont for slanging pies, turn me up, bump me louder
Beat like the lotto, but niggas don't wanna battle
Imma tell ya like a nigga told me
Don't be dissing on no record, go and see me like a G
Your lil lady loves me
What you talkin bout?
Take a trip to A Town, blow your fuckin brains out
I'm with my bro Cool, run with young fools
Stay with work, feeling like I'm on the move
I ain't hard to find, you can smell the dro
We don't fuck with no basic hoes

[Chorus: Dre]
Khaled, tell them what the fuck this is, this is the movement
Move with us, I got a hundred goons with me
Khaled, tell them what the fuck this is, it's the movement
Move with us, I got a hundred goons with me

[Verse 1: Hennessy & P.M.]
I done came too far to go back
And too hard to go soft
I'm fofilling my wishes, I got swag
They always say I'm losing my britches
I'm from the hood, so whatever ever happen I'm with it
DOE til I die, I got BIEs, for the low coming, see that cheese
You might be the police
So I don't give niggas convo
Talk shit, and choppers aming at your ass pronto

[Verse 2: Brisco]
I'm Brisco, what it be like?
A whole 5 star general, nigga, I been tight
Class gon hurt for these niggas
You don't need another case, let me murk these niggas
Fuck around and lose a loved one, got Khaled 

[?] connections with them

[Chorus: Lunchmoney]
Fuck all you haters, we gon do it major
For all that green paper

[?] by Jacob
He ain't nothing but a hater
These goons do it major

[Verse 3: Dirty Red]
Khaled, let me get them
I done came from nothing
Only a buck 65, took the game through muscle
I done got it on the block, they don't oh me nothing
Imma teach ya bout flawsing and stunting
I'm from the trap, boy
Can't believe everything you see on the TV
These niggas get out of line, burn quicker than CDs
Ain't never been friendly, ain't feeling these old bees
Don't fit in the hood with the thugs and OGs
They tell me thug niggas don't live long
So I bring that thing with me when I leave home
Watch your mouth, loose lips make your ship sink
Niggas talk shit, but when it's time, can't stand in the paint
Dirty Red, you understand what my name mean?
I'm excepted in the game, it changed me
Make money, but the money don't make me
I'm too real, I'm what these other niggas can't be

[Chorus: Lunchmoney]
Fuck all you haters, we gon do it major
For all that green paper

[?] by Jacob
He ain't nothing but a hater
These goons do it major

[Pre-Chorus]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist game froze, you should see the way we do it
Sexy little bitch she throwin' titties out the window
You from outta town but you know what we get into

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters

Sailing like a pirate how I came in with the yacht

Tell me if you fuckin' cause it's backups if you're not

Threesome, sexy two broads, ooh

And no more puttin' shooters in the Uber
'Cause they can't hop back in it when they

All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist game froze, you should see the way we do it
Sexy little bitch she throwin' titties out the window

Shawty, are you down to give the head to all my shooters, oh

[Verse 2]
I came in, I just pulled up with the slab
She don't know her father but lil' mama call me dad
Go designer shopping, cop it, fucking up the tab
Rich as fuck, my chick thick as fuck, I had to brag
All these, diamonds, on me (woo)
Don't it, get you, horny? (woo)
It's late, but I, can't leave, it's lit
Rollin', top down, my shit, legit (straight up)
Police tryna catch me with the shooters

I caught a felony and beat that shit the next week
I stack it tall, Lisa Leslie cause

[Pre-Chorus]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist game froze, you should see the way we do it
Sexy little bitch she throwin' titties out the window
You from outta town but you know what we get into

[Chorus]

Wrist so froze you should see how I been movin'
Shawty said she down enough to flex with all the shooters
Shawty, are you down to give the head to all my shooters, oh

And that is how a you go reach Mount Zion

I feel magical, mystical, motherful, logistical

Look around X3
On the ground X2
There's a finger on my blister

[Verse 1: Jake]
Smoke-swell haze on the hill over Tennessee
Leaky churches
Honey-burned tobacco leaves
Girl, teal-eyed, do occupy this tree with me
Summer peelings

[Verse 2: Jake, Jake & Nathan]
The rose-set road will bend around
The earth you knew is waiting for you, dear
Some wave-swept gold drips from your mouth
The hazel hounds move south
To meet you here
Sky gone a certain shade of blue
The kind that heaven's fixin' up for you
Boy, that sure-fire desire is true
Raw hands heart-beating to the smoky view

[Verse 3: Jake]
Warm glow morning soaked in pastel tea
Soulful, soulful kids stamped to the concrete
Tryna be a paintbrush
Searching for a better seat
Summer peelings

[Chorus: Nathan, Nathan & Jake]
Arm's length, shoulders wide
Looking for a fight
Peace sign, getting by
People, we'll be alright
Arm's length, shoulders wide
Looking for a fight
Peace sign, getting by
People, we'll be alright
Arm's length, shoulders wide
Looking for a fight
Peace sign, getting by
People, we'll be alright
Arm's length, shoulders wide
Looking for a fight
Peace sign, getting by
People, we'll be alright
Arm's length, shoulders wide
Looking for a fight
Peace sign, getting by
People, we'll be alright
Arm's length, shoulders wide
Looking for a fight
Peace sign, getting by
People, we'll be alright

[Outro: Nathan, Jake, Nathan & Zach]
(Smoke-swell haze on the hill over Tennessee)
Arm's length, shoulders wide
Looking for a fight
Peace sign, getting by
People, we'll be alright
(Leaky churches, honey-burnt tobacco leaves)
Arm's length, shoulders wide
(Girl, teal-eyed, do occupy this tree with me)
Looking for a fight
Peace sign, getting by
People, we'll be alright
Arm's length, shoulders wide
Looking for a fight
(Summer peelings)
Peace sign, getting by
People, we'll be alright

[Verse 1]
I should've known when we met at the late show
You and me, dangerous, sittin' way too close
2AM, at my door where you dropped me off
Tell me how in the hell did I end up with my hand on the barrel?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time that you paid
I want you to clean up the mess that you made
Like a bitch out of order
Like a bat out of hell
Like a fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell?

[Chorus]
Bang, bang
Put my gun down on the table
Before you try to blow my mind
I used to think it was you who was so unstable
But now I'm sure I'm close behind

[Chorus]
B-b-bang, b-b-bang, bang, boom
B-b-bang, b-b-bang, bang, boom
B-b-bang, b-b-bang, bang, boom
B-b-bang, b-b-bang, bang, boom

[Verse 2]
I thought you were good, you painted me bad
Compared to the others, the best thing I had
But then I discovered, it couldn't get worse
You're buildin' my coffin, you're drivin' the hearse
I thought it was you, I loved you the most
But I was just keepin' my enemies close
I made a decision to never look back
So how did you end up with all of my jack?

[Interlude]
Whoa, whoa
Bang, bang

[Verse 3]
I should've known, you were too good to be true
You were hidin' both your horns and I was such a fool
It's not a race, wasn't trying to beat you
Trip me up, shut me down when I was with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a bitch out of order
Like a bat out of hell
Like a fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell?

[Chorus]
Bang bang
Put my gun down on the table
Before you try to blow my mind
I used to think it was you who was so unstable
But now I'm sure I'm close behind

[Chorus]
B-b-bang, b-b-bang, bang, boom
B-b-bang, b-b-bang, bang, boom
B-b-bang, b-b-bang, bang, boom
B-b-bang, b-b-bang, bang, boom

[Verse 3]
I thought you were good, you painted me bad
Compared to the others, the best thing I had
But then I discovered, it couldn't get worse
You're buildin' my coffin, you're drivin' the hearse
I thought it was you, I loved you the most
But I was just keepin' my enemies close
I made a decision, I had to employ
So how did you end up with all of my toys?

[Bridge]
I'm not your brother, not your lover
And I'm not your friend
Now that it's over, you're another kind of different
A new person
Your time is up
And that's my blood in your dixie cup

[Chorus]
B-b-bang, b-b-bang, bang, boom
B-b-bang, b-b-bang, bang, boom
B-b-bang, b-b-bang, bang, boom
B-b-bang, b-b-bang, bang, boom

[Outro]
Bang bang boom
B-b-bang, boom
B-b-bang, boom
I, I wanna wake up in the morning sun
Open my eyes, my life is just begun
I, I'll be ready when my kingdom come
I'm letting go of all the things I've done

I, I wanna wake up in the morning sun
Open my eyes, my life is just begun
I, I'll be ready when my kingdom come
I'm letting go of all the things I've done

As long as we're together
We gon' do this thing forever
It's true, with you
As long as we're together
We gon' do this thing forever
It's true, with you

Swinging like a tree
Baby you and me, me, me
It's a fantasy
Stuck inside a dream, dream, dream
Pack up all my things, you are all I need, need, need
Just you
I always believe you will never leave, leave, leave
Baby we're a team
You are stuck with me, me, me
Hand inside my jeans, like we're in the sheet, sheets
Just you
I, I wanna wake up in the morning sun
Open my eyes, my life is just begun
I, I'll be ready when my kingdom come
I'm letting go of all the things I've done

I, I wanna wake up in the morning sun
Open my eyes, my life is just begun
I, I'll be ready when my kingdom come
I'm letting go of all the things I've done

Now some believe in jesus
But I believe in us
It's true, with you
Now some believe in jesus
But I believe in us
It's true, with you

Swinging like a tree
Baby you and me, me, me
It's a fantasy
Stuck inside a dream, dream, dream
Pack up all my things, you are all I need, need, need
Just you
I always believe you will never leave, leave, leave
Baby we're a team
You are stuck with me, me, me
Hand inside my jeans, like we're in the sheet, sheets
Just you
So baby pull the trigger on my love
I can't wait to get me some
Baby you're 'erybodies boy you always make me want to come
Come on run, we're the wildest things
Jungle life is the way we live
I would never change it, baby livin' for your everything

Pull the trigger on my love
I can't wait to get me some
Baby you're 'erybodies boy you always make me want to come
Come on run, we're the wildest things
Jungle life is the way we live
I would never change it, baby livin' for your everything

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1]
Walking up to me, expecting, walking up to me
Expecting words, it happens every time
Present company, expect it, present company
Expect the worst, it happens every night

[Hook 1]
Ah, present company, excluded every time
Ah, present company, the best that you can find

[Verse 2]
Talking like a jerk, except you are an actual jerk
And living proof that sometimes friends are mean
Present company, expect it, present company
Expect the worst, it works just like a need

[Hook 2]
Ah, present company, excluded in every way
Ah, present company, makes you wanna stay

[Verse 3]
Killing it with close inspection
Killing it can only make it worse
It sort of makes it breed
Present company expect it
Present company just laugh it off
Works just like a need

[Hook 3]
Ah, present company, excluded in the night
Ah, present company, included in the fight

[Interlude]
Ah-ahhhhhhh
Ah-ah-ahhhh
Ahhhhh
Ah-ahhhh

[Verse 4]
Don't you want me to wake up?
So give me just a bit of your time
Arguments are made from make outs
Then give me just a bit of your time

We've got to bring the resources
I wanna play it 'til the time comes
Forget your string of divorces
You go and throw your little hands up

[Bridge 1]
It's late
No, it's late

[Verse 5]
I miss the way the night comes
With friends who always make it feel good
This basement has a cold glow
Though it's better than a bunch of others

[Chorus]
So go and dance yourself clean
Go and dance yourself clean
We're blowing Marxism to pieces
Their little arguments to pieces

[Bridge 2]
It's your show
It's your show
It's your show
It's your show
It's your show...

Put your little feet down

[Breakdown]
Every night's a different story
It's a thirty car pile-up with you
Every fucker it's getting older
It's the end of an era, it's true

[Bridge 3]
And you go
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop

[Verse 6]
Break me into bigger pieces
So some of me is home with you
Wait until the weekend
So we can make our bad dreams come true

And it's a go, yeah, it's a go
But if we wait until the weekend
We can miss the best things to do
Oh

[Outro]
We should try a little harder
In this tedious march of the few
Every fucker's getting younger
And there's a part of me hoping, it's true

[Chorus 1]
It's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
It's time to get away
It's time to get away from you

[Verse 1]
You brought a lot of money
And me, I'm catching tiny tummy
And you, you make me sleep
I try and try
But you undermine me, uh-huh
And I start to be sensible
If you know what I mean

[Chorus 2]
And so it's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away
I'm dying to get away

[Post-Chorus 1]
Next time let's talk it over
And we can start again, shock

[Verse 2]
For you, I caught a lot of static
And me, I would like it automatic
What, what, what, what
What did you think would happen next?
What, what, what, what
What could it ever be?

[Chorus 2]
Though it's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away
I'm dying to get away

[Post-Chorus 1]
Next time we can talk it over
Or even start again

[Bridge]
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to pity you, it's true
To think I used to talk to you
To think I used to talk to you, it's true

[Post-Chorus 2]
Next time we could talk it over
Or even start again
You couldn't tell me what you wanted
I knew you were low, man
But the truth is I was shocked

[Outro]
Fun, power, eyes
Eyes never lie
Kids ("Hey, buddy?" "What?")
Kids never lie
Shame on you
Shame on you

Hey! Your love away from me!
You can't hide
Hey! Your love away from me!
But shame on you

Hey! Your love away from me!
You can't hide
Hey! Your love away from me!
But shame on you

Your love away from me!
You can't hide
Hey! Your love away from me!
Shame on you

Your love away from me!
You can't hide
Hey! Your love away from me!
Shame on you
Oh no, still you can, but I'll be lonely
Oh no, still you can, and I'll be lonely

Hey! Your love away from me!
You can't hide
Hey! Your love away from me!
Shame on you
Your love away from me!
You can't hide (shame on you)

Hey!
Oh no, still you can
Tell by the way I
Pho-o-o-one in situations
Got a love life
Say that your influence and love I could never return, yeah
But time still will follow us all and then
I wanna do what it takes to be lovin'
Like you do, not what you told me
But I've got to let you know, but
He leave me to love and
I don't feel like it's one more
My favorite song
My favorite song
Reminds me of the first time I went to space
It was such a long journey
It took hours, days, years
But when it was over...

Oh, it takes me back
That takes me back to the first time
I stepped into space
You were there
You were there with all my best friends

I remember
I remember the look on your face
The way you said, with your eyes
You said

[Instrumental]

And then I slipped out of the Sun's sphere of influence
Nothing was happening
It was so dizzying
And then you took everything from me
I was left here, a shell of my self
I was left here to pick up the pieces
And every piece was...

Love, give me love

That's when you saved me
At the last possible moment
You brought your big hand out
And scooped up my ship
And took me home

That day you gave a new faith
In how people can save one another
Instead of always putting out their hands
To crush

[Repeat 2x]
When you're out in space
You feel so light
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na

[Repeat 3x]
When you're out in space
You feel so light
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
When you're out in space
You feel so light

[Instrumental]

[Part 1: Freak Out]

[Chorus] x5
If you do it again, I'm gonna freak out
If you do it again, I'm gonna freak out
If you do it again, I'm gonna freak out
If you do it again, I'm gonna freak out
So do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again

[Part 2: Starry Eyes]

[Hook] x2
Starry eyes, doot doot

Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Pat Mahoney!

[Verse 1]
Late night, miss the train
Waiting in the rain
All night on the floor
And my feet are sore

[Verse 2]
Fool's out on the make
School's out and it's late
It's you I'm waiting for
Want to see you more, see you more

[Hook] x4
Starry eyes, doot doot

[Verse 2]
Fool's out on the make
School's out and it's late
It's you I'm waiting for
Want to see you more, see you more

[Bridge]
Uh huh
Uh huh

[Hook] x2
Starry eyes, doot doot

[Verse 3]
Bright lights in my eyes
Got me hypnotised
Late night on the floor
Wanting so much more, so much more

[Hook] x5
Starry eyes, doot doot
Home
Home
Home
Home
Home
Home

Take me home
Just do it right
Make it perfect and real
Because it's everything
No everything was never the deal

This is the trick, forget a terrible year
So we can shut the door
Oh, shut the door on terrible times
Aah

Do it right
And head again into space
So you can carry on
And carry on, and fall all over the place
This is the trick, forget a terrible year
That we can shut the door
Oh, shut the door
Until it gets weird

And this is what you waited for
But under lights, we're all unsure
So tell me
What would make you feel better?

As night has such a local ring
And love and rock are pick-up things
And you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know

Take

Forget your past
This is your last chance now
And we can break the rules
Like nothing will last

You might forget
Forget the sound of a voice
Still you should not forget
Yeah, don't forget
The things that we laughed about
And after rolling on the floor
And thankfully, a few make sure that you get home
And you stay home
And you're better

'Cause you're afraid of what you need
Yeah, you're afraid of what you need
If you weren't, yeah you weren't
I don't know what we'd talk about

Aah, aah-ahh

Yeah, no one ever knows what you're talking about
So I guess you're already there
No one opens up when you scream and shout
But it's time to make a couple things clear

If you're afraid of what you need
If you're afraid of what you need
Look around you, you're surrounded
It won't get any better

Until the night
You can climb a mountain
You can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire
But you'll never be free

You can shake me up
Or I can break you down
Whoa-o-o-o-, whoa-o-o-o-

You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire

We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy

You can climb a mountain
You can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire
But you'll never be free
You can shake me up
Or I can break you down
Whoa-o-o-o-, whoa-o-o-o-

You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire

But you'll never be free
But you'll never be free
Whoa-o-o-o-, whoa-o-o-o-

You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
Oh you
How can I regret?
How can I regret what you do?
You know the blame is on you

You won't leave me alone
Though it's the right thing
How can I forget what you put me through?
Sometimes I can't believe it's true

And now we're through
But you think we're cool
And this is my big difference with you

I think I'm ashamed
The way I feel
I know I'm ashamed
I feel like a shock

I want to forget
I want to forget
I get what I get
These Christmas blues
And that's the truth
But they come in, they come in
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
Batman and Robin, head bobbin', no Joker Penguin
You see him freezin' up like Mr. Freeze, Catwoman on the mind
The Batmobile design, Alfred the butler
Dynamic-duo hustlers
Burn rubber, Gotham City, I'm spinnin' in the gutter
Left the Batcave full of computers, the Mad Hatter
The realest, see my boss red like Twizzlers
I'm so hot like Hot Wheels, color shifters
Diagonal over Gotham City lookin' pretty
The caped crusader continue through the stages like a player
Pullin' up on The Joker while he playing poker
King Tut hoppin' out the range rover with brolic shoulders
Green Hornet and Kato see the Lamborghini doors open
Same rims on the BM as the Lotus
Dark blocks and they pop like pop rocks
Your girl on the cock, she jock a lot, the next episode, reload

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Cock the swammy back, don't hesitate, react, believe dat
They defecate where they eat at
More repulsive than the Boars Head logo
The trees had em seein' impulses in slow-mo, whoa
A whole lot of funk, a whole lot of drunk, who knows?
Could've did a line of bump with Donald Trump
He hear voices in his head, he gotta jump
Not now, too much lactose, gotta dump
A wise owl, growl with a mean scowl
A stand up dude even when he seeing foul, meanwhile
The world keeps on spinnin'
It seems the forces of evil keep on winnin'
Change of plans, and I'll take that off your hands
Retreat back to the cave with your mans
Super Vill, salute Milk D, top bill
Top notch or chop meat and chop krill
In the mix of trappin' and gun clappin'
DOOM, 25 years in, son slappin'
Wrote the key to life down on some napkin
Can't find it, whoever do is like-minded

[Snippet of lyrics released on Twitter]

...It's been oolong since I've had a sip
And I get this feeling, I need a green detox
The truth will be the winner tonight....

...Without the milk or sweet honey...

...That's the truth, Tea...
(Chorus)
It's in time, the current takes me away, ay ay
It's in time, the current takes away, from you
It's in time, the tides will take you away, ay ay
It's in time, the tides will take you away, ay yay ay, ay ay

(Verse 1)
Oh yeah, I've been gone for two nights
Oh my, now shes callin' me for flights
Weekends, looking pretty booked right now (Damn)
Tonight, I thought we were leavin' town

(Bridge)
Thought I left this pack of ice, I froze (?), so high
I might be the one, who's really cold, goodnight
Think she saw my weight in gold, shine
Now my lifes a f***ing stone (?), high

(Pre Chorus)
It's in time, I find it come today
Cause' in time, the tides will take me away, away, away,
It's in time, the clouds will take you away
(Chorus)
It's in time, the current takes me away, ay ay
It's in time, the current takes away from you
It's in time, the tides will take you away, ay ay
It's in time, the tides will take you away, ay yay ay, ay ay

(Bridge 2)
I know that there's problems that's real
I know that there's problems that's fake (fake)
I know that there's something going on
Got my mind playing all these games

(Chorus)
It's in time, the current takes me away, ay ay
It's in time, the current takes away from you
It's in time, the tides will take you away, ay ay
It's in time, the tides will take you away, ay yay ay, ay ay

[Verse 1]
I live in a house with a tin roof and
Every time it rains, I can feel my brain
It's moving back and forth
Upside down, east-west
Feeling and remembering everything you do

[Verse 2]
I was up last night tossing and turning
Couldn't get to sleep and I slept thru the morning
Need to clear my head and get out of the city
All alone in the jungle you'll find me

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and hear my secret
Deep, deep loving, hear my secret
Hear my secret, hear my secret

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I can hear the tremble below me
Pounding thru the floor, my body so restless
It lives in the basement below some boxes
Makes me feel so strange and so thoughtless so

[Verse 4]
Maybe someday this roof will cave in
You'll find me on the floor looking at the stars
These walls are made of brick, plated in gold
But I'm still here growing so old

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and hear my secret
Deep, deep loving, hear my secret
Hear my secret, hear my secret

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and hear my secret
Deep, deep loving, hear my secret
Hear my secret, hear my secret

[Chorus]
Coming for me
I hope you really are
Awaiting all the time I seem to be
Coming for me
I hope you really are
Awaiting all the time I seem to be

[Verse 1]
Well I could be watching a movie
I might as well be watching you
Well I could be ordering sushi
Well I might as well be ordering you

[Chorus]
Coming for me
I hope you really are
Awaiting all the time I seem to be
Coming for me
I hope you really are
Awaiting all the time I seem to be

[Verse 2]
Well I could be working on a farm
I might as well be where you are
Well I could be in a police car
But I might as well be in your arms
Yeah

[Chorus]
Coming for me
I hope you really are
I’m waiting all the time I seem to be
Coming for me
I hope you really are
Awaiting all the time I seem to be

[Bridge]
Well I wouldn’t mind the rain
If it was falling when you came

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
(La la la la) La la la la la
No I wouldn’t mind the rain
(La la la la) La la la la la
If it was falling, falling all day
(La la la la) La la la la la
If you were calling, calling on me
(La la la la) La la la la la
So just come along

[Verse 1]
I’ve been feeling weary, 70 degrees in February
Mama’s raking leaves, and I’m about to leave
I-90 barreling down, Pacific Northwest-bound
Through this cage’s screens, watch the turning of the leaves
Oh I’m free, Oh I’m free

[Chorus]
Oh, rest easy while I’m home
While I’m home

[Verse 2]
But I ain’t often home, keep company but feel alone
All the sights to see, I know where I could be
I’m a lonesome boy, but loneliness pair well with joy
All in all live, and learn what you can give that’s free
Oh that’s free

[Chorus]
Home, rest easy while I’m home
Well I’m home
Home, while I’m home
Well I’m home

[Verse 3]
Often miss my pa when I hear that Amanaz
Follow Khala my friend down the road that has no end
Ain’t got time to meet someone I would treat in that loving way
Cause I’m leaving any day if I’m free
Oh I’m free

[Chorus]
Oh, rest easy while I’m home
While I’m home

[Verse 4]
Just a traveling man in a traveling band
Hope to lend a hand before the Earth turns into sand
Wanted to have a daughter and a son that loves the water
Swimming in the sea living worry-free
Fat chance, fat chance…

[Chorus]
Home, rest easy while I’m home
While I’m home
Home, rest easy while I’m home
While I’m home
Home, while I’m home
Well I’m home

[Verse 1]
You always want to watch
Somethin' late at night
That terrifies you
And then you make me stand guard
At the bedroom door
I wanna know everythin' you do

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I never mind
Do it a thousand times
Just let me close to you
'Cause in the dead of night
With you by my side
There's no cold that could cut through

[Chorus]
Do you miss me too?
Wish you were in my room
I just can't shake this off, I won't try
And will you fly back to me?
There's no one we gotta see, no
There's no other place we should be
There's no other place we should be

[Verse 2]
I talk a lot of shit for someone that can't talk
Then you send it back to my face, love
You never pull punches and never will stop
I hope you never do, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I never mind (Mind)
Do it a thousand times (Times)
Just let me close to you
'Cause in the dead of night (Night)
With you by my side (Side)
There's no cold that could cut through

[Chorus]
Do you miss me too?
Wish you were in my room
I just can't shake this off, I won't try
And will you fly back to me?
There's no one we gotta see, no
There's no other place we should be

[Outro]
Do you miss me too?
Wish you were in my room
I just can't shake this off, I won't try
And will you fly back to me?
There's no one we gotta see, no
There's no other place we should be

[Intro: Gucci Mane & The Weeknd]
Huh, it's Gucci
XO (Yeah), 1-0 (Yeah), 1-7 (Yeah)
Brr, brr
(Go)

[Verse 1: The Weeknd & Gucci Mane]
The kid back on the whiskey
Virginia Black got me tipsy
I'm in L.A. like I'm Nipsey
Spanish girls wanna kiss me
A nigga wanna come and diss me
And put a hex like a gypsy
They kill themselves, no wrist bleed
Got suicides on my SV
She do it all for the Fendi
She do it all for the Gucci (Gucci!)
Baby girl wanna choose me
She wanna use and abuse me (Uh)
I know she wanna text me (Wow)
I know she wanna sex me
Fifty thou' make her neck freeze
Fuck her once like, "Next, please"
My nigga, who would've thought? (Huh?)
My nigga, who would've thought now?
I'll be right back at the top now
I'll be right back at the top now
I got your girl on my finger
Blowin' my phone like she's single
Blowin' my phone like I'm Cee-Lo (Damn)
Somebody needs to come get her

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Gucci Mane]
Like, "Woo," with the curve (With the curve)
I know you don't deserve it, know you don't deserve it
I got that work
I know you want the Birkin, baby, are you worth it?
With the curve (With the curve)
I know you don't deserve it, know you don't deserve it
I got that work (With the, with the, with the)
I need to know for certain (It's Gucci!)
Tell me, are you worth it?

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Say I, a star was born last night
Way you showed out on that dick, girl, you performed last night
That's why you deserve that first-class flight
Buh-bye, 'cause I just quenched your thirst last night
I'm in Dubai
Somebody tell the prince that the kingpin has arrived
If I lived over here, I'd probably have one hundred wives (Damn!)
Walkin' in the club and they like, "Gucci just arrived" (Gucci!)
I ordered up a dub and then I threw it in the sky
I told her I'm a'ight, now she look like she surprised (I'm a'ight)
She look like a model, but a devil in disguise
Bum, bum-bum-bum, I feel like Rocky in his prime (Bum, bum-bum-bum, bum)
You know you came to fuck, so why the fuck we wastin' time?
I got the kind of wood that make a woman lose her mind
I'm young, rich and handsome, baby, I'm one of a kind
Just keep it real with me, baby, it won't cost you a dime
I know you got expensive taste and I don't even mind

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Gucci Mane]
Like, "Woo," with the curve (With the curve)
I know you don't deserve it, know you don't deserve it (No)
I got that work (Got that, got that, got that)
I know you want the Birkin, baby, are you worth it?
With the curve (With the curve, it's Gucci!)
I know you don't deserve it, know you don't deserve it (Hell no)
I got that work (With the, with the, with the, with the)
I need to know for certain, tell me, are you worth it?
(You need to know Wop!)

[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Wiz Khalifa (both)]

Now your pussy gettin' wet soon as you mention me

Fuckin' with me got me goin' way up
Slammin' in that pussy, never lay up
Fuckin' up your makeup

You an' him need to hurry up and break up
Run around the world, I don't run games
Run into your bitch, I'ma find out her name
Let her rep the gang, let her wear my chain
Let her give me brain
Soon as I put it in

[Verse 1]
You've got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we can make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Anyplace is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I've got nothing to prove

[Pre-Chorus]
See my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle that's the way it is
Says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My momma went off and left him
She wanted more to life than he could give
Said somebody's gotta take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
I work in a market as a checkout boy
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
Live in the suburbs

[Pre-Chorus]
You've got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You've gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
And I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone
Be someone, be someone

[Outro]
You've got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You've gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
Leave tonight or live and die this way
Leave tonight or live and die this way
Leave tonight or live and die this way
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Told her pop that ass for me on a jet ski (On a jet ski)
She said, "I might even lick it if you let me" (If you let me)
You knew I would kill the pussy when you met me
And that's why none of mine can regret me
Oh, yeah oh, yeah
Throw the cash up high, it's all there, yeah
Pop that ass for me on the jet ski
She wanna fuck because the chain, Wayne Gretzky
I would hit it out in public if she let me
I'm tryna fuck her twin sister she gon' let me

Say I hit that the shit so good she can't forget me
I can't have no bird bitches disrespect me
When you know I curve bitches just for sweating me
I be smoking Presidential, gone elect me
All the white girls wanna give me Becky
All the time a nigga fuck her in a fresh tee
A nigga mad that I'm sav, tryna threaten me
I be balling, need a espy
That's your girlfriend, she my bestie
If you sayin', let's be honest, girl, then let's be
I'm tryna see you and little mama on a jet ski

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, the real thing
I don't wanna do it if it's not the real thing
She don't wanna do it if you ain't got the bill paid
All my boss bitches know I got the bill
Hey, hey
Bad bitches and they want the real thing
I don't wanna do it if it's not the real thing
She don't wanna do it if you ain't got the bill paid
All my boss bitches know I got the bill, hey

[Verse 2: Future]
Fuck her twin sister, now she hate me (Hate hate)
Brrt, brrtt
Please, order up the jet key (Key)
I just changed my number, you can't call or sext me
Have your location on when you address me
Knock it out the park, Ken Griffey
Ooh, ooh, ooh
All these missed calls was never missed, ohh ohh
And a lot of bad bitches with no IG
She don't post, so I know she won't expose me
I'm gone stamp every country on your ID
They can't smoke me, you know they tryna find me
When I give that paper to you and it's crispy
And these Benji Franklin's stacked up in your birkey
Fell in love with a nigga drinking codeine
How you gone fall for a nigga drinking creatine
Fell in love with a nigga drinking codeine
How you gone fall for a nigga drinking creatine

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, the real thing
I don't wanna do it if it's not the real thing
She don't wanna do it if you ain't got the bill paid
All my boss bitches know I got the bill
Hey, hey
Bad bitches and they want the real thing
I don't wanna do it if it's not the real thing
She don't wanna do it if you ain't got the bill paid
All my boss bitches know I got the bill, hey

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
I got a thick, thick, thick, white bitch
My shit lit than a bitch and I'm rich
Keep a .40 with extendo on the grip
And know I gotta have it on me because my niggas out here lit
I ain't even know she was your bitch, dawg
She been throwing that shit at me, Micheal Vick, dawg
Steady quarterbacking at the kick off
No pun intended, I just her with the pick
Step up in the mix, shit is lit
I might even stop and pose for a pic
Looking at my ex bitch and she sick, yeah
She don't like that I just pulled up with you
Fuck it, tell a bitch to bust it
I ain't come to t-t-talk, I came to t-t-touch it
She came to s-s-suck me off, then, baby, s-s-suck it
She tryna s-s-send a Snap, but, baby, time to bust it

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, the real thing
I don't wanna do it if it's not the real thing
She don't wanna do it if you ain't got the bill paid
All my boss bitches know I got the bill
Hey, hey
Bad bitches and they want the real thing
I don't wanna do it if it's not the real thing
She don't wanna do it if you ain't got the bill paid
All my boss bitches know I got the bill, hey

[Intro]
Alone tonight
Begin tonight
Till it's all right
Damn lover friend of mine

[Verse 1]
She got your number, she know your game
She put you under, it's so insane
Since you seduced her, how does it feel
To know that woman is out to kill?

[Chorus 1]
Susie got your number, and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number, and Susie says it's right

[Post-Chorus]
Susie says it's, Su-Su says it's
(Take my-Take my money)
Susie got your, Su-Susie got your
(Throw my time away)
Blood is on, is on, blood is
(You've been talking garbage)
The dance floor, the dance the night
(You're damn, damn good for me)

[Verse 2]
I never knew, but I was walking the line
"Come go with me," I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
My baby cried, she left me standing alone

[Chorus 2]
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
This is Heartbreak Hotel, it's so evil
Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

[Chorus 3]
Ten years ago today
Dangerous, and Susie ain’t your friend
Dangerous, with seven inches in
Dangerous, blood is on the knife
Dangerous, and Susie says it's right

[Verse 3]
A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see the truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart

[Chorus 4]
So just leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Stop it, just stop dogging me around

[Chorus 5]
It was blood on the dance floor, to enjoy that simple dance
It was blood on the dance floor, everything was on my side
It was blood on the dance floor, like it was love and true romance
It was blood on the
And I just can't take it, the girl won't break it

[Outro]
You've been, you've been, you don't, you don't, don't
You don't, you don't, don't mess with my baby
She don't, she don't, she don't know it
She just, she just, mess with my baby

[A$AP Rocky Snippet]
Motherfucker's dead
Everything is a go, even a cop or a fed
Married to your head, cartel from japan
Niggas don't understand I'm the motherfuckin' man
Watchu say?
Whatchu say? Whatchu say?
I'm a motherfuckin' savage
Drug Cartel and they came with a tactic
Money and the mattress
Money and the attics
Niggas are addicted
Heard they got that...

[Verse 1]
No limit in the sky
That I won't fly for ya
No amount of tears in my eyes
That I won't cry for ya, oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There's no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep

[Chorus]
When it comes to you, there's no crime
Let's take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you, don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you, comes to you

[Post-Chorus]
When it comes to you
When it comes to you

[Verse 2]
Cupid ain't a lie
Arrow got your name on it, oh yeah
Don't miss out on a love
And regret yourself on it, oh
Open up your mind, clear your head
Ain't gotta wake up to an empty bed
Share my life, it's yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, oh

[Chorus]
When it comes to you, there's no crime
Let's take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you, don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you, comes to you
(5,6,7,8)

[Post-Chorus]
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
When it comes to you

[Chorus]
When it comes to you, there's no crime
Let's take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you, don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you, comes to you

[Intro]
Yeah, mmm, turn the beat up a lil' bit
Yeah, it should never be one nigga that's the head of the crew
'Cause if that one nigga go to jail, fall, die or somethin', everybody falls
We live by this shit
If you got money, you fall, it gon' catch you
When the whole team rich

[Chorus]
Want the whole team rich, want the whole team rich
Want to see the whole team lit, see the whole team rich
See the whole team rich, want to see the whole team lit
My niggas so hungry, we go get that money and we ball forever
If you got some paper and I got some paper if you fall
I'ma catch ya (I got you my nigga)
Want the whole team rich, want the whole team rich
Want to see the whole team lit, see the whole team rich
See the whole team rich, want to see the whole team lit
My niggas so hungry, we go get that money and we ball forever
If you got some paper and I got some paper
You fall, I'ma catch ya (I got you my nigga)
Want the whole team rich

[Verse 1]
Really want the whole team rich
Want to see the whole team lit but it don't mean shit
Look at what Po did to Mitch, hit him up for thirteen bricks
Niggas ain't loyal, these bitches ain't loyal so we never trust 'em
I lay with that chopper, I sleep with one eye open these niggas'll touch ya
I go to sleep with that MAC on the dresser
Shit, I feel like Tony Montana
Pray we don't go to the slammer
They just got here for a hammer
I'm 'bout to go to Atlanta 'fore I go banana
Payin' these lawyer fees, coppers follow me, watch me, recordin' me
Pussy niggas, they said, they extortin' me
Put a price on my head, try to order me
I'm like, look what this money shit doin' to me
It can make us or break us
I never fake with the fakers
I'm gettin' money, shit, I got your bitch in Jamaica
Dutty whinin', rolling papers
Never minding for your favors
Fuck, it's time we do it major
We been grinding for a minute
Bust a hundred with my niggas
That's the only way I'm living

[Chorus]
Want the whole team rich, want the whole team rich
Want to see the whole team lit, see the whole team rich
See the whole team rich, want to see the whole team lit
My niggas so hungry, we go get that money and we ball forever
If you got some paper and I got some paper
You fall, I'ma catch ya (I got you my nigga)
Want the whole team rich, want the whole team rich
Want to see the whole team lit, see the whole team rich
See the whole team rich, want to see the whole team lit
My niggas so hungry, we go get that money and we ball forever
If you got some paper and I got some paper
You fall, I'ma catch ya (I got you my nigga)
Want the whole team rich

[Verse 2]
You know I ride for my dawgs
It's do or die for my dawgs
No switching sides on my dawgs
I done sold nickels and I done flipped dimes with my dawgs
Nigga, it's deep
We do not fall out for bitches 'cause we done fucked all of them bitches
I'm alley-ooping these hoes, I get all my assists
You know I'm ball with my niggas (Woo)
Time to get back on that trill shit
Came in the game with some real shit
You came in the game with some bullshit
I turn it on when I wanna hit my kill switch
I make a mill' quick, then I double up
I came from the bottom like a upper-cut
When the feds came, got the bubble-guts
Shit, I pray to god, it ain't one of us
And I pray to god, I don't fuck this up
Bout to make a nigga get a hundred bricks
Passing, blowing shit, probably blow this shit
Shit, they said I can't do a show and shit
They ain't notice it but I'm goin' through it
I never show that shit, I'm immune to it
I should kill these niggas, let my goons do it
I can smell the money, it coming soon to us

[Chorus]
Want the whole team rich, want the whole team rich
Want to see the whole team lit, see the whole team rich
See the whole team rich, want to see the whole team lit
My niggas so hungry, we go get that money and we ball forever
If you got some paper and I got some paper
You fall, I'ma catch ya (I got you my nigga)
Want the whole team rich, want the whole team rich
Want to see the whole team lit, see the whole team rich
See the whole team rich, want to see the whole team lit
My niggas so hungry, we go get that money and we ball forever
If you got some paper and I got some paper
You fall, I'ma catch ya (I got you my nigga)
Want the whole team rich

[Verse 1]
I be sitting in the same old bar
Heart breaking on a broken bar stool
Wishing she'd come running back
Running from the past
Runnin' up the tab, drinkin' for two
But that night my boys showed up
Dragged me out on the town
Had to pick me up
I'd never know what I was missin' if they didn't

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
Never found you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I still go out sometimes
But I don't ever try to get that drunk
Now when I can't sleep it's 'cause you're all over me in the sheets
All night keeping me up
Yeah, it's hard to believe that a goodbye could be
So good to me

[Chorus]
No, I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you

[Bridge]
And now I'm takin' back the way I said I wish I'd never met her
Sometimes the things that don't work out
Couldn't work out any better
I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
Never found, never found you
No, I'd have never found you

[Verse 1]
Here come old flat-top, he come grooving up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs, he's one holy roller
He got hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please

[Verse 2]
He wear no shoeshine, he's got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola
He say, "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

[Chorus]
Come together, right now
Over me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
He roller-coaster, he got early warning
He got muddy water, he one mojo filter
He say, "One and one and one is three"
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see

[Chorus]
Come together, right now
Over me
Come together, right now
Come together, right now
Come together, right now
Over me

[Verse 1: Kane Brown & Chris Young]
10 P.M., most folks are sleeping
But it's the weekend
So we ain't, and we know where the cows don't go
These 40 inch tires seen enough pavement
So we're taking them on red dirt place somewhere offroad
You won't find us at no bar
I'll tell you right where we are

[Chorus: Both]
No where, no rules
Crack a Bud Light, get into the groove
Dancing in the middle of the night in the middle of a field
Just turning it loose
Hell yeah, that's us
Don't need a downtown to get to tearing it up
Round here, just watching the stars get bright
Setting the night on fire, on fire, on fire
Setting the night on fire, on fire, on fire

[Verse 2: Kane Brown & Chris Young]
Girls showing up late as always
Now it's a party
Cut off sun dresses, they're ready to go
Don't need no dance road tonight
Just country music and good times

[Chorus: Both]
No where, no rules
Crack a Bud Light, get into the groove
Dancing in the middle of the night in the middle of a field
Just turning it loose
Hell yeah, that's us
Don't need a downtown to get to tearing it up
Out here just watching the stars get bright
Setting the night on fire, on fire, on fire
Setting the night on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire)

[Bridge: Kane Brown & Chris Young]
You won't find us at no bar
I'll tell you right where we are

[Chorus: Both]
No where, no rules
Crack a Bud Light, get into the groove
Dancing in the middle of the night in the middle of a field
Just turning it loose
Hell yeah, that's us
Don't need a downtown to get to tearing it up
Out here, just watching the stars get bright
Setting the night on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire)
Setting the night on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire)
Yeah
Setting the night on fire

[Outro: Chris Young]
On fire

[Verse 1]
Wasn't really looking when you caught my eyes
Just another town, just another night
Didn't say much, I was scared for my life
I didn't catch your number and didn't know your name
Tried to move on, couldn't help to think of you
And I knew that you'd change everything

[Chorus]
What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours

[Verse 2]
Now there's make up my counter
Your shoes on my floor
Taking my side of the bed and more
But it’s fine, I don’t mind, 'cause you changed everything

[Chorus]
What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Take this ring
Forever now
Til death do us apart
And take this vow

[Chorus]
What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic, don't it?
I'm right where I wanna be

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this

[Verse 2]
I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never
Had to even leave this room

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
Could be better than this

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this (heaven)
Could be better than this (heaven, heaven)

[Outro]
I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Pusha T]
Timbo the king, right?
Haha
Ooh, eghck

[Verse: Pusha T]
King Push, Timbo
V.A, that's kin folk
Cocaine on tempo
You hold hands with that nympho
My big pimpin', too cold
Lobster and shrimp, I'm the new Hov
No Carter here, but my Cartier
Is just lit up like a party here
I'm post Porter, A.Z
Midget moli and a AC
Triple park like Freddy Meyers
We gettin' money like it's '83
Modern day hide away
South to France on holiday
She in Hermes with her ass up
And I'm smackin' it like Oda Mae
I turned her, I showed her
I made her cause I mold her
I owed her not a iota
I dressed her up cause she on my shoulder
(Woo!) Baller like
You've been a petty nigga all your life
Take shoes back quick when she pause a fight
Shoot a bitch in her foot like it's Harlem Nights, ha

[Chorus: Timbaland]
This track is stoopid
All the ones...

[Intro]
Oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You want me, but he needs you
Yet you're telling me, that everything is good
Trying to convince me, baby, to do as you say
Just go along, girl, and see things your way

[Chorus]
And keep it on the down low (Down low, babe)
(Nobody) Nobody has to know
(Oh, ooh, oh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Secret lovers is what you wanna be (Wanna be, wanna be)
While making love to him, girl, you're silently calling on me
What is a man to do in a situation like this? (Again)
I feel there is something, that I
I don't wanna miss

[Chorus]
And keep it on the down low (Down low)
(Girl, nobody) Nobody has to know (Oh, girl, I go)
(Oh, ooh, oh, yeah)
Keep it on the down low (Down low)
(Girl, nobody) Nobody has to know (Ooh)
(Nobody, nobody, nobody)

[Verse 3]
Beautiful you are, but you're his by far
Coming by my way, driving his fancy car
Making plans to be in my life forever
Tell me, tell me, that we'll always be together

[Chorus]
And keep it on the down low (Oh, ooh, oh, yeah)
(Nobody) Nobody has to know (Oh, yeah)
(I go, oh, ooh, oh, yeah)
(Oh, ooh, oh, yeah)
Keep it on the down low (Down low)
(Girl, nobody) Nobody has to know (Ooh)
(Nobody, nobody, nobody)

[Outro]
Keep it on the down low
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Down low, down low, down low, babe
Keep it on the down low
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
(Come on in here)

[Verse 1]
At first I didn't like him
He came asking for a loan
I got nervous when he came into view
On an overdose of vitamins
Trying to explain
Something that I already knew
He said help me stay afloat and get back to
Hawaii
Hawaii

[Verse 2]
All the paintings and the sketches
Lay scattered on the sand
And the condominium was close at hand
Things were getting hard to follow
I was feeling pretty hollow
When the stranger came to me and put out his hand
He said I think we better talk there's something you don't understand
About Hawaii
Hawaii

[Verse 3]
With my baby and my bicycle
I up and rode away
And many nights have passed since that morning came my way
And I think about him often with his vitamins and kids
Does he sleep with half a women on his mind?
Well the other half just got left behind
In Hawaii
Hawaii

My God, I’ll make your head nod when I come through
If it’s me you’re gonna do, you better work out, boo
So reminisce the caramel king, you know the Mecca don swing
Give you everything else but the ring
So déjà vu, tell you what I’m gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Interlude: C.L. Smooth]

[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Hey…check it
What we have here…is another one
The remix
Orchestrated (You don’t have to worry)
By the Puff Daddy and Tone Capone
Yeah, rock on

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, you don't have to worry, ooh
I won't waste your time (I won't waste your time)
I'm satisfied (Mmm-mmm, no)
You don't have to worry (No no, no)
I won't waste your time
I'm satisfied

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Listen, love is made, made of many things
One of them is trust, mmm, but I can't trust you anymore
Things you say (Things you say), followed by the things you do
They won't hurt me, no (They won't hurt me)
They won't hurt me anymore

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You don't have to worry (Oh-ho)
I won't waste your time (I won't waste your time)
I'm satisfied (You know, you know, you know)
You don't have to worry (No no, oh, no)
I won't waste your time
I'm satisfied

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Love can make, make a stronger man
But you don't love me (You don't love me)
And I don't feel you're growing strong
The heart you break with your simple lies
You better watch out, baby, the next heart may be your own

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I gave you my love, my love, my life, my time
Mine was your own, though you stripped me to the bone
When I asked just you how you feel, if our love was the deal
You said “We got it goin' on,” now I feel that love is gone

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You don't have to worry (You know I, you know I won't)
I won't waste your time
I'm satisfied (I'm satisfied, yeah)
You don't have to worry (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I won't waste your time
I'm satisfied

[Rap: Craig Mack]
Don’t try to play me for that same, same, same
Last nigga did it caught a beat until this month
You’re goddamn right I want the fame
Plus a little horseplay if I get a off day
I wouldn’t wanna waste your time, Mrs. Mary Jane
So I like to kick a little bump in your ear
My acoustic real sick type of hype a derelict makes shit real thick
The funk data that flows fatter
MC’s with that chitter chatter microphone even matter
Craig Mack’s like a funk robotic super sick psychotic MC who got it
The new season in cyber season crushing MC’s for no apparent reason
Mack man put fat funk out the frame…(That's funk, G)

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I'm alright, I'm alright

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I gave you my love, my heart, and soul
You took my love, now you want to take control
But when a good thing comes your way
Why can't you stay?
I can't go on another day

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You don't have to worry (I won't waste your time)
I won't waste your time
I'm satisfied (I'm satisfied, yeah)
You don't have to worry (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I won't waste your time
I'm satisfied (Oh)
You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time
I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time
I'm satisfied

[Bump over second Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You know I'm gonna be alright, you know I'm gonna be alright
You know I'm gonna be alright; Why? Why? Why?
You know I'm gonna be alright, you know that I'm satisfied
You know I'm gonna be alright, ah

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
You don't have to worry, I’m alright
You don't have to worry, I’m alright
You don't have to worry, I’m alright
You don't have to worry, I’m alright

[Andre Harrell]
The reports were that you were in New York City and you basically blew up
How do you feel performing at Madison Square Garden in your hometown New York City?

[Mary J. Blige]
I felt good
I felt good that people at home—it just let me know that people at home love me more than I thought they did
And they made me feel good…

[Verse 1]
I will love you anyway even if you cannot stay
I think you are the one for me
Here is where you ought to be
I just want to satisfy ya
‘Cause you’re not mine and I can’t deny it
Don’t you hear me talkin’, baby?
Love me now or I’ll go crazy

[Chorus]
Whoa, sweet thing
Don’t you know you’re my everything
Whoa, sweet thing
Don’t you know you’re my everything
Yes, you are

[Verse 2]
I wish you were my lover but you act so undercover
Love you child my whole life long, be it right or be it wrong
More than what you make me, baby
Don’t walk away, don’t be so shady
Don't want your mind, don’t want your money
These words I say they may sound funny but…

[Chorus]
Whoa, sweet thing, yeah
Don’t you know you’re my everything
Whoa, sweet thing
Don’t you know you’re my everything
Yes, you are
Yes, you are, baby

[Verse 3]
You are my heat, you are my fire
You make me weak with strong desire
Love you child my whole life long
Be it right or be it wrong
I just want to satisfy ya
‘Cause you’re not mine, I can’t deny it
Don’t you hear me talkin’, baby?
Love me now or I’ll go crazy

[Outro]
You’re my heat, you are my fire (You're my fire)
You’re not mine, I can’t deny it (I can't deny it)
Don’t you hear me talkin’, baby?
Love me now or I’ll go crazy (I'll go crazy)
You’re my heat, you are my fire (You're my fire)
You’re not mine, I can’t deny it (Can't deny)
Don’t you hear me talkin’, baby?
Love me now or I’ll go crazy
You’re my heat, you are my fire (You're my fire)
You’re not mine, I can’t deny it
('Cause you're my sweet thing, sweet thing)
Don’t you hear me talkin’, baby?
Love me now or I’ll go crazy
You’re my heat, you are my fire
You’re not mine, I can’t deny it
Don’t you hear me talkin’, baby?
Love me now or I’ll go crazy

[Intro]

[Teddy Riley]
I don't know what to do without you
I don't know what to do, do, do
I don't know what to do without you
You got me going in circles, circles, circles
Now that my love is gone away from you...

[Mary J. Blige]
Oh...baby
(Whatcha gonna do) Baby
My, my, my love...hey

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
I was a fool to let you in
Knowing you would play with my heart
That was so long ago that I thought we could make a new start
You left me brokenhearted from the day your love departed
Now that love is by, I’m with someone new, it’s gone
And so you wanna come back

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do without my love
(Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do, baby?)
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love has gone away from you?

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Sweet memories of yesterday when it all seemed so right
I was loving you, kissing you, holding you tight
I wish you’d known that woman that you learned to leave today
And it’s a shame that you wanna come back now, baby
My love is gone away

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do without my love
(My love is gone, yeah)
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love has gone away from you?

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
I’ve played the fool for ya, baby
And you stole away my heart
(Whatcha gonna do)
Now that my love has gone away
(Whatcha gonna do)
Sweet memories of yesterday
(Whatcha gonna do)
Now that my love has gone away

[Verse 4: Heavy D]
Now call me crazy but I woulda thought that you were diggin’ me
You didn’t think that you’d considered that Heavy D that kinda way
Thought I was reaching for an unreachable star
But then you told me you’re a star no matter who you are
So here’s the plan, I’ll be your man, you’ll be my honey lamb
Two birds of a feather flock together, we look good together, that’s what they say
Anyway, here’s what I say, I’ll make you scream and shout
That’s what it is all about, so tell me what you’ll do without…
My love

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
My love, my love
Whatcha gonna do without my love
(Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do)
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love has gone away from you?

Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love has gone away from you?

Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
(I’ve played the fool for you, baby)
Whatcha gonna do without my love
(Now that my love has gone away, whatcha gonna do?)
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love has gone away from you?
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
(Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do)
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love has gone away from you?

[Interlude: Mary J. Blige + Teddy Riley]
Now that my love has gone away from you
Now that my love has gone away from you
What can I do without you?
Now that my love has gone away from you
What can I do without you?
What can I do without you?
Now that my love has gone away from you
What can I do without you?
What can I do without your love?

Of a love that I once knew
Yes, it’s true, oh

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
You, you remind me of a love that I once knew
Is it a dream or is it déjà vu?
I just had to let you know so I had to sing it
‘Cause with you, boy, I don't know

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
And the way you walk and
And the way you talk and
The way you move and

Sweet baby, darlin', come on just stop playing with my mind
‘Cause with you, boy, I don't know

Yes, it’s true, oh
(You really do remind me, yeah)

[Verse 3: Greg Nice]
N-n-n-now, M-M-Mary’s infatuated, in love with you
Skiddly wah wah, Pepe Le Pew
Picnics in the park, strollin', holdin' hands
Pickin' cotton candy from the candy man
I got a flashback, uh, counterattack
Hugs and kisses, love but don’t lack
Déjà vu of me hugging you, holding you, and squeezing you
Memories reminding me of you

“That’s the way the story goes
That’s just the way the story goes”

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You know that you remind me
Of a love that I once knew
Yes, it’s true, oh
You know that you remind me
Of a love that I once knew
Yes, you do, oh
You know that you remind me
Of a love that I once knew
Yes, it’s true, oh
You know that you remind me
Of a love that I once knew
Yes, you do, oh
You know that you remind me
(And you do, you do, you do remind me)
Of a love that I once knew (Of a lover)
Yes, it’s true, oh (Yes you do, you)
You know that you remind me (Yeah, you do)
Of a love that I once knew
Yes, you do, oh

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
You know, that you remind me…

[Chorus 1]
Can’t you see what I’ve been doing through ‘cause I wanna be with you
Changes I’ve been going through ‘cause I wanna be with you
Can’t you see what I’ve been doing through ‘cause I wanna be with you
Changes I’ve been going through ‘cause I wanna be with you
Can’t you see what…

[Verse 1]
It’s all gone, the moment that we shared is gone away
Maybe it’s better that we didn’t stay together
Seems like we’ve gone through this a thousand times
Baby, I still don’t have the answer
Why can’t you tell me why we couldn’t be together?

[Chorus 2]
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Be with me)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Be with me)
Can’t you see what…

[Verse 2]
See, I didn’t want to ever want to cry
But still I need love and affection
Was it that hard for you to show me some attention?
Tell me, baby, did I push you away?
Was I coming on strong for you?
Why can’t you tell me, tell me what am I to do?

[Chorus 2]
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Be with me)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Be with me)
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Be with me—don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Don’t you wanna be with me)
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
(Don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
(Don’t you wanna be with me?)
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
(Don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
‘Cause I want…
(Don’t you wanna be with me?)
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Don’t you wanna be with me)

[Intro: Kid Capri]
Flavor beyond control
Once again, it’s the midnight rocker, the Kid Capri
Doing this one on the crazy down low with Mary J. Blige
The Hip Hop Queen in this, you nam’sayin’
So y’all just lay back, chill, get booted, and all that
And let us do this
And we out…

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
(Oh-ho) If lovin’ you is all that I have to do (No no, no no)
I don’t wanna do anything else (Oh yeah, ah baby, baby)
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do
I don’t wanna do anything else
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do (No no, no no)
I don’t wanna do anything else
(I don't wanna do anything else, baby, baby)
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do (No no, no no)
I don’t wanna do anything else (Listen, baby)

[Verse 1: K-Ci]
Every night and day I dream of another way
To tell you something good
I don’t think that I’m understood
You walk away and I frown
With my head hung far down
You tell me what is wrong
You just wanna be loved all night long, baby

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do
(I don't wanna do)
I don’t wanna do anything else
(Yeah, won't you tell me, baby)
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do (Oh-ho)
I don’t wanna do anything else
(I don't wanna do, ooh, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary)

[Verse 2: Mary J Blige]
You told me a thousand times
That you would be mine all mine
I do everything for you
But in your smile I still can’t find
Now you tell me this
This is something that I can’t miss
And all you want to do
Is to love me for me and I'll love you for you

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo + Mary J. Blige]
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do
I don’t wanna do anything else
(I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do anything else)
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do
(I don't wanna do anything else)
I don’t wanna do anything else

[Bridge: K-Ci & Mary J. Blige]

[K-Ci]
Listen baby, now that I know I’m gonna make love to you
So let it open up your heart
And let me in where I belong

[MJB]
If lovin’ you was all that I have to do
Then it won’t be wrong, baby

[K-Ci & MJB]
‘Cause we belong together, baby, yeah yeah yeah

Together, we will be as one
Just me and you, you, you, you, you

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do
I don’t wanna do anything else

[Bump (over chorus): K-Ci & Mary J. Blige]
Will you love me? (I will love you)
Will you please me? (I will please you)
Girl, don’t leave me (I won’t leave you)
Let's make it easy (I’ll make it easy)
Will you love me? (I will love you)
Will you please me? (I will please you)
Girl, don’t leave me (I won’t leave you)
Let's make it easy (Oh)
They could take my possessions, oh oh oh
They could never take your love away from me
Oh, oh, oh, oh no, Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary
See, now listen, with every breath I breathe
And every beat of my heart
I know that no one, I know that no one can tear us apart
Oh no
‘Cause I love you, baby
I love you, too
And I need you
I need you, too
Yeah, ah yeah, if lovin' you...
Stay with me more than just a day
And you know, you know, you know
Oh no, no
I love you
You make me feel so good, baby

[Outro: K-Ci & JoJo]
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do

[Snippet]

Picture me giving niggas a portion when I can hit the dealer and buy all my killers Porsches
They gon' slide on you if I tell them ride on you
Then them secure niggas ready to die for you
All my niggas pull up with .30s and fire on you
Suddenly when it hit you, somebody done lied  to you
This the summer I'ma have to beat my hittas
Check, check, check
Fucking famous bitches, countin' paper
Check, check, check
I got shit about you, I won't say it
Pay to watch your mouth, you keep on quiet
I'm gon flame on you bitches, play no games with you bitches, no way
My condolence for you losses, I just pray you ok
Used to hail lord for you, now I'm swinging that cake
So if you ride with my opps, then get the fuck out the way, hoe

[Verse 1]
You go where the wind blows
Destroying everyone in your path
I'm done feeding your ego
Forgetting everything that we had

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how history ends in an instant
How something so close can end up so distant

[Chorus]
Dancing on the line of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

[Breakdown]

[Verse 2]
Good luck when you wake up
And realize all that you've lost
Shining lies are what you're made of
I hope it's worth the price that it cost

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how history ends in an instant
How something so close can end up so distant

[Chorus]
Dancing on the line of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

[Breakdown]

[Outro]
Great divide

[Verse 1]
When we first met I was just a Sophomore
We spent the night on Lydia’s couch
I didn't know you were gonna break my heart then
I didn't know the pain I’d feel right now

[Pre-Chorus]
And I smiled, yes I smiled
But underneath are memories
That I’m trying, yeah I’m trying to let go
And so you left, yeah you left
On someone else's arm now
And I’m trying, yeah I’m trying to let go

[Chorus]
But it’s not that simple
Type of misery
All these mixed up signals
In my head
I still hear these echoes
Of when you loved me
But now you’re just someone in my mind
That used to be mine
That used to be mine

[Verse 2]
People used to say I didn't deserve you
I was cool with that, 'cause I felt the same
But then they played my song on the radio
And I don’t think you liked who I became

[Pre-Chorus]
And I smiled, yes I smiled
But underneath are memories
That I’m trying, yeah I’m trying to let go
And so you left, yeah you left
On someone else's arm now
And I’m trying, yeah I’m trying to let go

[Chorus]
But it's not that simple
Type of misery
All these mixed up signals
In my head
I still hear these echoes
Of when you loved me
But now you’re just someone in my mind
That used to be mine
That used to be mine

[Bridge]
Cause baby your beauty marks
Are like shooting stars
In my goofy heart is one of Cupid's darts
I’m just a nervous guy
And these words of mine
Won't reverse the time
To when you were mine

[Chorus]
Cause it’s not that simple
Type of misery
All these mixed up signals
In my head
I still hear these echoes
Of when you loved me
But now you’re just someone in my mind
That used to be mine
That used to be mine
That used to be mine

[Verse 1]
Virginia Woolf and poetry
No one seemed to notice me
Being young was getting so old
Cheap beer and cigarettes
Life is like a movie set
And I seemed to be given no role

[Pre-Chorus]
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 18
I cried to my mother
And she told me, "young man"

[Chorus]
"There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
Life is not always a comfortable ride
Everybody's got scars that they hide
And everybody plays the fool sometimes, yeah
Just be as you are"
(Be as you are)
(Be as you are)

[Verse 2]
They played me on the radio
And everything was changing, so
I thought I was all the way grown
But I can still remember in that cold November
When I realized I'm all alone

[Pre-Chorus]
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 22
I cried to my mother
And she told me, "young man"

[Chorus 2]
"There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
It doesn't matter if you become some star
Life is better when you open your heart
You don't always have to act so hard, no
Just be as you are"
(Be as you are)
(Be as you are)

[Chorus 2]
"There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
It doesn't matter if you become some star
Life is better when you open your heart
You don't always have to act so hard, no
Just be as you are"

[Outro]
(Be as you are)
(Be as you are)
(Be as you are)

[Verse 1]
I was 16 with a rocket
And some sunshine in my pocket
It was how you used words I didn't know
And the way you said my name
And cut up peaches and them brown eyes
Little flame that we pretend doesn't glow

[Pre-Chorus]
You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine
What I've come to understand
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me
I'm right back where I began

[Chorus]
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

[Verse 2]
There were times I think about us
Overcome by the nostalgias
I am on call when you need me, let me know
But we're drifting in a strange way
I'm aware that it's a mistake if I love you
It's a mistake if I don't

[Pre-Chorus]
You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine
What I've come to understand
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me
I'm right back where I began

[Chorus]
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

[Bridge]
And she smelled like Michigan
And it felt like lust
And the nostalgia's killing me
And it's all because

[Chorus]
I'm in the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, stranger, stranger

I'm in the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
You only love me
In bits and pieces
I keep on workin'
You keep your secrets
That's not an insult
That's not a lie
That's just a statement
Proven by time

'Cause even when I have you
I don't really have you
I am not your last dude
Where'd you get this attitude?
Talkin' 'bout you're leavin'
Cause you don't believe in
Me and all my reasons
Left me with these demons, demons

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
And you're just killing me with silence
And you're just killing me with time
I don't know where to put my sorry's
You're running laps around my mind
How could you leave me on this tightrope?
And I feel nothing when it storms
You know you're killing me with silence
You hold your halo up with horns
You hold you halo up with
Hor-hor-horns, hor-hor-horns
Hor-hor-horns, hor-hor-horns
Hor-hor-horns, hor-hor-horns

[Verse 2: Labrinth]
You know you're clever, I'll give you that
You gave me heaven and took it back
That's not an insult
That's just the case
You've had your pretty mask on
For so damn long
That everybody thinks it's your face
But underneath your eyelids
I can hear the silence
Spreading like a virus
Why'd you wear disguises?
Why'd you have to cut me?
Then act like it's nothing
This time I'm not bluffin'
How'd you know I'm bluffin'
Every single time

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
And you're just killing me with silence
And you're just killing me with time
I don't know where to put my sorry's
You're running laps around my mind
How could you leave me on this tightrope?
And I feel nothing when it storms
You know you're killing me with silence
You hold your halo up with horns
You hold you halo up with
Hor-hor-horns, hor-hor-horns
Hor-hor-horns, hor-hor-horns
Hor-hor-horns, hor-hor-horns

Sitting on a runway, time on my hands, thinking of you again
As I replay our conversations, pray that everything fell in place
Like a mirror lookin' back at me, sayin' you're the only one
Makin' me feel I could survive, so glad to be alive
Nowhere to run, I got a song to sing
Messed up inside and it's been raining all day

[Chorus]
Since you went away, Southside serenade

[Murphy Lee]
Whooooooooooo
Damn, that girl fine, that girl fine, that girl fine
Yo, yo, Kanye, yo turn it up, a little bit, whoo

[Hook]
Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..

[Kanye West {*over the hook*}]
Yo, this is a Roc-a-Fella, St. Lunatics collaboration
Chi-Town and St. Louis
She said she ain't never seen Murphy Lee befo'

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
I called her back from an earlier beep Fo' in the mornin' they be like "Nah, I wasn't sleep"
Convenient whore stay on top of convenient stores
Keep pictures of me in their Victoria Secret drawer
I keep somethin' hot on tour
Can ya, Kenyatta, make sure they know before what is really in store
See I adore the ones that call me Torhi, true story
I created 'hood rats so these new mice bore me
See I normally settle for sevens, but eights I can't wait Nines be wantin' time and dimes be wantin' dates So know I got elevens and twelves With at least
Thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hell
I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell
Hehehehehehehehe hell, I remember when she smashed LaBelle
See most women kinda sneaky like a six-year old
Hey yo they always in the summer, somethin' wrong with their nails

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
What's the point of havin' a girl that's drop dead That you know don't like you? She'll run over your head with a motorcycle I mean the way you look is
Nice, but there's more to life boo
Cuz I could go to videos and get fo' just like you
I talked to your ex-boyfriend and took a census
But you don't read the cookbook, you just look at the pictures Matter of fact, when's the last time you looked at the kitchen?
This is gettin' ridiculous, how you gettin' defensive?
Jimmy Choo, Frankie B., bitch you gettin' expensive
I know you fuckin' around, my sixth sense told me That ain't no male friend that bought you the stereo She said "He gay anyway, you don't know nothin'
About Jamario"

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
And people say, “Oh, Ronald Reagan’s that president”
But type “Black Panther” and “Ronald Reagan”
And see what you get
Being that he was the governor of L.A
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil-Scott was hearing
Why all our heroes and heroines end up on heroin?
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that; it’s like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hanging from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it
The fiends cop it; nowadays, they can’t tell if…
That’s that good shit? We ain’t sure, man
Put the CD on your tongue; yeah, that’s pure, man

[Chorus]
That’s that crack music
That real Black music
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la

[Verse 2]
From the place where the fathers gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the maricóns lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say? “We just trying to party, homes”
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood, it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda; raised they whole quota
Right when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause… dreams of being Hova
Went from being a broke man to being a dopeman
To being the President; look, there's hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosing
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that
Crack music!

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I-I'm Lil Tay-K, I don't think you want no action (Gang, gang)
You want action, you get turned into past tense (In the past)
Your boys deep? Well, let's get to subtractin' (Pow, pow)
Smith & Wesson made my 9 with sub compaction (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Chorus]
Fu-fu-fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case (Gang, gang)
But I ain't beat that case, bitch, I did the race (Skrrt, skrrt)
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face (Lil bitch)
Eli blast crackin' 4s like a vase (Gang)
Pop a nigga then I go out my way (Skrrt)
Do the dash then I go out the way
Ro-ro-rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace (Gimme that shit, nigga)
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face

[Verse: Tyga]

Bleached into a light
Please stop, I'd rather that you didn't touch
My porcelain skin, 'cus it's paper thin

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Heart is crying out but I'm too cool to let you know
If I was not afraid I'd ask you can you light it up

[Chorus]
My mind so slow (can you light it up?)
I need your glow (can you light it up?)
Feeling stupid, lost and so confused
Help me out please tell me what to do
My mind so slow (can you light it up?)

My body's a mess, there's dirt on my dress
Well I thought that you already knew

Get your energy right

My own issues on the back of the stove burning like coal in a caboose
You know the boy's the truth, no sojourner
My old earth was on some greasy shit, need a kiss
Sayonara to the slow learners 'til we meet again
Like auf Wiedersehen
Like the work ain't the cleanest, but it's worth it when you need a win for sure
I'm finicky with words like my easel drip, we tend to hit a nerve like
I'm tending to the turf when it need defense, nigga
Love, on the border line
It's messing with my mind
I just won't give you up
I'm tired of falling
Get back up

See I know one of these nights
You'll find me there
When I'm in over my head with you
I don't care

It's a fine mess that we're getting in
We've been alone tonight
And there ain't no sign of him
It's a fine mess
And I don't know what to do
Cause I may wind up losing, baby
More than you
More than you

Wait by the telephone
Wondering if he's not home
Leave in the nick of time
Girl would you ever be on mind
See I know one of these night
He'll find me there
When I'm in over my head with you
I don't care

It's a fine mess that we're getting in
We've been alone tonight
And there ain't no sign of him
It's a fine mess
And I don't know what to do
Cause I may wind up losing, baby
More than you
More than you

Both of us are crazy
Both of us are fools
There's so many ways a man can dream of being cruel
I don't want to be your love 

[?]
Dancing with this baby
And loving her on the run

It's a fine mess that we're getting in
We've been alone tonight
And there ain't no sign of him
It's a fine mess
And I don't know what to do
Cause I may wind up losing, baby
More than you
It's a fine mess
Hey, hey, hey
We've been alone tonight
And there ain't no sign of him no
It's a fine mess and I don't know what to do
Cause I may wind up losing, baby
More than you
Here we are
Ready to witness magic
We can feel it’s about to happen
But, something beyond our control
It got in the way
(I know we’ll have to try another day)

Cause nothing and no one is going to stand in our way
I believe its destiny (girl)
Life's episodes
Takes us down different roads
So let us take command
(Together, we’ll make it)

Cause you and I
We really must be in love
There’s no denying, girl
It’s real
To be continued
Another day
Set the stage for another play

Under different circumstances
So much better are our chances
Believe in a dream cause it will come try
And it’s evident with you
(Cause here we are together again)

Oh, I waited and waited
For this day to arrive
You’re right here by my side, girl
Good things are well worth the wait
So I learn to appreciate

Cause you and I
We really must be in love

You got a love for life
But I love you
But I love you
Ahh, oh
Ohhh, na, na, na, na
Disconnect the phone
I can`t wait to get you alone
Put the music on
And make the groove real slow
Tonight I'm here to stay
So put on your naughty negligee
Open up the wine
And just let it flow

The world can go and fall apart
And I won`t even hear it start
Oh, no

Cause I've got love on my mind tonight
There ain`t no way to conceal it
I've got love on my mind tonight, baby
One look at you and I feel it
I've got love on my mind tonight
On my mind tonight

These are crazy days
It's like you're running through an endless maze
Coming home to you
Just in the nick of time
Come and fill your cup
All day long
I've been building up
Let me melt your body
Wooo-oooh, into mine

Forget about the world outside
Inside each other we can hide
Cause I've got love on my mind tonight
There ain`t a way to conceal it
I've got love on my mind tonight, hey hey
One look at you and I feel it
I've got love on my mind tonight
On my mind tonight

Have your gun by you, 'cause niggas will try you
Watch how K. Dot move, something not like you
Have your gun by you, 'cause niggas will try you

[Verse]
Uh
Who's sick as me?
Tell the truth, bitch, nobody, and that's real
And as far as my eyes can see
I'm the only one fucking with me
Myself, so put your album right back on the shelf
And let real business get dealt
You ladies man like Leon Phelps
I pee on any man tryna discontinue my health
I don't give a damn on how you feel or how you felt
Your small mercy won't help
When shots circle around your waist like designer belts
I design your face, the tray hitch lift ya up
Rock niggas like Bobby Boucher, you waterboy
What you want, weed, dope, or water, boy?
It's right here, and y'all catch up, I move fast like light years
Now it's back to the basics
K. Dot's nothing to play with
A nigga tried to test my gangsta
I pulled out a weapon and aced it
My grade point average at the top of the brackets
I'm sick like a cancer patient
Assist many players like personal agent
Y'all as foul, clothes to fragrance
I'm the best now
Plus the kid married to rap, old cats need to renew ya vows
Sit down, practice your verbs and nouns
'Cause I'm on the verge to progressin' my words
I'm the best you heard today, hands down
So hand down whatever you had
Like you been in a bag
Put it in garbage or trash, I'm the best you had
Ever since, oh yeah, intelligence
K. Dot, so heaven sent

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That's just how it's goin' down lately
That's just how it's goin' down lately

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Yes I'll give you the low down, baby
Just take it nice and slow, now, baby
Tell me, can you feel the vibrations?
'Cause I can feel so many sensations right now

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
No, no, no, no regrets
I'll take control of it
I'll give you all of it, when I say that, I mean all of it
All of it, yes I will

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I love it when I feel your sexy body layin' next to me
Woah, oh, oh
When we look into each other's eyes I'm feelin' like it's destiny
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No one can feel the love that I feel right now
It's like a drug and I can't slow down
I wanna tell you, but I don't know how
So I turn the lights down 'cause it's feelin' right now

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
No, no, no, no regrets
I'll take control of it
I'll give you all of it, when I say that, I mean all of it
All of it, yes I will

That's just how it's goin' down lately
How it's goin', how it's goin' down
That's just how it's goin' down lately
That's just how, that's just how it's goin' down
That's just how it's goin' down lately
Goin', how it's goin' down
That's just how it's goin' down lately
That's just how it's goin' down
That's just how it's goin' down lately
How it's goin', how it's goin' down

[Verse 3]
I wanna do it in the right time
Yeah I only wanna see you in your right mind
I don't really wanna see you in the night time
Yeah I wanna be the one to make your light shine
I wanna do it in the right time
Yeah I only wanna see you in your right mind
I don't really wanna see you in the night time
Yeah I wanna be the one to make your light shine

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That's just how it's goin' down lately
That's just how it's goin' down lately
How it's goin' down, that's just how it's goin' down
That's just how it's goin' down lately
That's just how it's goin' down
That's just how it's goin' down lately
How it's goin', how it's goin' down
That's just how it's goin' down lately
That's just how, that's just how it's goin' down
That's just how it's goin' down lately
Goin', how it's goin' down
That's just how it's goin' down lately
That's just how it's goin' down
That's just how it's goin' down lately
How it's goin', how it's goin' down

[Verse: Okay Kaya, King Krule, & Both]
Don't you dare baby, dare baby, dare
Face me already, replace me already
Nothing's working with me
Nothing's working with me
Don’t you dare baby, dare baby, dare
Face me already, replace me already
Don’t be scared, don’t be scared, don’t be scared
Deface me already
I’m a waste, baby
And I’m alone
So you come over
I’m down under sea
I’m down under
Nothing's working with
Me, nothing’s working
With me
I’m this worthless you see
Nothings working with me
Nothings working with me
Nothings working with me

[Verse 1]
I seem to sink lower, gazing in the rays of the solar
In fact, we made a pact, but now I think it’s over
Red on white but he sipped on KA soda
Fuck, that's Coca-Cola, as TV sports the Olympic ebola
I think we might be bipolar, I think she thinks I’m bipolar
He left the crime scene without the Motorola
Still had dreams of being Gianfranco Zola
For at least for now, it’s all over
Yeah, at least for now, it’s all over

[Chorus]
I seem to sink lower
In biscuit town, in biscuit town

[Verse 2]
You're shallow waters, I’m the deep seabed
And I’m the reason you flow
I got more moons wrapped around my head and Jupiter knows
Whilst you orbit with some stupider hoes
Only a slacker would know tryna get up and group home
Tryna eat from the same bowl, in my troopers abode

[Chorus]
I seem to sink lower
In biscuit town, in biscuit town, ah-huh
I seem to sink lower
In biscuit town, in biscuit town (biscuit town)

[Verse 3]
And now I’m caught up by the taste in her mouth
As she whistles all about
She gonna miss her match deep down south
And no more wheelers dealers creeping about
At least none that she knows
Thrown away so much till I'm rolled up in the same old dutch
Need a touch of thought for my libido
And now she’s nearly hitting speed cones
As we proceed to her street dome, in her body not a weak bone
Strong mind, but she still got sight for a peep hole
Not that she knows, that’s what he knows

[Chorus]
In biscuit town, ah-huh
I seem to sink lower
In biscuit town, in biscuit town
In biscuit town, in biscuit town
In biscuit town, in biscuit town
You best get down

[Verse]
I’m not in the mood, but I gotta move
At least what I was hoping
The barriers stayed open
Now it’s just for the wait
And how unjust is this weight
My back was so broken
Tear me apart, pull me open
(Look inside) See the corrosion
The Tannoy spoke my name
This vessel was delayed
No objects in motion
A subject to smoking
The platform sighs, “My empty emotion”
As trackies walk on by
I’m alone, I’m alone
In deep isolation
In the dead of night, in the dead of night
Waiting for the train
In the dead of night I howl
We all have our evils
We’re told just to keep calm
Curled up and feeble
Plagued by our brains, the internal sinking pain
I wish I was equal, if only that simple
I wish I was people (I wish)
The train it now arrives, I plead just take me home
Step the gap of minds, he steps the gap of minds
We all have our evils
We’re told just to keep cool
The soul of the people
I wish I was equal, I wish I was equal, I wish I was equal
Twist the soul of the people

[Verse 1]
She smoked me whole and blows out Os
The sink had sunk, it overflows
The door is shut, my eyes are closed
I hear her moan or what I suppose
The thing about her, I must let go
Why I sing about her, she’ll never know
The bookie's shut, all bets are blown
The license bust, the shops are closed
I caught my mum, she stumbles home
Through open ground, back to broken homes
I thought about her, her smell through clothes
Her spoken smoke, mixed with my cologne
We were soup together, but now it’s cold
We were glue together, but it weren’t to hold
Her solvents dissolved
Her solvents dissolved
Her solvents dissolved

[Verse 2]
The ups and downs, deep velvet folds
The landslides in, depression poles
Once thought was shed, but always holds
Reflection taunts my empty soul
The sky will weep on my way home
The bus won’t let me on, I’ll have to stroll
And in my head, tormented prole
As lies were fed, he swallowed whole
The soup was grey, intense charcoal
He molded clay at intervals
The lights would change, the same logo
I passed your house, it looked so cold
In dreams together, white noise arose
She draws me in and swallows whole

[Refrain]
Lonely blue, lonely blue

[Verse 1]
He slated life, was never alone
Lost his touch, encased head to toe
I'd save him but he's dead
She still hugs the cold night air
Still will search
The burdening city awaits
But he’s gone

[Refrain]
Lonely blue, lonely blue

[Verse 2]
She thought about the flesh and his bones
Took a trip and called down the phone
I'd answer but I’m gone
My head's in all kinds of a mess
She takes it upon herself, concaves her chest
Now I'd be glad to see you
Now I'd be glad to see you

[Refrain]
Lonely blue, lonely blue

[Verse 3]
The blue cave, the deep dark unknown
Submerged forever soaked to the bone
She screams but she’s stone
Repeats my theory
Crawling through the dirt
From the deep dark, I wandered alone
So forlorn
Now I'd be glad to see you
Now I'd be glad to see you
In a ballad, we touch
'Cause our skulls will mush
So please don’t let go of our kingdom of trash (Ah!)
I got high off butane, I was born amidst a wrath
That boy, he's just a puke stain
That girl, she made me mutate, yeah

[Outro]
Oh, so lonely
Oh, so lonely
Oh, so lonely
So lonely blue
The sky was blue
And high above the moon was new
This eager heart of mine was singin', "Lover, come back to me
Lover, lover come back to me"

[Intro]
Has it been this long?
Has it been this long since I saw you there?
Well, has it been this long?

[Verse]
Has it been this long since I’ve had this bond?
Lost to where I belong
I don’t ever wanna leave this night
And has it been this long?
Waltzing deep space lullaby
Well, has it been this long?
Lost paradise for one
I can see your face
Lost to where I belong
I walked across you everyday
As I floated along
Spent most of my time orbiting your waist
And had it really been this long?
Since I got lost in space?

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
Has it been this long since I’ve had this bond?
Has it been this long since I’ve had this bond?

[Intro]
No help still
No help still

[Verse 1]
He said it hurts when he stares at lights
I guess my brain was full, indecision's on the lefthand side
But the doctor said it's cool, just take these in the dead of night
Within the deepest sleep, you'll fall, my head hit bed, but my mind's still alive

[Refrain]
These pills just make me, these pills just make me drool
I say these pills just make me, these pills just make me, these pills just make me, these pills just make me drool

[Verse 2]
I told him he weren't doing things right
So he put me on some more, no change as a year flew by
I gave that fraud a call, he sniggered when I told my plight

[Refrain]
He told me I was, he told me I was wrong
He told me I was, he told me I was
He told me I was, he told me I was

[Verse 3]
And now she's sat alone, the deep of night
She's sitting in a pool, makes incisions on the righthand side

[Refrain]
Her blood is in me, her blood is in the song
Yeah, her blood is in me, yeah, her blood is in me, yeah, her blood is in me, yeah, her blood is in the song
Yeah, her blood is in me, yeah, her blood is in me, yeah, her blood is in me, yeah, her blood is in the walls

[Outro]
Yeah, no help still
Yeah, no help still
No help still
No help still

[Intro]
Won’t be wasting my time
Won't be wasting my time

[Verse]
I'm used to saying, “I don’t belong”
A burdened youth outcast from young
But how are you? I'm wasting your own time
And once consumed, spit gunk from lungs
To tell the truth, I haven't done
But how are you? I'm wasting your own time
My skin is bleach, my hair is long
I have no teeth, I've never done
My gums are raw and bleeding all the time
The shapes are grey, the cityscape
Bourgeoisie change to replicate
How can I be feeling the same as you?

[Outro]
'Cause they
Girl, they
Won’t be wasting my time
They, the suns will sinks
Won't be wasting my time

[Verse]
She asked me in detail how to get to where I’m from
But I told her it won’t work
'Cause she needs to be raised in dirt
I saw some crimes when I was young and now my brain is gunk
Haven’t found the right sized sponge
To rinse through all its wrongs
I put my trust in many things but now I know that's dumb
So I don’t trust anyone, only get along with some
Saw that girl again one time and now I know it's done
And my eyes are so forlorn but her eyes are so full on
I watch her creep between the streets beneath the setting sun
I said hey, how, where you going with my gun?
See some boiling blood beneath my skin, I crave her tongue
As my head it starts to plunge so I follow where she’s gone
Kept me hollow by her side in a taxidermy skunk
Oh, my brain is for her junk, change and lipstick in my lungs
Left outside another night, I watch the city burn
Hear her screaming all her words I say baby it’s your turn

[Chorus]
And she keeps on, it’s one of the people, she gets torched
She's one of the people, she keeps on, as one of the people

[Verse 2]
She sits as dust, with an earthly pus in a capsule on my tongue
And I think of what we've done and sink into where she sunk
Now up on my mantelpiece, she has no legs to run
Still a trophy I ain’t won, in a ceramic pot for one

[Outro]
She scatters just like one of the people
And yeah, she scatters just like one of the people
And yeah, she scatters just like one of the people
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Slipping into filth
Lonely but surrounded
A new place to drown
Six feet beneath the moon
He arose a bloodsucker
Painting black and blue objects with projections of himself
It was always about himself
He jerks inside
His guts twist
Sits in the big smoke and thinks of her
Me and you against this city of parasites
Parasite, paradise, parasite, paradise

[Intro]
Half man with the body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark

[Verse 1]
Half man with the body of a shark
Man, you know they left me in the dark for days
Ah man, if you try and it works, well maybe it can stay
It was a corrosive touch, I just lost too much in my soul
Perhaps the emotive rush turned my brain to mush
I’ll never know

[Chorus]
You were so fine the moonlight
Head aligned with your eyes in my sight
Caught everything
Simple soft thoughts, simples soft thoughts become menacing
Twisted raw adrenaline
Racing through my bones, racing through my body

[Verse 2]
I’ll never know
Ah man, if you try and it works, well maybe it could stay
It’s the evoking trust holding this frame of rust, I had to let go
To let this place combust you must refrain from lust
Dismantle the throne

[Chorus]
You were so fine the moonlight
Head aligned with your eyes in my sight
Caught everything
Simple soft thoughts, simples soft thoughts become menacing
Twisted raw adrenaline
Racing through my bones, racing through my body

[Bridge]
And if you don’t know and if you don’t care, don’t try to hide it
You’re not even there
And if you don’t know and if you don’t care, don’t try to fight it
You’re not even aware
And if you don’t know and if you don’t care, don’t try to fight it
You’re not even there
And if you don’t know and if you don’t care, don’t try to fight it
You’re not even there
Brother, brother
I’ve only got two fighting hands
Brother, brother
Make it hard for us to understand
Brother, brother
I’ve only got two fighting hands
Brother, brother
They make it hard for us to get together in this land
Half man with the body of a shark
Half man with the body of a shark
Half man with the body of a shark
Don’t try to hide it
Half man with the body of a shark

[Outro]
See world, you’ll never know
At least when you look to the stars they still glow
Well, not for me though
Body and head are empty, even when we're toe to toe
Well, I suppose I’ll forever be the only one who knows
Aspirations ingrown, I’ll forever be alone
See world, you’ll never know
At least when you look to the stars they still glow
Well, not for me though
Body and head are empty, even when we're toe to toe
Well, I suppose I’ll forever be the only one who knows
Aspirations ingrown, girl, I’ll forever be alone
They just don’t care

[Intro]
Hello?
Through moans of the dead
The universe in skulls
Hello?
As oceans stand still
Steel structures dissolves
Of dust soft fuzz
Is anybody out there? Hello?
She pants, she pants
All I can see is her mouth
Is anybody out there? Hello?
Its motion, it's urgent, its trigger
Is there anybody out there?
Pulling us in, she pants
Is there anybody out there?
Distortion trails up spines
The locomotive has arrived
Is there anybody out there?
The locomotive has arrived

[Chorus]
I don’t know why
I search for you
Could we align?
Can we meet here?
Until the end of time

[Verse]
Is there anybody out there?
'Cause I'm all alone
In soft bleeding, we will unite
We OOZ two souls, pastel blues
Heightened touch from losing sight
Swimming through the blue lagoon
Basking in the dark of night
Of depths unknown to be explored
We sink together through the sky (the sky)

[Chorus]
I don’t know why
I search for you
Could we align?
Could we meet here?
Until the end of time

[Verse 2]
Is anybody out there?
A lover's sigh
To be absorbed
But I let go, I slip alone
Sorrow weeps my lucid eye (lucid eye)
Abandoned bodies by numb minds
The universe salutes, Lucifer cries
Within heartbeats, you strum goodbye
Within your heartbeats, you say goodbye
I don’t know why
Is anybody out there?
Could we align?

[Outro]
She pants she steals
Can’t you breathe
Through moans of the dead
The universe in skulls
As oceans stand still
Steel structures dissolve
She weeps
Her sweet sting
Bleeding perfume perpetually
It overflows, it sinks
It drips in obnoxious ink
On streets, in clothes
She leaps, she limps
Tense liquid herbivore
Cannibal pacifier
She pushes me off
It’s cold by the fire
Bathed city

Bathed city

The liquid scenery
Cast an indigo complexation
To drift so carefree, moonlight reflects in the pool of darker times
And to sink to darker measures
Submariner seeks pride from depths hard to find, forever wading
A pool of strange things
Its guilt, is craving, this comfort, it’s quilt
And outside I think it’s raining

Why’d you leave me? Because of my depression?
You used to complete me but I guess I learnt a lesson
Things are even
But don’t even out
The deep sea diver’s in doubt

*murmurs*
*murmurs*
*murmurs*
And if we swim down low
This pressure might go beneath the covers the cotton ceiling
And if we swim down low
This pressure might grow beneath city lights I’m wandering home
And if we swim down low
The pressure might go beneath the sheets I’m covered in
And if we swim down low
The pressure might grow those woes were still hovering

This day’s slipping
I feel my feet drift
Tarmac city skin
I walk the beat swift
The sunsets, the moon lifts
Those blue hours, those blue hours
Those blue hours, that blue shift

[Verse 1: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
There's a lot of things I'm pretty sure I taste of
And I'm sorry they're all pretty cheap
I've been letting down everyone I know
And hardly ever going out anymore

[Chorus: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
20 comes fast so I should go out
I should really go out
There's a lot of things
And I can't give them up, never give them up
I lose my mind, is it out there?
Have you seen it?

[Verse 2: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
These last few months have left a lot to be desired
There's gotta be more I can do than just wake up tired
I'm wondering how much longer
I can not go to the gym
And still appear slim
With my clothes on

[Chorus: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
20 comes fast so I should go out
I should really go out
There's a lot of things
And I can't give them up, never give them up
I lose my mind, is it out there?
Have you seen it?

[Verse 1]
Dumb surfer is giving me his cash
Won a bet for fifty and now I need a slash
Man this band that's playing, is playing fucking trash
Skunk and onion gravy, as my brain's potato mash
He came across the back of a bureaucratic stash
Shot the lot for credit and never got it back
He's mashed, I'm mashed, we're mashed
That cat got slashed in half like that
As venus completes orbit, I’m feeling slightly mashed
The stir fry didn’t absorb it, I need another slash
She spoke in English, it was low lit where we sat
Remembering her face but that’s the end of that
I’m a step from madness as I puke on pavement slabs
Got a bit embarrassed, need to get back to the lab
In the debts of traffic, I was feeling like we crashed
With a girl from Slovak in a European cab
From a set of habits, I can see momentums mashed
If we were commuting, this train would fucking crash
Now my brain's diluting with blame and guilt and hash
Getting lashed, getting lashed by all of the gods
By all of the gods, by all of the gods

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
As my brain's diluting, I suffer from whiplash
This girl's now screaming, I think we've gone and crashed
The driver’s speaking and the car is still intact
It was only minor, well that's the end of that
Girl, that’s the end of that as I know
Girl, some things you don’t know

[Outro]
Dumb surfer, don't suffer
Dumb surfer, don't suffer
Dumb surfer, don't suffer
Dumb surfer, don't suffer
Ay, some things won’t change for a while
Keep me, keep me as the villain
But my prayer, you don't own

[Verse 1]
Falling slow but surely
I've bitten off more than I can chew
Old haunts feel so mundane
Nothings quite the same without you

[Chorus 1]
Wait, I'm in over my head again
Wait for me 'cause I, didn't look this far ahead

[Verse 2]
Master of disguise, maybe one day
I'll get this rock out of my shoe
Still people always ask me
What I wanna be, I wish I knew

[Chorus 2]
Wait, I'm in over my head again
Wait for me 'cause I, didn't look this far ahead
I catch you smile as you snooze
As contented as I'll ever be
Running risk of sounding crude
But your pizazz is "Michael Jackson bad"

Trying to keep my cool around you
Skip my played out, swoony antics
I drop whatever I'm doing
At first chance of you sending an adorable dog pic
Don't have a clue what I am doing
More than half the time, at least google can help me rhyme

Trying to keep my cool around you
Skip my played out, swoony antics
Trying to keep my cool around you

[Intro: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
I still text you when I know that you're asleep
And I miss you when it hasn't even been a week
I use an excessive amount of emoticons in every text I send
Every night's a good night, and I never want them to end

[Chorus: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
I've never been so into
Hearing about someone's gardening
And isn't weird?
How you could talk for hours
And I'd still be listening

I've never been so into
Hearing about someone's gardening
And isn't weird?
How you could talk for hours
And I'd still be listening

I've never been so into
Hearing about someone's gardening
And isn't weird?
How you could talk for hours
And I'd still be listening

[Verse 1: Ben Robertson]
Every moment you're around
I'm stir-crazy, off the ground
Let's get high and jump a fence
I don't care what happens next
Sprained ankles and blistered feet
as we walk down the empty streets
Directionless pursuits are fine
We know that we've got time

[Chorus: Ben Robertson]
Because I've seen the world a thousand times it seems
Just to wake up and find that it was in my dreams
I try my best not to lock eyes
When I do I just can't get you off my mind

[Verse 2: Ben Robertson]
Dead-arm on a Friday night
And curbside lit up by streetlights
Sleep-filled eyes awakened by
Morning daylight through the hedge
Sorry about your grass-stained jeans
I'll make it up by any means
Let's get high and jump a fence
I don't care what happens next

[Chorus: Ben Robertson]
Because I've seen the world a thousand times it seems
Just to wake up and find that it was in my dreams
I try my best not to lock eyes
When I do I just can't get you off my mind

[Verse 1: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
You said I smell like Listerine and cigarettes
But I just want you to like me
As much as Kanye West, likes Kanye West

[Chorus: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
But I'm feeling uncharacteristically fine
A little more all the time
Since you've been mine

[Verse 2: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
The ground felt weak beneath my feet
The day I wore jeans to the beach
And I try really hard, but I can't control my fucking speech

[Chorus: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
And I'm feeling uncharacteristically fine
A little more all the time
Since you've been mine
My words mean nothing as they fall rapidly out of my mouth
It's not a race but if it was, I'm definitely not winning
It's always been this way, ever since the beginning
I try to fake a smile but only half of my muscles co-operate

Remember all the times I ran my fingers through your hair?
Every morning I wake up I'm dreaming you'll be there
Remember all the times I ran my fingers through your hair?
Every morning I wake up I'm dreaming you'll be there

Remember all the times I ran my fingers through your hair?
Every morning I wake up I'm dreaming you'll be there
Remember all the times I ran my fingers through your hair?
Every morning I wake up I'm dreaming you'll be there
And I left a note on my bedpost
Said not to repeat
Yesterday's mistakes
What I tend to do
When it comes to you
I see only the good
Selective memory
The way you make me feel, yeah
You gotta hold on me, I never met someone so different
Oh here we go
You're a part of me now
You're a part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
I can't remember to forget you
I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed, repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I'm trying to say
Is not to forget
You see only the good
Selective memory
The way he makes me feel like
The way he makes me feel, I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh here we go
He a part of me now
He a part of me
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory
Is us kissing in the moonlight (oh)
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
I rob and I kill to keep him with me I
Do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight I
Do anything for that boy
I rob and I kill to keep him with me I
Do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight I
Do anything for that boy
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory
Is us kissing in the moonlight (oh)
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
But when you look at me
The only memory
Is us kissing in the moonlight (oh)
Oh-oh ooh oh
Oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
You and I
We don't know where to start
But I can't lie
I think that's my favourite part
You don't mind
That you're not my only vice
So let's waste time
Dancing under the steetlights

Cause I've been precarious
Except when you're around
Cause I've been precarious
Except when you're around

Horoscopes lie
But I know that you don't mind
Cause you and I
I think we're the same kind
Some of your wise words
I'll not soon forget
But if looks can kill
So can your cigarette
Cause I've been precarious
Except when you're around
Cause I've been precarious
Except when you're around
I'm sure there will come a time
When you know me well enough to hate me
I spent my whole summer getting high
On playgrounds with my best friends
I'll sit on the side of the road
Entirely fucked, if i want to
And I'll think to myself, this is a good night
But I know it'll end

I grab my tongue, before I can choke on it
I hold my beer, so I can hold a conversation
I sleep all day, so I can feel a little less shit
I grab my tongue, before I can choke on it

I'm sure there will come a time,
When you know me well enough to hate me

[Intro]
Yeah
You're now rockin' with the best
Hub City's threat
Minor of the year
K. Dot
Ooh, it's about to get so ugly in here
It's about to get so ugly
Like whoever's listening to this
Oh man I crack myself up
Yeah
Oh my God man, oh my God
We 'bout to shit on these faggots man
Check it
Yeah, K. Dot
(Let me get that)

[Verse]
First niggas used to rapping, get my attention
Now I don't even listen
It run through one ear and out the other
And I don't buy niggas records for music
I'm more interested in their album covers
I'm a talented brotha
Plus I move so quick it's like my brain came with a joystick
Motherfuckers better listen when I spit
I knock records out the park
Homeboy I Ken Griffey a hitch
And I might Ken Griffey ya bitch
But won't buy her shit, not even a small bag of chips
Just give her long pipe 'til it's scrapin' her hips
Like a waitress, the way the broad ask for the tip
If you want, just ask for a clip
I'll give ya those for free, no, I won't charge a fee
Just roll up on you, like cut off sleeves
Nobody can cut off the number one rap artist, damn, I am the hardest
Blowin' through Nintendo cartridges
To Maybachin it, valet parkin' it
Now people arguin' who is better?
Them or him, him referring to me
Them referring to the industry
Hands down, Jay left, now give me the crown
Fuck later, I'm takin' it now
Fuck haters, I'm takin' 'em down
With the red beam, red beam, silencer, don't holler it muffle the sound
Bark like ten rottweilers straight from the pound
Straight for the dollas, 745, older Impala, scrapin' the ground
I suggest you follow, or not be smarter
Seein' another broke tomorrow
You can tell the way I speak begins to stutter
First it was hard for y'all to even makin' it harder
Ain't about money, then please don't bother
Y'all niggas funny, talkin' bout that you run shit
When I'm lookin' at ya like "Who are ya?"
Y'all niggas is gas
And what make that bad is y'all niggas is trash
Y'all don't wanna see me spaz
Out, pull the gats out and see me blast, ouch
You better off coppin' a pen and a pad
Than copyin' the last rhymes I had
And spit 'em to your homeboys 'till they all say "You wrote that?"
Tell 'em lies or, give 'em the facts
It don't matter 'cause in a minute, I'ma be chargin' my raps
A G for a bar, that's 3 16's, plus a 8 bar hook nigga, add up that
I charge you a verse like Dre would charge you a track
Your whole budget, hoes love it
But you hate it, 'cause I'm your girls favorite
Nigga, face it, you can't walk in my shoes nor change the sides tryna replace it
As far as rap, I spit in the Matrix
Past reality, nigga actually, I wrote a rhyme where there was no gravity (Haha, oh my God)
That's a whole 'nother planet
For real holmes, I do damage
Blow up ya city, even ya school campus
Run in ya class while your doin' ya standards
Let it blast
One gun subtractin' ya life, now that's the basics of math

[Outro]
Oh my God man let me stop spazzin' out on these niggas, B
They have to call 911, I'm done
Dave, you feel me man? It's real
K. Dot man, just havin' a lil' fun up here man
It's real ugly, ya know?
Yeah, bang, bang, let's go

[Kendrick Lamar & Random Guy]
Yo like I was sayin' though, I pull up to the chick house
Nigga be like straight cartoon characters (What?)
No doubt, tasmanian devil

[Random Guy & Kendrick Lamar]
Aye, aye, aye man, aye
You that dude K. Dot, man? (Yo)
Yeah, yeah man, I heard you from like Compton (Yeah)
Like CPT, like deep in there, like in the streets

[Kendrick Lamar]
Hol' up, hol' up, who is y'all?

[Random Guy]
Man, I'm Johnny Goodfor, and I'm from Wisconsin
But my man here, he spit that hot fire, you need to hear this, he got that piff

[Kendrick Lamar]
Where you from?

[Random Guy]
That's that piff

[Random Rapper]
I'm Deran, nigga, D3 is from the east coast, homie

[Kendrick Lamar]
What part of the east coast?

[Random Rapper]
Nigga I'm from Maine

[Kendrick Lamar]

[Random Rapper & Random Guy]

From the east coast

[Kendrick Lamar]

[Random Rapper]

[Random Guy]

[Random Rapper]
Man, imma get these cars, get these cars

[Kendrick Lamar]
Wait, hol' up, is you serious?

[Random Guy}
Man, I ain't playin', this nigga's real, man

{Random Guy & Random Rapper}
(Hushed murmuring)

[Random Rapper]
I'm the truth!

[Random Guy]
Yes there's rappers in Maine, they been in Maine, we originated from Maine, that's the 

[?]

[Random Rapper]
Tell these- tell these fools

[Random Guy]
I'm tellin' 'em

[Random Rapper]
These Cali ass niggas

[Random Guy]
Cali, Bali
We go to valleys

[Kendrick Lamar]
Damn industry niggas
If you were a teacher, I would fail your class
Take it over and over 'til you noticed me
If you were a waiting room, I would never see a doctor
I would sit there with my first aid kit and bleed

I want to be the power ballad that lifts you up and holds you down
I wanna be the broken love song that feeds your misery
And I can wish all that I want, but it won't bring us together
Plus I know whatever happens to me, I know it's for the better

And when broken bodies are washed ashore
Who am I to ask for more, more, more?
But you're breathing in my open mouth
You're the gun in my lips that will blow my brains out

I want to make you drive all night just because I said maybe you should come over
I want to make you fall in love as hard as my poor parents teenage daughter
She'll be the best you ever had if you let her

I know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
There's a valley of sorrow in my soul
Where every night I hear the thunder roll
Like the sound of a distant gun
Over all the damage I have done

And the shadows filling up this land
Are the ones I built with my own hand
There is no comfort from the cold
Of this valley of sorrow in my soul

There's a river of darkness in my blood
And through every vein I feel the flood
I can find no bridge for me to cross
No way to bring back what is lost

Into the night it soon will sweep
Down where all my grievances I keep
But it won't wash away the years
Or one single hard and bitter tear

And the rock of ages I have known
Is a weariness down in the bone
I used to ride it like a rolling stone
Now I just carry it alone
There's a highway risin' from my dreams
Deep in the heart I know it gleams
For I have seen it stretching wide
Clear across to the other side

Beyond the river and the flood
And the valley where for so long I've stood
With the rock of ages in my bones
Someday I know it will lead me home. oh, oh, oh...

[Intro]
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 1]
I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
And when they finally leave me, I'm all alone but
I'm lookin' down and my girls are blowin' my phone up
Them twenty questions, they askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I had to trash the hotel lobby

[Chorus]
But I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 2]
In every city I've got one with different ringtones
Flyin' from L.A. all the way to Puerto Rico
My girls are callin' me askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse
But I can't even lie you got me

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Bridge]
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
Darling, I can't stop it even if I wanted
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
Missed what you were sayin', I was miles away, yeah
Don't be mad, don't be mad
Not like I had a choice
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse]
Open your mouth wide
The universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Open your mouth wide
The universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive

[Outro]
Ocean blooms

[Verse 1]
I heard that you been with that girl again, boy
Don't you know I could only take so much pain, yeah
It's plain to see, ooh, what you're doing to me
I, I could only take so much pain

[Pre-Chorus]
You've been sneaking around I'm told
Why am I the last to know?
Listen, when I say

[Chorus]
Should I love you like I do?
I'd like to leave but I'm unable to
Should I love you like I do?
Listen boy, I'm talking to you

[Verse 2]
I can give you a lifetime of desire; I can, yeah
Sweep you sweetly as a breeze on a hot summer night, ooh yeah
It's plain to see, ooh, what you're doing to me
I, I could only take so much pain

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll help you every inch of the way
Through the dark and through the day
Oh, listen when I say...

[Chorus]
Should I love you like I do?
I'd like to leave but I'm unable to
Should I love you like I do?
Listen boy, I'm talking to you

[Bridge]
I can feel you slippin' away
Don't hurt me again
I can't stand the pain
Oh listen, when I say...

[Chorus]
I've been thinking a lot about you
Should I love you like I do?
I'd like to leave but I'm unable to
Listen boy, I'm talking to you

I've been thinking
I've been thinking a lot about you

[Outro]
Oh, don't hurt me again, boy; I need you
Should I love you like I do?
Should I love you like I do?
Should I love you like you love me?
Listen to me, I'm talking to you
Sign it from the times, something you can't own
Life is what you find, hiding in your home
I wanna see you make it, make it, make it on your own
I wanna see you take it, take it 'til you're all alone
Make it, make it, make it on your own

She has got no friends, and his seem to be near
If you ended it tomorrow, would they even care?
I wanna see you make it, make it, make it on your own
I wanna see you take it, take it 'til you're all alone
Make it, make it, make it on your own

I wanna see you make it, make it, make it on your own
I wanna see you take it, take it 'til you're all alone
I wanna see you make it, make it, make it on your own
I wanna see you take it, take it, take it on your own

Ras clat bad man, not up for discussion
We buy, you can't make out a new budget
Hair tie, hair dye, 'til you feel something
Brooklyn, late night, girl that knows nothing
Caps lock, arms raised, hiding in the bathroom
Your eyes can't fade when you've seen nothing
My eyes dark brown, blackened by the night
'05 fist fight ended with a knife
UK, you gay? You okay, nigga?
Shaking in the corner like ya mama ain't with ya
Twistin' your reality until you come home
Checking on ya pulse 'cause there's nowhere else to go
PULSE nights can't keep up with a nigga (June 12th)
Wanna see me before you go
New slides on sight, fuck with a nigga (bet)
Wanna see me before you go
Places and faces, come fuck with a nigga
Wanna see me before you go
I wanna see you make it, make it, make it on your own
I've been walking on my silence
Drowning you in diamonds
I wanna see you take it, take it 'til you're all alone
Fading out the violence
I wanna see you make it, make it, make it on your own
What's it gonna take?
Phasing all the blue out
Drowning you in diamonds

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Say say say, hey hey now baby

[Bridge: Adam Levine & SZA]
Aren't we too grown for games?
Aren't we too grown to play around?
Young enough to chase
But old enough to know better
Are we too grown for changin'?
Are we too grown to mess around?
Ooh and I can't wait forever baby
Both of us should know better

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Ooooh, oooh
Been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh

Somewhere different, lose myself in the life

Yeah, Ursher baby
So, how you doin’ honey?
With me, you know there’s no losing, honey
I ain’t braggin’, but got plenty money
Spending it as if it’s funny money
I know you been at your 9 to 5
Let me put something new in your life
Bottles and models and skippin’ lines
Tippin’ them strippers, that lavish life

(We can) Take a private jet from here to LA
(We can) Hit up London and New York in the same day
(We can) Light up Vegas, sippin’ something, go dumb in the Bay
(We can) pop a couple bands, shut down every state

Would u believe it If I were tell ya
I'm the man who'll change your life
Would u believe if I were show ya
All your dreams in just one night

It starts and ends with me
Would u believe it if I told you that?

Ain’t no illusion, honey

Ain’t just out here with anybody
My boo is exclusive, I own the party
Now you think you sitting courtside

Shawty you could save the sky miles
But going private for that mile high
Girl, I can show you things so tell me are you wit it (Are you wit it?)
‘Cause we just got one life to live, do you wanna live it?

Somewhere different, lose myself in the life

[Verse 1]
Woo!
Hey, sexy lady, uh, you got something I want (Yeah)
And yo man gon' probably hate me (Shh)
But girl, it's all his fault
You know you've been frustrated, I see it in your eyes
Your man be actin' shady, he just keeps tellin' lies
So girl, when you replace him, he shouldn't be surprised
So by the end of the night, you'll be mine
That's why I'm screamin' out...

[Chorus]
Ay girl, fuck yo man, ay girl, fuck yo man

And you can be all mine tonight, tonight
Let's do it all tonight, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

[Chorus]
No I don't need your alibi
You say I'm wrong, yeah, show ya right
We kiss, we hug, we fuss and fight
We laugh, make up, then we go all night
It's such a thrill to love you and it's real
Roller coaster, of emotions we feel
It's such a thrill to love you and it's real
Roller coaster, of emotions we feel

[Verse]
Sometimes I hate you
Sometimes you kill
My love but I still
Manage to deal
You think I'm crazy, I could say the same
Perfect for each other, yeah, we're both insane

[Chorus]
No I don't need your alibi
You say I'm wrong, yeah, show ya right
We kiss, we hug, we fuss and fight
We laugh, make up, then we go all night
It's such a thrill to love you and it's real
Roller coaster, of emotions we feel
It's such a thrill to love you and it's real
Roller coaster, of emotions we feel

[Outro]
No I don't need your alibi

[Verse 1]
Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing
Turnin' blue
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me like you do (Like you do)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you need me, wanna see me
Better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon

[Chorus]
Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry)
But down
Hmm, down

[Verse 2]
Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year-long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me, déjà vu (Hmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you need me, wanna see me
You better hurry, I'm leavin' soon

[Chorus]
Sorry can't save me now (Sorry)
Sorry I don't know how (Sorry)
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry)
But down
Hmm, down

[Outro]
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
But I'm not sorry
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
Sorry

[Intro]
(Four, three, two, one)

[Verse 1]
Say hello to the girl that I am
You're gonna have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't wanna be so damn protected

[Pre-Chorus]
There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers

[Chorus]
What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

[Verse 2]
I'll tell them what I like, what I want and what I don't
But every time I do, I stand corrected
Things that I've been told
I can't believe what I hear about the world
I realize I'm overprotected

[Pre-Chorus]
There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers

[Chorus]
What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel (Help the way I feel)
But my life has been so overprotected

[Bridge]
I need time (Love)
I need space
I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
What I, what, what, what I'm gonna (I need)
Do about my destiny
(I say no) Nobody's telling me just
What, what, what I wanna do, do
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be
Someone else but me, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected
I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
What I, what, what, what I'm gonna
Do about my destiny
(I say no) Nobody's telling me just
What, what, what I wanna do, do
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be
Someone else but me
What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel (Help the way I feel)
But my life has been so overprotected

[Verse 1]
What am I supposed to say
When I only speak the truth?
If you're trying to inflict more pain
Then you're good at what you do
But we may never be the same
That's what brings me back to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you electrify my brain
You electrify my brain

[Chorus]
I'm screaming out, out
My insides coming out, out
Said we'd make it thru this time around, round
But look what's already happening now, now
My insides coming out
My insides
My insides coming out
You electrify my brain

[Verse 2]
Woke up this morning but I'm dead
And I can't get out of my head
And I didn't really get much sleep
'Cause you came to me in my dreams
I never really thought you'd leave
Take your freedom and making a change

[Pre-Chorus]
And you electrify my brain
You electrify my brain
You electrify my brain
You electrify my brain
You electrify my brain

[Chorus]
I'm screaming out, out
My insides coming out, out
Said we'd make it thru this time around, round
But look what's already happening now, now
My insides coming out
My insides coming out
My insides coming out
My insides coming out
You electrify my brain

[Bridge]
Covered in blood, covered in goo
Covered in tears, covered in glue
Oh I'm missing you, oh I'm missing you
Colored in green, colored in blue
Colored in gold, colored maroon
Oh I'm missing you, oh I'm missing you
You electrify my brain

[Chorus]
I don't want you to go
I need you to stay
But I want you to know
This back and forth can drive me crazy
I'm scattered across the room
Want you to come and pick me up
It was my heart that you threw
But I'm still missing you
You electrify my brain, brain
But I'm still missing you
You electrify my brain

[Outro]
What am I supposed to say
When I only speak the truth?

[Verse 1]
Walking Scott Street, feeling like a stranger
With an open heart, open container
I've got a stack of mail and a tall can
It's a shower beer, it's a payment plan

There's helicopters over my head
Every night when I go to bed
Spending money, and I earned it
When I'm lonely, that's when I'll burn it

[Chorus]
Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name?

[Verse 2]
I asked you, "How is your sister?
I heard she got her degree"
And I said, "That makes me feel old"
You said, "What does that make me?"
I asked you, "How is playing drums?"
Said, "It's too much shit to carry"
"And what about the band?"
You said, "They're all getting married"

[Chorus]
Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name?

[Outro]
Anyway, don't be a stranger
Anyway, don't be a stranger
Don't be a stranger

[Chorus]
Dance
Doom
Dance of Doom
Dance
Dance of Doom

[Pre-Verse]
Dance of Doom, here we go

[Verse 1]
Put out your arms and shake your head
Roll back your eyes just like you're dead
One hand hip, other hand hip
Take two steps and triple front flip
Take off your legs but keep your pants on
Then take off your head and throw it at your mom
Now that you're lighter, do a push-up
And out of your neck hole, quack like a duck
Lie on the ground and just stay put
And wait 'til a human steps on you and hurts their foot
Here comes the chorus then I'll show you soon
How to do the rest of the Dance of Doom

[Chorus]
Dance
Doom
Dance of Doom
Dance
Dance of Doom

[Verse 2]
Now bend your arm then bend it back
You're doing it wrong if you don't hear it crack
Right side down, left side down
Just a little lower, now you're underground
Remove some ribs so you can kick your own face
Roll down some stairs, then take a lunch break

[Smooth Jazz Lunch Break Interlude]

[Verse 2 (Cont.)]
Punch punch kick, punch punch kick
Spin forty times and land in the splits
Now it's time for a corn dog sword fight
You're doing it wrong if that feels right
Replace your scalp with snakes
Or really any piece that LEGO makes
Juggle with some boulders
While you crowd surf on skeleton soldiers
Now clap your hands
Then squeeze your pituitary gland
You'll grow a little bigger pretty quickly
And destroy the dance floor, literally

[Chorus]
Dance
Doom
Dance of Doom
Dance
Dance of Doom

[Bridge]
Plastic ninjas in your room
They're all doing the Dance of Doom
Plastic ninjas in your room
They're all doing the Dance of Doom
Plastic ninjas in your room
They're all doing the Dance of Doom
Plastic ninjas in your room
They're all doing the Dance of Doom
Dance of Doom
Dance of Doom

[Chorus]
Dance

Dance of Doom

[Outro]
Oooh, ahhh

Live in the ocean, give it a try
If you won't live here, why won't you die?

Don't look at the sun or you'll go blind
And die in a wave of emotion
Don't smoke grass or you'll get high
And die, so let's go to the ocean

Get in the ocean, give it a try
If you won't live, why won't you die?

Don't look at the sun or you'll go blind
And die in a wave of emotion

If it will give you hope
Want you to understand (Understand)
Here comes your smile (Here comes your smile)
Hope it stays for awhile (Stays for awhile)
You know it's contagious
It might sound outrageous
But I feel so alive (Feel so alive)

Arrows through the dark

So open up your mind for me
And make a little time for me
Ya heard I've been on your hills and thangs
I'm here to remove your bills and thangs
Splurge with you
My whole hands walking on the curve with you
Even hit the earth with you
Yeah, I wanna explore that
And take you to the store that, the rich and famous shop at
Kick back relax you are with a top cat
If I was in a tax I bust the top hat
You slip into some silk, yeah, I got that
Dogg's gonna get ya, a nigga gonna hit ya

Well I'm a libra, and I'm a dare devil like Evil Canival
And girl, yousa a diva
That's on the real
Do you do what you want or do what you feel

You like the Neptunes, oh for real?
Come by the studio and meet Pharell

But I need you in my program

[Hook: Jelly Roll]
I wanna get to know ya oh baby, get to know ya I gotta

[Hook: Jelly Roll]
I wanna get to know ya oh baby, get to know ya I gotta
Get to know ya oh baby, I gotta
Get to know ya baby, get to know ya I wanna
I went from backpack rap, I thought that was the ceiling
Never thought my underground ass would touch a million
Wrist two tone looking like a fucking penguin
And tell PETA, yes, this is a plush chinchilla
I said woo
Being modest, Funk Flex the bomb threat
The music department rejected me in college
So shout out to my alma mater
You know I got a couple Grammies that y'all can borrow
Nah nah
I'm still winning, I'm still any, they still envy
Still directing fans, no labels trying to steal pennies
The white walls clean as hell and they still spinning
Still buying bootleg shit, this isn't real Fendi
I pop off, get topped off
My watch got us looking like bath salts, the bezel is cracked rocks
I wrote the playbook, no time to coach mascots
Get your ass out of here, that goes for all of y'all
Go politic at Comic Con, homie, knock it off
Got my own kid to raise, you are not my job
Mamase, mamamakusa, bumping Chaka Khan
The other day, and another dollar in my pocket y'all
Who told you I was falling off?
They lied to you, oh I'm booboo? No, not at all
I hit your city and get litty, hoo, problem solved
And throw a party with some cougars and some soccer moms
The champ, I come through, I slide through, I slam doors
Bench press arenas, and slam journeys, and dance sports
Crash course, the whip looking like transformers
Now I'm heading home 'cause Family Matters just ask Laura
Drop another one, oh my God, hold applause
Wanna kick you while you're on your way up, they so Solange
My compadres eating empanadas, all my folks is on
On the autobahn, pushing Maseratis like old cars
I'm so hot, I'm so damn hot could holler at the stars
Probably could have fucked a couple, kept my Johnson in my drawers
Don't want to box with God, competition? Not at all
Take my shirt off, take my rings off, and I holler World Star!
Tweet that link, you get DDT
Mollywhop your squad, BBD
Back in school I used to dream about this job, TNT
RIP Craig Sager, that's my fucking dog
And my suit game vintage, so Magic Don Juan
Hold up, if Jay or Ye is Jordan, and Kendrick is LeBron
And Drake is Westbrook, and Durant is Big Sean
That means that Cole is Curry, and Eminem is Bird
I'm not playing in the league to sit behind Dirk
I said, one ring?
Fuck that, I'm on my third
This is unseen, bust past rapping on first
I had one dream, to travel around the earth
With a 16, turn an arena into a church
Now can I preach to 'em, Flex?
They said one hit wonder, yeah?
Five platinum hits later, yes
And Gemini September 22, yes

Uh-huh-huhhh, uhh, uhh
Uh-huh-huhhh, uhh, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
We’re movin' automatic, matic, ohh!
We’re movin' automatic, matic (matic, matic, matic)
We’re movin' auto matic, ohh!
We’re movin' automatic, matic, matic, matic (matic, matic)

[Bridge]
Everybody’s watchin', let’s put on a show
Put your arms around me, right above the floor
Oh, oh oh oh oh, oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, ohhh oh oh
Ohhh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, ohhh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhh yeah!

[Intro: Charli XCX & Lizzo]
Hey, listen (Hahaha)
I blame it on you, I blame it on you
Yee!

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
I just wanna drink you up
Pour you in a silver cup
You know I like to party
But you know I love your body
So many things I shouldn't do
I hate myself for hurting you (Yeah)
Honestly, I'm reckless
I'm sorry if I'm selfish

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Every time you get too close, I run, I run away
And every time you say the words, I don't know what to say
Back, back to the beginning, really wish that I could change
I do, I do, I do

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Blame it on your love
Woah-oh, I blame it on your love

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
Sorry I'm a little scared
But no one ever really cared (Uh-huh)
I took you for granted (Yeah, I did)
Just a big misunderstanding
I just want to spend the night (One night)
Sleeping in your bed tonight (Yeah)
Or watch a little TV
I love it when you need me

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Every time you get too close, I run, I run away (I run away)
And every time you say the words, I don't know what to say (Say)
Back, back to the beginning, really wish that I could change
I do, I do, I do

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
I blame it on your love (Yeah, yeah)
Every time I fuck it up (Fuck it up, man)
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX & Lizzo]
Blame it on your love
Blame it on your love (Ya-ya-ee)
I don't know what's wrong with this girl Charli, she crazy (Woo)

[Bridge: Lizzo]
Gotta blame it on the, blame it on the
Blame it on the juice (Blame it on the juice)
Looking at my booty like you don't know what to do
Baby, I know that you can't control it (Control it)
But my body like a swisher, just roll it (Roll it)
I'ma give you one chance to fall in love (Hey)
Give you one chance, don't fuck this up (Uh)
Ah, ah, oh (Uh-oh, uh-oh)
I'm tryna catch millions, I ain't tryna catch feelings (Bitch)

[Chorus: Charli XCX, Lizzo & Both]
I blame it on your love (Yeah, yeah)
Every time I fuck it up (Fuck it up, man)
I blame it on your love, I do (I do)
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop (Yeah)
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love (I do)
Every time I fuck it up (Every time I fuck it up)
I blame it on your (Every time we fuck it up) love, I do (I do)
I blame it on your love (Yeah, I blame it on your, blame it on your)
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hahahaha, okay, that's it

[Intro]
Looks don't count better off judg—

[Verse 1]
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna—
Motherfucker, it's my goddamn honor
To eat a sucka MC like a hot lamb döner
Respect rook check dope blind dialectic
Took the perspective of open-minded skeptic
Where your skeptical's looks don't count
Better off judgin' by rhymebooks and sheer amounts
And work backwards from there
Angle of attack on a track was like a spear through the clear air *tongue-click*
What's your status? It's don status
Reserved for those who chose to go beyond madness
'Cause we like "Villain you must be out your taboggin' hoggin it's a horror"
Eatin' MC's like there's no tomorrow starvin'
Welcome to the club registration
We be waitin' right here collectin' off our nations revelation
Sensations of Latter-day Saints
Immortalized in black splattered spray paint, Faint
Ain't live and direct and kept his eye on the game
Like SpyTec
Mic check
Villain get booted out your online school
Student got straight-up A's in divine rule
Quicker than a sleight of hand like, "Damn"
Telepathy and telekinesis faster than InstaGram
See what he said, layin' his wood, get paid is at
From the States to your estate flat, ain't that

[Verse 1]
I was five, and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

[Chorus 1]
Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down

[Verse 2]
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play"

[Chorus 2]
Bang bang
I shot you down
Bang bang
You hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
I used to shoot you down

[Bridge]
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now he's gone, I don't know why
And 'til this day, I sometimes cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

[Chorus 1]
Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down

[Outro]
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby shot me down

[Intro]
Ready?
I can't get this thing to stop squeaking
Laughs
Alright
Ready, Riley?
Ready
1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
I've been on my own for a long time, I'm feelin' kinda lonely
Nothing's fun when I'm the only one out here who knows me
Something's stopping me from becoming a better person
I could try to pace myself, but I don't think that it's worth it

[Chorus]
What's the point in workin', if a wish is never certain?
I know I'll never be... perfect

[Verse 2]
I went for a walk last night, I swear it was for hours
Happiness is far from reachin' inside of my power
My friends say that I'm changin', changin' like the weather
Mom says I look sick, pop says keep my head up

[Chorus]
What's the point in workin', if a wish is never certain?
I know I'll never be... perfect

[Verse 3]
Man, I'm thinking out loud, where I know someone will hear me
Cryin' out for help, in search of someone near me
And I see a growin' boy whenever I look in the mirror
Told me pain is temporary and my vision's comin' clearer

[Chorus]
I'm not used to workin', a wish is never certain
I know I'll never be... perfect

[Chorus]
No, no
I'm not used to workin', a wish is never certain
But at least I'll never be... perfect

[Verse 1]
Take a dirty picture, babe
I can't sleep and I miss your face
In my hands and in my knees
Tell me what you wanna do to me
Tell me what you'll do, please

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone anymore

[Verse 2]
It got quiet on the other line
Said the sun was coming up, and I
Laughed until I couldn't breathe
Now I'm too tired to go to sleep
Now I can't breathe, and I can't sleep

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be stoned
I don't wanna be stoned anymore
I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone anymore

[Bridge]
I've got a good feeling
I've got a good feeling
It doesn't happen very often

[Verse 1]
For a chemical imbalance
You sure know how to ride a train
Your revolution is a deathbed
And the music is your maid
When someone comes a-knockin'
With a needle on a tray
Only your lonesome lies beside you
For you told me not to stay

[Verse 2]
You are somebody's baby
Some mother held you near
No, it's not important, they're just pretty words, my dear
There is no distraction that can make me disappear
No, there's nothing that won't remind you
I will always be right here

[Chorus]
And you spit the blood back
Spit the blood back, baby
I'm amazed that you're alright
Oh, so long, prison boy
I won't be home with you tonight

[Verse 3]
We're both very sick, our muscles all worn down
It's as if we are one-hundred, know I won't still be around
Because I've fallen
Yes, I've fallen right into the love I've found
Long before I reach one-hundred
I'll have fallen to the ground

[Verse 4]
And for generations, they'll romance us, make us more
Or much less than ever was before
The Chelsea and the floor
Make us stand before the masses
Like two speakers for the poor
When there was no revolution
Nothing we were fighting for

[Chorus]
And you spit the blood back
Spit the blood back, baby
I'm amazed that you're alright
Oh, so long, prison boy
I won't be home, I won't be home
I won't be home with you tonight

[Bridge]
And you can call the service bell
When we stay at the Chelsea Hotel
And I'll stay out of my own hell

[Outro]
Oh, so long, prison boy
I won't be home, I won't be home
I won't be home with you tonight
Tonight

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I don't got time for meditation, nah
Don't got time to have a conversation with God
Don't got time for the congregation now, ah
I'ma put off liberation 'til tomorrow
Lord knows that I'm stuck in my ways
Out here expecting the rays
And do the same thing every day
Then expect it to change, yeah

[Chorus: Ben Abraham]
I used to say
I was never gonna change
But it rain
Water carry me away
Change
River is gonna run
Why am I afraid?
What am I hiding from?

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Can't take in the church, if I don't show up
If I don't do my job, I don't get the bonus
Don't wanna appear weak, if I don't know some
Can't find self if I'm afraid to no one
Can't critique the world if I can't take a critique
Can't blame my neighborhood if I don't clean my own street
Can't blame the drugs if I put the drugs in me
Can't expect others to change if I don't change me
Lord knows I ain't perfect
But 'til I put the work in
Success isn't destined, it's determined
By what you sacrifice for your purpose
But what's the purpose?
But what's the purpose?
Until they close the curtain
Put the work in

[Chorus: Ben Abraham]
I used to say
I was never gonna change
But it rain
Water carry me away
Change
River is gonna run
Why am I afraid?
What am I hiding from?

[Chorus: Ben Abraham]
I used to say
I was never gonna change
But it rain
Water carry me away
Change
River is gonna run
Why am I afraid?
What am I hiding from?
Square-cut or pear shaped
These rocks don't lose their shape

Diamonds are a girls best friend
Diamonds are a girls best friend

Diamonds, diamonds
I don't mean rhinestones
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

[Verse 1: Phoebe Bridgers]
Playing "would you rather"
When it comes to fire
You always say that you'd prefer to drown
You were still in the ambulance
When the cop suggested you're the one
Who tried to burn it down

[Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers & Conor Oberst, both]
Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We found our way out
Of the suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background, I'll be waiting

[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
We have the same face
I laid awake as someone shoved you up against a wall
Quarantined in a bad dream
He's half the man and you're twice as tall

[Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers & Conor Oberst, both]
Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We found our way out
Of the suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background, I'll be waiting

[Bridge: Phoebe Bridgers & Conor Oberst]
Next time I see you, you'll show me
A hundred different ways to say the same things

[Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers & Conor Oberst, both]
Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We found our way out
Of the suicide pact of our family and friends
And when you touch down, I'll be waving

[Verse 1]
Broke into her house, saw her sitting there
Drinking coke and whiskey in her bra and underwear
Saw him in the kitchen, hanging up the phone
I asked him nicely once to pack his things and go

[Verse 2]
He gave her a reassuring look, said he wouldn't leave
But I asked him one more time, this time pulled out my shiv
Stuck him in the back, and I pulled it out slow
And I watched him fall down, and as the morning sun rose
He looked at me, he said:

[Chorus]
"You missed my heart, you missed my heart
You got me good; I knew you would
But you missed my heart, you missed my heart"
Were his last words before he died

[Verse 3]
Looking out the window, up at the blue sky
Listening to her scream, listening to her cry
A feeling of relief came over my soul
I couldn't take it any longer, and I lost control

[Verse 4]
I chased her up the stairs and I pinned her to the ground
And underneath her whimpering, I could hear the sirens sound
I rattled off a list of all the things I miss
Like going to the movies with her and the way she kissed me

[Verse 5]
Driving into downtown Wheeling, showing her off
Backyard barbecues and reunions in the park
I said I missed her skin, when she started laughing
While I clenched down on her wrist, she said
"That's quite a list, but there's one thing you missed"

[Chorus]
"You missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missed
You missed my heart, you missed my heart (You missed my heart)
That's quite a list, but what you really missed"

[Verse 6]
Running through the parking lot, running through the fields
Policemen on my back, something hit my skull and cracked
They dragged me off to jail, set a million dollar bail
Where I tried to tie a noose, but I failed and I broke loose

[Verse 7]
I went racing through the prison yard, shot down by a tower guard
He got me in the shins, and he got me in the arms
They strapped me in the gurney, took me off to the infirmary
Where the priest read my last rites
And just before everything went dark, I said

[Chorus]
"He missed my heart, he missed my heart (You missed my heart)
He got me good, I knew he would
But he missed my heart, he missed my heart" (You missed my heart)
And just before everything went dark

[Verse 8]
The most poetic dream came flowing like the sea
Laying there, my lifeblood draining out of me
A childhood scene, night sky, moon beams
Fishing with my friends, sittin' in the wild reeds

[Verse 9]
Watching the Ohio river flow at night
Waitin' for the bullheaded catfishes to bite
Downriver from the Moundsville Prison graveyard

[Outro]
Downriver from the Moundsville Prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville Prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville Prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville Prison graveyard

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, be humble (hol’ up, bitch)
(hol’ up, bitch)
(hol’ up, bitch)
(hol’ up, hol’ up, hol’ up)
Sit down (hol’ up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol’ up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol’ up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol’ up, hol’ up, hol' up)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, be humble (hol’ up, bitch)
(hol’ up, bitch)
(hol’ up)
(hol’ up, hol’ up, hol’ up)
Sit down (hol’ up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol’ up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol’ up, hol' up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol’ up, hol’up, hol’ up, hol' up)

[Verse 1]
I gotta start by thanking the lord, (because)
I don't wanna see no face more, (than yours)
Cause you
Got a kinda persona that can not be ignored
Anymore
I got ya
For sure
I got ya
Cause your
Body just the type I want against me
You with me?
You the only girl I know that fits me
You get me
Feels like a love bug bit me
I gotta find you quickly
Because I don't even know your name

[Hook]
I'm hoping you feel the same
I don't want you to think I'm insane
But you just keep looking my way
I ain't shootin' no game
'cause
'Cause I don't even know your name (2x)
Girl
(Bridge)
I gotta find you quickly
Because I don't even know your name

[Hook x2]

Now I bet if I ever die, she gon' cry
And I know even if she get high, she gon' lie
I know it, that my brother, he gon' lie and he down for it
Bitch, I pop molly and buy Tom Ford
I want you, baby, baby, baby
Get rich and make my brothers my neighbors, neighbors

My momma ain't 'bout to answer if it ain't got acres, acres, yeah

[Verse]
Okay, all my diamonds water like a pool party
Bitch, I’m Young Thugga like a newborn 2Pac
Just bring that ass back, get comfortable like a futon
Meanwhile, I’m working my moves, Young Thugga Liu Kang
I'll buy you the shit if you suck this dick like a tic
I got hoes from the east, north, west, south, so legit
If a pussy nigga play, I'll shoot his back just like he Rick
No Smiley, my gators got poison ivy
She riding me like a Harley, I’m riding her like a trolley
Meet me at the W, no Wale
And broke never been the topic
Put that bitch on her feet with Huaraches

[Chorus]
Now I bet if I ever die, she gon' cry
And I know even if she get high, she gon' lie
I know it, that my brother, he gon' lie and he down for it
Bitch, I pop molly and buy Tom Ford
I want you, baby, baby, baby
Get rich and make my brothers my neighbors, neighbors

[Chorus]
Now I bet if I ever die, she gon' cry
And I know even if she get high, she gon' lie
I know it, that my brother, he gon' lie and he down for it
Bitch, I pop molly and buy Tom Ford
I want you, baby, baby, baby
Get rich and make my brothers my neighbors, neighbors
I’m rocking red, white and blue like a patriot, patriot
My momma ain't 'bout to answer if it ain't got acres, acres, yeah

Why can't you be near?
Never one would appear
Where do we go from here, where do we go?
If the last one isn't there
And it's all gone
But if the last one wasn't there
It'd all be wrong

Sometimes you turn around
Sometimes you're lost but not found
Where do we buy the day, when we go?
If the last one isn't there
And it's all gone
But if the last one wasn't there
It'd all be wrong

[Verse]
Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, "What scent that is, boy?"
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house "the embassy"
The studio "the chapel", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me "don't worry, I got your money" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, "Where does the day go?"
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Insha'Allah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira

[Outro]
I love, I love
I love, I love it
Baby, I
Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronise
Don't patronise me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel somethin' that it won't
And here in the dark, these final hours
I will lay down my heart, I will feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me when you don't
When you don't, yeah

I close my eyes
'Cause then I don't see
The love you don't feel when you're home with me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel somethin' that it won't
And here in the dark, these final hours
I will lay down my heart, I will feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me when you don't
When you don't, you
When you don't, yeah
Hey, mom and dad I'm a real dick and I hope you know that
Hey, mom and dad I'm a piece of shit and I hope you know that
Hey, mom and dad I'm a real bitch and I hope you know that
Hey, mom and dad I'm a real... dick, dick

I don't need no introduction
No ad lib on my name, 100 times for nothin'
You already know
It's K.Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie 

[?]
Oakland and 2Pac, I'm more focused
I'm nothin' like these rap gods fumblin' over a few lines
Thinkin' they're high 'cuz their homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lyin' to you
You tellin' a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hours, these niggas better get their bars up
I bench press this rap stuff
Got it locked like handcuffs, I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my AC
Home is where the heart is
And I gave it to you in a paper bag
Even though it’s tarnished
You told me it’s the best you ever had
You got my secret combination
And I don’t be giving that out easily
With my deepest dedication
You can tell that you were brought the same for me

Please don’t let go
Cause you know exactly what we found
So please don’t let go my darling
You keep me locked up underground

In your big house on the hills
Where you keep your dollar bills
And you stashed my heart
Somewhere in the dark
Keep it safe I know you will
Know you will, know you will
Know you will
We're meant to be
Rolling with the punches
So they won’t get inside our happiness
Love is always hunted
But your arrows are soaring through my chest
Cause you know you give me something
Yeah you give me exactly what I need
Got my blood pumping
You know you always draw more blood, I bleed

Please don’t let go
Cause you know exactly what we found
So please don’t let go my darling
You keep me locked up underground

You left my heart out
When the rest of me is down
You, you enchanted me, even when you are not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on they
Now I know what I have found

I feel you close enough
I wanna latch in your love
I think we're close enough
Cuz I latch when you're mine

Now I got you in my space
I won't let go with you
What you shackle in my embrace
I'm latching on you

Now I got you in my space
I won't let go with you
What you shackle in my embrace
I'm latching on you
I'm so encaptured, got wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tighter then your clutch
How do you do it, you got me losing every breath
Why did you give me to make my heart bleed out my chest

I feel you close enough
I wanna latch in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I latch in your love, baby
I feel we're close enough
I wanna latch in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I latch in your love, baby

Now I got you in my space

There are voices in my head
And my heart is heart is trying hard to drown them out
I keep hearing what they say
They can space me into what they're all about
Well power slips away
And I'm weakening with every word they say
So I contemplate my faith
As I do, the whisper turns into a shout

You bring out the darkest side of me
Can't stop from a place that I can't reach
I would love to practice what I preach
You bring out the darkest side of me

I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me

Risking everything I had
I was keen to find the worst that I could do
Throw this sanity away
Brought destruction to the people that I knew
My hurt became a cage
I became a puppet on the stage
And even though we're not okay
The feeling brings me blush all the same, all the same
I know you're smart
You spin me round like a knot
You know the pieces, pieces of my heart
Sometimes it's fun, you pull my strings one by one
Until you get me, get me onto one

Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
I don't need you
Givin' it straight to me, givin' it straight to me
You're just gonna get my back
I don't need you
Tell me how to be, tell me how to be

Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying
Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying

Only you can look at me the way you do
You always tend me, tend me black and blue
Such a shame, you frame me with such disdain
You got me washed out, washed out, call it drained

Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
I don't need you
Givin' it straight to me, givin' it straight to me
You're just gonna get my back
I don't need you
Tell me how to be, tell me how to be

Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back

Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying
Hear me crying
Hear me crying

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, the most beautiful things
The most innocent things
And many of those dreams, pass us by
Keep passing me by

[Chorus]
You feel good
I said it's funny that you understood
I knew you would
When you were good, you were very, very good

[Verse 2]
So I close my eyes softly
'Til I become that part of the wind
That we all long for sometime, yeah
And to those that I love, like a ghost through a fog
Like a charmed hour and a haunted song
And the angel of my dreams
Angel of my dreams

[Chorus]
(You said) You feel good
I said it's funny that you understood
I knew you would
When you were good, baby
You were very good

[Verse 3]
I still look up, when you walk in the room
I've the same wide eyes, now they tell the story
I try not to reach out, when you turn 'round you say hello
And we both pretend
I'm no great pretender

[Verse 2]
So I close my eyes softly
'Til I become that part of the wind
That we all long for sometime, yeah
And to those that I love, like a ghost through a fog
Like a charmed hour and a haunted song
And the angel, angel of my dreams
Angel of my dreams

[Verse 4]
I still look up, yeah
I try hard not to look up, yeah
That girl was me, yeah
Track a ghost through the fog, yeah
A charmed hour and a haunted song, yeah

[Outro]
Track a ghost through the fog, baby, yeah
Track a ghost through the fog, baby
Ooh, you try hard
But you'll never catch me, yeah
That girl was me
Ooh, you try hard
But you'll never catch me, yeah
Ooh, that girl was me
Fellas don't go psycho
When she's on her menstrual cycle
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

Maxi pads are frightful
But orgasms are delightful
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

After she blows my wad I hate to go out in the storm
But when I think about what she just did my hard on keeps me warm

If that pussy ain't popping
Get her head to bopping
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

I wonder if Miss Morgan
Will suck my reproductive organ
If her cycle has to flow
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow
Well it feels so good I'm crying
Everywhere sperm is flying
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow...

After she blows my wad I hate to go out in the storm
But when I think about what she just did my hard on keeps me warm

If you can't stick it
Kick back and let her lick it
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

If there is no pussy pounding
You might find her lips astounding
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

I accept trainees
Get down on your knees!
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

After she blows my wad I hate to go out in the storm
But when I think about what she just did my hard on keeps me warm
Fellas don't get mad
Let her change her maxi pad
If you got her head down low
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

And when she gets real grumpy
Give her something lumpy
Since you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow.... let her blow....

[Verse 1]
Don't take me down where there's no way out, no way in
The plants can't breathe down here
Everyday there's another thing on my mind
It weights me down to the ground

[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me something sweet
And I won't stay away
Bake me, bake me up a treat
And I can't stay away

[Verse 2]
I don't have class, got a lot of time on my hands
To sit, wait around for a sign
Lay in the grass, open up a can of a new
Flavor that I've never tried

[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me something sweet
When the day seems so long
Bake me, bake me up a treat
I won't tell anyone

[Verse 1]
Recently played, shuffled again
Same two songs stuck in my head
I'll hear it back, don't pause the track
Always the same, stay in my lane

[Chorus 1]
I can't see in outer space
The night is dark, nobody finds me

[Verse 2]
Somewhere I heard, make up your words
Believe in the gods, come out on top
Try to relate, predict your fate
Now is the time, passing you by

[Chorus 2]
I can't see in outer space
The night is dark, my body shakes

[Verse 1]
I left my heart inside my brain
The thirty nine is still the same
When the spirit comes through you'll shake to the ground
I hope they're ready for the hot, crispy sound

[Verse 2]
I wash the windows, dry the frame
When I'm outside it starts to rain
I can't help feeling the spirit creep through the wall
The very sound it makes leaves me

[Verse 1]
I got a girl crush
I hate to admit it, but
I got a heart rush
It ain't slowing down
I got it real bad
Want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh
She's givin' you now

[Chorus]
I wanna taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
And I've got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush

[Verse 2]
I don't get no sleep
I don't get no peace
Thinking about her
Under your bed sheets
The way that she's whisperin'
The way that she's pullin' you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't get her off my mind

[Chorus]
I wanna taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
And I've got a girl crush
Oh, and I got a girl crush

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
No but in all seriousness, I'm the best rapper alive

[Verse]
You could be the back then and I’ll be the now
High as Neverland I'm Peter Pan, we'll keep it down
I got ya wig and ya man and ya nosey
That should be enough to keep a clown on her toseys
Look, Reddit, I gets my credit
I fleek my brows and I lay my edges
Keep my crowd and I pay my dues
Blood red bottoms, you da lady in the shoe
We pop the bottles while you getting all the booze
Every day I brush another nigga like rouge
I’ll take the L that the chicken had to ooze
I ooze when they look at my boobs
Look at my ass
Look at my crew
Look at yourself now
Look at your goons
Look at all the views that I got on one tune now
Tell me who the queen and who making all the rules
Rock to my shit
Flock to my shit
This is my flow, putting a lock on my shit
Fuck all of the games, but I’ma bottle my shit
You never could step, hop walk to my shit
Big joint shit like it make big coin
Give a bitch a red dot, sharper than a pin point
Bring bacon back home like a big oink
Gold digger
Chewing out your pocket, that’s a bit coin

[Bridge]
Seems like you need some juice
All y’all should ween off pills
Somebody needs some chill
(Somebody needs some milk, hahaha)
Make hits, I drop it simple
My boys got white like dental
Your rhymes, you bought like rental
I don’t make pop like pimple

[Hook]
She need milk
He need milk
Y'all need milk
Y'all need milk
He need milk
She need milk
He need milk
Need some milk
I don't make pop, I, nah
I don't make pop, I don't

[Intro]
What they say, what they say, what they say now?
What they say, what they say now?
What they say, what they say now?
What they say, what they say now?
What they say, what they say now?
What they say now? Ooh, yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse]
God on the screen, televangelist swing
A jacket made of faith waving grace
At the catchy song slapathon super chic
Runnin' 'round Tehran with Qurans in the cape
Base nuclear bombs, building arms like a palm full of weights
'Til the flash of daylight spawns in our face
Collective capitalistic adventures of the angelly invested
You only entered this for the exits
Flow is European Union, beats is like Brexit
Was restless, now me and chillin' go together like Netflix
Like boyfriends and girlfriends
Like Baltimore and Maryland, Dorothy and whirlwinds
Trump on acid, didn't mean to gas it
Pulled up to the pump with his trunks on backwards
Carreras, Testarossas, Superleggeras
Gaviria meets Guevara
White man made me
Born coldhearted like Iceman's baby
I can't lately that's why I chant daily
Warm soul artists hope Iceland saves me
The isolated geothermal screens
Warms the blood, Reykjavik's the scene
Two chains, one ring
No watch, lame
Trap

[Verse 1]
This night is young
Feels like I've been here forever
I want to stop, ooh
Drinking too much
My head has been in hell forever
I gotta give up, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Got girlfriends, boyfriends
Best dress on
Cocaine, ice cubes
Platinum blondes
Empty glasses, black Patron
But somehow I don't feel at home

[Chorus]
The city's alive
The lights are so bright
But inside my mind
I'm in the darkness
My friends have all gone
I'm here on my own
I'm walking alone through the darkness

[Post-Chorus]
I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the, in the
In the darkness

[Verse 2]
Smoke fades quickly
Yeah, I'm sick and tired of all the sadness
When I'm tryna get down
Cars pass through me
But I'm lost inside all the madness
No, I can't hear a sound, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Got on the guest list with plus one
Six AM, I see the sun
Heart is heavy, weights are turned
I hope my limousine will come

[Chorus]
The city's alive
The lights are so bright
But inside my mind
I'm in the darkness
My friends have all gone
I'm here on my own
I'm walking alone through the darkness

[Post-Chorus]
I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
In the darkness
I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the, in the
In the darkness

[Outro]
I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
In the darkness
I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the, in the
In the darkness

[Chorus]
You're the definition of perfection, quality, satisfaction
I guarantee I'm qualified
For your love, I'm ready, for your love
All it takes is one heartbeat for your heart
Painless, painless
And all I need is TNT to start the spark
Blow it up, now you're in shock

[Verse 1]
Girl, you know you got that bomb shit, and I want it
Girl, you know I got them explosives
Kissing and touching and freaking and loving your body all night long
That's the way I go, that's the way I go in, go in, in
This is the part when I steal your heart
And never give it back, back, back, back
This is my one chance to show you
That this is where it's at, at, at, at

[Chorus]
You're the definition of perfection, quality, satisfaction
I guarantee I'm qualified
For your love, I'm ready, for your love
All it takes is one heartbeat for your heart
Painless, painless
And all I need is TNT to start the spark
Blow it up, now you're in shock

[Verse 2]
Girl, you know you're supernova (You're an angel)
Brighter and brighter, you're a star, babe
Your halo is your crown
Let your love come down
Higher and higher, baby, don't fly away
Please stay under the clouds

[Chorus]
You're the definition of perfection, quality, satisfaction
I guarantee I'm qualified
For your love, I'm ready, for your love
All it takes is one heartbeat for your heart
Painless, painless
And all I need is TNT to start the spark
Blow it up, now you're in shock
I was thinking about
(I was thinking about)
Death and 

[?]

What if it was good times
Better than the life we live
Man that would be awesome
(man that would be awesome)
But then I can 

[?]

Totally horrific
With that being said imma live my life
(live my life)

[Intro]
'Cause that's where I'm supposed to be, like
I'm supposed to be where I'm tryna take the listener
You know what I mean, like if I'm..
I can't say it from that vibration down there, yeah
Uh, yeah
It's Illa J
Oh, yeah
Give me that soul, uh
Let's go , uh
Ya , uh, yeah

[Verse]
Religion and tradition don't belong in the same sentence
Soon as it becomes a routine spirit is missing, uh
Are you people listening?
Soon as it becomes a routine, spirit is missing
If you want your soul to be cleansed
You need to listen
To this lyrical soul that I am spitting
This individual soul is on a mission
To show you miracles so you would pay attention
To dip divinity that flows for infinity
Some of ya'll already there
Some pretend to be
Righteous with your head wrapped
Tryna be Erykah Badu
And you don't really do that
Claiming that you love soul food R&B and Hip Hop
But you don't really shouldn't
And wouldn't do that
If you had a chance
Anyway, Let's proceed to the dance, uh
It's Illa J on the rap
Tom Misch on the beat
And we killing that shit
A hundred grand, uh
You got, Ben on the drums
Jesse on the bass
Danny on guitar
That's my mans, uh
Is everybody is a star
And everybody going far
So everybody raise your mother fucking hands
'Cause everybody is a star
And everybody going hard
So everybody raise your mother fucking hands (wave your hands)

[Outro]
Everybody raise your mother fucking (wave ya hands)
Everybody raise your mother fucking (wave ya hands)
Everybody raise your mother fucking (wave ya hands)

[Verse 1]
You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Verse 2]
I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
I'm way to good at goodbyes
(I'm way to good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Bridge]
No
No, no, no, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you'll see me cry)
Ahhh
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Outro]
And every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes

[Verse 1]
Well I'm walking around in my mind
Your image knocks me down and I'm blind
No matter how far I move away
I find myself coming back everyday

[Bridge]
Oh, just let me go
Oh, just let me go
Oh, just let me go
Oh, just let me go

I know I shouldn't stay, you do have your ways
with me
But I want to see the colours of freedom

[Chorus]
From you (Repeated)

[Verse 2]
Maybe time be my friend
as I try to break from this trend
Maybe its harder than it sounds
Maybe my heart still pounds

[Bridge]
Oh, just let me go
Oh, just let me go
Oh just let me go
Oh, just let me go

I know I shouldn't stay, you do have your ways
with me
But I want to see the colours of freedom
From You

[Chorus]
From you (Repeated)

[Verse 1]
You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
But every time you hurt me babe, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
I'm way too good at goodbyes
I'm way too good at goodbyes
We don't stand a chance, Baby
We don't stand a chance

[Verse 2]
I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me

[Chorus]
I'm way too good at goodbyes
I'm way too good at goodbyes
We don't stand a chance, Baby
We don't stand a chance
We don't stand a chance, Baby
We don't stand a chance

[Bridge]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry

I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes,
I'm way too good at goodbyes
I'm way too good at goodbyes

And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes

[Chorus]
I'ma fly to LA, I been getting them racks
Tired of chasing that money, fuck her front and her back
I don't ever talk smack, pussy you ain't taking jack
I don't like cats, I like jags, I drink drank by the keg
I won't hit if it's stankin', suck that dick while you planking
I might buy new Acres, climb in it like a Wrangler
Substituting these whores
As I'm flying around the globe
I'ma shoot you boy if you play about my woah

[Verse 1]
Paris Hilton my rooms, I get them racks up
Now she suck a nigga like woo
My new CD's are print, but it ain't blue
I got a K in my trench, it's 'specially for you
Gunning, watch them pop lock it and drop it
Got all five pockets full in case you think it's a wallet
Shoot em in the back like Ricky, no Bobby
I got hoes and they give me head without a pocket
Aye, eenie miny mo
I'ma fuck the bitch all of her clothes on
Nigga that complain really poor, uh
Need a new job better store up
Need a new car with some carbon
I don't make it rain no, I'ma nut on her car, let her snort some
I just went inside Nordstroms and spent me a motherfuckin' fortune

[Chorus]
I'ma fly to LA, I been getting them racks
Tired of chasing that money, fuck her front and her back
I don't ever talk smack, pussy you ain't taking jack
I don't like cats, I like jags, I drink drank by the keg
I won't hit if it's stankin', suck that dick while you planking
I might buy new Acres, climb in it like a Wrangler
Substituting these whores
As I'm flying around the globe
I'ma shoot you boy if you play about my woah

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
I'ma fly to LA, I been getting them racks
Tired of chasing that money
Fuck her front and her back
I don't ever talk smack
Pussy you ain't takin' jack
I don't like cats I like jags
I drink drank by the keg
I won't hit if it's stankin
Suck that dick while you plankin'
I might buy new Acres
Climb in it like a Wrangler
Substituting these whores
While I'm flying round the globe
I'ma shoot you boy if you play about my woah

[Verse 1]
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking from the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus]
‘Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one’s gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it’s thriller
Thriller night
You’re fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Verse 2]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus]
‘Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one’s gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it’s thriller
Thriller night
You’re fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Killer, thriller

[Vincent Price]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller night, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

Cause this is thriller

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
There are times when I don't wanna speak
Grab a pen, scratch your chin, make the beat
Maybe not, smokin' pot on the beach
Paranoid with my boys, where my keys?
And my head in the clouds, is that him?
And my boys trippin' hard like nigga, chill
Someone new with the mouthful of boot
Now my boys, they come in with the deal

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I'm not mad at you
Things I'm going through make me act the fool
Please don't think I'm cruel
Really normally I'm cool
There is nothing you can do
Hey
When my words are few
Things ain't what they seem
Feeling like I'm fooling me
I know god is calling me
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
Sitting here smoking trees
When I should be on my knees
When my words are few

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Why you hounding me in the house of the lord?
Watch us, guilty
Ain't no move in the parking lot prophecies
That's why at the benediction, you can't find me
Oh ain't no smiles, ain't no joke
No bitches, please
Ain't no rest for my soul til' I come clean
I'll hear from the lord if I speak
So back off and let me eat, let me feast

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I'm not mad at you
Things I'm going through make me act the fool
Please don't think I'm cruel
Really normally I'm cool
There is nothing you can do
Hey
When my words are few
Things ain't what they seem
Feeling like I'm fooling me
I know god is calling me
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
Sitting here smoking trees
When I should be on my knees
When my words are few

[Verse 3: B.Slade]
I know that I chose to backslide
But now I know the way
I was born and raised in this thing
And that's something I chose to do
Church all my life
I ain't stepped outside but now I feel the light calling me
Back to the fold

[Interlude: B.Slade & Snoop Dogg]

Lil' bitch!
Hello America, Timbo is back
SV, Shock Value
Check it…

It’s Timbo, Timmy T/
I live in Miami still rep the VA beach/
Moving at light speed, who you know just like me/
A simple black man who own a private island/
Boss man is Iovine, gas house and Verizon/
Don’t fly in nothing less than a gulf stream/
There’s one more thing about me, niggas gone doubt me/
Because the Timbaland brand holds a lot of clout, G/
Come on girl lets go play housie, take these drugs get drowsy/
When the feeling come on give me some top piece/
I know that’s really not me but a nigga really horny/
I do a lot of nasty shit without a warning/
Come on come on hold me, shake that shit for me/
Cause in bed you ride that shit like a horsey/
Oh oh oh oh oh Lordy, let’s change up the story/
I’m too rich for y’all niggas to ignore me/
I don’t do it for glory, but a nigga love Porches/
A nigga will never sell his soul to sorcery/
Mom and dad divorces, that’s what split up the most list/
It made me so strong and it forced me/
To watch my haters closely, why blogs is so nosy?/
If you know something bout me nigga then show me/
You talking to the old me, ain’t ain’t ain’t that right, Steve?/
Tell them bitch haters to meet us up in Paris/
HOOK
Let me tell you bout this nigga/
From round da way/
He - he the coolest nigga and I got to say/
His name is Timbo/
So down to Earth think he can be your kinfolks/
(repeat 2x’s)

Verse Two
Black card, I got three/
He just recently sent me that new white piece/
The one without no writing, me, that’s a light beam/
I got a two-million thirty-five carat Graff ring/
Wife got the same thing - to me - that’s a ? mean/
Because me and you have nothing in common/
I’m my own Army, I like it when it’s starving/
I like to fall down - get up - it makes me hard G/
I paid a lot of parsley - got that Charles Barkley/
I like my women bow-legged - that got that dark meat/
Vacations and the RE somewhere near Greece/
Where the villas in the middle of the ocean/
Where don't wear no own rings - me and you boinking/
I got a lotta equity up in Beijing/
Think you niggas phase me - when I’m on phase 3?/
I sold a hundred and twenty million now chase me/
HOOK

[Verse 1]
"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say (Aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 2]
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(Yay)

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Bridge]
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 1]
Call you on the phone, you said don't be alone
I'm on my way, on my way
Another Friday night, where to now?
I'm on it

[Chorus]
Please don't, please don't let me down down
Please don't, please don't let me down down
We've got the world in our hands

[Verse 2]
We can drive around, all around the town
So pointless, so pointless
Maybe it's a waste to drink our nights away
But I love it, I love it
And I know I might be wrong in holding on too long
But fuck it

[Chorus]
Please don't, please don't let me down down
Please don't, please don't let me down down
We've got the world in our hands

[Verse 1]
I landed on the silver lake
Washed up and feeling blue
Heard the sound of footsteps
Drifting softly to the moon
Looking for clear water
I had to take control
Out there in the wilderness
Another bullet hole

[Pre-Chorus]
Playing it all for gods
Yesterday

[Chorus]
Idaho, Idaho
There's a beauty on the road
Every day, I look out on the bus
Silver lining's getting lost

[Verse 2]
Floated out into the woods
To hear the old elk call
Touched a rainbow with my hands
I'm dry, I got 'em all
"Ride on," said the king of cool
You've got nothing to lose
Tinseltown is down the road
It's the bullet or the noose

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're playing it all for gods
Far away

[Chorus]
Idaho, Idaho
There's a beauty on the road
And every day, I look out of the bus
Silver lining's getting lost

[Verse 1]
Every day is not a perfect day for you and I some days
Some things are just not right
That doesn't mean that I don't love you
And boy you know it’s true
I cannot always please you
When I look into your eyes
(When I look into your eyes)
I always see myself
That means that we are one
No one else can satisfy this girl the way you do
I know that love makes all the rules

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I say things to hurt you
But I'll apologize
Neither one of us are perfect
So you should realize

[Chorus]
Don't go, baby (I need you)
Baby, don't you go
(Baby, don't go, don't go)
Don't go, baby
I still love you so

[Verse 2]
Don't act that way if I ask you to stay
Please don't walk away from me, baby
Give me the same respect that you want from me
(Why don't you?)
‘Cause Lord knows that I deserve it too

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I say things to hurt you
But I'll apologize
Neither one us of are perfect
So you should realize
(No one is perfect, no one is perfect, don't)

[Chorus]
Don't go, baby
(Don't go, baby, I need you)
Baby, don't you go
(Baby, baby, don't go)
Don't go, baby
(I need you, don't leave me, baby)
I still love you so
Don't go, baby
(Don't go, baby, I need you)
Baby, don't you go
(I need you, I need you, I need you with me)
Don't go, baby
(Don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go)
I still love you so
(I still love you, yeah, yes I do)

[Bridge]
We all know we make mistakes
Sometimes we’re not always gonna get along
(We’re not gonna get along but I love you, yeah)
So stop wasting all your time thinking that I don't love you
(See, I love you, baby)
‘Cause if love makes the rules, no one gets played for a fool
(No one gets played)

[Chorus]
Don't go, baby
(Don't go, baby)
Baby, don't you go
Don't go, baby

Why're you so self-centered?

I ain't thinkin' 'bout you
Please don't sit yourself in my head

Nobody thinkin' 'bout you
(Bout you, bout you, bout you)
Why're you so self-centered?

Only thing keepin' me by your side now
Uhh we official, no dice we rolling together the end frigid I froze with you at night
Get your energy right
The enemy coming in by the droves don't give them control
My own issues on the back of the stove burning like coal in a caboose
You know the boy's the truth, sojourner
My old earth was on some greazy shit, need a kiss
Sayonara to the slow learners 'til we meet again
Like auf Wiedersehen
Like the work ain't the cleanest, but it's worth it when you need a win for sure
I'm finicky with words like my easel drip, we tend to hit a nerve like
I'm tending to the turf when it need defense, nigga
Hot summer streets
And the pavements are burning
I sit around

Trying to smile
But this air is so heavy and dry

Strange voices are saying
What did they say?
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort
This heat has got right out of hand

It's a cruel (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

The city is crowded
My friends are away
Now I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle
So I got to get up and go (go)
Go (go), go (go), go

It's a cruel (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
You're not the only one

It's a cruel (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer
Now you're gone

It's a cruel (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
You're not the only one

It's a cruel (it's a cruel), cruel summer
You left me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer
Now you're gone
Now you're gone, now you're gone, now you're gone
(It's a cruel) Now you're gone, now you're gone, now you're gone
(It's a cruel) Now you're gone, now you're gone, now you're gone
(It's a cruel) Now you're gone, now you're gone, now you're gone
(It's a cruel) Now you're gone, now you're gone, now you're gone
Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times

Happy days are here again
The time is right for makin' friends
Let's get together, how 'bout a quarter to ten
Come tomorrow, let's do it all again
Boys will be boys, better let them have their toys
Girls will be girls, cute pony tails and curls
Must put an end to this stress and strife
I think I want to live that sporty life

Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times
Good times, these are the good times
Our new state of mind, these are the good times

A rumor has it that it's getting late
Time marches on, just can't wait
The clock keeps turnin', why hesitate
You silly fool, you can't change your fate
Let's cug the rug, little jive and jitterbug
We want the best, we won't settle for less
Don't be a drag, participate
Clams on the half shell and roller-skates
Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times
Good times, these are the good times
Our new state of mind, these are the good times
Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times
Good times, these are the good times
Our new state of mind, these are the good times
When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be

A lovely day
A lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day
A lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day
(Day) A lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day
A lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be

A lovely day
A lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day
A lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day
(Day) A lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day
A lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be

A lovely day
A lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day
A lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day
(Day) A lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day
A lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day, a lovely day
Day
I see the curtains hangin' in the window
In the evenin' on a Friday night
A little light a-shinin' through the window
Lets me know everything is alright

Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind

I see the paper layin' in the sidewalk
A little music from the house next door
So I walked on up to the doorstep
Through the screen and across the floor

Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind

Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
And I come home from a hard day's work
And you're sitting there, not a care in the world
See the smile a-waitin' in the kitchen
Food cookin' and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through

Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Yeah, let's go!
Listen, some people wind up
With the one that they adore
In a heart-shaped hotel room
It's what a heart is for
The bubble floats so madly
Will it stay sky-high?
Hello partner, kiss your name bye-bye
Ooh sometimes

Romantic Piscean seeks an angel in disguise
Chinese-speaking girlfriend, big brown eyes
Liverpudlian lady, sophisticated male
Hello partner, tell me love can't fail

And it's you and me in the summertime
We'll be hand-in-hand down in the park
With a squeeze and a sigh
And that twinkle in your eye
And all the sunshine banishes the dark...
Some people wind up
With the one that they abhor
In a distant hell-hole room
This third World War
But all there I see is films with colourless despair
Meant angry young men with immaculate hair
Ooh sometimes

"Get up" a voice inside says
"There's no time for looking down
Only a Pound a word
And you're talking to the town"
But how do you coin the phrase though
That will set your soul apart
Just to touch a lonely heart

It's just you and me in the summertime
We'll be hand-in-hand down in the park...
With a squeeze and a sigh
And the twinkle in your eye
And all the sunshine banishes the dark...

And it's you I need in the summertime
As I turn my brown skin red...
Two peas from the same pod, yes we are
Or have I read too much fiction?
Is this how it happens...?
Is this how it happens?
How does it happen?
Is this how it happens?
Is this how it happens?

(Now, right now)

[Chorus]
Some people like to drink
Some people like to smoke
Some people overthink
Some people overdose
I'm just trying to get the nicest
Bottles on ices
Pull some all nighters
'Cause everybody got vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices
Everybody got vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices
Everybody got

[Verse 1]
I popped a couple bottles
I took a couple shots
I done fucked a couple models
I done fucked a couple thots
But from Seattle to Atlanta
From Philly to the bay
The only loyal bitch I know
Is a loyal bitch named Tanqueray
She gets me right everytime
It ain't never no fussing or fighting
She said she'll always be mine
That's why I cuff her and wife her
Now that's through sickness and health
All the way 'til death do us part
Ever since I seen her on the shelf
I knew we'd always be together from the start
And she tell me when my cups half empty
I tell her when the bottles half full
And I can't get enough so don't tempt me
Sometimes she's chased with Red Bull
Sometimes I have to re-up
'Cause I want to be with her all the time
'Cause everybody's got vices
I just wanna come clean about mine

[Chorus]
Some people like to drink
Some people like to smoke
Some people overthink
Some people overdose
I'm just trying to get the nicest
Bottles on ices
Pull some all nighters
'Cause everybody got vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices
Everybody got vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices
Everybody got

[Verse 2]
I rolled a couple fat ones
I Passed around the dank
I smashed a couple bad ones
I smashed a couple skanks
But from Cali to Carolina
New York to Tijuana
Only Mary that I know
Is a faithful hoe named marijuana
I be draped in all designer
Won't can't me in nothing less
Than a couple thousand dollars
Success will just make 'em swallow
Good sex will just make 'em holler
Good weed will just make it better
And ease the stress in my mind
As I continue to going and get this cheddar
Better roll it, lick it and then light it
Puff puff, pass that thing around
Everyday, I gets excited
'Cause this here, came from the ground
And it was put, on the earth to smoke it
I can't think, of a better time
To light it up and ask if I wanna hit it
'Cause I know that I can't decline
Luda

[Chorus]
Some people like to drink
Some people like to smoke
Some people overthink
Some people overdose
I'm just trying to get the nicest
Bottles on ice
Pull some all nighters
'Cause everybody got vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices
Everybody got vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices, vices
Everybody got

I've been burnin', yes, I've been burnin'
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance, to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Verse 1]
I've been smokin', oh, more than twenty a day
Blame it on rebellion, don't blame it on me
Wish I was younger back to the nineteenth of May
I had an open mind, swore to never change

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how time goes by
Had respect for myself that river ran dry
You reached a limit, I wasn't enough
It's like the fire replaced all the love

[Chorus]
I've been burnin', yes, I've been burnin'
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance, to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Verse 2]
Oh, if you ever called, I will run straight back
Give you my forgiveness and the shirt off my back
No friends to turn to, yeah, I messed up that
Wish we could smoke again, just for a day, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how time goes by
Had respect for myself that river ran dry
You reached a limit, I wasn't enough
And it's like the fire replaced all the love

[Chorus]
I've been burnin', yes, I've been burnin'
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance, to pay for the damage

Oh, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Verse 1]
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

[Chorus]
Oh won't you stay with me?
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Intro]
I just want the best for you

[Verse 1]
Yeah another night out
I get drunk, I get high
Then you call and I lie
And say I'm on my way now
Yeah, I say I'm on my way now
Show up when it's light out
When you're dressing for work
And I'm mumbling words
I don't know what to say now
No, I don't know what to say now

[Pre-Chorus]
You tell me I don't care, tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt ya if I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me, you don't believe me

[Chorus]
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh, baby
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through

[Verse 2]
Parties with shots and powder
But you'd rather sleep eight hours
And I know you got your doubts
'Cause I can't turn this life around, baby
Thought it was just a phase
'Til I woke up a thousand days later
Realizing I'm the same as I was before I saw your face

[Pre-Chorus]
You tell me I don't care, tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt ya if I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me, you don't believe me

[Chorus]
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh, baby
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh, baby
I just want the best for you

[Bridge]
You tell me I don't care, tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt ya if I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me, you don't believe me

[Chorus]
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you (for you)
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through
I just want the best for you (just want the best for you)
I just want the best for you (just want the best for you)
But I'm just not the best for you (I'm not the best for you)
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh, baby
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through
Oh oh no, baby (Yeah)
Oh oh no, baby (Yeah)
Oh oh, baby
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you

[Verse 1]
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 2]
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Bridge]
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Outro]
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, know
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 1]
Take everything you have in front of you
Make every movement, do it 'til ya do
You will not be hungry for long if you're working
And what would be the point if you didn't deserve it?

8 long months later I feel better
I try to decompress all the things that tend to mess me up
They always mess me up
And you were never conscious of all the good that surrounds you

Wake up to the rhythm of the city and I try to remember
Even my brothers have some trouble with each other sometimes things fall apart
It’s the way that things are
It’s the way that it is

[Verse 2]
Still, and I might, you have to suffer
You were never an example of someone who was givin’ up
You’re never givin’ up
And you had all the options, you probably needed someone around you
Even when you split me up, groovin' to the sound of the laughter
And if I listen to it closely I can still hear all the love in his heart
Every time I take a look at the skyline it makes me feel better
Cause I just miss you down here where the other people try to move on

Now you’re a star
It’s the way that things are
It’s the way that it is
Drivin’ that car

[Verse 1]

[Verse 1]
Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no
It's a special occasion
Not invited, but I'm glad I made it, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me apologize
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times (All those times)
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm beggin' you

[Verse 2]
Can we talk for a moment?
Got these feelings that I'm tired of holdin' on
Wasn't tryna get wasted
I needed more than three or four to say this, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me apologize, yeah
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times (All those times)
Your love, I don't wanna lose (Lose)

You say I'm just another bad guy
You say I've done a lot of things I can't undo
Before you tell me for the last time, yeah
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin' you

[Chorus]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out? (Can we work this out)

Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?(Yea)
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you
Baby, you make me believe I can fall in love at first
Sight, how you stunned me with your
Body, I'm under your curse
Baby, I'm under your curse
Baby, I'm under your curse

Baby, you make me believe I can fall in love at first
Sight, how you stunned me with your
Body, I'm under your curse
Baby, I'm under your curse

[Verse 1]
It's not time for conversation, no
I don't wanna complicate this for you
And I leave them other girls alone
If you'll be the one that I come home to

[Pre-Chorus]
All of my love, all of my love
My time, my attention, my patience, I'm giving it all
All the above, all the above
No, this ain't the way that I usually play this, no no

[Chorus]
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now?
Would I lose, oh, if I bet my heart on you?

[Verse 2]
Is it real, is it fake?
Would you leave, would you stay?
Will the night turn into day?
Will we get closer? Or will it be over?
I'm only hoping I don't waste, I don't waste

[Pre-Chorus]
All of my love, all of my love
My time, my attention, my patience, I'm giving it all
All the above, all the above
No, this ain't the way that I usually play this, no no

[Chorus]
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now?
Would I lose, oh, if I bet my heart on you?
If I bet my heart on you?

[Bridge]
It's not time for conversation, no
I don't wanna complicate this for you
And I leave them other girls alone
If you'll be the one that I come home to

[Chorus]
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now?
Would I lose, oh
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now?
Would I lose, oh, if I bet my heart on you?
If I bet my heart on you?
If I bet my heart on you?

[Verse 1]
You keep me connected to you like I was your shadow
You're giving me answers to all of my questions here on my pillow, oh
Can't nothing get in between us, baby
We've been waiting on this moment for so long
You wanna be reckless, restless, right until tomorrow
Wait

[Chorus]
When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby, cry for me
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)

[Verse 2]
Just turn off the lights and you can be my private dancer
When we close the curtains
You and me can forget all our manners, oh
The neighbors must think that we're crazy, baby
'Cause look how easily we keep coming undone
You wanna be reckless, restless, right until tomorrow
Wait

[Chorus]
When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby, cry for me

You feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
Make you cry for me

I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby, cry for me
Baby, when I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)

Hug ya, hug ya, hug ya
Look into your eyes and I see the ocean
I ain't got no wings, but you got me floating on a cloud
Looking down, it's emotion
Champagne flutes, everybody toasting
Heart beat fast on this roller coaster
Love you up and down, spin you 'round and 'round
Can you hear me now?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Oh, oh, hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand

You come over to tell me that it's over
Say you wanna do this face to face
Bottle opens, we pour out our emotions
Knew that if you came here, you would stay

[Chorus]
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure

[Verse 2]
How did we end up in this situation?
Guess it went exactly as you planned
I always give in to your manipulation
I tried to resist, but I just can't

[Chorus]
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure

[Bridge]
Oh, as soon as we make love
It's gonna break your heart again
'Cause we both know when we wake up
That we'll go back to war again, yeah

[Chorus]
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
If you want closure, come on and close that door

[Instrumental]
Morning side
System's gone from me
After love debris's still with me
Not doin' all right

Appetite
I can't even think
No sign of relief is...
Not doin' all right

'Cause I've got an upset stomach
From a broken heart
A tear stained pillow
From my crying eyes
A migraine headache
That just won't go away
'Cause I've got an upset stomach
From a broken heart
A tear stained pillow
From my crying eyes
A migraine headache
That just won't go away
Because I think our love has fallen apart
Sunny skies
Are cloudy to me
Black sad as can be confusing
We're not doin' all right

Happy smile
Has turned in reverse
Before work I must rehearse you
Not doin' all right

'Cause I've got an upset stomach
From a broken heart
A tear stained pillow
From my crying eyes
A migraine headache
That just won't go away
Yes I've got an upset stomach
From a broken heart
A tear stained pillow
From my cryin' eyes
A migraine headache
That just won't go away
Because I think our love has fallen apart

It's really hard
You said go away
(Repeat five times)
Be free
Free me
Alone
Leave me free me
Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone

I'm a soul
Of the broken kind
All feelings so fine have left me
Not doin' all right

Only love
Of the healing kind
And what's down time can help me
Back up to doin' all right

'Cause I've got an upset stomach
From a broken heart
A tear stained pillow
From my crying eyes
A migraine headache
That just won't go away
Because I think our love has fallen apart

It's fallen apart
Our love has fallen apart
Yes I've got an upset stomach
From a broken heart
A tear stained pillow
From my cryin' eyes
A migraine headache
That just won't go away
Because I think our love has fallen apart

[Verse 1]
You're standing there with your cigarette
Looking at me like we've never met
I know I fucked up, so I'll take the blame
And I don't expect you, to let me explain
You can't forgive, I can't forget
I know you're just too different now

[Chorus]
But I miss you and that denim jacket
I let you get away, I let you get away
Do you still wear that denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away
'Cause the color of that blue sky
Just reminds me of our goodbye
Do you still wear the denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away

[Verse 2]
Now someone else is taking you home, yeah
Hands on the waist, I used to hold
And I know it's my fault
I'm late to the dance
'Cause you couldn't wait for me and I understand
Why you never look back, once that door closed
I know you're just too different now

[Chorus]
But I miss you and that denim jacket
I let you get away, I let you get away
Do you still wear that denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away
'Cause the color of that blue sky
Just reminds me of our goodbye
Do you still wear the denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you, do you still?
Do you, do you still?
Do you, do you still
Do you still, do you still
Wear that denim jacket?
Do you, do you still?
Do you, do you still?
Do you, do you still
Do you still, do you still
Wear that denim jacket?

[Bridge]
You're standing there with your cigarette (yeah)
Looking at me like we've never met

[Chorus]
But I miss you and that denim jacket
I let you get away, I let you get away
Do you still wear that denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away
'Cause the color of that blue sky
Just reminds me of our goodbye
Do you still wear the denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away

[Outro]
Do you, do you still?
Do you, do you still?
Do you wear that denim jacket?

[Chorus]
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
I keep getting stuck in this day
Stuck in this déjà-vu

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm never riding solo
I feel you walking in my shadow
Never hit me quite like that though
'Cause now I'm under your spell
Late nights and I can't sleep
Choked up and I can't breathe
No one that can save me
'Cause now I'm under your spell

[Chorus]
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
I keep getting stuck in this day
Stuck in this déjà-vu
Even in my darkest hour
Even when I know it can't be true
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
(I keep seeing visions of you)

[Verse 2]
I keep saying that I'm okay
They never go so I pray
Dear Lord, I hope that one day
I, I get you out of my head
Late nights and I can't sleep
Choked up and I can't breathe
No one that can save me
'Cause now I'm under your spell

[Chorus]
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
I keep getting stuck in this day
Stuck in this déjà-vu
Even in my darkest hour
Even when I know it can't be true
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
(I keep seeing visions of you)

[Bridge]
You're a mirage
It's all in my mind
This is just love playing tricks on my eyes
You're a mirage
It's all in my mind
Why can't I seem to let go?
You're a mirage
It's all in my mind
This is just love playing tricks on my eyes
You're a mirage
It's all in my mind
Why can't I seem to let go?

[Chorus]
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
I keep getting stuck in this day
Stuck in this déjà-vu
Even in my darkest hour
Even when I know it can't be true
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh

[Outro]
I keep seeing visions of you
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you

All I gave to you
Was my heart, my keys, my bed, my home
All I gave to you
Was my time, my green, my favorite jeans, and everything you choose

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me how, how, how, how, how, how, how

All I asked to you
Was to prove to me that you were real
All I need from you
Was the pose, the breath, the sun, and life
Something I can feel

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how
Can you fake all that, can you fake all that?
Tell me how, how, how, how, how, how, how
Can you fake all that?
'Cause when I look back
Woah, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, all you gave me was

Damn my neck clearer than water
Old heads go hide all your daughters
Boat cannot be the father
I used a condom, I did
Baby said swallow my kid
I cannot front on a bitch

[Chorus]
I cannot front on a nigga, I cannot front on a bitch now
I don't eat vegetables but I keep carats in my wrist now
Fly like a cardinal, brother keep all of the arsenal
And I paint all of these bitches' faces just like an art show
Ayy, just like an art show
Nut on her face, paint up her face, just like an art show
Woah, just like an art show
Call it the art show, bitch it's the art show

[Verse 2]
Hmm, bitch fuck your daddy he don't want you with a boss
I met your mama and she hated how I floss
She said my style reminded her of Kriss Kross
She said I need to walk around with a cross
I can't have love for no bitch (no)
Watch how I lane switch (yeah)
Watch how I flood the wrist, oh
Damn, that's a flood (that's a flood)
Put that on the hood (put that on the hood)
I'm living good (yeah yeah)

[Chorus]
I cannot front on a nigga, I cannot front on a bitch now

Fly like a cardinal, brother keep all of the arsenal

Niggas been rapping for years and still don't got no fans
Niggas talk down on Boat, they pull up in black vans

Baby, you're just in my head and my daydreams
Nobody knows you, it can't be
Cause when I think of you I swear, babe
I can feel your bones

[Verse 3]
Lately, you are the first one to find me
Drowning and drowning, I can't swim
Your waves are too big and I am
Falling asleep
The road's so cold and you better know
That you're a winner and you're going for gold
I know it's long but you beter know
(yeah) don't ever stop

Never let 'em pull you down
Never let 'em lie to you
Never let 'em take your crown
Never let 'em cry to you
Never let 'em in your heart
Never let 'em give you money
Never let 'em hope you starve
Never let 'em find you funny
Never let 'em follow you
They don't need to side with you
Never let 'em ride with you
Pull out what's inside of you
Never let the system get you
Feed you, eat you, spit you out
Never let 'em know what you doin'
It's time you figure out
Never let 'em teach your kids
Never let 'em see you fear
Never let 'em blow your lid
Never let 'em take you there
Never let 'em break you up
Never let 'em break you down
Never let 'em shake you up
Never let 'em in your town
Never let a charoulette tell you what is excellent
Never let embetterment regard for what's irrelevant
Never let 'em tell you that KRS "oh, he dead, stop"
Never let 'em tell you that the radio plays Hip Hop
The road's so cold and you better know
That you're a winner and you're going for gold
I know it's long but you beter know
(yeah), don't ever stop
Don't stop
Don't ever stop
Don't stop
X2

(Hey)
Got the rhymes, borderline's rapper
I'm that other kind with tons of rhymes
Spit flames hotter than the summertime
People want to undermind but stay under mine
Under my mind under my thoughts, caught in another time
They in the past I'm in the right now
Thirty city tours these critics be like "how? Wow!"
They be tryin' to get rid of me since back in the day
But the more they push me down the higher I raise
When I did criminal minded they had something to say
When I said self-destruction they had something to say
When I did edutainment they had something to say
That's the devil I ain't concerned with nothing they say
They was frontin' in the 90's and they still frontin'
They know the cost of everything but the value of nothing
I keeps it pumpin' like a trucka
That's why I'm fresh for 2017 you sucka
The road's so cold and you better know
That you're a winner and you're going for gold
I know it's long but you beter know
(yeah), don't ever stop
Don't stop
Don't ever stop
Don't stop
X2

Never let 'em make you doubt
Never let 'em break you
Never let 'em take you out
Never let 'em tempt you
Never let 'em employ you
Never let 'em lead you
Never let 'em boy you
Never let 'em deceive you
Never let 'a snitch or  traitor
Know what's going on
Never let 'em know the plan
Freedom's only for the strong
Never let 'em in the jam
This is how they stole our songs
Never let 'em corrupt you
KRS ONE I'm gone

[Chorus: Malcolm X]
To have once been a criminal, there’s no disgrace
To remain a criminal, is the disgrace (That’s right)

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
Politics is a pile of tricks
Eight years, what do we get out of it?
More chatter, more gun splatter
More dumb rappers, and dumb athletes and actors
My name’s revolution, open your eyes
I'm not on TV, 'cause the revolution will not be televised
They telling lies, we better rise and get a plan
The US President? He’s endorsed by the Klan
Damn
You don’t understand what’s going on?
Slavery coming back and most of y’all just gonna go along
Not me, they ain’t veiling me
You can see, I ain’t vote for the president or Hillary
America tryin’ to put the fear in ya
They the reason for the fake war there in Syria
So when I grab the mic, I spit a full-clip
Wake up, you ain’t got time for this bullshit

[Chorus: Malcolm X]
To have once been a criminal, there’s no disgrace (That’s right)
To remain a criminal, is the disgrace (That’s right)

To have once been a criminal, there’s no disgrace (That’s right)
To remain a criminal, is the disgrace (That’s right)

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
This what the boom bap sound do
Since way back in the Bronx, I had a sound view
If you hearin’ this, the truth, it just found you
I’m in his town, her town, your town too
Man, I stay ahead like a crown do
Look around you
Knowledge reigns supreme, this is what it comes down to
People talkin’, but ain’t doin’ nothin’
KRS ain’t about frontin’, let me tell you somethin’
We need unity at all cost, or everything is all lost
These lessons are hard, that tweeter shit is so soft
Brothers killing brothers killing brothers with the sawed off
No remorse, brothers are hauled off up north
We off course, believe in the hype
Honesty, we ignore; but that deceiving, we like
These rappers are corny, but you like, “He aight”
You lyin’ from the pulpit
You ain’t got time for this bullshit

[Chorus: Malcolm X]
To have once been a criminal, there’s no disgrace (That’s right)
To remain a criminal, is the disgrace (That’s right)
To have once been a criminal, there’s no disgrace (That’s right)
To remain a criminal, is the disgrace (That’s right)

[Outro: Malcolm X]
I formerly was a criminal. I formerly was imprisoned, I’m not ashamed of that. You never can use that over my head. And—that—He’s usin’ the wrong stick, I don’t feel that stick

[Refrain]
I know it's rough out there
But you got to..
Stand on your feet, No problems
If you eat and you sleep, you've got No problems
To live is to love and really seek, No problems
No problems, No problems
You've got to..
Stand on your feet, No problems
If you eat and sleep, you've got No problems
To live is to love and really seek, No problems
No problems, No Problems

[Verse 1]
You see these bombs going off like usual business
Up on your feet, your dreams are not finished
Believe in yourself man, I'm speaking a lesson
Instead of stressing over depression just count up your blessings
Rich man or poor man, I'm neither or neither*
KRS don't jerk money and he's no miser
I'm wiser
We could see the rich life is toxic
If you ain't got peace it don't matter whats in your pocket
Switch the topic
I roll with the force so it gets me what I need so I don't worry about the cost
I'm all ?
As long as I'm dancin
Actin or rappin
Walkin around like
I don't know what's happenin
You like me (x4)

If I'm talkin bout drinkin
And nothin bout thinkin
As long as I'm high
And I never ask why
You like me (x4)

But the second I start with the state of the economy
Black leadership, Black gods and Black sovereignty
That's when you can't seem to follow me, confusion
You feel like you losin, I'm no longer amusin
This song's about choosin, choosin why you cruisin
Either Black entertainment or the Black Revolution
People love to see a young Black man rap
Until he wakes up and realize he's caught in the trap
So as long as I'm dancin
Actin or rappin
Walkin around like
I don't know what's happenin
You like me (x4)

If I'm talking bout drinkin
And nothin bout thinkin
As long as I'm high
And I never ask why
You like me (x4)

But the minute I get in it bout the way these rappers spit it
The minute I start spittin that truth here comes a critic
I freestyle off the top like removin ya yankee fitted
But they not really checkin for skills, they want the gimmick
Many of the challenges we face, we could solve em
But there's no trust, no unity, and that's the problem
Black people fightin amongst themselves that's the problem
White people fightin amongst themselves that's the problem
US foreign policy is simply just bomb em
Rebels against they own government, the US arms em
Then when things get outta hand, yeah they try to calm em
More money, more diplomacy, just charm em
If that doesn't work then they move to "Osama"
Turn him into a terrorist, so they can disarm em
Through the corporate media, we don't stand a chance
But too many people wanna us to just stand and dance
So as long as I'm dancin
Actin or rappin
Walkin around like
I don't know what's happenin
You like me (x4)

If I'm talking bout drinkin
And nothin bout thinkin
As long as I'm high
And I never ask why
You like me (x4)

You like me, you like me, you like me
You like me, you like me, you like me

Gucci to warm
2 Chains
Go!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci to warm
I'm tryna fuck me 2 cousins
I turn em' out of their living
I turn em' into new cousins
I think I'm buzzing, I'm tripping, My prescription need fixing!
I got a codeine addiction, What the hell I admit it!
I got a playboy subscription, I might check out them bitches
After stripper went broke, Ima slap one em' bitches
I got a cocaine connection, buy the cheapest on chicken
But he a stubborn lil' bastard, you gotta pay him his ticket
I got a chick that be boostin', 'Give me Gucci and Fendi'
I pay for that, but the pussy and head don't cost me a penny
I think I'm gone of this pack, this shit a hell of a stash
I need to get me a mask, cause they keep rollin' up gas
It's Gucci!

[Hook]
Seafood, fish scale, where the crook cook? It's just another recipe out the cookbook
Seafood, fish scale, where the crook cook? It's just another recipe out the cookbook

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Today I'm cooking yams, yesterday was greens
I take dirty money try to make it clean
Shoebox full of 20's, spent that on a watch
One thing bout' my menu, we never sellin squash
I was fifteen, out there selling rocks
Running back and forth the cars tryna duck the narcs
Fish scale odour, it's just straight yola
When this shit glitter, it take's the most soda
5 bricks, 50 p's in the Toyota
Baby mama driving, I hope she don't get pulled over
If she do she know the biz, I only fuck with soldiers
She ain't got shit to say...... Just like I told her

[Hook]
Seafood, fish scale, where the crook cook? It's just another recipe out the cookbook
Seafood, fish scale, where the crook cook? It's just another recipe out the cookbook

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
He say he hotter than La Flare, then he gotta prove it
I put shoes on my old school, just to do it
From a Buick to a Beamer coupe, I had to lose it
I lost the top and left the lot, playing Gospel music (Sike!)
Nah I'm lying, I was listening to that Boosie
Ice cream Gucci, you can call me bluey
Light hit the ice, and you can call me huey
Girls sticking to the kid, cause my game gluey
Before for that I choke a hoe down, Patrick Ewing
And I ain't talking to the law, I ain't do the shooting
You guys gotta get on ya job, you gotta prove it
I'm gone with this firearm, I might just abuse it!

[Hook]
Seafood, fish scale, where the crook cook? It's just another recipe out the cookbook
Seafood, fish scale, where the crook cook? It's just another recipe out the cookbook

[Verse 1]
We've got our problems
They're not so bad
Sticky situations always stop us from moving ahead
Just a civil feeling....and it feels so right
Where's the need for this indecision?
I don't really want to fight

[Chorus]
Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

[Verse 2]
I know nothing is perfect
I see the doubt in your eyes
You're asking me so many questions
I pray that you realize
You don't the meaning
And it hurts me to say
In these games where we hide our feelings
Our problems remain the same

[Chorus]
Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

[Chorus]
Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

[Chorus]
Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

[Chorus]
Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

Show a little mercy on me
Show a little mercy on me

[Verse 1]
What is your angle
Well, I hear your 

[view?]
I know that you whisper with
The minds that think like you
A mystery lived and breathed
From the day that I could see
Even I've no concept
Of the rage inside of me

[Bridge]
Sweet as the comfort of my
Everlasting peace
No bad religion
Just me and my beliefs
I was my 

[light?]
And now I am my 

[word/world?]

[Chorus]
And I've no desire to share my life
With little tin buddhas

[Verse 2]
Ask me your questions
Take me as you will
No thought can be sacred now
So sacrifice your kill
I see more fear in you
Then I breed within myself
Do you possess existence
And call it something else?

[Bridge]
Sweet as the comfort of my
Realizing 

[well?]
A misguided trust
Of those who are not
Of this world
I was my 

[light?]
And now I am my 

[world?]

[Chorus]
And I've no desire to share my life
With little tin buddhas
And I've no desire to share my life
With little tin buddhas

[Out of our heads]

[Verse 1]
Two more fall to the ways of love
With my respect for the man above
Sympathies mine remaining your state
Out of our heads and back again
I'm losing no time for the things I'm told
Ask for silence, let the world explode
Listen to it take away
Out of our heads and back again

[Verse 2]
Two more fall to the ways of love
With my respect for the man above
Sympathies mine concerning your state
Out of our heads and back again
I'm losing no time for the things I'm told
Ask for silence, let the world explode
Listen to it take away
Out of our heads and back again
Back again
Back again

[Verse 3]
Two more fall to the ways of love
With my respect for the man above
Sympathies mine concerning your state
Out of our heads and back again

Ask for silence, let the world explode
Listen to it take away
Out of our heads and back again

Back again
Back again again again again
Back again

Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and back again
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and back again
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and back again
Out of our heads and
Mhmmm
Mhmmm

[Verse 4]
I have no wish to see you bleed
I'll sacrifice your life for me
Still you lock yourself in chains
Out of our heads and back again
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Our love makes way for untold lust
Concede, our lives can't wait
Out of our heads and back again

Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and

[Verse 5]
Who am I to add lust
I couldn't let you down
The words of sense are hanging on
Leave you shivering on the ground

Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and

[Verse 1]
When you can smile, and you can cry
When there's no hope yet you find the will to try
Why should you fear, need to change
When people want you for who you are
And you can hurt so much it feels a burning scar
Why should you feel
Why should you feel the need to change

[Chorus]
When I have so much more to lose
More than I ever knew
Don't let it go too far
There's always somebody waiting
To break your fall
To break your fall

[Verse 2]
When I can't see, I can't read
When I know love is living inside of me
Why should I feel the need to change
So I spend all my time
Looking for something else
But now it's clear to me
I've learnt my lesson oh so well
Why did I feel
Tell me why did I feel the need to change

[Chorus]
When I have so much more to lose
More than I ever knew
Don't let it go too far
Just hold onto the branches 

[?]
Things we are
Just hold onto the branches 

[?]

[Chorus]
When I have so much more to lose
More than I ever knew
Don't let it go too far
Just hold onto the branches 

[?]
Things we are
Things we are
Things we are
Things we are

[Interviewer]

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Shoot 'em dead, split the wishbone
Bad luck, spilled the weed on the carpet
No more babysitting, no more homework
No more van rides to the mountains with the GameCube taped up
Take the auto down the block
With the scratches on the door, CD, no aux
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burn

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Where do I go when I die? What if I spend my whole life
Being a bad-ass boy with a crate on the side
I keep my face in my lap, wanna sit in the back
My mom driving around, we got church in an hour
Where do I go when I die? What if I spend my whole life
Being a bad-ass boy with a crate on the side
I keep my face in my lap, when I sit in the back
My mom driving around, we got church in an hour

[Verse 1]
There's an old song coming on the radio
Overrun they got us, let the garbage grow
Tell the kids stop feeling for the refugees
‘Cause they're not like you and they're not like me

[Chorus]
All of the boys they rock and roll
Cause they don't wanna talk anymore
All of the girls get no say in the world
Just dismissed, kiss their kids off to war
The lobby lines, the diamond mines
Don't listen to the people who won
It's a beautiful, beautiful world

[Verse 2]
There's a new song coming on the radio
Frutas florecen en todo el mundo
Let the flowers all blossom
The hummingbirds hum
We're all born equal under the same sun
Someone could be you and you could be someone
So do to each other as you would be done

[Chorus]
All of the boys they rock and roll
Cause they don't have to hate anymore
All of the girls, they’re all over the world
The sound of the four-to-the-floor
And everyone is part of the sum
Riches will rain on the poor
Say oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-whoa
It's a beautiful, beautiful world

You take the noise or you make the noise
So sing it like never before
Say oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-waoh
It's a beautiful, beautiful world
Beautiful, beautiful world

[Verse 1]
Take it by your silence
That I'm free to walk out the door
By the look in your eyes I can tell
You don't think I'll be back for more

[Pre-Chorus]
Try to think of the world
Where you could stay and these safe hands could go
Take your heart above the water
Wherever I choose to go

[Chorus]
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love

[Verse 2]
Even when you don't see me
And even when you don't hear
I'll be flying low below the sun
And you'll feel it all out here

[Chorus]
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love

[Bridge]
Standing here in silence
The world in front of me
Holding you in my hand
And seeing as you'd see

[Chorus]
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love

[Outro]
No freedom without love

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I can't describe
The way I feel, the way I feel
Oh, what a high
The way I feel, the way I feel
I just can't put in words
What I feel for you
The way I feel, the way I feel
It feels so good it hurts
What you do
The way I feel, the way I feel

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I feel like I'm in love
It's too much hype, just because
I feel like sayin' something that's for us
That defines what's in our hearts

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Dancin' and we're playin' around
You know you've got me
And then the feelin' comes rainin' down
All over my body
It tingles here, tingles there
Ooh, it tingles everywhere
That's why I've never found
The way to describe it

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I can't describe
The way I feel, the way I feel
Oh, what a high
The way I feel, the way I feel
I just can't put in words
What I feel for you
The way I feel, the way I feel
It feels so good it hurts
What you do
The way I feel, the way I feel

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
This feels right, as the buzz
And it don't describe when we uh
You feel my heartbeat thumpin' from your touch
In my life, you were my luck

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Dancin' and we're playin' around
You know you've got me
And then the feelin' comes rainin' down
All over my body
It tingles here, tingles there
Ooh, it tingles everywhere
That's why I've never found
The way to describe it

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I can't describe
The way I feel, the way I feel
Oh, what a high
The way I feel, the way I feel
I just can't put in words
What I feel for you
The way I feel, the way I feel
It feels so good it hurts
What you do
The way I feel, the way I feel

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
The morning
Hopefully at 10 o'clock we're both yawnin'
Right now
Think about it later, let's just both get down

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I can't describe
The way I feel, the way I feel
Oh, what a high
The way I feel, the way I feel
I just can't put in words
What I feel for you
The way I feel, the way I feel
It feels so good it hurts
What you do
The way I feel, the way I feel

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Dancin' and we're playin' around
You know you've got me
And then the feelin' comes rainin' down
All over my body
It tingles here, tingles there
Ooh, it tingles everywhere
That's why I've never found
The way to describe it

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
Ugh, you better ask for forgiveness now
Me and Miley about to rip shit down
And she bored of the misfits
You motherfuckers better hope that I can't fit this crown
And how did we get this sound?
Gotta say thanks to P Willy
Feel it gettin' island tsunami in Hawaii
And the beaches say hey 'cause the Preme Free Willy

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I can't describe
The way I feel, the way I feel
Oh, what a high
The way I feel, the way I feel
I just can't put in words
What I feel for you
The way I feel, the way I feel
It feels so good it hurts
What you do
The way I feel, the way I feel

[Verse 1]
It's not a question of love
'Cause our love has never changed
But all the little things keep piling up
And life keeps getting in the way

[Chorus]
Don't make it harder than it is
We both knew it'd come to this
Better now than in a year
More nights of tears and we both hate each other
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss?
And just let it go
And stop the madness before it explodes
Before it's out of our control
Let's stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes

[Verse 2]
Some things we won't understand
And we're both so tired of being misunderstood
So let's just turn and walk away
And hold on to what was good

[Chorus]
Don't make it harder than it is
We both knew it'd come to this
Better now than in a year
More nights of tears and we both hate each other
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss?
And just let it go
And stop the madness before it explodes
Before it's out of our control
Let's stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Before it explodes
Before it's out of our control
Let's stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes
Be next, Be NXT
BE Different, Be weird
Be huggers, Be fireflies
Be mohawks, Be beards

Like no one, Like nothing
Like whatever, Like this
Like Asuka, Like Charlotte
Like Becky, Like Bliss

No tapouts, No count outs
No 3-counts, No friends
No stopping, NOstalgia
No now with, No then

(Woooooooo)

One shot in one million
One versus all, One team
One Finn, One Balor
One demon, One king
Be hated, Be vacant

One word, Banks

Be heard, Be seen

Like Dolph, Like Dean

There's problems in the West, there's problems in the East, but
Will they ever stop fighting?
They'll say we are the best, high above the rest, but
Who gets 

[?]? Yeah
Don't wanna ask who is the mask
But can't let these issues just pass me
Don't want to cast doubt on the past but
These stories got me all laughing, 'cause
These modern times with all different kinds
Feel like "Are you ISIS, or Pisces?" Yeah
Men in the trucks say they give a fuck
But end of the day it's about prices

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static, and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
And though you're so close to me
You're still so distant
And I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you
You, now I see keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see even when I close my eyes

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
So even though you're close to me
You're still so distant
And I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you
You, now I see keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see even when I close my eyes

[Break]

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come, I
I can't wait to see tomorrow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
With you
You, now I see keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see even when I close my eyes

[Verse 1]
You said that we would always be
Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna to tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

[Post-Chorus]
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you
Without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

[Verse 2]
Now I'm running away, my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were here

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you (without you)
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you (without you)
I'm gonna to tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

[Post-Chorus]
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you
Without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

[Verse 1]
You said that we would always be
Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you

But they ain't got no niggas

[Bridge]
Put you in the crib, that wasn't enough

It's hard to reach you but if you'll see through
Skip through the sad parts
Forgive but never forget who you are
'Cause your smile, it just reminds me
How I can never put you behind me
Baby, you can ride shotgun
Or make love in the backseat
Make a difference, change my life and save me
Don't even know it
Make a difference, change my life and save me
Don't even know it

Your pocket on pancake, like they IHOPs

[Chorus: Young Thug & Gunna]
Diamonds doin' the Macarena (dan'-dan'-dance)
They doin' the Macarena (dan'-dan'-dance)

[DJ Dave]
Oh, okay, okay. I understand that. Okay, now, for uhh people who don't know, where'd you grow up at, man? Like, you know, what type of city. What area?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uhh, Compton. Straight Compton. No sides. No - just - niggas used to roll down Rosecrans, we used to be bumpin' that - pops used to be bumpin' that NWA shit. And, uh, shit - you know, "cruise down that street in my 6-4." We wasn't in no 6-4 though. We was in the brown dukie van and shit, same color as dukie

(laughs)

Know what I'm talkin' bout? But uh, yeah, we'd bump that shit all day

[DJ Dave]
Oh, okay. And what influenced you to become, you know, a rapper?

[Kendrick Lamar]
You know, the typical person would say, uh, "other rappers." I'mma be straight up honest, when I found out I was dope - Next question...

[Verse 1]
Turn around, open up that smile, I know it's buried down there deep
Look around, places change along with names I never heard before

[Pre-Chorus]
Trust in yourself, only from within
You trust in yourself to see it from the inside out, inside out

[Chorus]
But maybe you can try and go
Handle things all on your own
Holding on to something that is real
You need it like a common drug
Pass it down along with us
Trade in all your worries for something real

[Hook]
Safe and sound hide inside your inner secrets
All around 21, the age you're seeking
Keep it down you see it, you see it
Inside out, inside out

[Hook]
Safe and sound hide inside your inner secrets
All around 21, the age you're seeking
Keep it down you see it, you see it
Inside out, inside out

Safe and sound hide inside your inner secrets
All around 21, the age you're seeking
Keep it down you see it, you see it
Inside out, inside out

[Outro]
You need it like a common drug
Pass it down along with us
Trade in all your worries for something real

[DJ Dave]
Man, how long you been, how long you been rappin' for?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I been doin' this professionally, uh, four or five years. Professionally, uh, recording as a career; not on the block freestylin'...

[DJ Dave]
Y'all know, y'all know DJ Dave. Y'all know how it go, on the interviews and shit. I-I know we wil'in', but your boy's under the weather right now. But we gon' keep pushin'. Now-now-now the "Top Dawg" in your tee, like that...

[Kendrick]
Top Dawg, Jay Rock, nigga. Brotha-from-anotha. You know how we get down, slave in this motherfucka. Hey y'all niggas - y'all niggas better get - y'all motherfuckin' - stay in the studio, man. You know what I mean? Niggas be like, "Damn, Dot. Where you be at, nigga?" I be in - I be in the streets too. But nigga, we in this mothafuckin' lab all day, pumpin' it hard on you niggas. So when y'all hear this shit, and y'all be like, "Damn, them niggas be on some shit." Yeah, nigga, 'cause we in this mothafucka all day. We sleep in this mothafucka. I ain't lie when I said I sleep in the booth, nigga. Y'know what I mean? That's the big homie dude, though, nigga. We be in this mothafucka, slavin' on these shits man, you know what I mean? So... you know. It is what it is

[DJ Dave]
Hey, bro. Not strayin' away from your Jay Rock situation, again. Umm...

[DJ Dave]

[Kendrick]

[DJ Dave]
But, for the people that don't know, what's you and Jay Rock's relationship?

[Kendrick]
Uh, shit. Beyond the music shit, you know how most of these rap niggas be. You know, you know what I mean. Shit, we like - we like brothers in this shit. You know what I mean? We gon' - we discuss more than just music and politics and all that other shit that come with this industry shit. You know what I'm sayin'? You know what I'm sayin', so... I met him before the music shit, so, you know. Nigga, we like brothers, nigga. If I say that's my brother, nigga, you know what I mean?

[DJ Dave]
Everybody think they can rap, and everybody starting they record labels and everybody pushin' out they songs And if that's what y'all wanna do, go hard. But what separates our company from their company?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Consistency, man. You know, just, you know, perfect your craft, man. Try to block out all that other shit, man, just worry about your craft. Business, and the business will fall in place

Like my nigga J Black say:

"Change is coming"

[DJ Dave]
You have yo' shit be pre-prepared or ya' know what's your process? What's your songwriting process? You here to be- do you break out a pen and pad and go at it hard or how you do it then?

[Kendrick Lamar]
I- I hear the beat first, people. I hear the beat first and then I just go wherever the beat is tellin' me... just like all of the- ya' know all the other greats say

[DJ Dave]
What, no pen and no pad?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Maybe

[DJ Dave]
I mean but that seems kinda'.. you know like-

[Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah no pen, no pad then. (No pen no pad.)

[DJ Dave]
Aight yeah! but I mean aye I just- that's what I see. I mean but is that- does- does that- is that like the breaking point to- to really break you away from other artists that- you know that puts all the artists that don't use pen and a pads a different realm?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Naw, it just- it just a- a challenge, you know? You know Jay and Big ya' know were doin' it way back you know what I'm sayin'? It's just you know- I dunno, it's almost starting to become a cliché now, you know what I'm sayin'- I might fuckin back hop on the pen. Naw but uh (laughs) But yeah- but naw. You know. It's all- it's all- it's- it don't matter in- at the end of the day you know, whatever makes-

[Chorus]
Down by that place you met her
I hope that you feel better
No worries here on out to me it's all fine by me so
Don't think too much about it
I hope that you don't doubt it
Leave everything alone for me

[Hook]
Damn that old serenade makes me worry bout she said
Makes me worry bout she said
Damn that old serenade makes me worry bout she said
Makes me worry bout she said

[Chorus]
Down by that place you met her
I hope that you feel better
No worries here on out to me it's all fine by me so
Don't think too much about it
I hope that you don't doubt it
Leave everything alone for me

[Hook]
Damn that old serenade makes me worry bout she said
Makes me worry bout she said

[Bridge]
But when it's time for this you'll move along
A true romance can't last too long for me

[Chorus]
Down by that place you met her
I hope that you feel better
No worries here on out to me it's all fine by me so
Don't think too much about it
I hope that you don't doubt it
Leave everything alone for me

[Verse 1]
Talking bout girls, it's naturally empty
Our friends come and go, they make the most of me
I want you more and more but you do not know
Our time is running out, I can't seem to let you go

[Chorus]
Oh when you go I'll be around
It makes me bleed and cry when things get down
Oh when you go I'll be around
It hurts to know that I'll be on the ground

[Verse 2]
Dark was the sky tingly and cold
Honest is my lie, all my friends are animals
I can't remember when, I don't remember why
I fell inside your web as I looked into your eyes

[Chorus]
Oh when you go I'll be around
It makes me bleed and cry when things get down
Oh when you go I'll be around
It hurts to know that I'll be on the ground

[Outro]
Not alone
We're not alone
Girl of mine
Why do you leave me
But still I try
It's hard to be here
Not alone
We're not alone
Not alone
We're not alone
Why do you leave me
But still I try
It's hard to be here

[Verse 1]
I wouldn't pretend again so let's show off instead
Mine isn't a place of hate so let's turn it around
Don't she makes you don't

Take me from me
Save me from you

[Verse 2]
I can't comprehend your head but don't ever think twice
She doesn't believe in friends but who really knows

[Verse 3]
I wouldn't pretend again so let's show off instead
He wasn't believable but who really knows

But who really knows

Don't change your mind
Who really knows

[Verse 1]
An invitation to move away from
To crawl back inside back where we came from
But everyone's fine

[Verse 2]
A stormy outlook it keeps on coming but I close my eyes
Don't know the difference between reality and what's inside
But everyone's fine

[Chorus]
Fine as far as I know
And everyone's right right as far as I know
And everyone's fine
Fine as far as I know
Far as I know
Far as I know

[Chorus]
But everyone's fine
Fine as far as I know
And everyone's right right as far as I know
And everyone's fine
Fine as far as I know
Far as I know
Far as I know

[Intro]
"Because if I've lost my mind, you're really the only person that understands me, so either you're real, or you're an extension of myself, cause you agree with me."

"If you've lost everything you've got, what are you gonna do man?"

"You've just got to keep moving forward."

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
You drive a classic Mustang
The ones with the stock wheels you didn't change
Plus it has a new system that bangs
It makes me say “daaang”
Will you take me for a spin?
In your classic Mustang
Make your driveway look like a picture frame
Plus you got that nice leather with no stains
Smell like "daaang"
Will you take me for a spin?
Beep beep

[Verse 1]
What is just happening?
Who is this guy?
I think he really turns me on
Everything is classic, no need to ask why
Where do I sign? I'm gone

Like where was he raised?
What kind of game he plays?
Well, none would be my choice
I ask him 'bout his swagger
He didn't knew what that was
He said it sounds like swagger is for boys

[Pre-Chorus]
She made my drives
My daddy likes you
You make me feel alive
My daddy likes you
I'd never say goodbye
My daddy likes you
My daddy likes you
My daddy likes you

So why did you throw a fit?
My daddy likes you
You cursed a little bit
My daddy likes you
I still put up with your shit
But my daddy likes you
My daddy likes you
My daddy likes you

[Chorus]
You drive a classic Mustang
The ones with the stock wheels you didn't change
Plus it has a new system that bangs
It makes me say “daaang”
Will you take me for a spin?
In your classic Mustang
Make your driveway look like a picture frame
Plus you got that nice leather with no stains
Smell like daaang
Will you take me for a spin?
Beep beep

[Verse 2]
Hard to imagine it
We build up all this passion
We found baby is what I am on
Cruising all and crashing
I can't believe is lasting
I think it really turns me on
Nothing too dramatic
The love is gymnastics i'm fliping
Baby yeah I'm gone
Dancing 'till the morning
Lightning up and pouring
And trust me you ain't like other boys

[Pre-Chorus]
My daddy likes you
You make me feel alive
My daddy likes you
I'd never say goodbye
My daddy likes you
My daddy likes you
My daddy likes you

So why did you throw a fit?
My daddy likes you
You cursed a little bit
My daddy likes you
I still put up with your shit
But my daddy likes you
My daddy likes you
My daddy likes you

[Chorus]
You drive a classic Mustang
The ones with the stock wheels you didn't change
Plus it has a new system that bangs
It makes me say “daaang”
Will you take me for a spin?
In your classic Mustang
Make your driveway look like a picture frame
Plus you got that nice leather with no stains
Smell like daaang
Will you take me for a spin?
Beep beep

[Verse 1]
No one has a heven or hell to put me through
But you do
No fate could fill me up or drug could keep me high
Like you do
No one else can understand it all I ever wanted
Was you too
If the world stops caring all that matters to me is
If you do

[Verse 2]
No one makes me wanna believe in anything
But you do
All I know is I can close my eyes and I can fall right
Into you

[Verse 3]
Oh I never wanna miss you baby
I hate we have to die one day
I'd hold my breath to die together
As long as forever is with you you

[Intro]
Light up the place

[Verse 1]
I see you there now
Smoking from your unseen fire
Walk in the place
Then the darkness erase

[Pre-Chorus]
You need a beat to help you light it up
I made a beat to help you light it up
You need a beat to make you light it up

[Chorus 1]
Light up the place
Get lit with it, what, you can't get with it?
This is my room, this is my tool
This is my rule
Get fly with it, all up in the sky with it
Can't see me climb, come meet me, ah
Get lit
Miami, we like to party
We smart and naughty and we get lit
My people, good before evil
Big Will the sequel 'bout to get lit
This track is my kinda wave
If you're on the same page, come and get lit
'Cause we ain't stopping till we, light up the place

[Post-Chorus]
We ain't party Megatrons
We transform and get lit
We ain't party Megatrons
We transform and get lit
We ain't party Megatrons
We transform and get lit
We ain't party Megatrons
We (light up the place)

[Verse 2]
Light up the place
I'm coming through with the fire that's letting you now
The light inside of me ether and it's gonna blow
All of my people are lit so don't get in our way
It's the kind of celebrity we need today
The force around me is strong, my light been burning long
I do this for, I do this for y'all
My alchemy is strong, make it right from wrong
Man, I do this for y'all

[Pre-Chorus]
You need a beat to help you light it up
I made a beat to help you light it up
You need a beat to make you light it up

[Chorus 2]
Light up the place
Get lit
Get lit
Get lit
Get lit
Light up the place
Waiting on the world
To find out that we have no clue
The symptoms that you show
So crafted by your false ego and

You sit back in your chair
You tell me that it's not fair
Complain about your own life
But you're just messed up on the inside

And you, you said that you cared
But I surely see that you're unaware and now
You're too old to switch sides
And I see yours but you don't see mine

Take a seat next to the guy
It's been years since his heart went dry
Makes him feel full
Shuts you down to just be fine

While you sit back in your chair
You're picking at your gray hairs
Complain about your own life
How you're messed up on the inside
And you You said that you cared
But I surely see that you're unaware and now
You're too old to switch sides
And I see yours but you don't see mine

And you..
I would drive up and down the 405, just to hold your hand at night
I feel your heart burn in mine, mine might be in yours in time

I know how you get sometimes, getting caught up in the wrong and right
I think you know that the feeling's strong, cause I'm talking bout you all fucking day long

And it's you
You are the one to hold
All I can do
Is wish you didn't play my mind

I know how you get sometimes, getting caught up in the wrong and right
But it's you, oh no

I could give up all of my precious time, if maybe you could give me a try
I know you sent me 20 signals to go, but you could've left many hours ago

Get crazy when you're walking by, but you never look and turn your eyes
And i hear what your funny friends say, shouldn't be giving me the light of day

Still it's you
You are the one to hold
All I can do
Is wish for things to go my way
I know how you get sometimes, getting caught up in the wrong and right
But it's you
That lady in the sky is a full moon singing white
Tall shadow steps to cast while I’m walking round the whole night
Won’t be too scared to fall, yeah I’ll probably just float
You know that cold light’s just a reflection of the sun glow

There’s something calling out in the breeze where I do run
I’ll exit that vignette and I’ll step into a new one
One moment there then suddenly I’m carried off, the breeze is gone

My morning star broke up
I’m shadowboxing angel dust
Float my glory cloud back to the sky
And I cry, “there is a place for us”
But waking up this seems undone
And leaves me alone and wondering why

She’s looking through the glass at a white face passing by
This memories got hands that I’ll kiss until the sun shines
My shadow grows and then disappears into the night
Want to surround myself want to feel it like the last time
There’s something calling out and it finally came through
Last night that dream I had reoccurs as they are known to
What I thought was is not what is, it’s just a face that I once knew

My morning star broke up
I’m shadowboxing angle dust
Float my glory cloud back to the sky
And I cry, “there is a place for us”
But waking up this seems undone
And leaves me alone and wondering why

[Verse 1]
I don't know if you can take it
I know you want to see me naked
I just want to be your baby
But I can't be around you

[Chorus]
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts

[Verse 2]
I hope you know I'm for the taking
Hope you know this cookie's baking
I just want to be your baby
But I can't be around you

[Chorus]
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts

[Chorus]
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
The comedy of man starts like this
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips
And so Nature, she divines this alternative
We emerged half-formed and hope that whoever greets us on the other end
Is kind enough, oh, to fill us in
And, babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever since

Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to address
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron deficient
So somebody's got to go kill something while I look after the kids
I'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this thing its milk?
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we can switch
Oh, it's hard not to fall in love with something so helpless
Oh, ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this
C'mon, boys

Oh comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy
Just waiting until the part where they start to believe
They're at the center of everything
And some all-powerful being endowed this horror show with meaning
Oh comedy
Their religions are the best
They worship themselves yet they're totally obsessed
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks, these unbelievable outfits
And they get terribly upset
When you question their sacred texts
Written by woman-hating epileptics

Their languages just serve to confuse them
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring
And hand out prizes when someone patents the cure
Where did they find these goons they elected to rule them?
What makes these clowns they idolize so remarkable?
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning some new gods
So they can go on being godless animals

Oh comedy, oh their illusions they have no choice but to believe
Their horizons that just forever recede
And how's this for irony, their idea of being free is a prison of beliefs
That they never ever have to leave

Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman would conceive!
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive is the struggle to survive
But the only thing that they request is something to numb the pain with
Until there's nothing human left
Just random matter suspended in the dark
Well I hate to say it, but each other's all we've got

[SNippet]

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough to know
When it's time
Time to let go
Sing

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
All I really want (Yeah)
Is to be happy (Oh yeah)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy (I wanna be happy, yeah)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I asked for a sign from the sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me, but when
You think you're in love, you only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you, and you for me

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
All I really want
Is to be happy (I wanna be happy)

It would be so sweet

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Life is too short to be tryin' to play some games
Now take some time and think about

Why must it be this way?
Why do you have to play with my mind all the time?
Help me sing it

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
All I really want
Is to be happy (Help me sing it)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet (All I want is to be...)
All I really want
Is to be happy (...happy)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
(I don't wanna have to worry 'bout nothin' no more, no no)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet (I wanna be happy, yeah)
All I really want
Is to be happy (I wanna be happy, yeah yeah)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
(All I really want is for me to be happy)
All I really want
Is to be happy
(All I really want is for me to be happy)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
(All I really want is for me to be happy)
All I really want
Is to be happy
(All I really want is for me to be happy)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

[Interlude: Puff Daddy]
Remix

[Verse 3: Keith Murray + (Puff Daddy ad-libs)]
Yo, my style is major flavor
And my 9 be on my hip like my skypager (That's right)
All I really wanna do is be happy
And take it to the streets and puff a little bombazee
And have mad properties like Ali Baba and the 40 thieves
'Cause nobody makes songs like these (Unh-uh) — please
I come with complexity poetry at multiple degrees on phony MC's (Yeah)
And my Squad is Def, they don't hear nothin'
And my tank is on 'F', and that's not for frontin'
I spread love like the AIDS virus
Laughing at rappers and biters who try this
My purpose is to let all the bull(shit) surface
And seal and kill it with a deadly kiss
Even though Keith Murray's style is scrappy and nappy
All I wanna do is be happy (Be happy)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige + (Puff Daddy ad-libs)]
All I really want
Is to be happy (Yeah)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet (Rock on)
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want (Say what?)
Is to be happy (Rock on)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet (Remix)
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet (Come on)

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And now it's all right, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try, to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking, people
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
We will get low

[Verse 2]
Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancing man, and I just can't lose
You know it's alright, it's OK
I'll live to see another day
We can try, to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking, people

Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
Well you may be a lover but you ain’t no dancer

You all will have read that, uh, Dave Dee is no longer with us. But Mickey and Tich and I would just like to carry on the good work that's always gone down in number two

[Verse 1]
All through the day
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
All through the night
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Now they’re frightened of leaving it
Everyone’s weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All through the day, I me mine

[Chorus]
I-I-me-me-mine, I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine, I-I-me-me-mine

[Verse 2]
All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
No one’s frightened of playing it
Everyone’s saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through your life, I me mine
And I remember when I met him, it was so clear that
he was the only one for me.
We both knew it, right away.
And as the years went on, things got more difficult -
we were faced with more challenges.
I begged him to stay.
Try to remember what we had at the beginning.

He was charismatic, magnetic, electric and everybody knew it.
When he walked in every woman's head turned, everyone stood up to talk to him.
He was like this hybrid, this mix of a man who couldn't contain himself.
I always got the sense that he became torn between being a good person and missing out on all of the opportunities that life could
offer a man as magnificent as him.

And in that way I understood him
and I loved him.
I loved him, I loved him, I loved him.
And I still love him.
I love him.

Coming up short is nothing new
People like me people like you
Trying to win in this world but

But now I know I'm better better off without you

Alright, alright

By my side
Somebody who knows

I used to think that you would be the only one
But now I know I'm better better off without you

Gorgeous

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

You're so gorgeous

At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)

Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone
Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)

And even at the bottom of the sea

Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed

[Verse 2]
Lonely, only nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Feel me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me
Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, baby, you know that I'll always be in love
With you, right 'til the end

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

[Intro: Kid Capri]
Ladies and gentleman, welcome to the area. This is another east coast, west coast event. My name is the Kid Capri. I got my man right here, we slappin' vibe and shit. You know who I'm talking about! Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg!!

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I'm feeling the dough, and now I'm feeling the real
Stunning with the stunner, man, I'm one in a mil
Hold on to my hands while we walk up this hill
There's a mountain and a fountain but the waters are still
Walk in the light but I'm changing drill
Me and my homies gangbang on the field
Take a knee, make a G, follow protocol
Can't you see us kick, Capri?
Back with the Wonder Dog
Not the underdog, can't you understand?
Please believe me, I'm with Stevie
Mental wonderland
Or maybe Michael Jackson
Pure satisfaction
Rest in pussy, Hugh Hef
Playboy Mansion
Been a foe, mental fold
Split the difference punk bitch
You on a centerfold
One is soul, never told, forever G
C'est la vie, that's me

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Tell me what you got for me
I'm getting on the good foot
And see I'm only here to rock wit ya
They tell me that's a good look
See, I'ma keep doing me, 'cause that's all I know
So knick-knack, paddy-wack, Kid Capri and Snoop is back
We do it just it just like this that back (back)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
They tried to run a game on a nigga
Word to P.E, shame on a nigga
I never paid attention
Did I forget to mention
I started up cooking up the cavi in the kitchen
Then I graduated, matter of fact I made it
Reinstated but still kept it gang related
I traveled the globe, private jets, and Versace robes
Penthouse suites, what about phony hoes?
Tanqueray glasses, smoke fills the air
And hoes with fat asses playing truth or dare
No bizaar, what a lovely pair
And they all came here just to fuck wit a player
Anytime I wanna jam, shit I'm runnin' through these hoes
Like a pack at the Coliseum
Marcus Allen, Bo Jackson, and Bo Diddley
If you know like I know, you come and fuck wit me, fo' real

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Tell me what you got for me
I'm getting on the good foot
And see I'm only here to rock wit ya
They tell me that's a good look
See, I'ma keep doing me, 'cause that's all I know
So knick-knack, paddy-wack, Kid Capri and Snoop is back
We do it just it just like this that back (back)

[Outro: Kid Capri]
And that's just how the story goes
Another Kid Capri slapper
Snoop Dogg
Worldwide
Good foot, on a good foot
Snoop, we did it again, playboy
Out

[Chorus]
None of my niggas (none of mine niggas)
None of my niggas snitchin' (none of mine niggas snitchin')
None of my niggas (all of my niggas)
All of my niggas shooters (all of my niggas shooters)
None of mine niggas (none of mine niggas)
None of mine niggas tellin' (none of mine niggas tellin')
All of my niggas (all of my niggas)
All of my niggas fellas (all of my niggas fellas)
Throw bands, throw, nigga
I don't know who shot
Somebody got shot, nigga, I don't know did it (I don't know did it)
None of mine niggas (none of mine niggas)
None of mine niggas snitchin' (none of mine niggas snitchin')
All of my niggas (all of my niggas)
All of my niggas shooters (all of my niggas shooters)

[Verse 1]
None my niggas ever snitched on a nigga
Ever told on a nigga but we stole on a nigga
Pop two shots for the worst lockdown
'Cause the shit's getting hot on the block right now
A lotta niggas don't know, bust with the 44
Took his whole stack, now back with the coco
Cookin' it up, peepin', lookin' and cookin' it up
I plan for the worst, stick the bitch up with the bands in the purse
Then I get away, no one seen a thing
Shut your mouth or kiss the beam
Race supreme like a New York nigga
Get you clipped off, I'm a New York nigga
Wall renounce, bust you down
Without a sound, that's how I get down
And dirty, fly 'round with it, birdy
Touch my first 25 mill' when I turn 30
Ya heard me? And I'm still gettin' money homie
Nigga don't run up on me
'Cause that'll be
Take ten steps and battle me
Turn, face and draw
All you saw was holopoints at yo' motherfuckin' jaw

[Chorus]
None of my niggas (none of mine niggas)
None of my niggas snitchin' (none of mine niggas snitchin')
All of my niggas (all of my niggas)
All of my niggas shooters (all of my niggas shooters)
None of mine niggas (none of mine niggas)
None of mine niggas tellin' (none of mine niggas tellin')
All of my niggas (all of my niggas)
All of my niggas fellas (all of my niggas fellas)
Throw bands, throw, nigga
I don't know who shot (I don't know who shot)
Somebody got shot, nigga, I don't know did it (I don't know did it)
None of my niggas (none of mine niggas)
None of my niggas snitchin' (none of mine niggas snitchin')
All of my niggas (all of my niggas)
All of my niggas shooters (all of my niggas shooters)

[Verse 2]
Nigga talkin' shit, got shot in his motherfuckin' face
They ask me what I saw, I ain't seen a motherfuckin' thang
What I look like, news nigga?
Moved nigga? Used nigga?
Hoes, the game's to be sold
Not to be told, "for once to behold."
Game with aggression, oppression
Life is a lesson
Don't fuck with Cuz, if he thinkin', talkin' or guessin' (snitch)
Close your trap, in my area, we'll bust yo' gap
Hold you back from takin' a stand
Being a bitch and pointin' out your mans
That's some hoe shit we don't fuck with
This ain't made for all
Nigga, not y'all, just my dawgs
The game bang-related, non-negotiated
Real as fuck, the bitch niggas hate it, so what?
Blaze up, pour up, know what?
We gettin' fucked up
For all the real niggas worldwide, that ain't never snitch
Think that a bitch?

[Chorus]
None of my niggas (none of mine niggas)
None of my niggas snitchin' (none of mine niggas snitchin')
All of my niggas (all of my niggas)
All of my niggas shooters (all of my niggas shooters)
None of my niggas (none of mine niggas)
None of my niggas tellin' (none of mine niggas tellin')
All of my niggas (all of my niggas)
All of my niggas fellas (all of my niggas fellas)
Throw bands, throw, nigga
I don't know who shot (who? who?)
Somebody got shot, nigga, I don't know did it (I don't know did it)
None of my niggas (none of mine niggas)
None of my niggas snitchin' (none of mine niggas snitchin')
All of my niggas (all of my niggas)
All of my niggas shooters (all of my niggas shooters)

[Outro]
Shooters, shooters, shooters

[Chorus: October London]
Girl what you tripping for
I don't care 'bout these hoes
I ain't still living in the fast lane
Baby, I've changed a lot
I still deserve a shot
I still want you to have my last name

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I gave it to you cause you gotta have it
The Broadus family is so magic
T-Bone, You the baddest
Meet the one of us
Glad us had us ring in mind
I'm 'bout to sing a line
I'm all about you when I'm doing my time
With you on my mind
Rock around a clock, Jay and Beyonce
Michelle and Barack, all of the above
This is black love at its purest
Baby we done been through the forest
I'm talking about growing old with you
Sitting on the porch
Going through storage looking through old photos
When I used to rock the Death Row logo
And you was right there, you still here
So all that arguing, fighting
Let's toast to the night and I need you in my life
And and

[Chorus: October London]
Girl what you tripping for
I don't care 'bout these hoes
I ain't still living in the fast lane
Baby, I've changed a lot
I still deserve a shot
I still want you to have my last name

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I don't think I want to be with no one else but you
Cause you make my life so complete
And that's just how I feel right now for you
So you can take these words as what I say
What I mean
Don't think I'm playing, I'm saying it's truth
This is a lil' something from me to you
Flashy back
Trying to get the passion back
First girl I ever fell in love with
On some East Side long beach dove shit
You wouldn't understand it, even if I told you
Baby boo, nigga really love you
As clear as the sky is blue
Ain't nobody in this whole world ride for Snoop, but you
You're so, so

[Chorus: October London]
Girl what you tripping for
I don't care 'bout these hoes
I ain't still living in the fast lane
Baby, I've changed a lot
I still deserve a shot
I still want you to have my last name
(No love no love no no no no)
I still want you to have my last name
(Last name last name last name)

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yo, this shit feel like Sports Center
Nothing but highlights, some ballers
Jumping out the mother fucking gym
So Designer Flow
It's your uncle Snoop Dogg
Let me show you how we keep the trap jumpin' on the West Side
The best side

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
McDonald's all American
There's really no comparing it
I play some D and pop a three and fly up in the air again
First-round draft pick came in with this rap shit
Get a lot of moolah to keep you a bad bitch
Those were the rules, I aimed for the full pie
Took a slice and now I'm popping at the bull's eye
I'm equivalent to excellence
With my weaponry, I'm stepping while I'm rapping it
Now could I should I would I do things your way
And end up dead or in jail? My nigga no way
It's like some good hot head with no foreplay
I won't be caught so I cut you like I'm OJ
Kingpin Nietzche
Designer Flow hand me the ball young dawg I need a heat check
Reset, he wet
Dikembe Mutombo, that we shit
Get reject, we all stars baby
So you never get what we get

[Designer Flow]

[Verse 2: Designer Flow]
Nowadays nigga killing over nothing
Rep a gang cause they wanna be part of something
I been in my own lane since I was a youngin'
Whole family had a bag, I'm the plug's cousin
But I found my own plug, the ain't front me nothin
But my nigga Black did give me that Gucci belt (black)
This where I put my heat I never leave it on the shelf (strapped)
My heart froze I don't ever leave it on my sleeves (nah)
I got hoes I ain't never met a bitch I need
So when she tell me that she leaving i'm a let her leave
My aroma in her room ain't gon' let her breathe
Got it smelling like some money and a couple g's
It's on record I could smash who I want
Put this on record never asked for a front
Put this on record twenty bands this month
Put this on record, put this on record

[Chorus]
Trap jumping like a ball player
Trap jumping trap jumping like

[Verse 3: Designer Flow]
In the trap I do my best to help em out
And all some niggas ever did was fuck up the count
And all some niggas ever did was run they fucking mouth
Had to keep it moving had to keep my head up
Had to re-up and recoup to get my bread up
Had to take a nigga boo and put her legs up
Her nigga probably do the same with my main thing
Still ride with the flag for the gang gang
I'm a real trap nigga, I don't gang bang
I done been across the map with the propane
They'll point a nigga out get your old man
Put the noodle in her mouth like the low mein
Kill a nigga with a strap like a gay bitch
Made a band in a minute off 8 sips
Tried to walk away from trapping but I can't quit

[Chorus]
Trap jumping like a ball player
Trap jumping trap jumping like
Trap jumping like
Trap jumping like a ball player
Trap jumping trap jumping like

Trap jumping like a ball player

They say holla at a real one in the trap
All across the map sports center
Trap jumping like

Why do fools fall in love?
Why do birds sing so gay?
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?

Oh, love is a losing game
Love can be a shame
I know of a fool you see
For that fool is me
Tell me why, why, why
Tell me why

Why do birds sing so gay?
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love?
Oh, why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?
Why does my heart skip a crazy beat?
And before I know, it will reach defeat
Tell my why, oh why, oh why, why do they fall in love?
Oh, why do fools fall in love?
You're a thousand miles away
But I still have your love to remember you by, baby
And oh, my darling, dry your eyes
Daddy's coming home soon

On my knees every day
All I do is pray, baby, just for you
Hope you always want me too
Daddy's coming home soon

It may be on a Sunday morning
It may be on a Tuesday afternoon
But no matter what the day is
I'm going to make it my business to get home soon

You're a thousand miles away
Oh, but I still have your love to remember you by
And oh, my darling, dry your eyes, baby
Daddy's coming home soon
Oh yeah, daddy’s coming home soon
Stay, ohhhhh, just a little bit longer
Please, please, please, tell me that you're going to, yeah
Well, your daddy don't mind, and your mommy don't mind
If we have another dance, yeah, just one more, one more time

Oh, won't you stay, just a little bit longer
Please let me hear, hear you say you will (say you will)
Oh girl, won't you place your sweet lips to mi-i-i-i-i-i-ine
Won't you say that you love me all of the time

I just want you to (stay)
Oh woah woah woah just a little bit longer, oh yeah

Come on, come on, come on and (stay)
Stay, come on, come on, come on and stay
Come on, come on, come on and (stay)
Come on, come on, come on and (stay)
Come on, come on, come on and (stay)
My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
(Sha bop sha bop…)

Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you, dear
(Sha bop sha bop…)

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
(Sha bop sha bop…)

You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you
(Sha bop sha bop…)
When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face (Up on the roof)
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space (Up on the roof)

On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there, the world below can't bother me
Let me tell you now

When I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet (Up on the roof)
I get away from the hustling crowd
And all that rat race noise down in the street (Up on the roof)

On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Let's go up on the roof (Up on the roof)

At night, the stars put on a show for free
And darling, you can share it all with me
I keep-a tellin’ you that right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble-free (Up on the roof)
And if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two up on the roof (Up on the roof)

Up on the roof (Up on the roof)
Ah, come on, baby (Up on the roof)
Ah, come on, honey (Up on the roof)
Ah, come on, baby (Up on the roof)
Ah, come on, honey (Up on the roof)
Up on the roof (Up on the roof)
Folks say that you found someone new
To do the things I used to do for you
Just call my name, I'm not ashamed
And I'll come running back to you

Can't sleep at night, I can't eat a bite
When you were mine I didn't treat you right
Just call my name, I know, I know I'm not ashamed
And I'll come running back to you

Just like a king, I've lost everything
I sit all alone on my throne
And I've got my pride, but deep down inside
I'm yours and yours alone

I try to forget, have no regrets
This love of ours could always start anew
Just call my name, I know I'm not ashamed
I'll come running back to you

Just like a king I've lost everything
And I stood all alone on my throne
I've got my pride, but deep down inside
I'm yours and yours alone
I try to forget, have no regrets
This love of ours could always start anew
Just call my name
I know, I know, I know I'm not ashamed
I'll come running back to you

I’ll be (running)
Tell you I’ll be (running)
Running (running)
Running, I’ll be (running)
Running, running, I’ll be (running)
Running, I’ll be (running)
Running (I’ll be running)
Said I’ll be running (back) back (to you)
Oh, I’ll be (running)
Running (running)
Running, running, I’ll be (I’ll be running)
Running, yeah (running)
Oh, I’ll be running, oh yeah (I’ll be running)
Running, running, oh, running (running)
Oh, I’ll be (running) running (back) back (to you) to you, yeah

[Verse 1]
You don't remember me
But I remember you
Twas' not so long ago
You broke my heart in two

[Chorus]
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you (Oooh, oooh)
You (Oooh, oooh)

[Verse 2]
If we could start anew
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate

[Chorus]
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you (Oooh, oooh)
You (Oooh, oooh)

[Bridge]
Oh, love is not a gadget
And love is not a toy
When you find the one you love
She'll fill your heart with joy

[Verse 3]
If we could start anew
I wouldn't hesitate, no
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate

[Chorus]
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you (Oooh, oooh)
You (Oooh, oooh)
Caused by you (Oooh, oooh)
You (Oooh, oooh)
Hey, caused by you
Caused by you (Oooh, oooh)
You (Oooh, oooh)
Caused by you

I don’t know what else to tell you, but I
Because of love are the tears that I cry
Caused by you
Caused by you, hey
You know you did it, but I’ll take you right back
So we can start this thing all over again
Caused by you (Oooh, oooh)
You (Oooh, oooh)
Caused by you (Oooh, oooh)
You (Oooh, oooh)

[Wanya Morris]
I want a Sunday kind of love
A love that lasts past Saturday night
And I wanna know that it’s more than love at first sight
‘Cause I want a Sunday kind of love
Oh, somebody help me sing it

[Brian McKnight]
I want a, a love that’s on the square
Can’t seem to find somebody
Someone to care
And I’m on a lonely road
That leads to nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love
(Sunday kind of love)

[Shawn Stockman + Brian McKnight]
I do my Sunday dreaming (dreaming)
And all my Sunday scheming (scheming)
Every minute, every hour, every day
Oh, I’m hoping to discover
A certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

[Boyz II Men + Brian McKnight]
My arms need someone, someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
A love for all my life to have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love, oh
Oh yeah

I don’t want a Monday, or no Tuesday
I don’t want no Wednesday
I don’t want no Thursday, Friday
I don’t want no Saturday love
I want that Sunday kind of love

That Sunday kind of love
Oh, Sunday kind of love
Anyone

You can blame me
Try to shame me
And still I'll care for you
You can run around
And even put me down
Still I'll be there for you

The world
May think I'm foolish
But they can't see you like I can
Oh, but anyone
Who knows what love is
Will understand

Anyone (Anyone)
Anyone (Anyone)
Anyone
Anyone
Anyone

[Amber Riley]
I just feel so sorry (anyone)
For the ones who pity me
(Anyone) 'Cause they just don't know
(Anyone) No, they don't what happiness and true love can be

I know to ever let you go
Oh, it's more than I, than I could ever stand
Oh, but anyone who knows what love is, honey
Will understand
Oh, they don’t understand

[Wanya Morris + Amber Riley]
I understand, and I believe
They may think I’m foolish, baby
They don’t understand, no
I don’t think they hear us, baby
They don’t hear us, baby
They don’t know about our love, no, no
Not a better love

[Verse 1]
I call her sugar pie
She’s a little diamond in the rough to me
How do I make her mine?
I’ve been looking for the right recipe
She’s heard a lot of things
Well, but nothing that she should ever take to heart
I give up everything just so she can know who I really want

[Pre-Chorus]
See this girl’s got a smile that just keeps brightening up the day
But this girl just thinks that every single guy’s the same

[Chorus]
She thinks I’m a ladies man, but I’m just a gentleman
‘Cause I couldn’t be the one to ever break her heart
I give her the best of me
Get rid of the rest of me
‘Cause I couldn’t be the one to ever break her heart
Oh, I’ll be the ladies man
Oh, I’ll be the ladies man
I’ll be the ladies man
I’ll be the ladies man

[Verse 2]
I just wanna take her out (Take her out)
Maybe buy her dinner at her favorite place
So she’ll know what I’m about
Wanna kiss the dimples right off her face

Hey, ‘cause this one’s got a hold of me
But I can’t help but let it be
Oh, why (Oh, why) Oh, why can’t she see
This girl got a smile that just keeps brightening up the day
This girl, she thinks that every single guy’s the same

[Chorus]
She thinks I’m a ladies man, but I’m just a gentleman
‘Cause I couldn’t be the one to ever break her heart
I’ll give her the best of me
Get rid of the rest of me
‘Cause I couldn’t be the one to ever break her heart
Oh, I’ll be the ladies man
Oh, I’ll be the ladies man
Oh, I’ll be the ladies man
Oh, I’ll be the ladies man

[Bridge]
See, I’d give anything just to steal one kiss
And I’d do anything just to be the one she’s with
‘Cause all I do is think of her
I just gotta have this girl
And I just can’t let her slip away

[Chorus]
She thinks I’m a ladies man, but I’m just a gentleman
And I couldn’t be the one to ever break her heart, oh
I give her the best of me
Get rid of the rest of me
‘Cause I couldn’t be the one to ever break her heart
Oh, I’ll be the ladies man
I’ll be the ladies man
I’ll be the ladies man
Oh, I’ll be the ladies man

[Intro]
Oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Gave you my love and my affection all of the time
Thought you were the one
Thought you were the one, but you had to lie
Up in my house, straight to my face
Looking right through my eyes
Thought you were the one
Thought you were the one, but you had to lie
So...

[Chorus]
I'ma walk away, like a champion
Hold my head up high, like I'm on that throne
Made a mess of me in front of everyone
I'm done
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah
I'ma walk away, like a champion
I'm much better off, now I'm on my own
Made a mess of me in front of everyone

[Post-Chorus]
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah

[Verse 2]
Four in the morning
Got a groupie calling your phone
Thought I was the one
Thought I was the one, but I'm not alone
Gave you forgiveness
Gave you one thousand second chances
Thought I was the one
Thought I was the one, now I'm going home

[Chorus]
I'ma walk away, like a champion
Hold my head up high, like I'm on that throne
Made a mess of me in front of everyone
I'm done
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah
I'ma walk away, like a champion
I'm much better off, now I'm on my own
Made a mess of me in front of everyone

I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah

[Bridge]
You were everything, everything to me
I do, anything, anything to be right there
Kissing and touching your body
Laying side by side
My house, watching, watching a movie
You be texting with one of your groupies
Gave you nothing nothing you've ever seen
But you let the love die, so...

[Chorus]
I'ma walk away, like a champion
Hold my head up high, like I'm on that throne
Made a mess of me in front of everyone
I'm done
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah
I'ma walk away, like a champion
I'm much better off, now I'm on my own
Made a mess of me in front of everyone
I'm done
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah

Get that ass on the floor
Ladies put your lipstick up
Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hating I get money
Then I double up tonkers

I keep having dreams that make me cry
Oh, what am I supposed to do?
It's getting harder to be close to you
I know you try

[Chorus]
What if you change?
And look at me like I'm a stranger?
Oh, what if I don't change?
What if I feel like this forever, is forever now?
Please show me how to

I keep doing things that'll push you out again
I'm coming undone and I don't know why
No you shouldn't lie, no you shouldn't lie
Now it's getting harder to try

[Chorus]
What if you change?
And look at me like I'm a stranger?
Oh, what if I don't change?
What if I feel like this forever, is forever now?
Please show me how to change
What if you see me as a stranger?
Oh, what if I don't change?
What if I feel like this forever, is forever now?
Please show me how to change

[Outro]
I dream of sweat dripping around my neck
And I felt upset but I didn't know why
A thousand miles of road stretched from east to west
I tried to follow your voice but I didn't know how
Where are you now? (I can't catch my breath)
I dream of sweat dripping around my neck
And I felt upset but I didn't know why
There's too much road stretched (I can't catch my breath)
I wanna follow your voice but I don't know how, I didn't know how
I dream of sweat dripping around my neck
I dream of sweat dripping around my neck
I dream of sweat dripping around my neck
I dream of sweat dripping

[Verse 1]
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
’Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Verse 2]
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I’m spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothin' about

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha...

[Post-Chorus]
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

[Bridge]
Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
’Cause I don’t want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Outro]
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

[Verse 1]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus]
Don’t read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you’re turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 2]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it’s hard or it’s wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Bridge]
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Verse 3]
There’s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Outro]
Please don't ever become a stranger
(To the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Please don't ever become a stranger
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(I will hold on to you)

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (Woah, woah, woah)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 1: Future]
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type (You my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don’t wanna see
I don’t wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don’t wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Future, & Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Part I]

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
I can't make no dinner, but a nigga whip the breakfast
We can smoke, we can fuck, what's your preference?
Wrote to Santa just to put you on my sex list
You got that million dollar on at the Craigslist
Aw yeah, and you know who I am
All these bitches in the crib, they just go there to dance
And I'm in and out the bank like I go there to scam
We can go to Miami, girl, we can go get some tan, oh yeah
Liquor poured up, women called up, fuck it all up, oh yeah
In the condo, you know how it go, give it up slow

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
48 floors, that's the way we going
Open up the Wraith doors, oh yeah
And don't make me wait for ya
Pussy so good, I should have to pay for it, oh yeah
48 floors, that's the way we going
Open up the Wraith doors, oh yeah
And don't make me wait for ya
Pussy so good, I should have to pay for it, yeah
So good, I should have to pay for it

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Saved you under peach emojis in my contact
So when you hit me, you remind me just to call back
Tell them niggas like the Summer coming, fall back
She cashing out at 4 A.M., I'm 'bout to fall in, okay
We found love in the club, what you call that?
We wound up in the tub, and I bossed that
We still fuckin' on the bed, to the left, Tory
We still got this shit lit, 48 floors

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
48 floors, that's the way we going
Open up the Wraith doors, oh yeah
And don't make me wait for ya
Pussy so good, I should have to pay for it, oh yeah
48 floors, that's the way we going
Open up the Wraith doors, oh yeah
And don't make me wait for ya
Pussy so good, I should have to pay for it, yeah
So good, I should have to pay for it

[Part II]

[Verse: Mansa]
Portuguese girl from Paris, that my French baby
I'm just tryna win, can you let me win, baby?
Mixing up Patron with the gin, baby
I don't see nothing wrong, even though I know it's a sin, baby
I'm a 7 figure nigga, still riding the scrape
Still drop a bitch off if she don't drop on the tank
I can never lose the flavor that I got from the Bay
And I still got it, if you need it, you can cop it today, ooh yeah
On the 48th floor, keep that body on Dasani like it's off a lakeshore, yeah
Grindin' on me like a skateboard, tryna push a nigga buttons, this is not a GameBoy, no
Uh, on the 48th floor, the condo 'bout the bando, where I used to stay before
Now I'm poppin' in Toronto, I go state to state, foreign whip
Whippin' like I'm tryna make a getaway for it, oh yeah

[Outro: Mansa]
Uh, oh yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh
Ooh, ooh

[Intro]
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn’t see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin’, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin’
And I was just drinkin’
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin’, "Go, go, go!"
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (We’re both sorry)

[Pre-Chorus]
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Bridge]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win

[Breakdown]
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!)

[Chorus]
Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Outro]
I was ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car

[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
('Cause I like you)

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
(Yeah, I want you)
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it... delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
('Cause I like you)

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
(Yeah, I want you)
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
('Cause I like you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it delicate?

[Verse 1]
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

[Pre-Chorus]
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Verse 2]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have

[Bridge]
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them
(And here's to my baby)
Nice things, honey
(They didn't care about that he-said, she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Intro: As Spoken by Lil' Wayne]
I spent 1.8 million of my hard earned money
To buy this motherfucking car, I had heard about called the Bugatti

[Chorus]
OK, my boujee bitch all she want is Hermès
And my college bitch need a new apartment
Make 'em both cum together, said it's all in
(Rawwest nigga alive)
Hello bitch, I'm ballin'

[Verse 1]
Ha, hello bitch I'm ballin' and I'm jet lagged
Unh, shoppin' in Japan, we don't price check
Unh, see me for Chanel Dior sunglass
Unh, leather quicksand Bugatti sandman
Ah, don't bother me, I'm wakin' up from a Xan
Take two girls, make 'em best friends
This T-Raww, like let's get acquainted
She makes The Shade Room, she think she famous
Ah, tattoos on her body, cocaine is a hobby, don't
Be so obvi niggas, record and watch it
And sell it, make a profit, tryna slow up the progress
Light up and burn let it process
I yes, interior chopped, the turbans, swervin'
Medallion diamond iced the serpent, sir, yes
Paid checks, cash advance (cash advance)
Rubs hands, but no Birdman

[Chorus]
OK, my boujee bitch all she want is Hermès
And my college bitch need a new apartment
Make 'em both cum together, said it's all in
(Rawwest nigga alive)
Hello bitch, I'm ballin'
Boujee bitch all she want is Hermès
And my college chick need a new apartment
Make 'em both cum together, said it's all in
(Rawwest nigga alive)
Hello bitch, I'm ballin'

[Bridge: As Spoken by Lil' Wayne]
When I heard they got a motherfucking car that's a million dollars
(Un huh) I want it
You know what the people at the place called me?
The Barrack Obama of Bugatti

[Verse 2]
Ha, John Gotti, big body
Desert Eagle, bitch pop it
New Bugatti, I'm the topic
No mileage, just got it
Cocaine, glove compartment
Keep her high, she always want it
Green eyes, she from the tropic
Ride or die, keep the pistol polish
I ain't the hottest, nigga stop it
I ain't the hottest, nigga stop it
Rings on me since playing Sonic
Had rings on since playing Sonic
I'm the topic
I'm the topic
New connect, meet the buyer
I don't need a scale, I can eyeball it
Kiss the ring, I'm the godfather
Corleone, you ain't see it coming
I fuck her friend, cause these hoes is horny
Forty Glock, hunnit thousand on me
Play for keeps, I don't ever bargain
I'm the profit
I'm the profit
Double up into triple profit
In the mid-west, young Scottie
Beam me up in a jet, Roger
Red bitch into red leather
She clawing on me, that's Red Lobster
Head first, then we talk about it
Told the bitch that's law and order
Head shawty, head bussa

All my dogs, stay barkin'
She wipe her head, Lorena Bobbitt

Disagree, nigga stop it

(Unh, nigga I'm the topic)

She 'gon let me poke, she my Pocahontas
The cops is crooked (gunshots)

[??]
You know yeah
Oh no, you know
I'm curled up in my mother's bed, staring intently at my laptop. I'm watching a video of a familiar-looking man wearing a black tuxedo. The video seems to be of a televised award show. The tape is grainy, but the man steps up to the mic and his words are clear:

"Now I'm gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand. Her voice is full like solid gold, with some platinum blended in. Sometimes you'll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes... but gold is Brenda's metal in this song I wish I'd wrote. Ladies and gentlemen... Brenda Lee."

The camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties. The music starts, and she's looking down at a framed picture. She's at ease. She is theatrical. And she is beautiful, in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye. Lights, camera, action. She starts to sing. That's when you hear the gold, and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand. The performance ends, and the crowd goes wild. The lovely lady graciously takes a bow. She smiles out into the vast darkness, taking it all in with grace and composure. The video ends, and I reflect back on what I just saw. It was a timeless performance, but here are the facts: The year is 1983. The song is "Someone Loves You Honey." The man in the tuxedo is Johnny Cash. And the woman in the beautiful dress with the honey-like voice is none other than Brenda Lee.

Brenda Lee, who was born in 1944 near Atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father. Brenda Lee, the little girl who took over the music world with chart-topping hits when she was still a child. Brenda Lee, the woman who ushered in a new style of rock & roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television. Brenda Lee, the artist who later went back to her country roots, proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under. Brenda Lee, the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her.

I watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause. There's a reason she's been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years. Brenda Lee is grace. Brenda Lee is class and composure. And when she hears the roar of a crowd, Brenda Lee smiles like she's five years old and receiving her first standing ovation. Brenda Lee is someone I will always look up to because of the way she shines. As Johnny Cash said in 1983, it's almost like she's golden.

[Verse 1]
Listen to the wind blow, watch the sun rise
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
If you don't love me now
(If you don't love me now)
You will never love me again
(Never love me again)
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)

[Verse 2]
Listen to the wind blow, down comes the night
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence, damn the dark, damn the light

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
(If you don't love me now)
You will never love me again
(Never love me again)
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Hear you saying, never break the chain)
If you don't love me now
(If you don't love me now)
You will never love me again
(Never love me again)
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Hear you saying, never break the chain)

[Instrumental]
Hey

[Outro]
Chains keep us together
Chains keep us together
Chains keep us together (running in the shadows)
Chains keep us together (running in the shadows)
Chains keep us together
Chains keep us together
You must be living in a fantasy
You've got me dreaming now I believe
And there I saw you
Looking oh so right
Working the dance floor
You superstar of the night
You take me up you take me down
Shake your body to the ground
How do you do the things you do
I know it must be true that you

You pull me closer like I knew you would
I try to please you the way you think I should
You make me feel I'm in control
You take my body and my soul
You fill me up
This empty cup
I just can't get enough of you
Let the spirit move me
Keep that coming to me
Feel that running through me
Gotta keep the faith

Let the spirit move me
Keep that coming to me
Feel that running through me
Gotta keep the faith

I've been away
It had to be a long time no see
Drifted around
Thousands of miles between you and me
But I'm coming home
You need the drooves to hold me back
Cause I'll finally stay
To turn my dream into a fire

Let the spirit move me
Keep that coming to me
Feel that running through me
Gotta keep the faith
Wanderers
City to city done gone
Impossible games
You have to play
To find some fun
But in the end
You find that faith to be yourself
That this spirit's giving me
Hmmmmm
You need that faith ... nothing else

Let the spirit move me
Keep that coming to me
Feel that running through me
Gotta keep the faith

Spirit spirit spirit move me
Spirit spirit move me
Spirit spirit
You gotta let the spirit move you on and on
Spirit spirit
You gotta let the spirit move you on and on

Let the spirit move me(You gotta let the spirit move ...)
Keep that coming to me (Gotta keep that coming ...)
Feel that running through me (Feel that feel that feel that...)
Gotta keep the faith
Let the spirit move me(Gotta let the spirit move ...)
Keep that coming to me (Keep that coming ...)
Feel that running through me (Got to got to got to ...)
Gotta keep the faith

Let the spirit move me
Keep that coming to me
Feel that running through me
Gotta keep the faith

Let the spirit move me(You gotta let the spirit move ...)
Keep that coming to me (Gotta keep that coming ...)
Feel that running through me (Feel that feel that feel that...)
Gotta keep the faith

Let the spirit move me
Keep that coming to me
Feel that running through me
Gotta keep the faith

Let the spirit move me
Keep that coming to me
You got to let the spirit move you on and on
Gotta keep the faith

[Hook: Merlyn Wood]
Never learn my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave
Never learned my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave

[Verse: Dom McLennon]
One more clip for the chamber
I'm gon' live for the labor
I'ma need six hundred lanes
For all of my innovators
Save 'em up for later, pull the gauge up
Cause I'm swinging through the fences
The fire, no consensus
I took a break from college and then became Kanye
They say they throwing three stacks, it make me feel like Andre
I'm losing my archway, coming through the parkway

[Hook: Merlyn Wood]
Never learn my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave
Never learned my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave

[Outro: Joba]
Baby boy, don't cry (baby boy, don't cry)
Where's your sense of pride? (where's your pride?)
I laid it on the line
Won't let you fall behind (fall behind)
Inside
I must be kind
Ain't that the way we ought to be
So polite

But these planes
Outside the lakes
Hittin' jet speed
And they just keep rockin', my boat

And I try
So hard, to sway
Seeing double anyway
That I can breathe
Guess a swim'll be nice

Trying so hard to find
What's wrong
When everything is alright

Feeling so scared
I'll lose the game
When I've a hundred lives

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire
These young niggas living like they ready to die, forever on fire
Pop a little, baby
I'm rich and I'm girl crazy
I'm rich and I'm girl crazy
No whippin', I'm going brazy
I flip it, it's so crazy
Crazy about the mula
Fire, you try to play me
Fire, you try to play me
You streamin' a million times but don't ever try to play me

[Chorus]
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire, baby
Forever on fire, forever on fire
Forever on fire, forever on fire, baby
Forever on fire, forever on fire
Forever on fire, forever on fire, baby

[Verse 1]
Girl crazy
Saint Laurent and the cream Mercedes
She call me baby
I be stuntin' but you gotta pay me
Streets raised me it's crazy the whip's insane lately
Pussy got my mind hazy
Light up the mary jane
Bless, no complaining (Forever on fire, forever on fire)
Campaign and I'm a fashion statement
Moving state to state, here
One night only baby
Don't wanna be your lover, I ain't tryna play you
Play pretend, nose up
My diamond's on a glow up
I'm so high up, I can't look up (fuck)
I love it, we thugger when we're in public
I touch it, you get the hummin'
You bussin', you catch 'em look at my lady
(Forever on fire, forever on fire)
Not ready to die, we got way more time
I'ma light one, like 4 days in July
Let that motherfucker burn

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire
These young niggas living like they ready to die, forever on fire
Pop a little, baby
I'm rich and I'm girl crazy
I'm rich and I'm girl crazy
No whippin', I'm going brazy
I flip it, it's so crazy
Crazy about the mula
Fire, you try to play me
Fire, you try to play me
You streamin' a million times but don't ever try to play me

[Chorus]
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire, baby
Forever on fire, forever on fire
Forever on fire, forever on fire, baby
Forever on fire, forever on fire
Forever on fire, forever on fire, baby

[Verse 2]
Been platinum
You could stream it but don't ever play me
Stay ready, ain't gotta get ready
I drift the whip, race it like Andretti
Niggas is mean, petty
I mean heavy, blue money in a Gucci luggy
Caught my chick, glass nugget
Rings on every finger
They like, Phil coach em', must be god chosen
I'm good, better than ever
The Deal's sweet as nutella
Came from nothin' now we culture
Watch the rims let it soak in
Sun gon' shine, sun gon' shine
Bitch nigga, get on your job cuz I'm on mine
Bitch nigga, get on your job cuz I'm on fire
Pool on a rear, she wanna lay out and tan
Pulled up in the coupe
But I hopped out in Vans
You ain’t feelin’ me
You ain’t real to me
You don’t exist
So poof! - Vamoose, Son of a bitch!

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire
These young niggas living like they ready to die, forever on fire
Pop a little, baby
I'm rich and I'm girl crazy
I'm rich and I'm girl crazy
No whippin', I'm going brazy
I flip it, it's so crazy
Crazy about the mula
Fire, you try to play me
Fire, you try to play me
You streamin' a million times but don't ever try to play me

[Chorus]
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire, baby
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire, baby
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire, baby

The grant game told her sip slow
Wildin' chain in this Vietraw
Her head strong, hedgehog
Hell yea, I blew her head off
Feds watchin' so I sped off
Crawl back to me cut the legs off
Broke is a joke wipe the smirk off

Hot boy in the hot
Glaciers all in my watch
Making her best friend watch

Hop up on your good foot, spit on it, shoeshine
In the booth, I go caboose if the track fire
I end that, flatline, rotate hoes like spare tires
Five flames, but the heatwave, car painted and the feet suede
In the strip club, I go, T-Pain
Stay in your lane, cause heat lane

Spray in your face, no face paint

[Verse 2]
You don't live it up
If there's money on the floor
Bend over, pick it up
Counted so much paper
I done cut my fingers up
Shout out to my esé, riding on the trunk
15k, 5 days at the Trump
45k on the jet, rolling blunts
Say I ain't the one?
Stay in school, do your homework
Knew you'd act like a hoe first

[Outro]
You knew hating on me won't work
Thugged out, in the club, no shirt
With my chains on
She give me wet head, that's a brainstorm
I like a hot girl with the braids in
And the ass fat, and the waist slim
Sayin' I ain't him, do your homework

[Verse 1]
To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin
Python power straight from Monty
Celluloid loves got a John Frusciante
Spread your head and spread the blanket
She's too free and I'm the patient

[Pre-Chorus]
A black and white a red and blue
Ah, things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain I know

[Verse 2]
Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood
Up to my ass in alligators
Let's get it on with the alligator haters
Did what you did, did what you said
What's the point yo what's the spread

[Pre-Chorus]
A black and white a red and blue
Ah, things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain I know
And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is where I go

[Chorus]
Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood
It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is what I want to wear
Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood

[Verse 3]
To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin
Feather-light but you can't move this
Farley is an angel and I can prove this
Purple is a stain upon my pillow
Let's sleep weeping willow

[Pre-Chorus]
A black and white a red and blue
Ah, things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain I know
And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is where I go

[Chorus]
Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood
It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is what I want to wear
Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
An' little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the east at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
Firstborn unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

[Verse 2]
Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean no vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

[Verse 1]
Would you believe that I’m tellin' a lie
Would you believe that it’s just a disguise
I don’t invent myself to shelter cause the fame won’t kill me
The shame the game the lame
Broken rapture

[Chorus]
You might not be so down
If you knew my frown
You might not come around
Come over anytime, yeahh

[Verse 2]
Would you believe
I would convince myself to hide but not to be with someone else

Would you believe that I’m tellin’ a lie
Would you believe what you see in my eye

[Chorus]
You might not be so down
If you knew my frown
You might not come around
Come over anytime

[Verse 3]
Would you believe that I’m tellin’ a lie
Would you believe that I covered you why
I couldn’t tear myself of hatred from the loaded masses
It’s all it’s all a game, you crazy bastard

[Chorus]
You might not be so down
If you knew my frown
You might not come around
Come over anytime

[Verse 4]
Would you believe that I’m
Telling a lie
Would you believe that is
Just a disguise

The shame again be late
The broken rapture

[Verse 5]
It might not be so kind
If you knew my crime
It might not come around
Come over any time yeah
Would you believe
I could convince myself
And have it not to be for someone else
You crazy bastard

[Verse 6]
Would you believe that I’m
Telling a lie
Would you believe what you
See in my eyes
It might not be some time
If you knew my crime
You might not come around
Come over any time - mumble about assail

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 7]
Would you believe that I’m
Telling a lie
Would you believe that I
Covered you wide
I could compare myself
A patriot from a loaded asset
It’s all it’s all again
You crazy bastard

[Outro]
It might not be so kind
If you knew my crime
You might not come around
Come over any time
Oh so long
I said no

[Verse 1]
51-50 bulletproof glass
Take away vinny play
Attempted to the past
So you shed tears that felt
The eyes the blood and the hammerhead
Something you buy and just can’t penetrate
A loss of nature that do state
Rearrange the change and recreate
A wake up song come on and levitate

[Chorus]
Oh momma please don’t cry
I promise I won’t die
And if I stay too long
Well I will be forever in your favor
Forever always yours
Forever always

[Post-Chorus]
Momma please mommasan
Momma be mommasan momma say momma come momma said
It won't be long
Momma please mommasan
Momma be mommasan momma say momma come momma said
It won’t be long

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
The letter’s come for me to be someone
Two persons on the days I’ll be the numb one
Passion flower family
Cause I’m the one, the one and only blood son
So hard to understand
I know you loved your one and only soulman
Do you believe in one steer-in
Well I’ll be there; just because I can

[Chorus]
Oh momma please don’t cry
I promise I won’t die
And if I stay too long
Well I will be forever in your favor
Forever always yours
Forever always

[Post-Chorus]
Momma please mommasan
Momma be mommasan momma say momma come momma said
It won't be long
Momma please mommasan
Momma be mommasan momma say momma come momma said

I said where the beautiful people at?
Beautiful people, clap your hands (yeah)
Freaky people, clap your hands
Geeky people, clap your hands
Everybody, clap your hands

[Chorus: 2-D & Jamie Principle]
Hollywood is alright
Hollywood is vagrant
Jealousy is in gunfire
It makes you kill the vibe
(She's a wonderful thing)
Jealousy and dark times
Sinking on the web
There’s more to love than that
Jealousy is vibe down
Jealousy is vibe down

[Verse 1: Jamie Principle]
(Hahaha, yeah)
I'ma go walk
All the way to the hills
But you never know what's real
So you have to be prepared
You have to be ready
You have to be ready
'Cause she can be a bitch
And it's a wonderful thing
Hollywood (Hollywood)
She's so seductive
She's got me looking for that dream
I bow down
She knows how to do it
Exactly the way I like it

[Chorus: 2-D & Jamie Principle]
Hollywood is alright
Hollywood is vagrant
Jealousy is in gunfire
It makes you kill the vibe
(She's a wonderful thing)
Jealousy and dark times
Sinking on the web
There’s more to love than that
Jealousy is vibe down
Jealousy is vibe down

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Man I came through with that big fat chain on my neck
Little did they know, no sweat
So I dimmed out, rimmed out and cracked the glass
Twenty-five pounds, can you match that bag?
'Cause if you not, raise up
I got a deal to make
And a couple bad bitches
I've been achin' to break
Wakin' and bake
I put the cake on the plate
Jealousy and me? Oh, we're making a date
I'ma vibe with this, Hollywood, nigga I'ma survive this shit
I do that, did that, blow your fuckin' wig back
Forreal-a, gorilla, who loves goin' bareback
They wanna eye me down, tie me down, knock me off
But I'm a lion in the dogg pound
Now, how that sound?

[Chorus: 2-D & Jamie Principle]
Hollywood is alright
Hollywood is vagrant
Jealousy is in gunfire

You're just what I need
(And it's a wonderful thing)
In this city of dreams
(And it's a wonderful thing)
You know how to ride me
(And it's a wonderful thing)
You know how to excite me
(And it's a wonderful thing)

[Outro: Jamie Principle]
She's a wonderful thing
She's a wonderful thing
And everything I come from the sky
I break down and cry
I'd realize, she's out of my life
Oh baby

There goes that feeling all over again
In such place of feeling I won't let you in
Girl, I don't wanna be in this world all alone by myself
No one knows that you’re in

[Verse 1]
Pick up my wallet
I picked up my jeans
She said whats the problem
I said that's the problem
I been here for days
Grinding my ass off
Pulling my weight
But you say it's not enough
What a shame, I been here days trying to get it both ways
And shawty use my currency just to burn it up
As the currency, I just wanna know what's the plan
Girl you got options, you don't gotta stay with me
Only had a plan A, never had a plan B
I'm a stick to them ropes that I know
I need me a writer not need a fighter

[Chorus]
I just wanna be everlasting
I don't wanna die inside
It's hard to believe in my passion
When you gotta tell some lies girl
I wanna dream
Don't shoot me down girl, please don't shoot me down girl
Girl I wanna dream
Don't bring me down girl, please don't bring me down girl
Girl I wanna dream
Don't shoot me down girl, please don't shoot me down girl
Girl I wanna dream
Keeping me stable girl you're such an anchor

[Verse 2]
Far from a perfect man, suit and ties  ain't really my thing
Shawty wants my net worth to be more than my self worth
Every time I come around the city bling bling
I just wanna know why
The blood was on the leaves but you chose to hear the beat
Oh can you tell me why
Kids are starvin' in the street when the greed is what we eat
Man It's fucked up
Mama called on the phone like I miss her
But I never tell her anything about my issues
She said I'll be fine and I always wanna listen
But I know the truth and you can't fool the youth
I lied, I lied
All the mother fucking time time
Oh I said I lied, I lied
Lied all the mother fucking time time

[Chorus]
I just wanna be everlasting
I don't wanna die inside
It's hard to believe in my passion
When you gotta tell some lies girl
I wanna dream
Don't shoot me down girl, please don't shoot me down girl
Girl I wanna dream
Don't bring me down girl, please don't bring me down girl
Girl I wanna dream
Don't shoot me down girl, please don't shoot me down girl
Girl I wanna dream
Keeping me stable but you're such an anchor

[Outro]
Collect calls on my phone
But she never ever picks up
She's got my heart in a sticker
And I think I'm sprung, sprung
What do I do?
Don't wanna take a loss but what I really want is you
How can I love someone when I don't even love myself

[Verse 1]
Who's that boy boy, I like that boy boy
Who hangs out with his friends go home play with his toy toy
I know a girl girl, he'd like to twirl twirl
The kind of girl who loves him and complete his world world

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I like to pose pose in all your clothes clothes
And text you pictures of places I never show show
When I get home home, and I'm alone-lone
I just can't wait to feel you vibrate on my phone phone

[Chorus]
And think of you (I'll text you pictures)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
All the time (Right on my phone)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
And think of you (I'll text you pictures)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
All the time (Right on my phone)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)

[Verse 2]
It's hard to sleep sleep, without that beep beep
I need something to know that you're thinking of me me
I think of you you, and what I do do
I go in circles but it's no fun without you you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Baby you know know, you left a mark mark
Do you remember when we taped it in the dark dark
I talk for free free, and honestly-ly
You know I love it when you pop my blackberry-ry

[Chorus]
And think of you (I'll text you pictures)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
All the time (Right on my phone)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
And think of you (I'll text you pictures)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
All the time (Right on my phone)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)

[Bridge]
Baby, you know that I have never felt this way before
'Cause when you're gone I have these feelings that I can't ignore
Don't get the wrong idea, just what am I supposed to do
When all I have left to remember are pictures

[Chorus]
And think of you (I'll text you pictures)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
All the time (Right on my phone)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
And think of you (I'll text you pictures)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)
All the time (Right on my phone)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)

And think of you (I'll text you pictures)
(Vibrate on my phone phone)

And think of you (I'll text you pictures)

When I wake up in the afternoon
Which it pleases me to do
Don't nobody bring me no bad news
Cause I wake up already negative
And I've wired up my fuse
So don't nobody bring me no bad news

If we're going to be buddies
Better bone up on the rules
Cause don't nobody bring me no bad news
You can be my best of friends
As opposed to payin' dues
But don't nobody bring me no bad news

No bad news
No bad news
Don't you ever bring me no bad news
Cause I'll make you an offer, child
That you cannot refuse
So don't nobody bring me no bad news
When you're talking to me
Don't be cryin' the blues
Cause don't nobody bring me no bad news
You can verbalize and vocalize
But just bring me the clues
But don't nobody bring me no bad news

Bring some message in your head
Or in something you can't lose
But don't you ever bring me no bad news
If you're gonna bring me something
Bring me, something I can use
But don't you bring me no bad news

Well no bad news
No bad news
I said don't you, bring me, no bad news
Cause I'll make you an offer, child
That you cannot refuse
So don't you, bring me, no bad news

(Spoken)
What are you doing?
Get up from there
Work
What are you doing
Work
Work!
Wooooorrrrkkk!!!!
(singing)
Don't nobody bring me, no bad news
If your gonna bring me something
Bring me something I can use
So don't you ever bring me no bad news
Cause I'll make you an offer, child
That you cannot refuse
So don't you, bring me
I said don't nobody bring me
I said don't nobody bring me

Well no bad news
Don't don't you bring me
Don't, don't you bring me
Don't don't don't don't don't don't don't you bring me
No no no no no no no bad news
Don't you
Bring me
No no no no no no no no no noooooo bad news

[Verse 1]
Over on the east side across the river
There was a band called The Cocoa Boys
The leader was a brother named Frankie, huh
He was the ladies pride and joy, yes he was

Now Frankie had a brother named Joe
And they shared the high-part harmonies
Joe played the bass, Frankie played guitar
And people, I mean they was too funky

And every Sunday night up on the main strip
There always was a battle
(A musical battle of the bands)
And if you had the courage, if you had the style, if you had a different trip
You would have an extra hundred dollars in your hands
(One double 0, hundred dollars)

[Verse 2]
There was an argument as to who was gonna go on first
I guess you could say The Cocoa Boys won
(No!)
Yeah, 'cause they had a trombone player the size of a house
Who considered whoopin' punks like us fun
(Alright, y'all, what's it gonna be?)
The show started
The lights were turned off, "Turn 'em off"
And in the distance, the horns blared
The band was on the stage
I could sorta see Frankie smilin'
Needless to say he was, he was sorta scary
(Shit)
A single light called up three men or was it two?
(It was two)
He had a two-man horn section walkin' thru the front door
Playin' the funkiest line I'd ever heard
Frankie started laughin' and the, and the, the people roared

Cocoa Boys, pride and joy, huh
They give the people what they need
Make my ears bleed, Lord
Turn the music up, uh, Cocoa don't let us down
And if you do it right, you can hear my body sound

[Chorus]
Uh, can you hear it?
Uh, can you hear it, baby?
Uh, can you hear it?
Uh, Cocoa Boys, la la la
Cocoa Boys, la la la
Cocoa Boys, la la, yeah

[Verse 3]
Dig up
They kicked for thirty minutes
But the funk so hard the crowd could hardly walk
We knew we had to jam
We knew we needed a little scam
We knew we needed to have a talk, we need to have a talk
"Turn the house lights up!"
Gimme the mic, let me start my shit
I hate a show-off but I know what you like, uh

"Turn the house lights up!"
Cousin gonna hit a lick on the drum
Bang on the pump all night long
Play your chords in a loop, uh, let the horns blow, whoo

"Yo Frankie, check it out
We brothers got somethin' for y'all, huh"
Everybody jump down on the floor
And do that "Detroit Crawl" Whoo

That kinda worked 'cause the crowd gettin' tired
But we wanted them suckers to beg
Huh, the drummer just stomped on the rim and started to ride
We hit the "Wooden Leg", whoo! Get wit it
The crowd started rockin', we knew we couldn't lose
Step five, huh, jump to the side, do the "Kangaroo"
Kanga-what?! Kangaroo
Kangaroo, Kangaroo, Kangaroo, Kangaroo, Kangaroo, Kangaroo
Whoo!

[Outro]
All the boys and all the girls
You are the new kings of the world
And if you can't love somebody
If there are tears in your eyes
For every king must share his prize, oh
And if you are there, raise your hands in the air
Show 'em that you care
Everybody share the prize

You are beautiful
It's gonna be a beautiful night
You are beautiful
It's gonna be a beautiful night
You are beautiful
It's gonna be a beautiful night
You are beautiful
It's gonna be a beautiful night
Finished Version

[Verse 1]
I'm close to finishing
I'm closely listening
I'm tryna figure out but this is not as interesting
Should I stay or go?
How do I let her know?
Don't wanna lose control
Think it's time to tell her that I'm moving on (I'm moving on)
I'm moving on
Not tryna make commitments (commitments)
Just tryna make decisions (decisions)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm faithful
Faithful yeah
'Cause I'm faithful
I don't want to hurt your heart
But I told you from the start
'Cause I'm faithful
You know I'm faithful

[Verse 2]
Everyday you’re wondering
Asking me who was I with and where I been
Mind no more
'Cause baby I am leaving
You know that I'm moving on, moving on
I'm moving on, I'm moving on
You made a promise
Girl at least I'm honest

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm faithful
Faithful yeah
'Cause I'm faithful
I don't want to hurt your heart
But I told you from the start
'Cause I'm faithful
You know I'm faithful

[Verse 3]
It seems like every day you wanna fight
Why do you think I don't wanna spend the night
You always mess with me
Let me be

[Bridge]
I'm moving on slowly
I'm moving on, I'm moving on
You made a promise
Girl at least I'm honest
I'm moving on, I'm moving on
I gave you everything I have, I have nothing to give

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm faithful (faithful, 'cause I'm faithful)
Faithful yeah
'Cause I'm faithful
I don't want to hurt your heart
But I told you from the start
'Cause I'm faithful
You know I'm faithful

------------------

First Version

I'm close to finishing
I'm closely listening
I'm tryna figure out but this is not as interesting
Should I stay or go?
How could I let her know?
Don't wanna lose control
Think it's time to tell her that I'm moving on (I'm moving on)
I'm moving on
Not tryna make commitments (commitments)
Just tryna make decisions (decisions)

'Cause I'm faithful
Faithful yeah
'Cause I'm faithful
I don't want to hurt your heart
But I told you from the start

Everyday you’re wondering
Asking me who was I with and where I been
Write 'em all
'Cause baby I am leaving
Don't get it wrong 'cause I trust you and I love you and it's a new season

I'm moving on, I'm moving on
You made a promise

Yeah

[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothing left
Hey, I've been wanting to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old story everybody sing

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Nowadays, I'm just - to everybody else
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
(Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat)
I'm not gonna act like I don't love ya baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl, I know I do (true)
Tried to search all through the world not well
But I can't find a girl that lives close like you (no!)
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (yah!)
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house
And laughed out on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front
You're a stone cold diva (yaah!)
I had to get counseling from my moms
She's a heartbreak teacher (oh, yah!)
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face
Made you a creature
Now I think about you every single time I eat pizza, ohh

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Intro]
What they say, what they say now
What they say, what they say now
What they say, what they say now
What they say, what they say now
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Protect Lil B
At all costs
Know'm'sayin'?

[Verse 1]
Last club, left the bathtub
Like a flash-flood baptism
Caps sizzle packs in the van—That's thizzle as Mac Drizzle
Deal is half-pickles; jammed as bad pistols
The poorly dressed, the correlated, the laureates
No relation unless it's coronated to coronets
As well, Oswald Cobblepot, Alpo, how so?
Pepper Pott, love a heartless man in a letter that's penned to Gwyneth Paltrow
The ends justify the outro
Black hue, Hugh Hefner to the heifers, the boy cow's a gaucho
L'Oreal, story tales
Brush blush on the rough cuts of the Maury fails
You are not the cannon fodder, relax
Catch me outside, how 'bout dat?
Trust all the Einsteins, if you want the facts
Fuck Harvey Weinstein if you want to act
White people having serious brand issues, can't kiss you
Behind the scenes, fucking us from the back
Got too comfortable with Barack
Now Uncle Trump's making me feel so un-wonderful with the hat
Who watchin' you by the cap
Make America great again
I just don't to wait at these great American gates again
Patiently staying in place for three hours for a rollercoaster is ridiculous
Well, isn't it?
Protect Lil B and all lowercase betas
To overtake the haters, to motivate the saviors
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Lil B]
It's all love, I don't promote violence, I'm never with the violence. So I love them and it's all good, you feel me? I'm still here, I got jumped by like 10 mothafuckas, you know what I'm sayin? Been by myself. It's all love though, like I said, it's all love

[Verse 1]
It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

[Verse 2]
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
Because Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But the film is a saddening bore
Because I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
Me and my amigos (no, not Offset)
Swish swish, aww I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aww, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Don't be tryna double back
I already despise you
All that fake love you showin'
Couldn't even disguise you
Ran? When? Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror mirror who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
Muah, muah, the generous queen will kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
I'ma tell my ----- Biggz, yeah that's tha guy
A star's a star, da ha da ha
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby
I only rock with Queens, so I'm makin' hits with Katy

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Stop drop roll, open the doors and baby light my fire

Trying to make loo like an LA riot
Stick it for the ice in the cream like Breyers
All messed up like Micheal Myers
I'm tryna multiply wha, you all dividing
Call it Ice Cube, get it hit it on a Friday
(Ya'll get knocked the fuck out)
When Pit go all out
I play broke, while your broke ass ball out
Me I'm Diddy, Jay Z and Stee stay a little bit a bigge gimme the loo and I beat out
What's your thing boy, forget a debate boy
They're filling me like Obama and Hilary
So pick up pick up your artillery before
You get cut up like umbilical cord, let's go

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night spendin' my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual, she was flexable
Professional, drinkin' X and oh
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think I, whoa
Did I think I see shawty get low?
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her mo'
Cash ain't no problem, I know where it goes
She had them—

[Hook: T-Pain]
Apple Bottom jeans, boots with the fur (with the fur)

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Hey, shawty, what I gotta do to get you home?
My jeans full of guap and they ready for shones
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy grown
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon
Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl?
I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a solider, she ready for Rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster, she showed her—

[Hook: T-Pain]
Apple Bottom jeans, boots with the fur (with the fur)

[Chorus 1]
You belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
Sail away, and kill off the hours
You belong somewhere you feel free

[Verse 1]
Run away and find you a lover
Go away somewhere all bright and new
And I've seen, I've seen no other
No one who compares with you

[Chorus 2]
You belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
You belong with your love on your arm
You belong somewhere you feel free

[Verse 2]
Run away, go find a lover
Run away, let your heart be your guide
And you deserve the deepest of cover
You belong in that home by and by

[Chorus 3]
You belong among the wildflowers
You belong somewhere close to me
Far away from your troubles and worries
You belong somewhere you feel free
You belong somewhere you feel free
You belong somewhere you feel free

[Verse 1]
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Outro]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 1]
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Verse 2]
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Mind)

[Verse 3]
Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless

[Pre-Chorus]
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Verse 1]
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Verse 2]
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Bridge]
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know
Now I'm free

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Outro]
Never let you burn
Let you burn, let you burn
Never gonna let you burn
Let you burn

[Verse 1]
Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?
Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
There are things that we can have, but can't keep

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

[Verse 2 ]
The reminders, pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

[Instrumental + Bridge]
(I do)

[Chorus/Outro]
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do
Well I do

[Verse]
Pull up on these motherfuckers, then I hit the scene
Motherfuckers hate me 'cause I'm all about my cream
Rolling down my window, roll my pride for self-esteem
Yeah, the coolest be the fool-est 'cause them niggas really awkward
Leader and a lover like a mayor and John Mayer (Woo)
All them nights I stayed up, I get paid up like a lay-up now
Worldwide tour, so them girls wide open (Shee-)
Shows packed out, so the bus pack oceans
Unapologetic (Bitch), success is my fetish (Woo)
Young, black, and handsome, that be my aesthetic, yeah
Fenty on my baby so my boo ain't got no blemishes
Put the kitty on my face, I could take you on a trip
Tell me who the fuck makes skits for they tour? (Woo)
Tell me who the fuck makes skits for they tour? (True)
I started it, them niggas borrow it
They can't help it, haters too selfish
Secret, Good for You the best album alive
Writer and director, actor, rapper, I'm a prize
Leave 'em in the dust, tell 'em level up
I own the color yellow (Woo), Pantone, hit me up (True)
Mona Lisa for a feature, my price is priceless
Back up in this motherfucker, I gots the -itis
LST on the beat, I love my buck teeth, that's why I'm so fly-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
Traitors treat you like a reaper, RIP Kenneka (Mmm)
Practicing this verse up in the mirror like I'm Issa (Mmm)
I'm frank like Aretha (Yeah), I'm dank like your reefer (Yeah)
Flows keep switching so them niggas better keep up (Woo)
Chucks on my feet 'cause they cut me a check
I'm 'bout my business, CLBN ain't take nothing less
Question, do they have sex in the scenes with the sex?
What should I be for Halloween?
I know, me, I'm the best (True)

[Chorus: Tyga]

Twisted both ways

[Verse 1]
I kissed my penny and I threw it in
I prayed I'd keep my soul
Went down to the river where the water bends
The only place I know

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't see
The forest
For the trees

[Chorus]
So will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?
My evergreen

[Verse 2]
Standing at the water's edge
The Mississippi's overflowing
Hold your current in my hands
You bring the meaning to my moments

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't see
The forest
For the trees

[Chorus]
So will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?
My evergreen

[Bridge]
Oh, I can't see
The forest
For the trees
Oh, I feel so
Hopeless against the stream

[Chorus]
So will you wait for me?
My evergreen
I know it's just as hard in Heaven
So will you wait for me?
My evergreen
I know it's just as hard
My evergreen
Evergreen
My evergreen

[Verse 1]
It's you and your world and I'm caught in the middle
I caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can't be your friend
It's my head or my heart, and I'm caught in the middle

[Pre-Chorus]
My hands are tied, but not tied enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

[Chorus]
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

[Verse 2]
Eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time
Before the rush to my blood was too much and we flatlined
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends
Now I'm all messed up and it feels like the first time

[Pre-Chorus]
My hands are tied, but not tied enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

[Chorus]
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

[Pre-Chorus]
My hands are tied, but not tied enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

[Chorus]
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
A little less lonely now

[Verse 1: Mark Foster]
Bless my heart, bless my soul
Didn't think i'd make it to 22 years old
There must be someone up above
Sayin'  "Come on, Brittany, you got to come on up"

[Chorus: Mark Foster, Luke Pritchard]
You got to hold on
Yeah, you got to hold on, yeah

[Verse 2: Luke Pritchard]
So bless my heart and bless yours too

There must be somebody up above
Sayin' "Come on, come on , you got to come on up"

[Chorus: Mark Foster, Luke Pritchard]
You got to hold on
You got to hold on

[Chorus: Mark Foster, Luke Pritchard]
Hold on

[Verse 1]
There's an emptiness tonight
A hole that wasn't there before
And I keep reaching for the light
But I can't find it anymore
There's an emptiness tonight
A heavy hand that pulls me down
They say it's gonna be alright
But can't begin to tell me how

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ask myself out loud...

[Chorus]
"Have I been lost all along?
Was there something I could say, or something I should not have done?
Was I lost all along?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?"

[Verse 2]
Is there sunshine where you are?
The way there was when you were here
'Cause I'm just sitting in the dark
In disbelief that this is real
In disbelief that this is real

[Chorus]
Have I been lost all along?
Was there something I could say or something I should not have done?
Was I lost all along?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ask myself out loud...

[Chorus]
"Have I been lost all along?
Was there something I could say or something I should not have done?
Was I lost all along?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?"

[Verse 1: Becca Stevens]
I am the galaxy
I feed the universe
Within all the atoms. (I am)
I am Regina
I move the waters
Of infinity. (I am the)

[Pre-chorus 1: Becca Stevens and Jacob Collier]
I deal in stardust (We love it! We love!)
I dance with time (I am the)
I feel the movement
Of everything divine. (We love it!)

[Chorus]
Shout if you feel me
You’ve been living your whole life knowing nothin’ ‘bout me
Now that you know that
I’ve been giving you all the love that you want from me
Rise up the mountains
Cause you know that there’s nothin’ ‘bout you makes you different from me
And as you reach outside yourself you will find me

[Verse 2: Jacob Collier]
You light the sun above
You turn the moon around
Designing all the seasons. (I am)
And when the stars of love
Are what I’m thinking of
I’ll see you there

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jacob Collier]
I deal in music (We Love it! We Love!)
I dance with rhyme (We Love it! We Love!)
I feel the movement
And everything is mine. (We Love it!)

[Chorus]
Shout if you feel me
You’ve been living your whole life knowing nothin’ ‘bout me
Now that you know that
I’ve been giving you all the love that you want from me
Rise up the mountains
Cause you know that there’s nothin’ ‘bout you makes you different from me
And as you reach outside yourself you will find me

[Outro: Becca Stevens]
I am Regina
I move the waters
Within all the atoms
And the eaves

[Intro]
Hahaha, hello world!
Uh, I'll talk to him
See, live from the, from the, from the..
Gotcha!

[Verse]
Life from the 504
It's Mr. Crazy flow
Jumping like a bungee, no rope
Even in the dungeon I glow
Even if it ain't sunny I glow
If it ain't about money I go
Nowhere, I'm nailed to the flo'
I am a sail to the water, money's the sail to my boat
And it's going down, it's going down
Like there's a whale in the boat
And you can smell what I smoke
And yep, I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination that make my eyes bleed
I'm a shark in the water
Yeah, I swim with the big
So I don't have time to deal with Willy the Squid
L-L-Lilly pad homies L-L-Look at the monster
Man, you don't want to crash
Like La-La-La Bamba
See it's me, Roney, and Terry
And my new drop is berry
Watermelon, plum
Just call it fruit punch
I'm an old rapper
Getting new bucks
And all you new rappers
You're just new lunch
Flow sick
So sick
Need a Doc, yes
A creature
Monster
Like the Loch Ness
I gets hotter by the tick
Before I sizzle to death
I just tell the clock
"Gimme a sec"
I'm the middle of the war, where my enemy at?
I'm runnin' it like Eric Eric Bieniemy back
I hit a track I'm like an energy pack
The instruments are crying out "Where the sympathy at?"
Okay, I'm finna be that
Whatever rich look like, well look I'm finna be that
They say money ain't everything
But I look better than that
It's Cash Money
Young money
Have a sweater with that
And just chill

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
If you rolling around Los Angeles right now
This one right here is for you (keep it true)
And they say, and they say, and they say, and they say, now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Sunsets Los Angeles undressed like
The sky put on a skirt to hurt the slum sets
Then hit Hollywood boulevard like spars
Light taps that fight back, high heels covered in stars
Lounge gowns standing downtown up in W. Dubois'
Rolls Royce, Choice, the Hoist, and other comfortable cars
Shooting club doormans, speaking love of the warfare
What we're doing is ordering Ubers to Soho JoJo, everything is bizarre
Malibu Member's Only sitting lonely in the Rolex when these Denny's mirage
In-N-Out bagels, Katsu your crab rolls, East LA food trucks, bossa nova mastros
Half-glued eyes on the night time wide search
Chanel purse gone down on the I-5 side
Mulholland hill shops, house party chill spots
Valley versus ills in the south central will shops
Saudi's versus Persians,  Hasidic temples 

[?]
Santa Monica helicopters and Compton KJazz
KJazz

[Outro: Lupe Fiasco]
If you see nighttime out there, tell her I said hello
Kjazz

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah-yeah, breakfast sketches, yeah?, yeah, alright, and they say, uh

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Zombie, I need brains
Right on time like high speed trains
Pull up real slow like tai-chi cranes
That's an excellent Karate Kid reference
But I'm leave it there like negligence
To focus on the dead that I said in my very first testament
Re-animate it, (roll out) Roll-out mines, Frankenstein times Optimus Prime
Zorro bombing on cars how I write these names
Rail spike, snail life, I need change
That's transformers, ass warmers, ass styles for the wilin'
Frank Gallagher rubbing Valium on the mouths of the violent to make them silent
What a shame, taking on weight, and jumping on the plane
Lucille take it to the head, thumbs up to the mules, break another leg
Can Donald Bob Mueller and shake another fed?
He'll probably weave Bob, we'll wake up when we're dead
Dream team scheme to king Azizim
Don't sleep on that, that's a sword with 3 swings
Right across the chest, Mayweather your wig
Right across the left, rig weave
Have powwows and wigwams
Indeed, I spit freeze like Kal-El, only bow down for Islam
Back to the training, this mental bomb left Daniel-san hanging, haymakers for Al Haymin

[Outro: Lupe Fiasco]
Back way when, I would say then, they would do it, when I say when

When go, left, no, (roll out) stay, L-Word: Lupe

[Verse 1: Sam Smith & YEBBA]
I see you in the morning, feel your fingers in my hair
Sometimes I still pretend you're there
It hits me without warning, your reflection walking by
But I know it's only in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA,  Sam Smith, Both]
Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missin'?
Won't you give me the part of myself that I can't give back?
Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missin'?
'Cause I'd kill for you, and darlin', you know that

[Chorus: YEBBA, Sam Smith, Both]
So I'll light up a cigarette
I'll drink it down till there's nothin' left
'Cause I sure can't get no sleep
And Lord knows there's no relief
You held my heart in your fingertips
So now I drown in my bitterness
Oh, I can't get no sleep
And I sure won't, I sure won't find no peace
No peace

[Verse 2: YEBBA & Sam Smith]
All that I am askin' is for a little clarity
That's all that really matters to me
In and out of focus, tears are in my eyes
We're burnin' down the bridges this time

[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA,  Sam Smith, Both]
Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missin'?
Won't you give me the part of myself that I can't give back?
Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missin'?
'Cause I'd kill for you, and darlin', you know that

[Chorus: YEBBA & Sam Smith]
So I'll light up a cigarette
I'll drink it down till there's nothin' left
'Cause I sure can't get no sleep
And Lord knows there's no relief
You held my heart in your fingertips
So now I drown in my bitterness
Oh, I can't get no sleep
And I sure won't, I sure won't find

[Bridge: Sam Smith & YEBBA]
I used to find comfort in your arms
Caught up in the wonder of your charms
Oh, I'll cry for you, I'll cry for you
I'll lie for you, I'll lie for you
But I don't even know you anymore

[Chorus: YEBBA & Sam Smith]
So I'll light up a cigarette
I'll drink it down till there's nothin' left
'Cause I sure can't get no sleep
And Lord knows there's no relief
You held my heart in your fingertips
So now I drown in my bitterness
Oh, I can't get no sleep
And I sure won't, I sure won't find no peace

[Outro: YEBBA & Both]
Sure won't find no peace, no, no
Will you give me the piece
Will you give me the piece of my heart?
Will you give me the piece
Will you give me the piece of my heart?

[Verse 1]
My head is filled with ruins
Most of them, I built with you
Now the dust no longer moves
Don't disturb the ghost of you, mmm
They are empty, they are worn
Tell me what we built this for
On my way to somethin' more
You're that one I can't ignore, mmm

[Chorus]
I'm gonna miss you
I still care
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time, mmm

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know just what you're sayin'
And I regret ever complainin'
About this heart and all its breakin'
It was beauty we were makin', mmm
And I know we'll both move on
You'll forgive what I did wrong
They will love the better you
But I still own the ghost of you, mmm

[Chorus]
I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time, oh
I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we'd never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time
But real love is never a waste of time

[Verse 1]
I never feel like this
I'm used to emptiness in my heart
And in my arms
You're not what I'm used to
You keep me guessin' with things that you do
I hope that they're true

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm never gonna heal my past
If I run every time it starts
So I need to know if I'm in this alone

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, say it first
I need to hear you say those words
If I'm all that you desire, I promise there'll be fire
I need to hear you say it first
Come on, baby, do your worst
I know you'll take me higher
So come on, darling
If you love me, say it first
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?

[Verse 2]
I know you're right for me
But I'm waiting for everything in your world
To align with my world
I think of you while I sleep
I dream of what we could be if we grow
Together unfold

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm never gonna heal my past
If I run every time it starts
So I need to know if I'm in this alone

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, say it first
I need to hear you say those words
If I'm all that you desire, I promise there'll be fire
I need to hear you say it first
Come on, baby, do your worst
I know you'll take me higher
So come on, darling
If you love me, say it first
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it first
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Come on, baby, say it first
I need to hear you say those words
If I'm all that you desire, I promise there'll be fire
I need to hear you say it first
Come on, baby, do your worst
I know you'll take me higher
So come on, darling
If you love me, say it first
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?

[Verse 1]
Maybe one day I won't sing about you
I'll sing a song about someone new
But right here, right now, you are on my mind
And I think about you all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sendin' a message to you
And I'm hopin' that it will get through

[Chorus]
When it was good, it was bittersweet, honey
You made me sad, till I loved the shade of blue
I know you don't want to talk to me, so this is what I will do
Maybe you're listenin', so here's one last song for you
Here's one last song for you

[Verse 2]
And I hope it makes you feel
And I hope it makes you burn
And I hope it reminds you of how much it hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sendin' a message to you
And I'm hopin' that it will get through

[Chorus]
When it was good, it was bittersweet, honey
You made me sad, till I loved the shade of blue
I know you don't want to talk to me, so this is what I will do
Maybe you're listenin', so here's one last song for you

[Bridge]
In case you hear this, then know you're the love of my life
Want to tell you I'm sorry, I miss havin' you by my side
When you were mine

[Chorus]
When it was good, it was bittersweet, honey
You made me sad, till I loved the shade of blue
I know you don't want to talk to me, so this is what I will do
Maybe you're listenin', so here's one last song for you
Here's one last song for you

[Verse 1]
I choose me, and I know that's selfish, love
You are a dream, and I can't thank you enough
But I give another piece of me away
Every wakin' day that I'm with you
Am I a monster? What will your family think of me?
They brought me in, they helped me out with everything
But I give a little piece of me away
Every single day

[Chorus]
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo

[Verse 2]
Love you so much that I have to let you go
I'll miss your touch and the secrets we both know
But it would be wrong for me to stay
And I'll just give you hope

[Chorus]
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
I can't stop cryin', I hate that I've caused you pain
But I can't deny it, I just don't feel the same
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away

[Verse 1]
Holy Father, we need to talk
I have a secret that I can't keep
I'm not the boy that you thought you wanted
Please don't get angry, have faith in me

[Chorus]
Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch
It is him I love, it is him
Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us
It is him I love, it is him I love

[Verse 2]
I walk the streets of Mississippi
I hold my lover by the hand
I feel you staring when he is with me
How can I make you understand?

[Chorus]
Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch
It is him I love, it is him
Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us
It is him I love, it is him I love

[Bridge]
Ohh, ohh
Oh, I love
Ohh, ohh
No, no, I love
Ohh, ohh
I love
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Him I love
Ohh, ohh
Him I love
Ohh, ohh
Him I love
Ohh, ohh
Him I love

[Outro]
Holy Father, judge my sins
I'm not afraid of what they will bring
I'm not the boy that you thought you wanted
I love him

[Verse 1]
You say that you're leavin', but I don't think I can let go
When you put the phone down, I began to cry
What are you to do, when the person that you love just says no?
Boy, get yourself together, move on with your life

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm
Got to get you out my system
I would do anything to keep you off my mind
I'm gonna have to call my sisters
Be around the ones who listen
Anything to drown you out tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow

[Verse 2]
It wasn't enough, but you could've had the guts to face me
It would have meant so much, if you'd looked me in the eye
Why do I always fall for the ones who have no courage?
I must see some kind of beauty in their lies

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm
Got to get you out my system
I would do anything to keep you off my mind
I'm gonna have to call my sisters
Be around the ones who listen
Anything to drown you out tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm done, maybe it's true
Maybe I had one chance and I lost it with you
We fell so hard, with nothing to lose
I'll never love again, I'll never love you

[Chorus]
'Cause I gave my heart to a goddamn fool
I gave him everything
Now there's nothing left for you
'Cause I gave (I gave)
My heart (My heart)
To a goddamn fool
Oh, I lost everything
Now I have nothing left for you
I have nothing left for you

[Verse 2]
Mm, I can't pretend, pretend that I care
I see how you look at me, but I am not there
The damage is done, I'll save you the time
And if there are feelings there, they are not mine

[Chorus]
'Cause I gave (I gave)
My heart (My heart)
To a goddamn fool
I gave him everything
Now there's nothing left for you
'Cause I gave (I gave)
My heart (My heart)
To a goddamn fool
I lost everything
And I have nothing left for you
Oh, I have nothing left for you

[Bridge]
You won't hear me say those words again
This is something that you cannot mend
Can't you see I am a product of my own past?
So I know this will never last
And I will not cover your fears
I will not pick up your tears
I'll live out the rest of my days alone

[Chorus]
'Cause I gave my heart to a goddamn fool
I gave him everything
Now there's nothing left for you
'Cause I gave my heart to a goddamn fool
I lost everything
And I have nothing left for you

[Verse 1]
I regret that I told the world
That you were with me
And I regret how I showed the world
That you were pretty
I never thought I'd learn so much
So much from bein' lonely
But I guess I didn't learn enough
'Cause now you won't hold me

[Chorus]
I guess I got lost in the moment
I guess I got lost in the fall
I guess I got lost in your heartbeat
In the thrill of it all
And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all
In the thrill of it all

[Verse 2]
Even though we weren't in love
It was far from lust
Yeah, you were beautiful
But in you I could trust
Others, they warned my heart
They said I would lose fast
They said that you were stoppin' ground
And soon to be my past

[Chorus]
I guess I got lost in the moment
I guess I got lost in the fall
I guess I got lost in your heartbeat
In the thrill of it all
And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all, oh
In the thrill of it all

[Outro]
And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all

[Verse 1]
This is for my mother
From the older brother of your children, made of three
Now you found your lover
'Cause it wasn't our father who made you laugh and happy
It's been a long five years
I've cried a thousand tears, and here we are, after the war
But we're so much better
Now the skies are clearer, now there's no more slammin' doors

[Chorus]
Now, I say
Dear Mother, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, Mother, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretendin' when I say
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars

[Verse 2]
This is for my father
From the older brother of your children made of three
Yeah, you've been so good to us
And showed us how to live and taught us to be free
But when Mother told you
That she didn't love you, all these bridges hit the sea
So you built another one
And helped us cross it, even though you were in need

[Chorus]
Now, I say
Dear Father, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, Father, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretendin' when I say
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars

[Outro]
Dear Mother, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, Mother, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretendin' when I say
You cleared up my scars

[Verse 1]
Let's turn off our phones tonight
And rely on the stars
We've been so lost lately
We forgot who we are
But I got everything I need, baby
In the palms of your touch
In a world of dark distractions
It can all get too much

[Chorus]
So let's sit by an English river
Till the water runs dry
Can we light a cigarette
And talk about days gone by?
We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it one day at a time
Take it one day at a time

[Verse 2]
I know you're feelin' weighed down tonight
And you can't find the breaks
Every day is too long for you
You are sworn to your fate
But we got everything we need, baby
In the memories we make
In a world of reinventions
It's never too late

[Chorus]
So let's sit by an English river
Till the water runs dry
Can we light a cigarette
And talk about days gone by?
We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it one day at a time
Take it one day at a time, mmm
Oh, so let's sit by an English river
Till the water runs dry
There is nothin' that we've done wrong
That can't be made right
We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it
Grab a bottle and take it
Grab a bottle and take it one day at a time

[Verse 1]
And you got me like, "Oh, what you want from me?"
And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high
Baby you got me like "Oh"
You love when I fall apart
So you can put me together and throw me against the wall

[Breakdown: Rihanna]
Baby you got me like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hii
I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii

Must be love on the brain
That’s got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do
I’m no good without you
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the..... brain

[Verse 2]
Baby keep loving me
Just love me
Yeah, just love me
All you need to do is love me, yeah

Don't you stop loving me

[Chorus]
Must be love on the brain
Must be love on the brain

[Verse 2]
Babe, I’m fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe
And I run for miles
Just to get close to you

[Verse 1]
Are you livin'? Are you doin' fine?
Are you gettin' money? Do you need a ride?
I've been livin' off adderall, feel like only three months and
I've been trippin', I've been gettin' mine
I've been dippin', I've been livin' life
I appreciate the high life
But I just wish things were better
Between the ones that I love
No I don't want to try hard
Just don't wanna be, don't wanna be alone

[Chorus]
Stuck with just weed and no friends
Weed and my pen
End of the day, it's just trees in the wind
Day in the wind, day in the wind

Trees in the wind, trees in the wind, trees in the wind

[Verse 2]
I got a casing, got knocked out, I'm waitin'
To see if they'll take me to jail, no
Gee, I kinda hope they lock me up and throw away the key
'Cause I don't wanna go to work this week, anyway
Woke up like, "Why me?"
I heard that waist training get you a good boyfriend
I am not searching for one though
Girl, you too pretty, you could do better
Called you a cab in the mornin'
Girl, you know you should've call me
Would've roll it up, could've smoke it up with you
High, high-high, high, high-high, high
High, high-high, high, high-high, high, ayy

[Chorus]
Stuck with just weed and no friends
Weed and my pen
End of the day, it's just trees in the wind
Day in the wind, day in the wind
D-d-day in the wind
Day in the wind, t-t-trees in the wind
Driven away, driven away
Trees in the wind, trees in the wind, trees in the wind
D-d-day in the wind

He was only 22, lost his mother age of two
He lost it, he lost it all
Now he's got to get to work so his father don't get hurt
He won't let this home fall

[Chorus]
Oh Lord, he's the leader of the pack now
He is gonna save them all
No choice, he's the leader of the pack now
Listen to his lonely voice
Let's go

I hear you call for me with a million eyes
You take us gospel but I don't deny
But you won't succeed, 'cause I've been tipped off
I just turned a blind eye for way too long
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
People like me don't pick a fight with you
But underneath the bridge we gather two by two
If we don't succeed, well, at least we tried
Turned around to face you with a one blind eye

[Chorus]
I'm gonna carry you over (Carry you over)
Pull you in closer (Pull you in closer)
One by one, we marry the night
Sitting on the same boat on different sides
Staring at each other with our one blind eye
Ooh-ooh, ooh
One by one (Ooh), we marry the night
(Ooh) Sitting on the same boat (Ooh) on different sides
Staring at each other with our one blind eye

I got a neck full of hate, wrist full of jealousy
When I was 18, that's when I caught my first felony
Now, I'm in a Phantom, just a cruising like Penelope
Dipping like the blue cheese and counting all the celery
All this bullshit coke, fuck is niggas selling me?
They got me in the studio, rapping; making melodies
Just to get my cash back, tryna get my stash back
Nightmares of being broke, man, I be having flashbacks
Nigga fuck my bitch, you better ask him where the cash at
All white Mazaradi, looking like a lab rat
Nigga broker than a Joke, why you think you're laughed at?
I'm a rude boy, Top Shotta like Mad Max
We was at the club, she told me "Teach me how to dougie"
Took her to lofts, she told me "Teach me how to suck it"
She only wanna fuck me cuz she know I get that money
I don't know what that bitch thinking, she can't get a dollar from me!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
We ball to da max, all we know is spend it
And go and get it back
She all on my dick cuz I make a lot of paper
And I know I'm winning cuz I make a lot of haters
Swag on 100, my wrist on froze
Money, cash, hoes; that's all a nigga knows
I say money, cash, hoes; that's all a nigga knows

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Gotta go to court tomorrow, and I'm a wear my Audemar
And shit all on the D.A., kill em on a weekday
Only hit her once and now she want an instant replay
I'm bout to start selling dick, put it on EBay
All the girls'll buy it, you should come and buy it
I'll let you eat it all; put you on my dick diet
Shit, I ain't just spitting bitch, I'm getting rich by it
Niggas say they getting money, come around and get quiet
We ball to da max with it, I'm in a Maybach, I'm in the back with it
Shout out to lil (?) he on the track with it
2 9s like a hit em; Warren Sapp with it
Ok, I've been on my grind getting paper everyday
Shit, I think I'm married to the (?) everyday
Nigga crossed the line, I'm a send em (?)
Matter fact, Nah, I'm fucking all their bitches anyway

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
We ball to da max, all we know is spend it
And go and get it back
She all on my dick cuz I make a lot of paper
And I know I'm winning cuz I make a lot of haters
Swag on 100, my wrist on froze
Money, cash, hoes; that's all a nigga knows
I say money, cash, hoes; that's all a nigga knows

Money, cash, hoes, that's all a nigga know
Money cash, hoes, that's all a nigga know
Money cash, hoes, that's all a nigga know
Nike flow; I just do it, just do it, just do it, just do it, just do it

[Chorus: Masspike Miles]
I wouldn't be caught dead anywhere else
Yeah, my heart stuck here and I'ma ride till' my last breathe
Yeah

You should think about the consequence of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I've got a boyfriend he's older than us

I go through phases when it comes to love
I'm nothing that you want but I must say

Two Days Later

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk

And I've got a boyfriend he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
And you're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
I hate you so much
Just because I love you
Doesn’t mean that I care
And just because we’re together
Doesn’t mean that it’s fair

Just because I want you
Doesn’t mean that I want what you need
And just because you’re thinking what I’m thinking
Doesn’t mean you’re really thinking about me

Just because I’m a sun-baby
Doesn’t mean I don’t fuck with the moon
And just because it’s forever
Doesn’t mean it doesn’t make me feel blue

[Verse 1]
Step out of the doorway
I wish I was a ghost
I wish I could remember how it feels to feel close
Hold onto the handrail
Hold onto my head
If I make it to the corner I can make it to my bed

[Chorus]
With you
Well it’s better than being alone
Being with you
Well it’s better than being alone

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I feel alright, I ask you if you love me
Can’t you lie?
Sometimes in the middle of the night, in the middle of a movie, in the middle of a dream
I start to cry, cry, cry

[Chorus]
With you
I might as well just be alone
Being with you
I might as well just be alone

[Post-Chorus]
Would you tie me down?
Tie me down on my knees
You’re so heartless, it’s hard to believe
Would you tie me down?
Tie me 

[?]
You’re so ruthless, you’re just what I need

[Verse 3]
Pulling out my records
Pulling out my hair
Pulling out my money, I’m just making sure it’s there
Walking down Division, like walking in a dream
I can’t remember my name
I don’t remember where I’ve been

[Chorus]
With you
Well it’s better than being alone
Being with you
Sometimes I’d rather be alone

[Post-Chorus]
Will I tie you down?
Tie you down on your knees?
I’m so messed up, it’s hard to believe
Got to go downtown, and never do 

[?]
I’ll give you head, I’ll give you something to read

[Outro]
Sometimes when I feel alright, can’t you lie?
Ah, sometimes when I feel alright
Ah, sometimes when I feel alright
In the middle of the night
Oh, in the middle of the night
Oh, in the middle of the night
Oh, in the middle of the night

[Intro]
Giving in is anything I'd provide
My figure surrounded
The riches are clouded
If you live like I live
I wouldn't live without it
Said I'd be your new best friend, didn't I?
If February, anything I'd provide
When you coming down here
You're shaded, I provided all that
Rain coming down
Ambition got providing
All that money mine

[Verse 1]
Memo finna start acting out if I don't see him soon
Yeah my best friend ain't backing out, it's still on sight, fool
I'm the only one out here on the night loops
I'm the only one out here on the night loops
Trophy case still light, body need a race stripe
And these minerals on my body break light
And these reds on my body brakelight
New man comin' up ahead on his own two
Is you a natural blondie like Goku?
Sleepin' on my belly in a loop like a serpent
Talking Heads ripplin' on the surface

Eyes low, chin heavy, shoegazer
Moonwalkin', R.I.P. Stanley Kubrick
You had you some birthdays, could you prove it?
Show me the wisdom in your movement

Provide, provide
Pro...
Ooh, oooh, oooh
Tonight I might change my life, all for you
All for you (Provide)

[Verse 2]
Provided, diamond lane that didn't exist
Packed the Astro van and brought my kids through
Prada tee on the eldest, throw the Gildan on the children
Hand-me-down fits
Chest pass, see mist off rotation (Swish, swisha)
Stiff smile just like I'm Aphex Twin (Yeah, come to daddy, yeah)
Pat the Patagonia pockets, tryna find my zip (uh, where it's at? Yeah)
Blunt twist, tightropes, I'm not fallin' off (never that, no)
Watch friends, go pro through fisheye lens, drownin' off clear
I just saw JAWS, divin' under influence
Been feelin' like the Lord just out of reach for me (for me)
How I feel lettin' man speak
How I feel lettin' man speak for me (for me)
Holyfield, keep your ears split for me
Can't show my face if you spit for me
Spit for me, yeah

Got a choppa and your pussy boy disrespect us
I've been all up in the ah, ah, all up in the eckers

[Verse 1]
Outfit, got my dream girl in a dream car and they ain't even came out yet
Holdin' up the bars and I'm soaped up

[Verse 1]
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Verse 2]
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Bridge]
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
"You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes (Would you run away?)

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Outro]
(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)

Floating with swans
i think she noticed me
perhaps i held uncertainty
uneducated dishonesty
well whatever it was
that she saw in me
held her hands up high in the monastery
just here to be warned
for surrounding monarchy
some kind of limp slop apology
in a cable for two
only fits her and me
a lonely {?} Bermondsey
well they gathered for you
swans gathered for you
they gather for you
see i gathered for you
the flow of fluids
the citys you
destitute
to where we hide
away from clones
i pick my own
a cities own
to reside
they saw us cloned
they saw the smoke
they saw the fear within my eyes
i felt alone
i feel alone
i feel alone with you by me side
swans gathered for you
they gathered for you
swans gather for you
see i gathered for you
the whole world could be heard
somewhere in the colossus energy
hips lips will form a dirty mythology
just here to warned of your superficial ecology
so i'm trying to live in this monolithic democracy
the monolithic democracy
swans gathered for you
oh see how they gathered for you
you see they gathered for you
see i gathered for you

[Intro: Polly Misch]
"My cheek brushes against his
Smooth on stubble for a moment
And then it's gone
He walks along the platform as if in a dream
Every fiber in me wants to shout and scream
'Stop!'
To run across to him, to take him in my arms
To tell him, 'I love you! You silly, silly man, I love you!'
But instead I stand still
Heart cracking
Those little curls on the back of his head bouncing
As he steps out of my life, forever."

[Verse 1]
I hope that the fire we both made
Still burns a little in you
I wrote to you everyday
Did my letters find their way?
Our memories on my screen
Two lovers in this mystic dream
Baby, come back to me, come back to me
Too much time on my phone
Baby, do you still sleep alone?
Come back to me, come back to me

[Chorus]
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie, movie
On every screen
But would you realize
What you meant to me or was it mystery?
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie, movie
On every screen
But would you realize
What you meant to me or was it mystery?

[Verse 2]
I heard that you moved somewhere far away
Is your number the same as before?
I can't ignore
The time may have changed your ways
Does my record still hang on your wall?
Such a sentimental way to groove
I hope it still touches you
Baby, come back to me, come back to me
It kills me to see you leave
So I came home and made this beat
Baby, come back to me, come back to me

[Chorus]
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie, movie
On every screen
But would you realize
What you meant to me or was it mystery?
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie, movie
On every screen
But would you realize
What you meant to me or was it mystery?

[Outro]
Remember me, let's set the scene
You and me, what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me, let's set the scene
You and me, what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me, let's set the scene
You and me, what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me, let's set the scene
You and me, what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens

[Tyler]
Sometimes, I sit in my room and think about us
Ayo
You got them long lashes, couldn't get the dirt in em'
Curls on your head look like waves I'ma surf in em'
Wave at the camera, the paps ask your role
I evade any answer, but if you ain't a dummy
Shit is laid in these stanzas, kidnap my feelings
I ain't paying any ransom, I, keep em' like secrets
Might, drive a nigga crazy but I'm, beepin' like, beepin' like, beepin' like pages on a hip waist trainer, Yeugh!
Sometimes, I sit in my room

At the same time, the same time
Two bitches at the same time

[Verse 2]

[...] be callin' me
They know I'm be thuggin'

[Verse 1]
Can’t no bitch with no bills on her list tell me how to run my agenda
Who are these dudes still yelling from their rooms staying home with their moms like a husband, oh
Little bag niggas don’t associate with ‘em
Wanna be a god but still on the true religion
Can’t come, nope
Put my hand up on the boat
You are not from the land I swim from
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Please don’t insult my intelligence
My mindset is greater than your relevance
I, couldn't get a hold of your name there
Can't stay long 'cause the money's on hold and I gotta pick it up like daycare
You know I gotta pick it up I don't play fair

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta pick it up from the floor
Gonna make it hard for these hating ass niggas to ignore
Never give a nigga your location
Who's been giving niggas admiration?
I don't really know
Fraud ass niggas who be like that
Men runnin' up behind another man
Crowd full of bros I don't wanna get to know
I got blood 

[?]

[Chorus]
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Nonsense, nonsense
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Nonsense

[Verse 2]
If you're gonna run with the bulls better walk with 

[?] I gotta know what to with no lights out
Commas on the way, niggas wanna hang, all I'm gonna say when they try to lay the pipe down, is
Nope, your credit ain't shit
Four/five lots and my new whip still won't fit
Fuck are you to me?
Same hoes mad in the back ain't know who they wanna be
No time for the petty nonsense
Any bitch alive with a conscience knows
I'ma be around for a while now
Can't blame me if your nigga don't be giving you down time like he used to
Lately I been in 

[?] no bluetooth
I been in the cut getting C-notes
You be in the cut giving deep throat
Gotta pick it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta pick it up from the floor
Gonna make it hard for these hating ass niggas to ignore
Never give a nigga your location
Who's been giving niggas admiration?
I don't really know
Fraud ass niggas who be like that
Men runnin' up behind another man
Crowd full of bros I don't wanna get to know
I got blood

[Chorus]
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Nonsense, nonsense
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room

You got me on standby

In my best designer
Shawty wastin' time, but it's time to make your mind up
I know you like the way the 458 skates
See the diamonds in the dash
You ain't worried 'bout the cash
But you know I got the game that be feelin' like a cheat
Got the stars in the roof, double R's in the seat
I'ma dawg, I'ma freak
Come fuck with me I'll beat that pussy W-E-T
Tell your friends that I'm your homie, I'm not tryna be
Not tryna wing it

Oh I'm leaning, 420 leaning
You know I don't know steamin'
Secrets you keepin', I never keep 'em
I know you seen 'em
See 'em in a Roll-Royce leanin'
Chick name Janina, slim like my nina
Out in Miami, Dolphin Marina
Let me fly you out where it's sandy
Taste like candy, face on yandy
No V-Day, 28, just grindin'
Pink brown eyes, all Asian and slanted
Niggas all on you, I can't stand it
I booked the flight baby, I just landed
I just rented, two of you at Camden
You still got it, Yorkdale shoppin'
You’re still poppin', you’re still top of my
Top of my list...

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Girl, I be in it so deep, I ain't slept in five weeks
Side ting mad, when she not who I pree

I hear the racks talkin', gotta relax honey (Relax honey)
Girls gettin' me in trouble all the time, yeah, yeah (Oh yeah)
Out here lookin' for a diamond in the rough (You dig, you dig, yeah)
And this goes to the ones that I thought were the ones
That never turn to thots when summertime come
Ain't no suckin' (Ain't no suckin')
That's when I need some (Some)
Baby girl, that's why I need ya (Need ya)
You don't make it no easier
Been up all day, that's why I'm leaning

Girl, I be in it so deep, I ain't slept in five weeks
Sad ting mad when she not I pree

[Verse 1]
If these four walls could talk then they would tell you to stop
Because you're crushing my bones and I am breaking your heart
If these four walls could talk then they would tell you to stop
Because you're crushing my bones, I'm breaking your heart
Romance is rotting my skin and we are falling apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, what would you say if I went away and stole your starlight
Would that be alright?
Now, how would it be if a symphony played our favorite song
And got the notes wrong?

[Chorus]
Is this the part where the violins kick in?
Is this the part where the drama begins?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
If these voices were real then they would tell you to leave
And if these mirrors could speak they'd tell you to scream
But your body's a mess, your eyes roll back in a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, what would you say if I went away and stole your starlight
Would that be alright?
Now, how would it be if a symphony played our favorite song
And got the notes wrong?

[Chorus]
Is this the part where the violins kick in?
Is this the part where the drama begins?
This is the part where your toys burn up
And all of my colours fall to the sun

[Bridge]
Is this the part? Is this the part? Is this the part?
Is this? Is this? Is this?
Is this the part? Is this the part? Is this the part?
Is this? Is this? Is this?
Is this the part? Is this the part? Is this the part?
Is this? Is this? Is this?

[Chorus]
Is this the part where the violins kick in?
Is this the part where the drama begins?
This is the part where your toys burn up
And all of my colours fall to the sun
Is this the part where the violins kick in?
Is this the part where the drama begins?
This is the part where your toys burn up
And all of my colours fall to the sun

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Hey, Jahlil?! We already got "So Fly" on em!
Now, it's time to take off! Haha, Let's get it!

[Chorus: Meek Mill] (2x)
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
I'm so mafuckin' fly, hoe, I'm bout to levitate
Im leering, Im leering, Im leering, Im leering
Bitch, Im leering, Im leering, Im leering, Im leering

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Let me strike a pose, hoe, take a flick
Whole team be gettin' money, we on some shit
My stomach hurtin', haters make me sick
And, I won't fuck her twice if she can't take the dick
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, I'm so mafuckin' fly, hoe, I'm bout to levitate
I be gettin' money honey, Trust me, I don't ever hate
Benji after benji after benji, I'm forever straight
I got in my Louie Bag any time I wanna
Gucci crossed my mind today, so I think I'm gonna
Give em green and red stripes all on my (?)
Yellow diamonds in my Breitling, wrist shine like I'm Homer
Bummer, you leased that little hoe but I'm the owner
All that hatin' shit, I'll turn you to an organ donor
You fuck wit that "Reggie", we don't smoke that Arizona
Little hoes be tryna fuck me, I say "girl, get your diploma"

[Chorus: Meek Mill] (2x)
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
I'm so mafuckin' fly, hoe, I'm bout to levitate
Im leering, Im leering, Im leering, Im leering
Bitch, Im leering, Im leering, Im leering, Im leering

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Haters yell "MAYDAY!", everyday is payday
I just wanna be successful like my nigga Trey Day
But, nothing in this world can come for free, not even AJ
I do what I wanna do, you just do what they say
I make niggas' look bad, strap it in the book bag
School of hard knocks was in a crook class; shook ass
Actin' all hard, you know who we are
We be rock-n-rollin'; no guitars cuz we stars
Shinin', blindin', a whole nother' climate
My niggas' on the block like an offensive lineman
I don't tell them haters "I'm back", say I'm rewinding
9 on my hip for the nonsense, we mobbin'
Every hoe I fuck once, wanna fuck again
Cuz I prolly cut em, Barry Sanders rushin' in
Niggas' fuck wit us but um, we don't fuck wit them
Catch me in a car dashing like my name was fuckin' Kim
Ha!

[Chorus: Meek Mill] (2x)
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
I'm so mafuckin' fly, hoe, I'm bout to levitate
Im leering, Im leering, Im leering, Im leering
Bitch, Im leering, Im leering, Im leering, Im leering

[Verse 1]
He used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that he hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids

[Drop]
Reminded me of when we were kids
Reminded me of when we were kids

[Verse 1]
He used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that he hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids

[Drop]
Reminded me of when we were kids
Reminded me of when we were kids

[Outro]
He used to call me DN

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life I'll show you what's there
There was a tongue to share but there
I care, I care, Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you there)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you there)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you there)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you there)

I've traveled the world until tonight
But I've never seen a stars come to life
But when I see you the sky turns light
And when the lights gone I'll drown in your eyes
Come with me I'll take you for a ride
Into the night I'll teach you how to fly
Let it go, I'll show you how to dice
So come with me I'll take you lit the light

You're my destination
You're my destination

I've traveled the world until tonight
But I've never seen a stars come to life
But when I see you the sky turns light
And when the lights gone I'll drown in your eyes
Come with me I'll take you for a ride
Into the night I'll teach you how to fly
Let it go, I'll show you how to dice
So come with me I'll take you lit the light

[Intro]
Mm-mm-mm
Hm-mm
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I heard you come in at a quarter 'til three
You closed the door and laid down next to me
But then I heard you say her name in your sleep
Your dirty secret's too far gone to keep

[Chorus]
I, I, I
I'm 'bout to lose my
I, I am, I
I'm 'bout to lose my
My mind, my mind, my mind
'Bout to lose my
My mind, my mind, yeah
I think about you all the time
Woah, oh-oh-ah
Hey

[Verse 2]
You can't even look me dead in the eyes
Her love is strong, she got you hypnotized
You say you love me, but I know it's a lie
When I work so hard to keep you satisfied, ooh

[Chorus]
I, I, I
I'm 'bout to lose my
I, oh-oh, I am, I
I'm 'bout to lose my
My mind, my mind, my mind

My mind, my mind, my mind
'Bout to lose my

[Bridge]
Woah-woah
How could ya, how could ya do
Do this to me?
Hey, yeah, mm-mm-mm
No way, no way, she can't take you away from me
I sure won't stay, but I'll be damned if I ever leave
No way, no way, she won't take you away from me
I sure won't stay, but I'll be damned if I ever leave
If I ever leave
Anybody know what I'm talking about?
No way, no way, she can't take you away from me, yeah
No way, no way
And I sure won't stay, but I'll be damned if I ever leave

[Outro]
In my mind, my mind, my mind
I think about you all the, all the time
My mind, my mind, my mind
You will always be mine

[Intro]
(Man, that's what I'm doing...)
(Man, you know, you want some of that motherfucking homie)
(Nah, I'm... straight)
Hey there boys and girls!
Let me know if y'all with me y'all

[Verse]
I only play the games that I win at
And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats
As a matter of fact, let me rephrase
With more rhymes than ways to fillet felines these days
Watch the path of the black one, Super-villain
Who wrecks clubs for delf in a drunken stupor chillin'
Ready and willin' to inadvertently foil that plan of
The rhymers, they be whiners like spoiled brats
Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose?
And holds mics like he knows karate body blows?
Nobody knows the trouble I see
From the MPV fly dirty tailin' the bubble eye thirty
For the record, this is some shit I just thought of y'all
It's science fiction that's not permissible in no court of law
I live to rock mics in 3-D
The only reason I'll seek to stop, to snuff the TV
I heard beats, they sound like karaoke with monkey rhymers
On a leash like "Don't let this nigga choke me"
Hit 'em with a penny so we could get these peanuts
And I thought we was nuts
I used to get free cuts
They lock Lex Luthor up in Green Haven
Since when a nigga never really been clean-shaven
Misbehavin' rap stars need Listament
Call me Mr. Bent, I'm at where your sister went, intelligent
Used to write and be well-spoke
Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell–
Tell joke
This could lead to catastrophe
'Bout to stop the violence right after these last of three
Shots from the black bat that got me at headlock
Holdin' on to sanity by strands of bitch's dreadlock
She told me "get off", I said "Bitch!"
"Let me set this shit off so I could get rich"
So then this shit hit me like the point of intoxication
I'ma come out and rock this nation like ox defacing
A lotta niggas out is rusty like oxidation
In this world's strangest, most dangerous occupation (wow!)
I could do it, I'm the super like in your building
Villain like trife Kinder is in All My Children
Plottin', and it's sure to pay ends
With some real mature womens and some more of they friends
When bad men roll tight, it's actual true
Like a pack of Big Bambú, with natural glue
Who grip necks of deuce, dukes to triple X
He just came in 4-D, follow the ripple effects
And it'll lead ya right to him
Oh, snap!
Seems we've walked into a trap through rap
Zoinks! This place is filled with pretender willies
One false move and get broke off like end of Phillies
Yes true believers, ain't nothing new to a
Crook with special powers like how to tell the future, uh...
I picture rhyme of the month, two page long
I'm in it with two gauges and my cape on wrong
Son, it's on, it's like a Raekwon tape song
With a fleet of superbad bitches, status: Rae Dawn Chong
Let me know if y'all with me, y'all (Hey!)
It's national and geographic, down to the titty ball
I represents MI City y'all
To my man Wiz doing his unsettling bids
You woulda' got away if it was not for them meddling kids

[Outro]
(Over here!)
M'er F'ers

At all times, nigga
Niggas get smacked up, backed up with gats strapped up
Haha, haha
(Huh?)

[Intro]
Oh and hey by the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh and hey by the way

[Verse 1]
All the stuff that you said
Hey, buddy, naw
Yeah, I heard what you said
All bets are off
You're a choke artist, man
Man you would have stalled
Running against my race, you're lost
We're all at the matinee
The American mall
Where corporations won't pay for effects they cause

[Chorus 1]
Oh, you won't get away!
Even in your fast car
Oh, you won't get away!
Send your son to the stars
Oh, you won't get away! Hey Hey!
Smoke in the garage
Going to your head
'Cause your intentions are dead
Dead wrong

[Post-Chorus]
Deep, deep down body thurst
Wrong
Deep down body thurst
Hey hey, yeah yeah!

[Verse 2]
Oh you won’t get away, yeah
Oh and hey by the way
Mane, fuck what you say
We're gonna climb your wall
Okay Murphy's Law
It'd be worth the fall
I sure hope you're just talking, man
And that's all
'Cause we'll go over it, under it, around it
We have the gall
Oh, you're not the Milky-way
Or the center star
It doesn't matter what you win
If inside you're lost

[Chorus 2]
Oh, you won't get away!
The way you treat Islam
Oh, you won't get away!
Jesus will open his arms
Oh, you won't get away! Hey Hey!
Mr. Wizard of Oz
It must be going to your head
'Cause your intentions are dead
Dead wrong!

[Post-Chorus]
Deep, deep down body thurst!
Wrong!
Deep down body thurst!
Hey hey, yeah yeah!

[Outro]
Oh, and hey, by the way
Oh, and hey, by the way
Oh, and hey, by the way
Oh, and hey, by the way
As you listen to this, know that we're designed for you
Oh, and hey, by the way

Don't be surprised if the guilty is among us

You know that you got it right when people ask, "Hey, what are you on?"
Well, this is the vivid state that revolutions are born
Did you ever realize that universe just means one song
Your soul knew it all along, you were dancing when you were born
Yeah

[Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams]
Contemplating time and space
Light is raging then erase
How I stand in the same place?
Connect the million by the waist (Skrt, skrt)
ESPN with the mace
It come to me when I gaze
And when I listenin' to waste
My mind receive it then it plays

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
Forward, forward, forward, forward
But it takes you just to lay back, lay back, lay back
Lean forward, forward, forward
I think it's really cool to lay back, lay back, lay back
Come on and lean forward, forward, forward
They keep telling you to lay back, lay back, lay back
But you gotta lean forward, forward, forward, forward
They say come on man lay back, lay back, lay back

[Verse 4: Shay Haley & Pharrell Williams]
It's what possessed the slave to look in the river (Shoo, shoo)
Then he saw his true master, fuck is a mister?

And sober is the only worthy system (Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo)
And he's the co-creator with the giver

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
Detach yourself (let go, let go, let go, let go, let go)
Re-pack yourself
Be back yourself (let go, let go, let go, let go, let go)
And dream as yourself
Be seen as yourself (let go, let go, let go, let go, let go)
Beam as yourself
Scream as yourself (let go, let go, let go, let go, let go)
And be king of yourself

Lightning fire magic prayer
Lightning fire magic prayer
N.E.R.D

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Light bulb, fire and cause of all that is
There was, and will be, beyond beginnings and end
The town, they say it's you, that starts the fire
Without matches that will open desire

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Live wire going through your body
Burn the old, make you anew
It's a mystical experience party
The universal connection to you
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic, mad ethnic
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic, mad ethnic
Where do I begin?

[Chorus 1: Pharrell Williams]
Lightning Fire Magic Prayer
Far beyond the gaseous layer
What if we all put our hands in the air?
For that lightning fire magic prayer

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Sometimes, you may have to do unpopular things
For them to see your faith lately go sane
You may not refer to it by a name
Long as you know it is from whence you came

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Livewire go through your body
Burn the old, make you anew
It's a mystical experience party
The universal connection to you
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic, mad ethnic
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic, mad ethnic
Where do I begin?
I begin, I began, I began

Catch me out here

Catch me out here (Hey)

[Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams]
They got the crazed look in their eyes
Something in the water
Everybody's in a trance
Because the brainwash is in high tide
Something in the water
You can tell when they dance

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
Wasn't everything that everybody promised
Once you tried it, did you think that you could stop it?
Everything has a cause, did you profit?
You can't see your life, until you sit and watch it

[Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams]
They got that crazed look in their eyes
Something in the water
Everybody's in a trance
Because the brainwash is in high tide
Something in the water
You can tell when they dance

[Verse 4: Pharrell Williams]
A young fish doesn't know that it's wet (Yeah)

Can somebody burst it down?
Waitin' for the great, I am
Can somebody burst it down?
Waitin' for the great, I am

[Chorus 1: Pharrell Williams]
Come on now, lightning fire magic prayer
I can't believe it's never been done
Imagine if we once, all hands in the air?
For that lightning fire magic prayer

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
Where do I begin?
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic, mad ethnic
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic, mad ethnic
Where do I begin?

[Verse 1: Gary Lightbody]
Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

[Hook: Both]
And right before your eyes
I’m breaking
No fuss, no reasons why
Just you and me
(e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he)

[Chorus: Both]
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(eye, eye)

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

[Hook: Both]
And right before your eyes
I’m aching
No fuss, nowhere to hide
Just you and me
(e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he)

[Chorus: Both]
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(eye, eye)

[Bridge: Taylor Swift and Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time you tell me I’ve got it wrong
This is the last time I say it’s been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won’t hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho

[Chorus: Both]
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
If you don't know by now
I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot
Never let the plane come down
Forever on some fly shit
Yeah, I got it vibing
Baby girl knows my sound
I'm your royal highness
Baby going fast for me
Then I tell her slow it down
I ain't really worried about
When my time gon' come
'Cause I know it's now
I been really grinding
Baby, come find me
Gotta let me know you're down
I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot
Never let the plane come down
Forever on some fly shit
Yeah, I got it vibing
Baby girl knows my sound
I'm your royal highness
Baby going fast for me
Then I tell her slow it down

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
On the west side yeah I'm living proof
Started small but now everything new
I spit like I ain't got no tooth
Flying topless, the plane got no roof
I'ma shine till my name in the sky
I'ma ball hard and break all the rules
Graduated and hopped in that coupe
With my main girl now I gotta say bye to you
I can count up a mil on a bad day
She ain't down then she ain't got no use
By the way that she making that ass shake
I just told baby do what she do
She the type I got to search for
Wasn't handed to me, had to work for it
They riding the wave like a surf board
While the boy hotter than the earth core
Told her wait til' I go get my cash right
When the money was low she didn't act right
Caught up living in the fast life
To be the boss I paid the mad price
I be with some women watching Friday
Smoking spliffs up on the highway
Shawty call me royal highness
'Cause I did this shit my way

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
If you don't know by now
I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot
Never let the plane come down
Forever on some fly shit
Yeah, I got it vibing
Baby girl knows my sound
I'm your royal highness
Baby going fast for me
Then I tell her slow it down
I ain't really worried about
When my time gon' come
'Cause I know it's now
I been really grinding
Baby, come find me
Gotta let me know you're down
I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot
Never let the plane come down
Forever on some fly shit
Yeah, I got it vibing
Baby girl knows my sound
I'm your royal highness
Baby going fast for me
Then I tell her slow it down

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh for real
Real expensive, my clothes
I'm reinventing flows
Presidential, my smoke
You guys are little clones
Go 'head and wash your self up
The only loud smell should be the dope
Everything else is top shelf
Dinner on a boat, smoking a joint
I call that time to kill
I don't trip, I let shit slide
But niggas 'round me will
5k, Vegas at Tao, The owner pay the bill
Best seats
We at the game, I'm ashing on the field
Soon as we board the plane, they screwing up they faces
Money in cases, old watches, colorful bracelets
Some of us famous
The others just started they come-up

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
If you don't know by now
I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot
Never let the plane come down
Forever on some fly shit
Yeah, I got it vibing
Baby girl knows my sound
I'm your royal highness
Baby going fast for me
Then I tell her slow it down
I ain't really worried about
When my time gon' come
'Cause I know it's now
I been really grinding
Baby, come find me
Gotta let me know you're down
I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot
Never let the plane come down
Forever on some fly shit
Yeah, I got it vibing
Baby girl knows my sound

Baby going fast for me
Then I tell her slow it down

[Intro]
Started small with nothing
Now I got it all
I still want more
Who say I can't have that too?
You feel me..

[Verse 1]
Foot on the gas, both hands on the steering wheel
Jumped in the game, 'cause I know it's real
Heard it'll change you, I know it will
Gatting still, we made it over the hill
Being broke, I know how it feel
All about a dollar bill
And seeing my son grow up
See, they ain't know what they focus was
That's when I see my lane open up
Drinking champagne on boats
So drunk that I'll probably spend a month sober
Little more famous but a lot older
Been through situations, niggas acting bipolar
You don't always keep it real with me, I don't know ya
Say they good intentions, but they not even close
Say they got sick of whips, but i'm driving the most
Nigga I be on my shit, you ain't gotta provoke me
Fuck you talking bout it

[Chorus]
You know it ain't like it was before
I know it feel like I've been here before
We know that it's all about the dough
What that mean
If it ain't we out the door....
Hit the bank and I'm counting more
I know to the top's where we can go
You know that it's all about the dough
What that mean
If it ain't we out the door

[Verse 2]
All I know is I been here before
Blew that smoke in the air before
Smell like dope in the airport
I'm the one that they're cheering for
Lotta kush smoke, that's what they preparing for
Gave you solid shit before now you hearing more
Seeing my niggas on top that's what I stand for
And only money conversations what I care for
And anytime you eat just know you gotta share yours
Them niggas out to get you, claiming they down
Shit change when you turn around
So it's no love for them
It's only papers when I roll up
Focus on the money now and not later
Ain't got the time to play
Thirteen cars in the driveway
God telling me keep going
One foot on the gas, two hands when I'm rolling
(Ay what chu doin nigga?)
Getting mine and staying focused

[Chorus]
You know it ain't like it was before
I know it feel like I've been here before
We know that it's all about the dough
What that mean
If it ain't we out the door....
Hit the bank and I'm counting more
I know to the top's where we can go
You know that it's all about the dough
What that mean
If it ain't we out the door

[Outro]
So you really need all those?
That's how much you gon smoke?

[Intro]
Yeah, I'ma need the whole thing
Justize
Not half, I want the whole thing
We gon' take that
Put a few O's in there
Turn a couple of them around
And voila
Matter fact, we gon' have them everywhere
Yeah, bitch, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm rolling up another joint soon as the weeds gone
You ain't on gas, it just seems strong
You ain't a boss unless your team on
You niggas going broke, you need someone to lean on
Young rich nigga from the burgh
Said I was gon' make it and meant every word
I remember I was getting curved
Always back it up, 'cause actions speak louder than words
I be outta state growing strains
I be smoking ounces to the brain (strong)
I be pulling up with one rolled
Just say my name if you wanna smoke

[Hook]
I'm in my weed farm (yeah)
I'm in my weed farm (yeah)

[Bridge]
Now that shits legal, you know exactly what the fuck I been talking 'bout
I been sayin' this shit
Now you want some huh, ok I got you

[Verse 2]
Roll the paper, I ain't smoking blunts
O a day, That's two pounds a month
Put it in my lungs and then I'm good
Only smoking fire like I should
Used to deal with niggas tryna tax
Now I'm throwin' pounds and growing them back
Multi million dollars in the safe (mills)
Homie I been getting it from the gate
Pushing weight outta state
Putting big ass orders up on my plate
See, you was down to stand in line, I couldn't wait
You must not heard about the amount I'm finna make

[Hook]

Now they got a girl and her best friend
Let 'em take shots, now they feelin' it
Tell me that I'm better than her ex man
If I hit it once, I'ma hit again, yeah
I be gone with the wind
In a Hellcat can't handle it
Can't even push the whole pedal in
Y'all niggas broke, can't get it fixed

Puffy, all about my benjamins

All about the check like Federline
I was out in Pittsburgh, pedalin'
Way before I was on television
Pack so loud I'm yellin' it
Want KK? I'm sellin' it, yeah
All they do is pretend
Won't keep it real 'cause they never did
Talk about life they ain't ever live
Talk about stripes they ain't ever get
Lookin' for the right one to let 'em in
I'ma get her right, in her element
Brain so bright, she intelligent

[Chorus]
These dudes ain't got no wins

Cookin' Soul
Yeah
It's all about a dollar man
Don't let nobody else tell you anything otherwise
Unless it's me
Uh

[Verse 1]
Leave my iPhone cracked if I take a loss
Know I'm gon get it back, I'm always on attack
Learn to let the money stack, homies turn to rats
When you deal with certain cats, they deserve the facts
Stay in constant meditation, always burning back
Wipe them ashes off my lap, you ain't part of my set
It's harder to maintain than it is to get
That's why you hold on to it and don't ever forget
That you did good with less just gotta deal with the stress
It's part of the game

[Chorus]
Sometimes things ain't gon work out
How you think you want it to go
Sometimes you gotta keep going
When you think you can't no more
Sometimes you can't depend on
Who you think you can no more
Sometimes you gotta try, gotta try and
Figure it out

[Verse 2]
Knowing your worth is half the battle
Keep fuck niggas out of your circle
Yeah they gon try to hurt you
See you focusing, they try to divert you
Being fake ain't rare, it's universal
That's why I'll never work with you
Family first, till I'm in the dirt
How these niggas bosses but they needing work
That's exactly why I don't believe em
Goals, set em, achieve em
Joints smoke em and leave em
Ten toes, no matter the season
Hot tub with my feet in
Living comfortably cheesing

[Chorus]
Sometimes things ain't gon work out
How you think you want it to go
Sometimes you gotta keep going
When you think you can't no more
Sometimes you can't depend on
Who you think you can no more
Sometimes you gotta try, gotta try and
Figure it out

[Outro]
You know what, playboy?
They always gonna wonder why
You gotta have a brand new car
Or why you gotta have the flyest watch
But you know what, playboy?
You just gotta keep doing you
Coz ain't nobody do you better than you
You look good doing it too, playboy
And you know what else
Them haters, they just gon keep hating man
And when you on top, people always gon want your spot
But you know what, playboy?
It's up to you whether you give it to them or not
So keep that in mind, playboy

You know what I smoke

I always supply it anytime you want
There ain't no need to deny
You're suppose to be in the sky
Some people think it's a lie, but I don't even know why
I put my weed in a cone
We smoking weed like a tribe
You smoking weed to get by
We smoking weed to survive
Smoking that medical

[Outro: Mr. Easy Rider]
Yeaaheaa
This one goes out to all my patients and paitent-ettes
With that medical weed card yall
And I heard it's legal in Nevada too
Recreation on Seattle
So if you got your ID
Make sure you show up to your local dispensary
And cop you some of that KK
And tell em I sent you
And to all the states that ain't legalize it yet
Get on board man
We need the green
Make the world a better place
By putting the grass all in your face
Free the weed
Let everybody's who's locked up out of jail
And let all these patients get well
There ain't nothing wrong with it
You was just raised to think it was bad
But now its time to change your mind
Open your eyes yall
Look around, everybody's getting high

[Intro]
Mhm
Let me talk to you
Show you something that you probably seen before, but you never seen it like this

[Verse 1]
Physically fit, smoking that shit you can't get
If it don't make dollars, then well it don't make sense
Got my crib out in Cali, buy everything for my kid
You hear me talk about it, fuckin' right, it's what I live
Lean back, hit the chronic
She like "Why it so intense?"
I say don't "Don't worry 'bout it, keep your mind up on these chips"
And these niggas out plotting
They broke so they got something against us
Pot, we smoke it anywhere

[Chorus]
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw

[Verse 2]
Don't get to a comfortable point
And back off
Gotta be sharp, the game's filled with whack artists
I ain't hating on you dawg, get yours
But don't ever think I'm convinced
These eyes covered by lenses
'Cause I'm probably high as your rent
See the Forbes list, think it got him content
But I'm not, I'm still hustling hard
Won't let my paper stop

[Chorus]
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw

Leave that shit to them little niggas, real talk
We out with it
Uh

[Verse 1]
Don't leave the door open cause we smokin'
Proceed with caution when you approachin'
Jump in my ride, I'm getting ghost
Don't ever go no where without my bros
Round the best, you get exposed
Them execs we ain't sweatin those
I'm in sweatpants looking for the remote
Rocking better clothes than the ones that was fly before us
When it come down to paper, I'm trynna get the highest portion
Pull out the old school just so I can slide the Porsche in
I worked hard for mine, french bulldogs all in the yard
Won't change course or fall off
Paid the cost to be the boss
When you the man you don't play your hand, you deal the cards
Me I'm owning the building and smoking weed in every room in it
Pulling up high as fuck to your event
Shirt open, my chains swanging
Don't rep the gang if you can't hang

[Interlude]
As simple as that
Matter of fact the shit kinda complex
So don't try this at home
Fuck around and learn something you young ass nigga

[Verse 2]
It's bigger than nino, we know
We the last generation that's worshipping Al Pacino
Seen it first hand in Casino
But nigga's gotta go down that road to find out
I smoked a couple j's i rolled a couple more fore' I'm out
You ever been to where I'm from you probably know
What I'm bout
Stay ready for the occasion
Time equals money that's the equation
You nigga's look funny trynna ride the wave
I hope that you crash
And nobody dive in and save you
They call it the game, watch how they play you
My life is a movie, you wanna stay through
Still think I'm the realest nigga to this day
Them other nigga's is hand made
Under pressure they break
I just do this for my gang's sake
I don't get time away
I'ma light this j

[Chorus]
We don't stop hustling
Nah, never
We don't stop grinding
Hell naw
We don't stop going hard
Nope
Made a lot of paper but I got a long way to gooooooo
We don't stop hustling
Nah, never
We don't stop grinding
Hell naw
We don't stop going hard
Nope
Made a lot of paper but I got a long way to go

[Outro]
This is a really big performance for me like
This is something that I kinda take seriously
I love performing, I love being in front of people
Like the festival crowds are always dope
So it's just something that I not only look forward to
But I try and make sure I'm really prepared for
So I can go out there and just have the best show

[Intro]
You hear that?
It's paper
Its bout paper, get your money man
Get yours

[Verse 1]
Lay up, if you wanted me, I'm 6 o'clock
That mean I stay up
See you niggas standing in a line
I got my weight up
A lot of niggas owing dues, man
It's time to pay up
Smoke a joint with my girl every time we wake up
In your city, but don't plan on staying
If you ain't talking 30 million
Then we can't arrange it
Yeah
I treat the game like I'm renovating
They call me the landlord
I got all the tenants hating
Look at my tennis bracelet
There's all these diamonds in it
And plus my watch is icy too
That means it's time to get it
Yeah, I think they scared of me like I'm the dentist
Like it run in the fam, everyone 'round about our business
And I get high off fitness
That mean I'm smoking strong
Bet all these diamonds will you give you something to focus on
Your girl love my song
My chain cool the Fonz
My kush be the bomb
It sing like Solange

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That they say that we can't get dough?
All money
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That they say that we can't smoke?
Kush
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That they say that we can't rep Taylor?
Taylor Gang
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That we can't keep getting that paper?
Hell no

[Verse 2]
Big stunner, ex-weed runner
My bitch hotter than the middle of the summer
Rocking anything I want and
Still watch for undercovers
Like, I'm just on the sheet
Money make me feel complete
See, you don't do this everyday
That mean you can't compete
I'm on top of the game
But I came from underneath
Never tame me, I'ma beast
Watch my change increase
Used to just show up
But now I make them pay them fees
Used to smoke blunts
Now I need the paper
Being broke ain't in my nature
Either block out what they say
Or use the talk as motivation (uh)
We at the top and know they hating
Know sometimes they like the child that whine and get impatient
But there ain't no complaining

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That they say that we can't get dough?
All money
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That they say that we can't smoke?
Kush
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That they say that we can't rep Taylor?
Taylor Gang
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where we go, go, go
That we can't keep getting that paper?
Hell no

[Outro]
And that's how it is
I just got on the plane, you know what I'm saying?
Smelling like about 5 thousand dollars worth of Khalifa Kush
And I dare somebody to say something to me, motherfucker
Taylor Gang or die
And the gang is for gang
Yeah bitch, yeah

[Chorus]
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel

[Verse 1]
Hotel smoked out
I ain't going nowhere
Leaving in the morning
Cleaning lady picking up roaches, so she don't care
How I move so player? G Pen, mid-air
High school I was getting high
Teacher say I was going nowhere
Now I'm worth millions that's the worst feeling
Said fuck a job bought the building
All these fake niggas where the real ones
First-class no shoes, young nigga I got no rules
6'1", no roof, go hard won't lose
And you know the truth, I got more to do
Already made history once
Fuck I'm supposed to do?
Big bag, no seeds
Yeah I rap and I grow weed
When you this great, niggas don't hate
It's about dollars so it can't wait

[Chorus]
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel

[Verse 2]
Break down the gas roll another one
Puff one J, roll my brother one
Already stoned and I'm almost home
If you high then you know where I'm coming from
KK feel it all in my lungs, one puff damn got me going numb
Everywhere I go niggas want some
(Damn, man let me get some of that shit)
No, high all day I ain't coming down
Take two pulls then it's going round
Since a young nigga I been blowing pounds
Always in the sky I ain't on the ground
Jump in the ride about to blow a cone
Niggas at the crib so I'm solo
Take this half-ounce to the dome
Smoke this hash out of the bong
Don't choke don't pass out until the morning
In the club throwing cash out 'til it close
And I stay with the pack on any coast
KK cut down to a clone
Gameday touchdown Randy Moss
Say we just ran out so we getting more
We gone smoke 'til we ain't got anymore
Don't just roll one roll plenty more

[Chorus]
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel
Know that shit'll get real in that city of steel

[Outro]
Wanna be together, without any way
I don't wanna know better
Changing my name, and I'm quitting the game
This time I know

Tonight I'm getting sober

[Verse 1]
I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me "Baby" like tryin' on clothes

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

[Verse 2]
Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
(Inside my room, oh)
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once (Hey), I've been waiting, waiting (Waiting)
Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one
I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting)
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

[Bridge]
Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul (My soul), ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once
'Cause you're the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Hate! Bad bitches wanna be my bae
Hate! Hunt me down like the C.I.A
Hate! Side of my car, tryna see my face
Hate! Want me to beat it like the T.I. case

Hate! Hatin' niggas can't believe my race
Hate! Niggas hit you with the Eli face, oh

Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Hate! You keep askin' me where I'm from
Hate! About the borders and, "Did I run?"
Hate! Keep askin' how I feel 'bout guns
Hate! There's a light and dark army, which side you choose? Oh
Hate! If not now then when?
Hate! And if not me then who?
Hate! Don't drink the Kool-Aid, my friends
Hate! I tried to tell y'all about this dude

I get it how I live it
I live it how I get it
Count the mothafuckin' digits
I pull up with a lemon
Not 'cause she ain't livin'
It's just your eyes get acidic
And this here ain't a scrimmage
Mothafucka, we ain't finished
I told you we won't stop
A nigga 'bouta business
Like yours, but you rent it
Wave hello to the top
Nigga the Veyron glide
Tell the paparazzi get the lens right
Got the window down, top, blowin' la
Got the hazards on, only doin' five

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
You can find P, Skateboard in the La Ferrar'
And the truck behind me got arms
Yeah, longer than LeBron
Just waitin' for my thumb like The Fonz
Woo! This beat tastes like lunch
But it's runnin' from veneers and it's runnin' from the fronts
But everyday, hey, wasn't lemonade
I was afraid, once a nigga graduate
Would I be okay?
So I prayed and I played
Nigga, i am OTHER, we got our office in space
Warp speed, Doctor Spock couldn't chase, nigga

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face

Mothafucka, we ain't finished
I told you we won't stop
A nigga 'bouta business

Got the window down, top, blowin' la
Got the hazards on, only doin' five

[Verse 1]
I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I–

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

[Verse 2]
I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance?
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I–

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
(Knew we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

[Bridge]
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again)

[Chorus]
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Oh, yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)
Yeah, we were dancing (Oh)
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
(Dancing with our hands tied)
Yeah, we were dancing (Ooh)
And I had a bad feeling (Had a bad feeling)
But we were dancing

[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Hands tied, hands tied (Dancing)

[Verse 1]
I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing"
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad (Oh)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Post-Chorus]
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da

Da-da da-da

[Bridge]
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons

So light me up (Light me up), light me up (Light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (Light me up)
Light me up (Light me up), light me up (Light me up)

Oh, you say I did something bad

Why's it feel so good, good?
So bad, why's it feel so good?
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (Bad)
It just felt so good, good

[Verse 1]
See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…

[Verse 2]
Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…

[Refrain]
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

[Bridge]
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting? (One, two, three)

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall (Pieces fall) right into place
Getting caught up in a moment (Caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep (Oh)
And I'm yours to lose (Baby)
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…

[Refrain]
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

[Intro]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacin', I just need you

[Pre-Chorus]
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time"

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 2]
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes (Echoes) of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And baby, for you
I would (I would) fall from grace
Just to (Just to) touch your face
If you (If you) walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right)

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right, no)
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

Don't blame me, love made me crazy (Oh-oh-oh)
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (You ain't doin' it right)

Don't know how to keep on going
When our car is on the road, we're slowing down
But we got to keep on driving
We're the young kids and we've got to get around

You always got to move on, move on
When the people say we're so wrong, so wrong
They don't know that we're dressed in talent
And they don't know that we're on, on, on it now

[Pre-Chorus]
We're on on, on on
We're on on
We're on on
We're on on on it now
We're on on, on on
We're on on
I'm on on
And the kids are saying

[Chorus]
You can kiss my beauty
'Cause you know you're never gonna shut us down
You can kiss my beauty
'Cause you know that kids will always be around
You can kiss my beauty now
You can kiss my beauty now

[Verse 2]
We don't know how to stop this feeling
We're so electric, we've got static in our bones
Don't know if we're only dreaming
We're ultraviolet and we're dancing on our own

We're never gonna slow down again
'Cause I don't want this feeling to end
Now they know we're dressed in talent
And they know that we are on, on, on it now

[Pre-Chorus]
We're on on, on on
We're on on
We're on on
We're on on on it now
We're on on, on on
We're on on
I'm on on
And the kids are saying

[Chorus]
You can kiss my beauty
'Cause you know you're never gonna shut us down
You can kiss my beauty
'Cause you know that kids will always be around
You can kiss my beauty now
You can kiss my beauty now

[Bridge]
Kiss

You think you know us but you don't
You think you know us but you don't
You think you know us but you don't

We're on on, on on
We're on on
I'm on on
I'm on on on it now
We're on on, on on

Get your guns out
And make your move now
Make your move now

[DC Pierson]
The story takes place, uhh, I guess like 3 or 4 summers ago
Umm, the summer immediately after I graduated from high school at the condo of my friends Chuck, Trevor and Alicia in Tempe, Arizona
They had all moved in together, they were like my three best friends from high school
We just graduated and they all moved in cause they were gonna go to ASU
So for the summer, this place was like our drunken clubhouse
Like, we would just get blitzed, and I would pass out on the couch and wake up and drive home the next day, great

Um, they had this 4th of July party, and this girl shows up
Now this girl had definitely been in our circle of friends, she was just cute as balls and adorable, just the sweetest girl you could ever possibly know, and everybody loved her

Umm and, when she shows up to this party, and she had had a boyfriend until very, very recently–they broke up
And she shows up at this party and I just remember a moment of "this girl is fucking gorgeous" like amazing, amazing
And it's kinda ON between me and her, it's kinda on, There's a thing
And like we're just talking and it's there–it's just there
We're making out on a balcony, it's great
Um, and then this guy shows up

And now this guy was a year younger than her, two years younger than me
And he was a cool kid–smart, funny, all that stuff
But yeah, it was like her best friend, this is like her best friend, year younger than her
And he had a reputation for just showing up to parties, drink ten shots in a row, and just fucking go nuts and then pass out
And that night, he does that very thing: Shows up 4th of July, drinks ten shots in a row, fucking goes crazy
He doesn't go crazy for long, because before long, he's just human sludge
He's so drunk they just dump him in the bathtub and he's just-you know

And so, it's her best friend, so naturally she goes to his aid and she's a sweetheart and she wants to take care of him and all this stuff, she's bringing him towels and stuff like that
But I still kinda want it to be on, I don't want this to fuck up the thing we had going on
So I go position myself next to her, who's next to him in the bathtub
So she's taking care of her--she's taking care of him, I'm like still kinda trying to-like NOT–I'm aware of the situation, I'm aware there's a dude there puking–but I'm still trying to kinda make it happen

And, but the unfortunate thing is that this kid–whose my friend, her friend, everybody's friend
My bro has–everybody knows–this kind of unrequited love thing for this girl that I'm hitting on, that I made out with, and for like a long time
And I been down that road, I knew it was a fucking suicide mission, I knew it was a terrible idea
And he was my bro, so I guess I should've still respected that even though I knew it was dumb


But I-I don't know, I guess like kids like me and kids like him–these like awkward, like-introverted, bookish-like theatre kids who develop these stupid unrequited love things–like when it finally-something does comes along, we think we deserve it
Like, damn the consequences, damn like right or wrong, we're just like "I DESERVE IT! I'm sensitive, I deserve it!"

So I felt bad, and even in the moment, I knew that it was wrong...but it was just there
And I just-I dunno and like, it was great
We ended up having a thing that summer, it was really--it was cool
But it kind of makes me sound like a dick
And it is a dick--it, it, it was a dick thing
And to this day, I'm, like, feel like a dick about it

[Dominic Dierkes]

[I was in] Grade 6– at this point 6th, 7th grade–
And i'm still like, really like-like we're friendly--it wasn't like she ignored me, uh, you know
Like I made her laugh in classes and stuff and we were friends but it wasn't like-we didn't hang out outside of school or anything

So, it was like Valentine's Day
I decide that I'm going to--this is probably the closest–if this story had actually followed through, would be the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to me
I went--so we went to mass that morning–it was a catholic school, so we went to catholic mass–we're down at church and the night before, every little homeroom had their own little Halloween--excuse me--their own little Valentine's Day party
So, I decided--and we were gonna exchange valentines or whatever--so I decided the night before to make her a "secret admirer" little poem
And I don't remember what the-I really do, I'm not holding out, I really do wish what the poem said, but it was just something just really like struggling to rhyme
Like my whole goal was: make it rhyme and make it say "I like you", those were the two things, so it wasn't, like, artful in many ways

So I, so uh, and I signed it "Secret Admirer" and I typed it out on the computer, printed it out so that my handwriting wouldn't be obvious and I like put it in an envelope
So each homeroom had their stack of Valentine's Day cards so I went in--yeah, they each had their own stack of Valentine's Day cards
So we all went down to mass, and I had my little letter, and so we were all in church, and I get up to go to the bathroom, and I run upstairs to homeroom and I slip this envelope in her-in the stack of valentines cause she wasn't in my homeroom

So I go downstairs and I sit in mass, and I'm kind of very pleased with myself like I'm gonna pull this off
And then for the next like 45 minutes that mass took, I was-I just completely mind-fucked myself into thinking it was the worst idea ever
I just sitting there, I went from like "Yeah, I pulled this off" to just sitting there like "You're an-you're an idiot, man. This is probably the gayest thing anyone can do"
And just like "people are gonna know its me", "I'm not gonna be able to like-and what do I even have to stand to gain by it? Like if I ever admit that it's me, people will be like "You're lame", but if I don't admit to it, then she'll never know it was me"
So I was just-it was like-I was just sitting there sweating just looking–and I couldn't get up to go to the bathroom again cause they wouldn't let me
So I was just like  "alright so I gotta get to that-" so then it became "Well, I gotta get to that envelope before anyone reads. I just gotta-I just gotta make that happen"
So all the homerooms--mass ends, and we all get up to go to our classes to have a little Valentine's Day party
We're all walking up the stairs and I'm like walking–like speedwalking and just like "hey whatever", I must've looked crazy
And then just go to the homeroom, and I'm like in the homeroom and I grab my letter, the letter that I had written
And then like, this is like before anyone was in the homeroom, but they're like SECONDS behind me
So I like grab the letter and shove it in my pocket, and then all the kids walk in like "Oh! You're not in our homeroom. What are you doing here?"
And I was just like "Oh! Right! Yeah yeah yeah sorry, I thought we were-I thought the party was in h-I gotta go" and I just left
And I just completely bolted and went to my homeroom and I took--and I was like "how do i dispose this thing"

So I literally ripped up the letter in the homeroom, went to the bathroom and flushed it down the toilet and then I was just like "*sigh* Thank god, I just created this massive problem for myself"

[mcDJ]
That's fucking hilarious

[Becca]
Okay, "what happened when my dad got his finger cut off"
My dad didn't get his finger cut off, my dad cut off his own finger

Um, I wasn't there, but he was in Michigan with my two younger sisters chopping wood for his wood furnace that he installed last winter
And he had repositioned the log or so he told me, he kept it still with his left hand, the axe was in his right hand, he came down to chop the log in half
It missed, and chopped the top third of his left index finger
He then proceeded to scream and alert my younger sister, one of whom was on the phone and who rushed over, started screaming when she saw the blood and all the rest of that
And so then they all got in the car, and drove to the emergency room together
My dad drove my sisters (12 and 10 respectively) 

[who] rode there crying, and he held the top of his finger on with a paper towel as they drove to the emergency room

He then got there and the doctor tried to re-attach the finger and my little sisters were still sitting there screaming, who had then called my mother
My mother was 4 hours away in Chicago, and she called me
I was with my friend and he and I were deciding how to go to a suburb to rescue his mom
Rescue, I say, because she locked her keys in the car
So my grandma was coming to pick us up to take the three of us to save the parent who hadn't cut the finger off
And my mother said that she had to leave for Michigan to pick up my sisters, who were still with my dad in the emergency room

So my dad proceeded to have emergency like, kind of surgery, but not exactly
And um-- have I told you this story before? I told you this before, haven't I?

[mcDJ]
Yeah

[Becca]
Have I? Okay, good, just checking
Okay so, my dad was--he had taken painkillers so he was kind of numb
But after my aunt and my cousin had come to pick up my sisters and brought them to my mom–cause my parents are no longer on speaking terms, which is why she didn't go all the way to the hospital
So she picked them up from midway, and then drove them all the way back to the city
And my dad, though he was looped up on Vicodin, held his finger on again as he drove the 4 hours back to Chicago all by himself

And now 6 months later, it's still healing
The bone hasn't grown back, it's like chopped in 3 fingers at the end of it
But the two of us with the car and the mother who hadn't chopped her finger off were just fine
And we just picked her up from the Starbucks
And brought her the keys
And then left
And went shopping or something

[Verse 1]
You took me out one night
Under blackened skies
I slept in your bed
Let the spark ignite

[Pre-Chorus]
This is torture, it can't be normal
Didn't even touch, I can't get enough

[Chorus]
When I feel a little lovesick
My heart is like électronique, whoa-whoa-whoa-oh
When I feel a little hazy
My body is mechanique, whoa-whoa-whoa-oh
Tu es mon étoile dans la galaxie
Et je suis suspendu, je suis

When I feel a little lovesick
My heart is like électronique, whoa-whoa-whoa-oh

Now you're on my mind
Your words are on my phone
Crawling through my blood
You won't leave me alone

[Pre-Chorus]
But I quite like it, I'm quite excited
Now I want to touch 'cause I can't get enough
To touch, to touch, to touch
'Cause I can't get enough

[Chorus]
When I feel a little lovesick
My heart is like électronique, whoa-whoa-whoa-oh

My body is mechanique, whoa-whoa-whoa-oh

[Verse 1]
I’m a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I used to be frightened by the devil
And drawn to those ones that weren't afraid
Remember you told me
Love was touching souls?
Surely you touched mine
Part of you pours out of me from time to time in these lines

[Chorus]
You’re in my blood like holy wine
You’re so bitter and so sweet, oh
I could drink a case of you, oh darling
And still be on my feet
Still be on my feet

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
You’re in my blood like holy wine
So bitter, so bitter, so, so sweet, oh
I could drink a case of you darling, oh yeah yeah
And I’d still be on my feet
And I’d still be on my
Still be on my feet
I’d still

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
Oh, what they think about you

[Chorus]
Oh, what they think about you
Prepare to leave my body when the time it comes through
Loving on you
'Til the time it comes through
Why you always hate to break bread?
Think about the way that you would feel if never said
Jokes on you
Well it's time to come through

[Verse]
Well if she had to choose me or her mom
I know I wouldn't last long, yeah
No problem with the truth
But when she made me laugh
Doom doom right to my tomb
I love that it's not hard to be in a place where laughing's easy like
What the fuck is real?
What the fuck is wrong?
I think I can fit with your tone, like

[Chorus]
Oh what they think about you
Prepare to leave my body when the time it comes through
Loving on you
'Til the time it comes through
Why you always hate to break bread?
Think about the way that you would feel if never said
Jokes on you
Well it's time to come through

[Bridge]
Time to come through
Time to come
Time to come through

[Outro]
You know I wanna be
Everything that you need
But I'm starting to see
You know I wanna be
Above everything
But I'm just not there yet

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away, if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I won't believe a word you say
I'm cut to pieces by the sound of every breath you take
I'm swimming through a sea of hurt
My life, my pride is stronger

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
It's time to sink or swim
It's time to sink or swim
It's time to sink or swim
To see who gets scared when the lights go dim

(No!) It's time to sink or swim
(No!) To see who gets scared when the lights go dim
(No!) It's time to sink or swim
(No!) To see who gets scared when the lights go dim

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is to fast, you just won't last

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter–
Flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, "This shit is garbage!"
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
Pectations and meet 'em, but first
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"

[Verse 1]
I lived in a house whose porch collected cigarettes
And every one I’d smoke held conversations from the night before
We all connected, lovers invested here

[Chorus]
Now we’re all gone!
But still I drive by it for no reason
But can’t tell how it makes me feel
Did I not savor it?
Memory reel
Is it all accurate?

[Verse 2]
In that house on the corner
There’s part of me stuck in the drywall
We’re all connected, lovers invested here
No one would think of where we’d all end up years from then

[Verse 3]
To old friends and those I’ve loved and lost:
I still think of you
I remember what I’ve learned
Hazy nights seen through a twisted plight
Did I do it right?
Did I do it right?

[Hook]
1-1-0-9
Two years of mine
I’ll flash back 96 months in a dream I had this last week

[Bridge]
(We’re disconnected)
Drug-filled bedrooms plagued part of that home
Tear-eyed partners' remnants haunt the halls

[Chorus]
Now we’re gone!
I drive by but I can’t tell how it makes me feel
Did I not savor it?
Memory reel
Would I still treasure it?

[Outro]
But I do
Here in the drywall
I collapse on you
Coiled legs under TV blue

What you thinking?
How you dreaming when you're dreaming?

Your eyelids flicker like a TV screen and...

I collapse on you (I collapse on your lap)
My calloused hands under TV blue (Calloused hands on your hand)
I want to collect all of the scary things
Hiding out where you sleep (Wanna collect, wanna collect)
Where you sleep (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

'Til I collapse on you (I collapse on your lap)
My static eyes under TV blue (Static eyes under...)

What could I do?
What could I do?
Wild-prairies and steam
Oh
Wedding ring, wedding ring
Wedding ring, wedding ring
Smoke ring
But what could I do? What can I do?
I got bit in my dream
Wedding ring, wedding ring
Wedding ring, wedding ring
Smoke ring
Smoke ring

[Intro]
"It's the same murder! You made our streets into what these people call the 'killing field!'"

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
The motherfuckin' dust kicker, who can you trust?
Do you have the heart to see a nigga, before you bust?
My name is spoken on the tongues of so many foes
Bustin' motherfuckers out the box, I ain't even go
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame?
From doin' flicks to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers got 'em duckin' from my smokin' Glock
And bustin' niggas asses to stay alive
Skinny ass player watchin' bigger motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm livin', I'm a hustler
Buckin' busters 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto, you ain't heard?
Niggas got they AKs headin' for them 'burbs
Aimin' at them skinhead bitches, let it rain
Givin' 'em a wet welcome to the house of pain

[Interlude]
"In a city that's upset by the challenge of racial tension at many levels, where the level of violence is higher this year than last"
"Our city is a war zone"

[Verse 2: Stretch]
Yo, I'm hunting down this nigga and he know so he stressin'
He better count his blessings and get ready for this lesson
The Stretch 'bout to teach him when I reach him with the MAC
And lay that ass down on his motherfucking back, Jack
Slack is something that a nigga don't take
His moms run the church, so I'ma see her at his fucking wake
Make way, the nigga paid me the other day
I'm walking with my son and the nigga got somethin' to say
Hey! The nigga tried to diss, boy, he got it twisted
He shoulda watched America's Most, I'm listed
For killing motherfuckers like him
So I'ma bring him to the House of Pain and kill him with a grin
Flim flam, god damn, I'm not the one
Before I choke him and smoke him
I'm gonna smack him with my fuckin' gun
Son, you made your last mistake and I don't know your name
But welcome to the House of Pain

[Interlude 2]
"In the second such case in recent memory, a Bronx woman being charged with murder in the shooting death of her daughter over her crack habit"

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
(Coughing) Huh, the country bud got me chokin'
I'm on a mission to the point that motherfuckers think I'm smokin'
Yeah, that sick nigga Biggie with the 8-shot fifth
With the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that a killing is thrilling?
All the blood spilling, is all a part of drug dealing
A born gangsta, my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 with the hollow-point slug
So when he licked shots, niggas dropped
Quicker than a bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tryna squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dues, while kids was on they one's and two's
Huh, now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the MAC-11 swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my momma through this strain
I'm livin' in the house of pain

[Outro]
"He reportedly tried to hide behind a parked car and then beg for his life before he was killed"
"A hostage in Brooklyn threatened with death, we have—"
"Registered this morning, they were kidnapped, held for ransom and strangled to death"
"They hurt us, humiliated us, took stuff for granted, stole from our community"

[Verse 1]
We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumping, make me wanna take my top off
Yeah, we'll be drinking and nobody's gonna stop us
And we'll be kissing anybody that's around us

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I just wanna go up tonight
Put me under the flashing light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight
I just wanna have fun tonight
(Blow up this shit tonight)
Put me under the flashing light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight
(Gon' blow...)

[Chorus]
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 2]
We're jumping in the pool and swimming with our clothes on
I poured a beer into my shoe and got my freak on
The neighbor's pissed and says he's gonna call the Five-O
If they show up then we are gonna give a good show

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I just wanna go up tonight
Pull me under the flashing light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight
I just wanna have fun tonight
(Blow up this shit tonight)
Put me under the flashing light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight
(Gon' blow..)

[Chorus]
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch, I'm Madonna
Tastes like holy water

[Post-Chorus]
We do it like this
You're gonna love this
You can't touch this
'Cause I'm a bad bitch
We do it like this
You're gonna love this
You can't touch this
'Cause I'm a bad bitch

[Bridge]
Who do you think you are?
You can't mess with this lucky star
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
You can't mess with this lucky star
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Who do you think you are?

[Outro]
Who do you think you are?
You can't mess with this lucky star
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
You can't mess with this lucky star

[Laughter]

[Filthy]
If you know what's good
If you know what's good
Haters gon' say it's fake
So real
Haters gon' say it's fake
So real
I said, put your filthy hands all over me
And no, this ain't the clean version
And what you gonna do with all that meat?
Cookin' up a mean servin'
No question, I want it
Fire up, everybody smokin'
Your friends, my friends
And they ain't leavin' till six in the morning (six in the morning)
Caught a chill, baby, you the coldest
Go far, put 'em on notice
If you know what I want, then yeah
Baby, don't you mind if I do, yeah
Exactly what you like times two, yeah
Got me singin', "ooh, ooh"
So baby, don't you mind if I do

[Rock Your Body]
Got time, but I don't mind
Just wanna rock you, girl

Come on let's give it a whirl
See, I've been watchin' you
And I like the way you move
So go 'head, girl, just do it
That ass shakin' thing you do
So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more
And you all could meet me in the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smellin' right
So you pass to the left, then you sail to the right
Don't be so quick to walk away (Dance with me)
I wanna rock your body, please stay (Dance with me)
You don't have to admit you wanna play (Dance with me)
Just let me rock you till the break of day (Dance with me)

Ladies and gentlemen
It's my pleasure to introduce to you
He's a friend of mine
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
"I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you"
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
"I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you"

[Sexyback]
I'm bringing sexy back
Them other boys don't know how to act
I think it's special, what's behind your back?
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack
Dirty babe
You see these shackles
Baby I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
Come here girl

Go ahead, be gone with it
Drinks on me
Go ahead, be gone with it

Sitting on the grass, laying side by side

Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy

There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it
Cry me a river (x8)

[Suit and Tie]
And as long as I got my suit and tie
Imma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love

[Until The End Of Time]
I woke up this morning
And heard the TV saying something
About disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm going
There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you, girl
And what you give me let's me know that I'll be alright
'Cause if your love was all I had, in this life
Well, that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you, girl, until the end of time

[Prince - I Would Die 4 U]
I'm not a woman
I'm not a man
I am something that you'll never understand
I'll never beat you
I'll never lie
And if you're evil I'll forgive you by and by
You, I would die for you, yeah
Darling if you want me to
You, I would die for you
You're just a sinner I am told
Be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good when you are bad
I'm not a human
I am a dove
I'm your conscious
I am love
All I really need is to know that
You believe
Yeah, say one more time
You, I would die for you

'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Can't Stop The Feeling]
I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavy when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we're in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it
Moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it
So don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance
Come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon
So keep dancing
Everybody sing
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Wanna see you move your body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
Come on

[Intro: Nic Nac & YG]
Let me see you
Mustard on the beat hoe

[Verse 1]
Put it on the line
Tell you how I'm feeling
Always on my mind
Even when I'm dreaming
Heart is beating faster
Walking on the ceiling
Keep on moving closer, closer
Give it to me, uh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
One hit baby and I'm yours (Ha ha, ha ha)
So sick, make me lose control, whoa-whoa
I'm hooked, now I want some more (Ha ha, ha ha)
Too much, gonna overdose, whoa-whoa

[Chorus]
'Cause your love taking me high, I wanna be your girl
Taste like lemonade skies pouring into my world
Got to jump on the ride, my rollercoaster
I can't give up the sweetest drug
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
When you called my phone (When you called my phone)
I was gonna answer (I was gonna answer)
I want you in my zone (I want you in my zone)
I want you in the shower (I want you in the shower)
Every single second (Every single second)
Every single hour (Every single hour)
Keep me coming over and over (yeah)
Give it to me, uh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
One hit baby and I'm yours (Ha ha, ha ha)
So sick, make me lose control, whoa-whoa
I'm hooked, now I want some more (Ha ha, ha ha)
Too much, gonna overdose, whoa-whoa

[Chorus]
'Cause your love taking me high, I wanna be your girl
Taste like lemonade skies pouring into my world
Got to jump on the ride, my rollercoaster
I can't give up the sweetest drug
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no (no, no)
(you're the sweetest drug, you're the sweetest drug, like)
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no (no, no)
(you're the sweetest drug, you're the sweetest drug, like)
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no (no, no)
(you're the sweetest drug, you're the sweetest drug, like)
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no (no, no)
(you're the sweetest drug, you're the sweetest drug, like)

[Verse 1]
You say you want me when I'm down on the floor
And when I'm ugly, you're always wanting me more
Yeah, in my bed, when I let it trip and it stop
We fall hand in hand
Yeah, I know you love my legs, even when they're not shaved
And I know you keep me in the same t-shirt for days
You're always by my side when I'm feeling deranged
You'll always be my man

[Chorus]
I like feeling like this
So give it to me like that
I like feeling like this
So give it to me like that
I like it like it like this
So give it to me like that
I like it like it like this
And I just want more and more

[Verse 2]
So, you'll be there when I'm old and I'm grey
Without my make up painted all of my face
And when I'm so sad, c'mon, let's do a race
We're losing hand in hand
Yeah, you know I love your hair in the morning time
You got your eyes screwed up from the brights of my light
I'm always by your side when you're scared in the night
You'll always be my man

[Chorus]
I like feeling like this
So give it to me like that
I like feeling like this
So give it to me like that
I like it like it like this
So give it to me like that
I like it like it like this
And I just want more and more
Here's something I've learned about people.

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.

This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.

The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.

When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?

Let me say it again, louder for those in the back...

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.

There will be no further explanation.
There will be just reputation.
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Patiently waiting ‘cause I know that soon or later
You'll be ready to understand who I am
Patiently waiting ‘cause I know it will be, know it will be okay
But I'm still at it
Lights, camera, action

[Verse 2]
And all the times you tried to stop me
Uhum, it ain’t working
Confident is not cocky
Uhum, I guess it’s working
I’m staying up till 6 in the morning
Just reminiscing about the past days
This rain just keeps on pouring
And I don't wanna leave it that way

[Chorus]
I just wanna know if you want to
Try and understand ‘cause I want you
I just wanna know if you want to
Try and understand ‘cause I want you

Figure it out cause I want you now, yes I know

[Verse 1]
Hey, my friend
How have you been?
You have been gone for so long
You look good, I knew you would
I've thought about you often

[Chorus]
When you were gone, oh, did you think of me?
When you were gone, did you think I would be waiting for you, the way that I have been?
When you were gone, were you wondering?
How was I doing?
Was I fine?
Know you were always on my mind
When you were gone, when you were gone
Did you think of me?

[Verse 2]
Now you're back
Putting on this act, that I was always in your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I didn't need you (wish I)
Wish I could believe ya' (wish I)
I wish I didn't want to know

[Chorus]
When you were gone, oh, did you think of me?
When you were gone, did you think I would be waiting for you, the way that I have been?
When you were gone, were you wondering?
How was I doing?
Was I fine?
Know you were always on my mind
When you were gone, when you were gone
Did you think of me?

[Bridge]
I was better than
Better when I was without you in my life
Now it's colder than
Colder than a frozen picture I left behind, in my mind
I was fine, but now you're here and I'm not doing so well

[Chorus]
When you were gone, oh, did you think of me?
When you were gone, did you think I would be waiting for you, the way that I have been?
When you were gone, were you wondering?
How was I doing?
Was I fine?
Know you were always on my mind
When you were gone, when you were gone
Did you think of me?

[Outro]
Did you think of me?
Did you think of me?
When you were gone, did you think of me?
When you were gone, did you think of me?
When you were gone, did you think of me?
When you were gone, did you think of me?
Did you?

[Intro: T-Pain]
You don't even know right now
I'm staring at my phone right now
Wondering if I should call you or leave you 'lone right now
I'm in my zone right now
I'm just, chilling at home right now
Shots of Patrón right now
I should put my phone right down
But girl, I'm so alone right now
That's why I'm

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Textin' my ex (oh no)
Don't nothing look good
I'm just talkin' 'bout sex (yeah)
Ooh, that's why I'm textin' my ex (oh no)
Don't nothing look good
I'm just talkin' 'bout sex
And I'm so ready for regrets
Yeah, baby, baby
I know you remember way, way back in December we was in love, yeah
I've been thinking of you
Please tell me that I'm the one you're thinking of, yeah
I just can't forget you now since I met you down in the club, ye-yeah
I know that I let you down, but we need to just link back up, yeah

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Probably shouldn't call you
But you know I'm 'bout to call you
And I don't even need to fall through
But I'm a man, baby, ain't that what we all do?
I understand what you tweetin' out
Hoping I'm the man that you speaking 'bout
But you didn't @ me
Hope my new girl don't catch me

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Textin' my ex (oh no)
Don't nothing look good
I'm just talkin' 'bout sex (yeah)
Ooh, that's why I'm textin' my ex (oh no)
Don't nothing look good
I'm just talkin' 'bout sex
And I'm so ready for regrets
Yeah, baby, baby
I know you remember way, way back in December we was in love, yeah
I've been thinking of you
Please tell me that I'm the one you're thinking of, yeah
I just can't forget you now since I met you down in the club, ye-yeah
I know that I let you down, but we need to just link back up, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Tiffany Evans]
You know you shouldn't call me
So why the hell you call me?
You know I got a new man
But this unknown number, this is all you
Even though this ain’t right
I’ll give it to you, I won’t think twice
Didn't mean to hurt you
Just hope your new girl don't catch you texting your ex

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Don't nothing look good
I'm just talkin' 'bout sex (yeah)
Ooh, that's why I'm textin' my ex (oh no)
Don't nothing look good
I'm just talkin' 'bout sex
I'm so ready for regrets
Yeah, baby, baby
I know you remember way, way back in December we was in love, yeah
I've been thinking of you
Please, tell me that I'm the one you're thinking of, yeah
I just can't forget you now since I met you down in the club, yeah
I know that I let you down, but we need to just link back up, yeah

[Verse 1]
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with the headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely had patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
Went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came, checks didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I could shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow

[Hook]
But why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down

[Verse 2]
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a black woman wishin'
She sayin' this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, hoping you could make it
Women don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
Can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them

[Hook]
But why I'm so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down to the top

[Bridge]
I love god, I love speed, I love drank, I love me
I love oceans in the deep
I love women, I love me
I love God
But I’m scared of god speed
Sometimes

[Verse 3]
Wrote this song looking at a broke home maybe
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and baby
Somebody say "Kendrick American they sho’ is crazy"
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye
He said homie you messed up
You breaking my good luck
You wishing for miracles
Living through shit, you’re crying hysterical
Settle for everything, complain about everything
Say your soul crack, my world amphetamines
You projects ain’t it, I live in the hood
You living to keep warm
I’m living to pay rent
I paid my way through
Praying to Allah
You played your way through dealing with Wi-Fi
Bull shit yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing go for the ones you came with
We all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
Your pain ain’t mine half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t nothing to me
See I made my moves, with shackled feet

[Interlude]
Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town
Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town

[Verse 4]
Corn row Kenny
I wanna get the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr
I wanna get the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr, skrr
Corn row Kenny
So many plays on me I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I react
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure play with him, you get killed
Play with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb things in my past
Love will give me hope and I won’t relapse
Dave just bought a new nine eleven
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Rashad got his son dripping in gold
Me? I’m ‘bout to let my hair down on hoes
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Top billing that’s a million a show
Might blow the Whole Remy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave got a Grammy this year
Mack wop, but he do what he want

[Outro]
Level two, level two
No I’m not done
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
I could put a rapper on life support
Guarantee something that none of you want
Then hold me down and they yell something like
Rent is like twenty five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and skrrrt?
What if I empty my bank out and skrrt?
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
Tell me that, tell me that
That, I am the One
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got
You ain’t got tell me that, what I’m the one
Yes, I’m the one
*Verse 1*

Same bed but just
A little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it
Dont sound the same
When our friends talk
About you all it does is just
Make a sound
*Chorus*
My heart feels the same
When i hear your name
It all just sounds like
Ooh oh ooh oh ooooh
Mmmm too young too dumb
Too realize that you should have
Bought me flowers and held
My hand should have gave me all
Your hours when you had the chance
Take me too every party because all
I wanted to was dance now im really
Dancing but im dancing with
Another man
*Verse 2*
Your pride your ego and
Your selfish ways caused a good
Strong woman like me too walk out
Your life now you never never
Get to clean up the mess you've made
Ooh

*Chorus*
And it haunts you every time
You close your eyes it all just
Sounds likeooh oh ooh oh ooooh
Mmmm too young too dumb
Too realize that you should have
Bought me flowers and held
My hand should have gave me all
Your hours when you had the chance
Take me too every party because all
I wanted to was dance now im really
Dancing but im dancing with
Another man

*Verse 3*
Although it hurts you'll
Be the first to say that
You were wrong oh know
Your probably much too late
Too try and apologize for your
Mistakes but i just want you
Too know i hope you buy her
Flowers i hope you hold her hand
Give her all your hours when you
Have the chance take her to every
Party cause all she wants to do
Is dance do all the things you should
Have done when i was your girl
Do all the things you should
Have done when i was your girl

[Filthy]
If you know what's good
If you know what's good

Cookin' up a mean servin'
No question, I want it
Fire up, everybody smokin'

And I like the way you move
So go 'head, girl, just do it
That ass shakin' thing you do
So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more
And you all could meet me in the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smellin' right

Don't be so quick to walk away (Dance with me)
I wanna rock your body, please stay (Dance with me)

Just let me rock you till the break of day (Dance with me)

[Senorita]
Ladies and gentlemen

"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
"I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you"
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
"I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you"

[Sexyback]

Them other boys don't know how to act
I think it's special, what's behind your back?
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack
Dirty babe
You see these shackles
Baby I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
Come here girl
Go ahead, be gone with it
Come to the back
Go ahead, be gone with it
VIP
Go ahead, be gone with it
Drinks on me
Go ahead, be gone with it
Let me see what you're twerking with

[My Love]
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love

Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

[Cry Me A River]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance for you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it
Cry me a river (x8)

[Suit and Tie]
And as long as I got my suit and tie
Imma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love

[Until The End Of Time]
I woke up this morning
And heard the TV saying something
About disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm going
There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you, girl
And what you give me let's me know that I'll be alright
'Cause if your love was all I had, in this life
Well, that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you, girl, until the end of time

[Prince - I Would Die 4 U]
I'm not a woman
I'm not a man
I am something that you'll never understand
I'll never beat you
I'll never lie
And if you're evil I'll forgive you by and by
You, I would die for you, yeah
Darling if you want me to
You, I would die for you
You're just a sinner I am told
Be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good when you are bad
I'm not a human
I am a dove
I'm your conscious
I am love
All I really need is to know that
You believe
Yeah, say one more time
You, I would die for you

[Mirrors]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Can't Stop The Feeling]
I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavy when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we're in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it
Moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it
So don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance
Come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon
So keep dancing
Everybody sing
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Wanna see you move your body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
Come on
Don't cry for me now sisters and brothers
Dynamite my soul
Watch it rise above the trees and the gutters
Step not where it falls

My heart has been long forgotten
My bones have been pushed through the door
And if tomorrow I woke up with it all
I'd still need more

I brought myself to come to you
It wasn't that hard
90 miles exactly I traveled
To your backyard

Don't cry for me sisters and brothers
Just dynamite my soul
And watch it rise above the trees and the gutters
Step not where it falls

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

[Chorus: Mike]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

[Verse 2: Chester]
Waiting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Chorus: Mike]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

The hardest part of ending is starting again

[Bridge: Mike]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

[Chorus: Mike]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

[Outro: Mike]
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
Listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

[Verse 1]
I hope to be around
The day we grasp in truth
The nature of mind
Befriending time, in truth

[Pre-Chorus]
In a midway I stand where many stood
Only to come home again
Walking through these streets I know too well
But my thoughts stray away

[Chorus]
I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself
Without any end

I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself
In truth

[Verse 2]
I wonder at this light
Enclosed in our soul, in truth
And bid our clay remain
Soft as it is, in truth

[Pre-Chorus]
In a midway I stand where many stood
Only to come home again
Walking through these streets I know too well
But my thoughts stray away

[Chorus]
I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself
Without any end

I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself
In truth

I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself
Without any end
I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself
In truth
If you're anything like me,
You bite your nails,
And laugh when you're nervous.
You promise people the world,
because that's what they want from you.
You like giving them what they want...
But darling, you need to stop,

If you're anything like me,
You knock on wood every time you make plans.
You cross your fingers, hold your breath,
Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes
Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.
Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado...
If life gets too good now,
Darling, it scares you.

If you're anything like me,
You never wanted to lock your door,
Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer
Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore
For fear she was much better before...
But Darling, now you have to.
If you're anything like me,
There's a justice system in your head
For names you'll never speak again,
And you make your ruthless rulings.
Each new enemy turns to steel
They become the bars that confine you,
In your own little golden prison cell...
But Darling, there is where you meet yourself.

If you're anything like me
You've grown to hate your pride
To love your thighs
And no amount of friends at 25
Will fill the empty seats
At the lunch tables of your past
The teams that picked you last...
But Darling, you keep trying.

If you're anything like me,
You couldn't recognize the face of your love
Until they stripped you of your shiny paint
Threw your victory flag away
And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway...
Darling, later on you will thank your stars
for that frightful day.
If you're anything like me,
I'm sorry.

But Darling, it's going to be okay.
When she fell, she fell apart.
Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated
as a child with sidewalk chalk
When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away
with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends

When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink
forming the words of a thousand voices
Echoes she heard even in her sleep:
"Whatever you say, it is not right."
"Whatever you do, it is not enough."
"Your kindness is fake."
"Your pain is manipulative."

When she lay there on the ground,
She dreamed of time machines and revenge
and a love that was really something,
Not just the idea of something.

When she finally rose, she rose slowly
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies
Wary of phone calls and promises,
Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes
When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness
Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck
Bathed in her brokenness
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
she never knew she needed
Standing broad-shouldered next to her
was a love that was really something,
not just the idea of something.

When she turned to go home,
She heard the echoes of new words
"May your heart remain breakable
But never by the same hand twice"
And even louder:
"without your past,
you could never have arrived-
so wondrously and brutally,
By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance
...here."

And in the death of her reputation,
She felt truly alive.

[Verse 1]
Every day's a new day
Every way's a new way
On the edge of darkness, finding out what it means to love
And to think we've found the time

[Chorus]
All my brothers we stand for the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart for an army apart
I am bleeding
All my brothers we stand for the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart for an army apart
I am bleeding

[Verse 2]
Always searching for love
Always searching for light
What the world is made of when I'm thinking it's right?
And to think we've found the time

[Chorus]
All my brothers we stand for the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart for army apart
I'm bleeding
All my brothers we stand for the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart for an army apart
I am bleeding

[Refrain]
Yeah, yeah...

[Bridge]
I've got love in my heart for army apart
I am bleeding

[Chorus]
All my brothers we stand for the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart for army apart
I am bleeding

[Verse]
I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like river, baby
I've been running ever since

[Chorus]
It's been a long
Long time coming
And I know
Change is gonna come

[Verse 2]
It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there,  baby
Beyond the sky

[Chorus]
It's been a long
Long time coming
And I know
Change is gonna come

[Verse 3]
Well, I go down to my brother
And I say
Brother, help me please, yeah
But he winds up
Knocking me back down
On my knees, yeah
Yeah!

[Verse 4]
There'd been times where I thought I
Couldn't last for long
Now I think I'm able
To carry on

[Chorus]
It's been a long
Long time coming
And I know
Change is gonna come
Oh, yes it will
It's been a long
Long time coming
And I know
Change gonna come
Well, it's been a long
Long time coming
And I know
Change is gonna come
Change
I know it, I know it
I know, I know, I know
Change, change gonna come
We used to say that come the day
We'd all be making songs
Or finding better words
These ideas never lasted long

The way is up along the road
The air is growing thin
Too many friends who tried
Blown off this mountain with the wind

Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge
When my time is up I'll see all my friends
Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge
If you really mean it, it all comes round again

Now I see I'm all alone
That's the only way to be
You'll have your chance again
Then you can do the work for me

Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge
When my time is up I'll see all my friends
Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge
If you really mean it, it all comes round again
Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge
When my time is up I'll see all my friends
Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge
If you really mean it, it all comes round again

We're gonna meet on the ledge, on the ledge
All comes round again
We're gonna meet on the ledge
Oh mama you lie in ruin
Can't you see what you've done
Well I've been there before
What's this war that you won
Oh mama you walk this way
And I'm crying inside
Well I've been there before
And you know that it's time

And everybody's talking
But you never let them know
Yes I can hear them talking

Everyone knows
That's there's talking on the streets
Remember the days
When there's no one to defeat
Follow me down
To the mountain of the sun
Forgetting the end
As your new life has begun
Look mama the light is low
And the darkness near
Yes everyone is looking for me and you
And the night's what you fear
Look, someone, they follow us
And they're all undone
Yes everyone is looking for me and you
And the war has begun

And everybody's talking
But you never let em know
Yes I can hear them talking

Everyone knows
That's there's talking on the streets
Remember the days
When there's no one to defeat
Follow me down
To the mountain of the sun
Forgetting the end
As your new life has begun

And everybody's talking
And you never let them know
Yes I can hear them talking
And you never let them know

[Verse 1: LoneMoon]
Ghost in the machine, gaining sentience
We the quickest in the scene, you'll find us anywhere
Too dope, we can't hang around the fakes
You know that we all up in your face
A lot of people say we gotta meditate
But we like to ghost ride, we don't care if it ain't safe
Got me saying "Oh my," cannot seem to get a break
I don't want a bold lie so I'll tell it to you straight

[Drop: LoneMoon]
Take this out
Take this out
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: LoneMoon]
Aye, 

[?] overkill it
We have always been the villains
Never cared about her feelings

[?] how we did it
Never ever made a milli
You gonna get with the drilling
Raise the roof, raise the ceiling
This is how we make a killing

[Drop 2: LoneMoon]
Break it down like this

[Verse 3: LoneMoon]
Let me think a bit about it
Ghost man, I'm standing up
Begin without us, fabled friend
Don't know my flow, feels like it's broke
Money come and money go
Hella fire, burn the gold
Listen, that's the way it goes
Feel like I will never know

[Verse 1]
I stand in the distance
I view from afar
Should I offer some assistance?
Should it matter who you are?

[Chorus]
We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared

[Hook]
Confide in me
Confide in me

[Verse 2]
I can keep a secret
And throw away the key
But sometimes to release it
Is to set our children free

[Chorus]
We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared

[Hook]
Confide in me
Confide in me
Confide in me
Confide in me

[Bridge]
Stick or twist, the choice is yours
Hit or miss, what's mine is yours
Stick or twist, the choice is yours
Hit or miss, what's mine is yours

[Chorus]
We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared

[Hook]
Confide in me
Confide in me
Confide in me
Confide in me
Confide in me
Confide in me

[Verse 1]
I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him where are you going
And this he told me
I'm going on down to Yasgur's farm
I'm going to join in a rock 'n' roll band
I'm going to camp out on the land
I'm going to try an' get my soul free

[Chorus]
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

[Verse 2]
Then can I walk beside you
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog in something turning
Well maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
I don't know who I am
But you know life is for learning

[Chorus]
Oh, we are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

[Bridge]
By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song and celebration
And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
And they were turning into butterflies
Above our nation

[Chorus]
We are stardust (billion year old carbon)
We are golden (caught in the devil's bargain)
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh...
Hmm...

[Verse 1]
The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?

[Chorus 1]
Under the sea
Under the sea
Darlin', it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore, they work all day
Out in the sun, they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'
Under the sea

[Verse 2]
Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves, they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They're sad 'cause they're in their bowl (Uh-oh)
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss gets hungry
Guess who's gon' be on the plate

[Chorus 2]
Under the sea
Under the sea
Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us in fricassee
We what the land folks loves to cook
Under the sea, we off the hook
We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles
Under the sea

[Chorus 1]
Under the sea
Under the sea
Darlin', it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore, they work all day
Out in the sun, they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'
Under the sea

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
If your friends are asking where you been today
Saying love is in the air does that seem okay
Since the greatest love's inside, let them feel the wave
Double Eleven Day

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
We have so many things to work on that you could address
You know that nothing changes until we unite and press
Show the world your human power, you know what that says
Double Eleven Day

You are not alone
You may think you're just home
Something you all should know
You can do wonders

If you could believe
And organize like the bees
You can do it, you'll see there's strenght in numbers
(It's shíyī, shíyī)

[Bridge: Kris Wu]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ay ay, yuh yuh

The possibilietes are swimming around inside my head
All the money raised imagine what coulde be done with it
And let the children watch the show, don't make them go to bed
Double Eleven Day

[Verse 5: Pharrell Williams]
So many miracles can happen because of this day
You know the world's watching whishing they could partecipate
There's gonna be 1.3 billion people staying up late

(Intro):
People only have two choices, to suffer or to fight

Verse 1:
Oh, grueling undertow
Spit me out any place you know
I'm too tired to swim home
Another staggering knockabout
Hammering the thought home
Like a nail through the window
Who are you to tell me who to know
And what to know?
Can't you leave this poor fool alone?
You're far too scared of the unknown
It feels the same everyday

Verse 2:
This flawless paradigm
Can't talk me into blinding my eyes
With the bright lights of these white lies
Souls forgot underneath
The weight of something we could reach
If it weren't easier just to leave ya
Who are you to turn your face away
From the darker days?
Taking cover from another
Maybe it's too late for you
It feels the same everyday
Verse 1:
Feeling daft beyond gone bland
Made it to the goal on lense
President, he just got hair down below
Tomorrow never more...
Made it to the BCP
Everybody knows it's me
I got up another sand
The guilty cell
Tomorrow never more...

Hook:
I Got the Law

Verse 2:
Feeling Dove beyond con-pen
Nobody can take it there
Feel it now and do yourself until you're gone
Tomorrow never more...
Tomorrow never more...

[Verse]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the swirling of the storm
When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 1: Damon Albarn]
Correct me if I'm wrong
Is this a rappin' song?
But I got tooken' ticking
I bail him over
And well I choose to say
A sun pack in my bag
I'm drinking all the sunshine, with tea
And beds are messy
And all my words
Are shot up in your face
I'll waste a few, I'll give a few
And then, I spill softly

[Rap 1: CeeLo Green]
I am puttin' poetry into motion my addiction is overdosing from a natural high
Supplyin' the soul with that unmistakinable mystical magical feelin' that your money can't buy
Becomin' a slave to the rhythm there's no way that you could stop me now I'd like to see you try
Because I'm already long gone don't be scared for me baby just blow me a kiss good bye
I can't believe you'd rather stay behind then go beyond talk to me baby tell me why
Society won't set ya free now follow me programmin' your fear to fly
But best believe I'm a breathe and break ground before I die
I know it's live and let live but my love won't let me lie
Make me wanna do...

[Verse 2: Damon]
I go from hotel to the car
And to the club and sing my song
And hopefully I look and chat and,
She looks pretty
So my car is in
That's the reason I wasn't in
My career (rl-rl-rl-rl) will still come again, and,
I hope you like us

[Rap 2: Fan Producer]
Take the white jam and the white lair,
Like the glass who's business, the way they style their hair
I like that crimp look, what they do with their bangs
I like their pussies but I still like the fangs
So stop, *mm mmm* taste those thighs
I wanna eat it up with a side of mothafuckin' fries
Dunk it in gravy, think you wanna lay me,
Can't stay away even if ya pay me.
What if the whole world
Is crashing down through space
Sinking through water
Down to the promised place

Into the searchlights
The shadow's cross the bay
Property pistols
You know we're never here

What if the whole world
Was crashing down in flames
Falling through oceans
Down to the promised land

Stars shining brightly
A glow in the dark sphere
If green men ask you
We were never here

Why is the whole world
Crashing Down through space
Crashing down through space
Crashing down through space
Xaphoon Jones Mixtape Volume 1

[Verse 1]
I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
Instead

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

[Verse 3]
People say "believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear"
But I can't help being confused
If it's true please tell me dear:
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Don't you know

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
I heard it through the grapevine
I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah

[Outro]
Honey, Honey, I know
That you're letting me go
Said I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, heard it thought the grapevine

[Intro]
And they wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

[Chorus]
God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't, yeah
I feel good, sometimes I don't (Ayy, don't)
I finessed down Weston Road (Ayy, 'nessed)
Might go down a G.O.D. (Yeah, wait)
I go hard on Southside G (Yeah, wait)
I make sure that north-side eat
And still

[Post-Chorus]
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things that they wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things that they wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
Yeah, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2]
She say, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly
I only love my bed and my mama, I'm sorry"
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
Eighty-one, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there'd be no me
'Magine if I never met the broskies

[Chorus]
God's plan, God's plan
I can't do this on my own, ayy (No, ayy)
Someone watchin' this shit close (Yep, close)
I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy (Road, ayy)
Might go down as G.O.D. (Yeah, wait, yeah)
I go hard on Southside G (Ayy, wait, ayy)
I make sure that north-side eat, yeah
And still

[Post-Chorus]
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things that they wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
Yeah, yeah
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things that they wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I heard a story, could be true
About a colour under blue
You couldn't see it with your eyes
Or invent with intellect

[Verse 2]
Like the inverse of colourblindness
It's shrouded like a natural gas
I've got to see it for myself
Settle my own curiousness

[Chorus]
Back and forth swing like the tide
I look to the left and through to right
My three shades are divisible
Lust to see the invisible

[Verse 3]
The story man was glassy-eyed
He told me about the power lines
And in subarctic caribou eyes
The metal wires burst into life

[Verse 4]
They flick across the territory
Resplendent mackerel sky
Some of the snow absorbs UV
Unseeable crumbs in dye

[Chorus]
Picking up clues 'bout my eyes
I scrutinize the iris of the storm's eye
My three shades are divisible
Lust to see the invisible

[Refrain]
Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see
Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see

[Bridge]
Polygondwanaland

[Chorus]
Inconspicuous hue will be
Crowded camouflage to me
My three shades are divisible
Lust to see the invisible

[Refrain]
Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see
Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see

[Refrain]
I believe the hyperbole
I see the fourth colour

[Verse 1]
Rising up out of my body
I am omnipresent for thee
Many fingers, many minds and
Many eyeballs puppet my feet
I walk the streets holy
I am born again
I see the light
It's in my face
My brain is storing information
Now I am a god in a photon
I see through walls
I see your heat
I can see your terror
With sight you can see the future

[Refrain]
I believe the hyperbole
I see the fourth colour
I can see, tetrachromacy
I see the fourth colour

[Verse 2]
Rising up out of my body
I am omnipresent for thee
Many fingers, many minds and
Many eyeballs puppet my feet
I walk the streets holy supreme
And see all that has been
All that will be
Third eye is free
I am not body
Tetrachromacy
Rising up out of my body
I am omnipresent for thee
Many fingers, many minds and
Many eyeballs puppet my feet
I walk the streets holy supreme
And has seen all that has been all that will be
Third eye is free
I am no body
Tetrachromacy
Rising up out of my body
I am omnipresent for thee
Many fingers, many minds and
Many eyeballs puppet my feet
I walk the streets

[Refrain]
I believe the hyperbole
I see the fourth colour

[Outro]
I am born again
I see the light
It's in my face
I am analyzing information
Now I am a god

[Instrumental]

[Vinyl-Only]
Hello

[Verse]
Look, it's all pen, it's all for real niggas
It's gone in a song, it's still with us
It feel different
My heart and my will in it
Bars ain't my only meal ticket
Regardless, I'm in a field, nigga
It's all pen, it's all- I twist the spliff with both hands
Bitches heard about a nigga, so they hollering for mo'
And getting with the program
I think i feel my body getting cold and I ain't bring a clothe'
I'm walking like an old man
And look at all the shit I do to cope with shit
I do the most when I get on the ropes and
Still think I'm 'bout to hit the dope man
My nigga if I'm walking talking 'bout four grams
You gon' have me walking with whole bags
This bitch is center on a coast tan
Bucket swerved and stopping for no man
We back in service, pack your shit up
Taxidermy rapping niggas for fun
My past determined what's finna come
My nigga skip the sermon, pass me the blunt
I knew the verdict 'fore the gavel went up
I know i judged you early back at the jump

[Outro]
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
I could sit here all day
Bruising my skin and watching the waves
I could sit here all day in your sunshine eyes
I could stay here this way
Guiding your hand as we lie in the shade
I could stay here in your inner sea home

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Let's run from the kingdom
Let's take all the treasure
Let's hide in this magic forever and ever

[Chorus]
'Cause you set me free
You set me free
And I know that it's wrong, but it's innocent fun
And you set me free
You set me free
Just you, and all the other boys too

[Verse 2]
You make me scream on the outside
Make me reveal all my colors to you
You make me want to untie all my soul strings
You make me live in the lie
Box up the truth, push it to the side
You make me smile as I sink deeper into your ocean

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let's dance with the dolphins
Let's lie in the flowers
Let's swing from this starlight for hours and hours

[Chorus]
'Cause you set me free
You set me free
And I know that it's wrong, but it's innocent fun
And you set me free
You set me free
Just you, and all the other boys too

[Bridge]
I'll stay in the field and I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting, just waiting
I'll stay in the field and I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting, waiting
I'll stay in the field and I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting, just waiting for you, yeah
I'll stay in the field and I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting, waiting

Most of my niggas on fed' time

We in it puttin' the redline
On niggas that's thinkin' it's their time
Put my dawg onto the whole lick, he made a hunnid off a headline
Grrr, shh, back
Puttin' these pussy niggas on the bedtime
Come again, I'm pullin' up in a Cullinan
With all of this money, I'm pressin' my thumb against
Due to the plug, I'll shoot if you run again
I'm 'bout to spazz, I'm dominant
Bitch, we got another one again
I was down and now I'm up again
They don't know what I was up against
Trap floor, on the sofa
Down bad, that was every night
White rice with the ketchup on it
Corned beef with the yellow rice
Trap nights, tryna make it out
Headshots, but I paid 'em out
When you see the nigga, lay him out
We about to see what they about, woah
They don't spark no fear
Pussy nigga, we could play it out
You know it's dark out here
And the sticks, niggas can't play without
Hit a lick, shoot a nigga
Change clothes at my baby house
New pay, good work
We won't go another day without
Trap boomin' (Woo)
'Bout to spit the whole baby out
Shooter 'bout to throw a eighty out
Make you wish you never played me out
Hey, ayy, lil' bih, my trap boomin'
Got my bih like Katsumi
Got two sticks, I'm that goonie (Grrr)

[Pre-Chorus]
Whippin' up dope (Whippin' up dope)

I sip way too much drank

This blunt got me too high
I won't try to pretend
'Cause you and I are just friends
So I won't try to pretend
'Cause you and I just friends

[Verse 1]
After all the nights that we spend
Swear every night too lit
You spend every night with my clique
I just never mind, you're a freak
Telling you it's gettin' too deep

I'm just out here actin' like a new me
Got this drink up in my cup, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I smoke, I sip, I drink

[Verse 2]
You ain't my girl on my slimes
We just slide sometimes

Rolled up and get high sometimes
Say you love me, but can't touch me
But you know your best friend want me

Can't fuck me
I tell the truth whenever you double cup me

[Pre-Chorus]
I smoke, I sip, I drink

[Spoken: Leah Senior]
The river opened her mouth and spat into a vast sea larger and bluer than a cloudless sky. Muscular, prodigious, immortal. But our vessel was invulnerable. It was well built, the boat rocked me into sleep and I floated through a deep dream, smooth sailing through the castle in the air...

[Verse 1]
One-eyed people living peaceful
With monopods and astomi
Without malice or guile
Without covetousness

[Refrain]
Ohh, ahh

[Verse 2]
And there's men whose heads do
Grow beneath their shoulders
Maybe we'll find the world's center
Where equinox casts no shadows
Spread our teaching
Alleviate their damnation

[Refrain]
Ohh, ahh
Ohh, ahh

[Bridge]
Without us they will go to hell
We are casting spells

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Could it be faithful?
It couldn't seem more real
As I opened my eyes
The dream de-colorised
Until it was obscured
And the harsh reality hit me like salty water

[Verse 1]
Meet with me, in the dark
Of the street, there we'll start
Believing, secretly
Utopia, freedom in
The inner cell
Look for me, with a beak
A cloak adorned, scent of leaves
A void between, foul stench
Of those above, whispering
Inner cell

[Pre-Chorus]
Dance of the dead
Will descend on his head
And extend to the
Families' hubris

[Chorus 1]
From under the skin, insurrection
From hollow logs, from shallow streams
And drying seas

[Verse 2]
Let us walk through the night
To a place clandestine
Free your mind, disregard
All you know, infiltrate
The inner cell
You must not accept
His sick version of
Life itself, disrespect
Everything, multiply
Inner cell

[Pre-Chorus]
Dance of the dead
Will descend on his head
And extend to the
Families' hubris

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 2]
From under the skin, the flesh has rotten
Poison has spread, through words unsaid
Anemic rule, now hear me say
Our time has come, transcending us
Above the one, to ego death
For now he sits inside the fire
Oblivious that we will keep
Him in the spire, have found resolve
And our own crimes to commit
In cold blood as he did his

[Verse 1]
I see all there is
And has ever been
I am not a man
I am everything
Picture of purity
Deific reign
Ordained unto me
Prehistoric god
Theophany
I shall not move

[Bridge]
Those who try
I will drink their blood

[Verse 2]
I'll be watching them
I am everywhere
Floating on the wind
Hiding in the dark
Pure omniscience
Traitors will quake
At the thought of me
Hang them on a hook
Put them on display
Examples must be made

[Bridge]
This is a test
I am Lord, fear my wrath
This is a test
I am Lord, I am death

[Verse 3]
What is with these crimes of treason?
I will fight this inquisition if I have to
I will not surrender!
If I'm backed into a corner
I will draw and quarter all their children
Just to prove I'm not a coward!
I will put them all on Judas Cradle
Just to show them a god incarnate

[Outro]
Where's the loyalty
Where's their loyalty?
Where's the loyalty
Where's their loyalty?
No man - no problem

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
There was a great hermit dominion
Veiled from inside and out
Ruled by a lone eremite
Bringer of an inferno
Conduit to Satan himself
To Tchort, Abaddon, and Set
A demented figurehead
Heinous looking thing, he was
Cold and terrible
A long and aquiline nose
Between swelling temples
His green eyes, a window
To the Ninth Circle of Hell
A tiny neck supporting a head
Filled with an unbending desolation

[Chorus 1]
Seditious bands storm the bastion
Alive with revenge
Grand intentions
Unbeknownst protomartyrs
Indoctrinated
With impalement

[Verse 2]
Just like that the plot was crushed
Brushed away without a thought
Some were found alive, though
Left to roam without their skin
Cauterized and blistering
Forever marked for all to see
Reminding those who think dissent
Is a bridge across the sea
One did make a pilgrimage
In search of a family
Evaporated in the dark
Stolen by the despot
A journey made all the worse
Having had his eyes gouged
He left without the gift of sight
To face his true destroyer

[Chorus 2]
Across the land he walked with death
Parading his
Ossuary
Upon reaching the castle walls
A twist of fate
His mind baulks

[Outro]
Sit down weary traveler
I am that what you seek
Join me in a meal
To hear of my repentance
Lift the veil from your eyes
And look beyond the three
Now you know the truth behind:
It's tetrachromacy

[Verse 1]
Searching for the way
Try to brighten up my day
Searching for the gold
Inside the rainbow
Looking through rose-coloured glasses won't work
It won't change anything

[Verse 2]
My body's not a temple
It is a vessel
And a blank slate
An empty hard drive
Doctor please, I'll do anything
Alter me, let me see
Give me more
I want to see the world differently

[Bridge]
Searching, searching
Searching, searching

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
I've been born again
I see the light
It's in my face
I'm analyzing information
Now I am a god

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington] - LOATR
I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared
But no-one would listen, 'cause no-one else cared
After my dreaming, I woke with this fear
What am I leaving, when I'm done here?

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington] - LOATR
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington] - LOATR
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me and, when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington] - SOTD
I close both locks below the window
I close both blinds and turn away
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington] - SOTD
And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington] - SOTD
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you

[Chorus: All] - Iridescent
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go. Let it go

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go. Let it go
This was our first chapter
From now on we’ll only be full of surprises
We love you
We’re grateful for all of you, with all of our hearts
We exist for and because of you
Goodnight, good afternoon, good morning wherever you are in the world
God bless you all
Be kind to each other
We’re in this together
We’re one big band
Everything is possible, if you never give up
And if you Believe in Love

[Verse 1]:
Sweetheart, did you  you know that you're a star?
Shining brighter than the Northern Light, bigger than the sun
My heart is full of only good intentions
Maybe we could be more than friends, if thats what you want?

[Pre Chorus]:
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Do you wonder what it's like to fall in love?
I do, I do, I do
Do you wonder what it's like to feel the drug?
I do, I do, I do

[Chorus]:
It's the start of true romance, like a flower blooms
Let's give in to love's command, see what we can do

[Verse 2]:
Taste it - sweeter than the silver moon beams
Drink it up and see your dreams, isn't it bizzare?
Fragile mind, cracked into a million pieces
Spin around your  atmosphere, swimming in the stars

[Pre Chorus 2]:
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

[?]
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

[?]

[Chorus]:
It's the start of true romance, like a flower blooms
Let's give in to love's command, see what we can do

[Intro]
I don't rap verses, I rap universes (to Pangaea!)

[Chorus]
No, I ain't come to talk, ain't come to play
Came to fuck shit up, what you got to say?
No, I ain't came to talk, ain't came to play
I'm here to fuck shit up (rare, rare)

[Verse 1]
I'm here to fuck shit up (wow)
You ain't even scratch the crust (stop, stop, stop)
Please, do not touch the tux (stop, stop, stop) (don't touch the tux)
I can't concentrate, I'm stuck
Ain't tryna debate, it's not MMA, you play with my plate, you bait (on me)
I fold up your bae, like paper maché, I got to feng shui the place (on God)
They can't imitate the great (on me), I do not take the bait (on God)
I mean what I say, in 25 seconds this message will self destruct (fuckin' shit up)

[Chorus]
No, I ain't come to talk, ain't come to play
Came to fuck shit up, what you got to say?
No, I ain't came to talk, ain't came to play
I'm here to fuck shit up (woah)
I'm here to fuck shit up

[Verse 2]
Look, third eye is functioning, and I'm in a function
I might go gorillas, go ape like a jungle gym
Too much of cannabis, too much of funguses
I get monstrous with my mantras, bitch
I like extra condiments on my consonants
Ain't no theories over here bitch, just common sense
In real life you internet gangsters just want a pic
Gee willikers gee my golly who'd I offend?
Synonymous with these psychotic psychiatrists
The villain within, or depending on who, the victim within
If you've got a point that you really do need to defend, vent to a friend
Baddest motherfucker walking since woman invented man
I'm in it to win, I'm knee-deep
She's down at my shins feeling my print
Shit, I feel like I'm Prince
If you happen to use my name in a sentence shit, future tense
Don't know if it's clear to you what it appears that I'm here to do
Shit I paid my nigga dues, I transformed you niggas' views
I'm fucking shit up, lit fuse, fuck you and your ten views, bitch

[Chorus]
No, I ain't come to talk, ain't come to play (ray bands)
Came to fuck shit up, what you got to say?
No, I ain't came to talk, ain't came to play
I'm here to fuck shit up
I'm here to fuck shit up

[Intro]
I go Willie B., I go Harambe
I go Mutombo, Dikembe
Get that Lewinsky, Will Smith pay, Independence day
No Scientology, I know my geography
Roll up these collard greens
I came up from poverty, now fuck off my property
Fuck off my, my property, fuck off my property
My property

[Chorus]
I don't notice them, them, creme de la creme
I don't fuck with them, creme de la creme
And if I ever let this play again (creme de la creme)
I could touch the sky (creme de la creme)
And if I ever leave this place again
I don't notice them, creme de la creme

[Verse]
I got my own lane
Since i was a kid I was a grown man
I don't need no new friends
Funny how they smile and they grin
True colors are hiding within
It's easy to slide and pretend
When you at a disquise of a friend
Wonder would she ride if i wasn't in a 500 benz
I don't know I don't get the shit
Why fuck with hoes that ain't interested
Smoke all your weed, drink all your liquor and Snapchat the shit like it's Christmas gifts, goddamn
Shit, I know 'cause I witnessed it
It's all about how they leave your life
It's never about how they entered it (creme)

[Chorus]
I don't notice them, them, creme de la creme
I don't fuck with them, creme de la creme
And if I ever let this play again (creme de la creme)
I could touch the sky (creme de la creme)
And if I ever leave this place again
I don't notice them, creme de la creme
I could touch the sky (creme de la creme)
And if I ever leave this place again (creme de la creme)
I could touch the sky (creme de la creme)

[Hook]
Is it rain, that you're praying for
Is it war, that you're fighting for
Is it love, that you're straying from
Is it you, that you're running from

Always on the run, run, run
So you run, you run, you run, you run
(yeah)

[Verse 1]
Alchemy, don't try my alchemy
You talkin' wild to me
These fallacies
Who and what to do what we allowed to be
Calculate you're every move
That shit don't amount to me
Quit doubting me
It don't take algebra for you to count on me
You can't program perfection
Life without direction is bound to get ingested
Belly of the beast swallowed the key to the dungeon
Are you really running or just chasing something

[Hook]
Always on the run, run, run
So you run you run you run you run

[Verse 2]
See they parade around acting like they give a fuck about you
They just, they just, they just tryna get some pub' about you
They just, they just, they just tryna get some bucks about you
They just, they don't really love you, they know nothing 'bout you
They don't, they don't reall- you nothing no-nothing about you (yeah)
They just want the clicks, they just want your clicks
They just want your clicks, they just wanna take your common sense
Ignorance, they just want your ignorance, 'cause it's bliss
If it's more dollars for them, and it's more slavery for you
'Cause if you're holding your breath, nigga don't wait for the truth (ahaa)
They ain't gone tell you that you property
It's a battle for the minds, nigga that's monopoly (bands)

[Hook]
Is it rain, that you're praying for
Is it war, that you're fighting for
Is it love that you're straying from
Is it you that you're running from

Always on the run, run, run
So you run you run you run you run
(yeah)

Uh, digital world, digital weed, digital trees
Digital sheep, look at the sheep, look at them sleep
Little Bo-Peep, lookin' at me, little ol' me
The eye of the beast, tryna defeat invisible ghosts

[Hook]
Inside the machine, inside the mach—

[Verse 2]
We dance so the weeds
Don't grow up underneath our feet (Underneath our feet)
So the vines don't swallow our dreams, don't swallow our dreams
This ain't a movie role
But they watchin' your boy like The Truman Show
Except I'm the director, the crowd and the cast
Shining a sky on that ass, look
Dead from your leg to your neck, your head suffocating in debt
You don't even depend on the Most High to get it
You just wait for disability checks
I do not compete with the rest, never bust a bead of a sweat
Chaos thing, I'm too great to ever be considered the best
Bandz!

[Hook]
Inside the machine, inside the mach—
Inside the machine, inside the mach—
Inside the machine, inside the machi—
Inside the machine, inside the machi—
All these lonely people, where's your heart?
All this fucking evil's not your fault
Inside the machine
Tryna defeat invisible ghosts inside the machine
Inside the machine

[Intro]

Don't, don't block the phone, don't, don't block the phone
And if you don't bring friend and your friend down
Then don't block the phone, don't

She ain't going if her friend ain't going
But her friend been rolling all night
Mandatory shots, mandatory, mandatory, mandatory

[Hook]
And if you come drag along
Don't drop your phone
And if you don't bring your friend
Don't block the hoes
With my blockers on, don't watch my phone
Don't stop to play, should have stayed at home
I wanna....lllllllllllllllllllllll loud
Tryna feel some, she feel you know it
Naughty girl, naughty girl..
You been choppin it, choppin it down

[Verse 1]
Look, you gotta be, honest, honest
I can feel your knowledge, you're in bondage
You got a blockage or a stoppage
Shit is... nonsense

I've seen heaven, issa cat
The tree of life from the back
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
I don't buy into the hype, I don't get lost in illusion
I see coincidence, ain't no such a thing
What everyone go to the club to see..

[Hook]
And if you come drag along
Don't drop your phone
And if you don't bring a friend
Don't block the hoes
With my blockers on, don't watch my phone

Tryna feel some, she feel you know it
Naughty girl, naughty girl, you been choppin it, choppin it down
(You're tryna get down)

[Verse 1]
I think a lit a fuse..
Embryos in food
Feed them in the school
Every day at noon
Police still abuse
Pedos get excused
Flowers still in bloom
Politicians lie
Chemtrails in the sky
Clones report the news
Clones report the news
Clones report the news
Clones report the news
Fluoride in your water
Babies get the needle
Before they leave the womb
Zombies in the room
Zombies in the tomb, elephant, what?
Elephant in the muthafuckin room

[Chorus]
Bones don’t turn to oil
Bones don’t turn to oil, nigga
Bones don’t turn to oil
Bones don’t turn to oil
Bones don’t turn to oil, nigga
Bones don’t turn to oil
Bones don’t turn to oil
Bones don’t turn to oil, nigga
Bones don’t turn to oil
Bones don’t turn to oil
Bones don’t turn to oil, nigga
Bones don’t turn to oil

[Interlude]
Yeah
I'm the creator, the operator and the destroyer, muthafucka!
I'm the bait, the hostage and the ransom, muthafucka!

[Verse 2]
Who the fuck got a problem with Bobby Ray? (Nigga, uh)
Since when did we give a fuck what a lunatic got to say? (Ha)
Mr. Potato head and Shill Nye behave
Quit sucking each other off and debate with Eric Dubay
Debate with C Freeman El and Dr. Alim El-Bey
Don't know about you, but my ancestors was never slaves
If I had a dollar for every agent they sent my way?
Then I'd have enough money to send a rocket to space
And get some of that hair gel them NASA hoes be using
That have some "pretty nice waves, pretty nice waves"
Yeah, cut my phone off and I lay low (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cuz most these truther pages on a payroll
I'm not your leader, so don't follow me (No sir)
Follow your own mind, and your own mythology (Yes sir)
Cause if your mind ain't your own, it's somebody else's property

[Outro]
Ha, so why them mocking me?
Ayy, use your common sense
I don't make no sense, I just rap I don't know shit, BANDZ!

[Chorus]
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh , what a shame, I'm not there

[Verse 1]
What is it you want?
You can lie, but I know that you're not fine
Every time you talk
It's all 'bout me, but you swear I'm not on your mind

[Chorus]
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows
You and I are suicide and stolen art (Art)
Pretty mama sews
Stitches into all your bitches' broken hearts

[Chorus]
You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

[Bridge]
Somebody new is gonna comfort you
Like you want me to
Somebody new is gonna comfort me
Like you never do

[Outro]
Every now and then, it hits me
That I'm the one that got away
But I guess being lonely fits me
And you were made for begging, "stay"

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
I've felt this way before
So insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
I've felt this way before
So insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

[Intro - Fallout/Roads Untraveled]
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for paths left lone
'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain I've known
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end, and if you need a friend
There's a seat here, alongside me

[Verse 1]
Tell me what I gotta do
There's no getting through to you
The lights are on but nobody's home (nobody's home)
You say I can't understand
But you're not giving me a chance
When you leave me, where do you go? (Where do you go?)

[Pre-Chorus]
All the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you

[Chorus]
And the truth is, you turn into someone else
You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm just talking to myself, ooh
Talking to myself, ooh
Talking to myself, ooh
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm just talking to myself

[Verse 2]
I admit I made mistakes
But yours might cost you everything
Can't you hear me calling you home?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, all the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you

[Chorus]
And the truth is, you turned into someone else
You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell
But I know, I know, I know
I'm just talking to myself, ooh
Talking to myself, ooh
Talking to myself, ooh
Yeah I know, yeah I know, I know
I'm just talking to myself

[Pre-Chorus]
All the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you

[Chorus/Outro]
And the truth is, you turned into someone else
You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell
But I know, I know, I know
I'm just talking to myself, ooh
Talking to myself, ooh
Talking to myself, ooh
But I know, I know, I know
Talking to myself

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Let's go y'all

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there, at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there, at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there, at the turn
Waiting to let you know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up, break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Told me yes, you held me high
I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
Built you up, but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there, at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up to break it back down
Building it up, burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Outro 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Outro 2: Chester Benngington]
Thank you!
Man, you guys are fucking awesome
You know, we have the best fans in the world
I say it all the time because it's fucking true

[Intro]
And I wanna thank all the people I see every night at all these shows
You know who you are
Love you guys

[Verse 1]
I got a long way to go
And a long memory
I been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach
Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I been searching for the courage
To face my enemies
When they turn down the lights

[Chorus]
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I’ll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don’t give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

[Bridge]
For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

[Verse 2]
They say that I don’t belong
Say that I should retreat
That I’m marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse
When they turn down the lights

[Chorus]
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I’ll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don’t give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

[Bridge]
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
When they turn down the lights

[Chorus]
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I’ll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don’t give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake
For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

[Verse 1]
I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

[Verse 2]
There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

[Bridge]
In every loss, in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
*crowd singing faintly*
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide
Across this new divide
Across this new divide

[Verse 1]
I've got an aching head
Echoes and buzzing noises
I know the words we said
But wish I could've turned our voices down
This is not black and white
Only organized confusion
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

[Pre-Chorus]
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now

[Chorus]
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible

[Verse 2]
Didn't get your way
And it's an empty feeling
You've got a lot to say
You just want to know you're being heard
But this is not black and white
There are no clear solutions
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

[Pre-Chorus]
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now

[Chorus]
Invisible (yeah), invisible
Invisible, invisible

[Bridge]
This is not black and white
There are no clear solutions
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

[Pre-Chorus]
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now

[Chorus]
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible

[Outro]
You guys ready?
So we have a new album out, it is called One More Light
And as we're making an album, there are always certain songs that stand out to each of us
Umm, and kind of help define the course of the record
And for me, this was always, this was always one song
That I felt like, umm, I really wanted to save
That I didn't want people to hear until they heard the whole album
And that's why, that's why we put it first on the record
This is actually, uh, this is only the second time we've ever played it too
So you guys get a, get a second concert

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
This one's called "Nobody Can Save Me"

[Verse 1]
I'm dancing with my demons
I'm hanging off the edge
Storm clouds gather beneath me
Waves break above my head
Headfirst hallucination

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I wanna fall wide awake now
You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight

[Chorus]
But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
Chasing out the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

[Verse 2]
Stared into this illusion
For answers yet to come
I chose a false solution
But nobody proved me wrong (no)
Headfirst hallucination

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna fall wide awake
Watch the ground giving way now
You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight

[Chorus]
But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
I'm chasing out the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

[Bridge]
Been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here (I wanna fall wide awake now)
I've been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here
I wanna fall wide awake now
So tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight

[Outro]
And only I can save me now
I'm holding up a light
Chasing out the darkness inside
And I don't wanna let you down
And I don't wanna let you-

Been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here

[Verse 1]
Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?
Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
There are things that we can have, but can't keep

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

[Verse 2]
The reminders, pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

[Instrumental + Bridge]
(I do)

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do
I do

[Outro]
Thank you

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me, when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared
But no one would listen, 'cause no one else cared
After my dreaming, I woke with this fear
What am I leaving, when I'm done here?

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reason to be missed
And don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Don't be afraid, I've taken my beating
I've shared what I've made
I'm strong on the surface, not all the way through
I've never been perfect, but neither have you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else
Can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some, reasons to be missed
And don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

[Refrain: Chester Bennington]
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

[Outro 1: Chester Bennington]
Forgetting, all the hurt inside
You've learned to hide so well
Pretending, someone else
Can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are, I can't be who you are

[Outro 2: Chester Bennington]
Thank you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me, you're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix, you won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it longer than you've been alive, you idiot

[Pre-Chorus 1: Mike Shinoda]
And it makes you so mad
That somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here (Get that shit up)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Live from the Genesis
Underline it for emphasis
There is no way to pretend
That we don't really know what the ending is
Part of me thinking
That even addressing is being too generous
Do you really think that they'll notice
When you get removed from the premises?

[Pre-Chorus 2: Mike Shinoda]
And it makes you so mad
That somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad
That I won't give you the respect that the others do
And you can't understand it was over
Before it's begun, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from
You guys ready to sing that shit?
(Don't you come back no more)
Fuck

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye (Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye (Don't you come back no more)

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
Yo, ayy
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours, this is our life
Still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoes
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's, gang

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye (Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye (Don't you come back no more)

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Stormzy]
Stormzy!
Make some fucking noise!
Make some noise for Stormzy ladies and gentlemen!
Oh London, I love you guys, thank you

[Intro: Stormzy]
Thank you
Come see me

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Interlude]
Yeah!

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
Forgiving what I've done

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Outro]
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
What I've done
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)

[Intro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Thank you very much
I feel like I haven't been over on this side like the whole night
What's up you guys?

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
Doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, they didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Crowd]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Crowd]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Amsterdam, you are incredible!

[Intro]
We'd like to play something for you that we worked up today
In the dressing room

[Verse 1]
Mama always told me don't you run
"Don't you run with scissors, son
You're gonna hurt someone"
Mama told me look before you leap
Always think before you speak, watch the friends you keep

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

[Chorus]
Sharp Edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp Edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

[Verse 2]
Should've played it safer from the start
Loved you like a house of cards
Let it fall apart
But all the things I couldn't understand
Never could've planned
Made me who I am
Put your nose in paperbacks
Instead of smoking cigarettes
These are years you're never getting back

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

[Chorus]
Sharp Edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp Edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

[Bridge]
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Put along the beaten path, never listened when she said

[Chorus]
Sharp Edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp Edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

[Outro 1]
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

[Outro 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Man, playing guitar and singing is really hard
Dude, Mike is back here, like, playing drums, playing keyboards, guitars, rapping, and I'm like, all five thumbs
*Laughter*
You wanna take a break from playing guitar and singing for a minute then?
What's that?
You wanna take a break from it, then?
Oh, no, I like playing guitar, it's super fun
I mean if you can't have fun doing this, you're doing it wrong, you know what I mean?

[Intro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
That's right
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for Chester Bennington
Hell yeah

[Chorus 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Can I get an encore, do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the L.A. boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah! So, what the hell are you waitin' for?
After us, there shall be no more
So for one last time, make some noise y'all

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Chester & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Bridge: Crowd & Chester Bennington]
And I know, I may end up failing, too
But I know, you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb
Tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb
Tired of being what you want

[Chorus 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Can I get an encore, do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the L.A. boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah! So, what the hell are you waitin' for?
After us, there shall be no more
So for one last time, people, make some noise

[Verse 1]
I don’t like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there’s comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can’t escape the gravity

[Chorus]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
To so much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

[Verse 2]
You say that I'm paranoid
But I’m pretty sure the world is out to get me
It’s not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

[Chorus]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

[Bridge]
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
Know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Crowd]
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?
Yeah, why is everything so heavy?

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Run myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach, somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor, again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I bleed it out, go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
And I can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So, I try ignoring him
Make it a dirt dance floor, again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this, now

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
Sing oh-oh-oh-oh
Sing oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sing oh-oh-oh-oh
Sing oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Crowd]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, oh-oh-oh-oh
I bleed it out, oh-oh-oh-oh
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, oh-oh-oh-oh
I bleed it out, oh-oh-oh-oh
I bleed it out

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I used the deadwood to make the fire rise
The blood of innocence burning in the skies
I filled my cup with the rising of the sea
And poured it out in an ocean of debris
Oh

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
We held our breath when the clouds began to form
But you were lost in the beating of the storm
And in the end, we were made to be apart
In separate chambers of the human heart
Oh

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve

[Post Chorus 1: Chester Bennington]
It's in the blackened bones
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve

[Guitar Solo]
Oh
Oh

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve

[Post-Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
The blame is mine, alone
For bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve
What I don't deserve, oh, oh
What I don't deserve

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I use the deadwood to make the fire rise
The blood of innocence burning in the skies

[Intro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Put 'em up, uh
Yeah, yeah
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them
We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control
Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Yo, yo
What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, I'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot, rocking every revision
I'm holding on to what I haven't got
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
Though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them

We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Holding on to what I haven't got
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
To save face, how low can you go
Talk a lot of game and yet you don't know
Static's on the way, make 'em all say whoa
The people up top and the people down low
Get down
And obey every word
Steady getting mine if you haven't yet heard
Wanna take what I got, don't be absurd
Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt
If you haven't heard yet, I'm letting you know
There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload
And no one make a move unless my people say so
Got everything outta control
Everybody

[Interlude 1: Mike Shinoda]
Alright y'all, let's see you put 'em up
Say this shit like
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Steel unload, final blow
We the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true
Wretches and kings, we come for you

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
So keep pace, how slow can you go
Talk a lot of shit and yet you don't know
Fire on the way, make 'em all say whoa
The people up top, the people down low
Get down
And I'm running it like that
Front of the attack is exactly where I'm at
Somewhere in between the kick and the hi-hat
Pen and the contract, pitch and the contact
So get with the combat, I'm letting 'em know
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down, no
So push the button, let the whole thing blow
Spinning everything outta control
Everybody go

[Interlude 2: Mike Shinoda]
Fuck that Vegas, we need to hear you guys right now
You ready? Say
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Steel unload, final blow
We the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true
Wretches and kings, we come for you

[Post-Chorus]
Steel unload, fire blow
Filthy animals, beat them low
Skin and bone, black and blue
No more this sun shall beat onto you

[Interlude 3: Mike Shinoda]
Alright Vegas, you ready to do this shit?
And it goes like this

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
From the front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
Lemme see you motherfuckers put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put 'em up in the sky
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high

[Outro: Mario Savio]
There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious
Makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part
You can't even passively take part
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
And you've got to make it stop
And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it
That unless you're free
The machine will be prevented from working at all

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Make some noise for yourselves Las Vegas

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
When you're standing in the wake of devastation
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
With the cataclysm raining down
Insides crying, "Save me now!"
You were there, impossibly alone

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go
Let it go

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
And in a burst of light that blinded every angel
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of tempered grace
Falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go
Let it go

[Chorus]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go
Let it go

[Bridge]
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go
Let it go

[Intro]
Secret Weapon

[Skit]

Your stupidity might be your one saving grace
Uh?
Don't uh me greek boy
How is it your fucking stupid, soon to be dead friends
Thought that they might be able to steal my cannabis
And then sell it back to me?
This is a declaration of war
Is this some white cunts job that black cunts don't get?
'Cause I'm not fucking laughing, Nicholas

[?] position, 'cause you're not that stupid
That if you did, you wouldn't have turned up here, scratching your ass
With that, "What's going on here?" look slapped all over your Chevy Chase
But, what you do know, is where these people live
If you hold back anything, I'll kill you
If you're bending the truth, or I think you're bending the truth, I'll kill you
If you forget anything, I'll kill you
In fact, you're going to have to work very hard to stay alive Nick
Now, do you understand everything I've said?
Because, if you don't, I'll kill you!
Now, Mr. Bubble and squeak
You may enlighten me

[Intro]
Huh, huh, yeah
I'ma murder this shit
Alright, it's Weezy Baby!
Ayy, listen here, come here, ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell you what I did last night
I made love in a bitch wig last night
Them chrome dubs up on the Benz fit tight
We stone up the stick ick gimmie light
Laughin' on the island nigga livin' right
But I got ta go ta ATL to N.Y then it's back to the N.O
Don't fuck around I put this mack to ya rib and blow
It's Weezy Baby, I'm baggin' in this bitch for sure
I'm packin' a fifth, I'm baggin' a four
Kilo package of blow for twenty it go
In ya tummy where the Semi would go
And I pull the trigga right after I wisper gimmie ya coke
And I'm charged off myself in this millenium flow
Man I might go to ya girl and tell her gimmie ya throat
Cause a pimp don't give a shit about offendin' a hoe
My hoe's fuck my friends, I find no friend in a hoe
And the women a go

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Oops, oh my
Baby see the whip ain't got no roof we so fly
And the feds ain't got no proof I sold pies
So I do like I do I'm so squad

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You see, I tried and I tried to keep goin'
But I'm, so high from the lie I keep blowin'
If I'm, gon' ride then it got ta be foreign
Yeah me no supply less than four and a half
Quit school went into the draft
I been puttin' numbers up since that
Been pullin' up in Hummers since that, so check my interior
So clean, so young, so what, so serious
Weezy do it all, man, I touch all areas
Sports agency, oh, plus I'm the best at this
I'm a mess at this, but I ain't trippin'
I leave rap to nothin' dizzy, I'm to fuckin' busy
17 'til I'm finished
Back in this, crack chemist
I murder that witness
What a burner that shit, we probably murder that spinich
But I ain't tryin' to fuck up me in feds image
They say, Tun' oh my
They say the boy so small he got to poke out
And all my cars own poke outs
Lu Baby call all the boys let's have a smoke out
And if you war with the boys we have a shoot out
July 2nd Cash Money pull the truth out
I'm bout to candy and chrome me a coupe out
I'm so cool gettin' dome when I move out
I have no home, the boy move out
So if you try to find me, Lil Weezy Wee be on that loop rout
How many chickens been to dudes house, trick question
Bitches or bricks now keep guessin'
Nigga take a swigga and flip, so keep playin' boy
You fucking with the Eastland Lords, nigga

[Intro: Lil' Wayne]
Yo, yeah what up world - SQAD Shit
I go by the name of Weezy
He go by the name of Nut and
He go by the name of Gutta
And we-

[Verse 1: Peanut Flame]
Bitch I'm Sqad for life
Hit ya one time, and if you don't die
Bitches scarred for life
Yall niggas hermaphrodites
Better grip ya torch is tight
When we park and cut off the lights
We'll hold the fight
Believe these lil' dawgs'll bite
I'm talkin' phsyc' when I'm on or off the mic
In the rawest night, you gon' afford the price
Call us soft or dark or light
Jus because my voice is light
The bottom of my arms is bright
The chrome is right here, stand right on the site
You don't wanna be in that place
Wit' ya mom with a sad face
While they go and put your ashes in that vase
Gimme room, gimme, get back, space
Fore I fix it where yo jaw can't git back strait
And the streets is too raw, it can't get back safe
If a Josh should kiddy on the strength of the weight
Look I'm not a white boy, not a new kid on the block
Want the white boy holla, the kid on the block, ya know

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

That Sqad shit, oh, oh

[Verse 2: J.Gutter]
It's like a nigga don't get no sleep
I'm tryna be the first nigga up so I can murk the streets
Sit flock fat rocks, got a bag of trees
Fuckin' pigs on my ass, so they taxin' me
(J.Gutter) I gives a fuck let them bastards be
(J.Gutter) I got a hundred trash bags of weed
(J.Gutter) give it the fee and move rapidly
(J.Gutter) Supa in the kitchen and he wrappin' ki's
I'm on the block, nigga puttin' in work
Hustle hard from first to first, but wait it gets worst
I gotta get it 'til I'm lyin' in a hearse
Dreams to lockdown, souf side of the earth
I'ma be Gutta til I'm lyin' in the dirt
These niggas askin' if I'm dyin' to a nurse
Nigga I'm hustla, I'ma grind 'til it hurts
It's Gutta Gutta, bitch

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
Yea, I'm a hustler baby, I just want you to know, yeah
And I love me some ki's, quarters ounces and O's
Nah, while this 'bout to bubble, so put it in there fast
To take all this crack and go flood the ave
Cuttin' back, crums to grams
From hand to hand, dubs to grands
From the slums to them industry club jams
I keep it jumpin', Supa my frontman
Because I gotta do this rap shit jus for a front end
And if I ever see the day my music bum-bump
Back to the block to pump sand
Know how to live call me young man
And shit I did it for my daddy
And understand if you lookin' for pitcture round that nigga in the alley
What? Niggas still got it all the time, just find me
True hustlers never stops to grind, I'm grindin'
When the drought come around some prices go up, my numbers come down
Nigga got hovers, got pounds, got bundles
Slick with the hustle
Weezy leave you with the itch and the uptown shuffle
Gimme a plate
Come through with that shit that they had back in '88
Balloons of heroine, silver packs are 88
Crazy wait paper straight
Lazy eye Mercedes 5
Slow and drive
We don't need the cop to pull us over got that blow in inside
Man the bitch ain't got no in size
'Cause it stop with the yay from the floor up
Come tell Weezy wee you need that yola
I got more coke than coca-cola
Ima solja holdin down the nola

[Verse 1]
It's you and your world and I'm caught in the middle
I caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can't be your friend
It's my head or my heart, and I'm caught in the middle

[Pre-Chorus]
My hands are tied, but not tied enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

[Chorus]
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

[Verse 2]
Eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time
Before the rush to my blood was too much and we flatlined
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends
Now I'm all messed up and it feels like the first time

[Chorus]
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

[Pre-Chorus]
My hands are tied, but not tied enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

[Chorus]
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

[Verse 1]
I've been a man ever since I can remember
I've never been a big fan of December
The nights get cold
Nobody there to take care of me
Nobody there to tell me that they love me
And nobody knows

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But we were born and raised in the days
Where you couldn't even pay to get away from the pain
And that's where we live, all day
And now we get paid to be slaves of our very own grave
And I say it every goddamn day, "That's no way to live"

[Chorus]
I've been called the murderer, killer
I've just played with the hand that they deal us
I've been called a loser, an outlaw
Shut down in my very own backyard
In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance
In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance
Don't back down, don't back down, not now, not never

[Verse 2]
What's your agenda, I never claimed that I wasn't a sinner
Bless my soul
I've been down for too many days
I might drown in all these haters out of control

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We were born and raised in the days
Where you couldn't even pay to get away from the pain
And that's where we live, permanently
But now we get paid to be slaves of our very own grave
And I say it every goddamn day, "That's no way to live"
No, not for me

[Chorus]
I've been called the murderer, killer
I've just played with the hand that they deal us
I've been called a loser, an outlaw
Shut down in my very own backyard
In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance
In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance
Don't back down, don't back down, not now, not never

[Bridge]
Who better to fix you other than you? ooh
You know exactly what you want, you know exactly what you gotta do
You just gotta do it, do it
You just gotta do it, do it

[Chorus]
I've been called the murderer, killer
I've just played with the hand that they deal us
I've been called a loser, an outlaw
Shut down in my very own backyard
In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance
In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance
Don't back down, don't back down, not now, not never

I'm back up in your shit just like a bounty hunter
Don't worry about ya bitch, I know you countin' on her
Mounted on her, went up in the club and threw a thousand on her
Took her back to the crib and put the hounds on her

Spittin' fire, spittin' flames, on my ring, got seven figures
I'ma rearrange things on these niggas, yeah

If I need a do' kicked in, my bitch'll knock it for me, oh

[Chorus]
That's how it go
Put my hand on the bible, nigga, I done took the oath
Y'all niggas slow, come and holla

Once they see what I got poppin'

Just know! (Just know!)
Them coppers won't stop me
Once they see what I got poppin'

I call that BMW a rump shaker

That suicide open, I got plenty mo'

I ain't 'bout to entertain these fuckboys
They been talkin' that shit, they done made enough noise
Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
On the low, I've been tryna to be that humble—
Motherfucker, but I'm 'bout to let it go

[Chorus]

Put my hand on the bible, nigga, I done took the oath
Y'all niggas slow, come and holla

Just breathe, all you need is one last chance

[Chorus]
So may I have this dance?
'Cause I, all I got one last chance

[Verse 3: Mr. Talkbox]
Oh yeah, T-Pain, let me explain
I couldn't help it, but I saw you walking into the room
You won't find me, and I caught a whiff of your sweet perfume
And you got me feeling like I wanna be in the groove
But I gotta stay focused on what I came to do
But my train of thought came rolling right back to you
You and me on that dance floor, baby come through
Touch me, let's get close
'Cause girl I want to show you a good time
If you wanna know what I'm feeling for you
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Let's dance, 'cause all you need is one more chance
Ooh baby, may I?

[Interlude]

[T-Pain]
Oh me, one more chance

[Verse 1]
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home

[Chorus]
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse 2]
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home

[Chorus]
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse 1]
Now I gotta add you to my list of people to try and forget about
Now I gotta add yours to my list of faces to try and not think about
Now I gotta tell 'em I don't care and hope that nobody might work it out
It was obviously an illusion 'cause there's never been so much I've been wrong about
And I don't want to spend all my days thinking of the one I can't live without
So I'm gonna have to add you to my list of people to try and forget about
To try and for-

[Chorus]
And as the years go by
Your name will fade out gradually
They'll think my heart went dry
But it was waiting in-

[Verse 2]
So now I gotta add you to my list of people to try and forget about
It could've been magic, nearly had ya, can you imagine? Nearly had ya
'Til it becomes another one of the things that I just can't talk about
I'm gonna have to keep you on my list of people to try and forget about
Try and for-

[Chorus]
And as the years go by
Your name will fade out gradually
They'll think my heart went dry
But it was waiting in the wings
And as the years go by
You'll stay a banished memory
They'll say my love has died
But it was waiting in the wings
I was trying to resolve and I’m waiting
It felt natural
Oh, I was hoping it would come out right
Who was I kidding

Push the button and start counting down
Oh, time is crawling to the moment
Beyond which
I can choose
I can fall
I can lose
Control
I concur
With the doubt
But I can’t
Turn back round
And they trip
What’s beyond
But time
Is rolling on
Rolling on
Now let’s do this right
Everybody
(And I’ll be trying)
It won’t come out right

I can fold
I can lose
Control
I can lose
Control
I can face
The unknown
Yes, I must
Venture there
If I fail
I don’t care

(Now let’s do this right)
There’s so much
Left unclear
But it’s time
Taxi’s here

[Verse 1]
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down
But I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound (Hey!)
Like thunder, gonna shake your ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am the champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar!

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar!

["Dark Horse"— Katy Perry]

[Verse 1]
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
'Cause I’m capable of anything
Of anything and everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don’t make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy

[Chorus]
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for (you should know)
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse (like a dark horse)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine (oh yeah!)
There’s no going back
There’s no going back
There’s no going back

["I Kissed A Girl" — Katy Perry]

[Verse: Lenny Kravitz and Katy Perry]
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what, I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

[Chorus: Lenny Kravitz and Katy Perry, Katy Perry]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

["Teenage Dream" — Katy Perry]

[Verse]
You think I'm pretty
Without any make-up on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I'll let my walls come down, down

Before you met me
I was alright
But things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my valentine, valentine

[Chorus]
You make me
Feel like
I'm living a, teenage, dream
The way you turn me on
I, can't, sleep
Let's runaway
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My, heart, stops
When you look at me
Just, one, touch
Now baby I believe
This, is, real
So take a chance
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Bridge]
I'm a get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight, tonight

Katy Perry: (Make some noise Super Bowl)

(crowd applause)

["California Gurls" — Katy Perry]

[Verse 1]
Katy Perry: "I know a place (sing it!)"
Crowd: "Where the grass is really greener"

Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

["Get Ur Freak On" — Missy Elliot]

[Verse]
Missy be puttin' it down, I'm the hottest 'round
I told y'all, y'all can't stop me now
Listen to me now, I'm lastin' twenty rounds
And if you want me  then come on, get me now
Is you with me now? Then biggie, biggie bounce
I know you dig the way I sw-sw-switch my style
Holla
People sing around
Now people gather 'round, now people jump around

[Chorus]
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on
Go, getcha getcha getcha getcha getcha freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on

["Work It" — Missy Elliot]

[Verse]
Is it worth it? Let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup (lets go Super Bowl)
If you got a big *elephant trumpet*, let me search ya
And find out how hard I gotta work ya
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup

["Lose Control" — Missy Elliot]

[Verse 1: Missy Elliot & Sample from "Body Work"]
Music make you lose control
I got a cute face, chubby waist
Thick legs, in shape
Rump shakin, both ways
Make you do a double take
Planet rocker, show stopper
Flow proper, head knocker
Beat scholar, tail dropper
Do my thang

[Chorus: Missy Elliot & (Fatman Scoop)]
(Just throw your hands in the air!)
(Just throw your hands in the air!)
(Just throw your hands in the air!)

Music make you lose control

["Firework" — Katy Perry]

[Verse 1]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
C'mon, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Bridge]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
C'mon, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Outro]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

Katy Perry: "Oh, yeah, yeah! Thank you and God bless America!"

[Verse 1]
Red lips are always moving fast
Never gonna make me laugh
Wanna smash your mouth, like glass, into a thousand pieces
Stop calling on my telephone
Can't you leave me left alone?
Push you in a volcano flames for your burning ego

[Pre-Chorus]
In my ride, I got no room for you
In your head, you know you hate me too

[Chorus]
So, can you please shut up?
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
So, can you please shut up?
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
So, can you please shut up?

[Verse 2]
You never really turn me on
Tried, but always get it wrong
Now we're never gonna touch, and she's been seperated
Bored when I look into your eyes
Sparks were never meant to fly
Sometimes I just wanna die
Coffin feels like a vaca

[Pre-Chorus]
In my bed, I got no room for you
In your head, you know you hate me too

[Chorus]
So, can you please shut up?
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
So, can you please shut up?
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
So, can you please shut up?

[Bridge]
No sleep
Laying with your body
Cold to me
Trying to erase my memory
Need to breathe
Need to leave this destiny behind
Even though we're enemies
I don't really feel a thing
No love, no hate
Dead hearts won't break

No sleep
Laying with your body
Cold to me
Trying to erase my memory
Need to breathe
Need to leave this destiny behind

[Outro]
So, can you please shut up?
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
So, can you please shut up?
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
So, can you please shut up?

Chick is lookin' at me strange, but you know I don't care
Step up in this motha, just a-swangin' my hair
Trick quit talkin', crip-walk if you down with the set
Take a bullet with some grip and take this smoke on this jet
Out o' town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if you happen to get cracked, trick shut your trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the S, you'll be relievin' your stress

[Verse 1]
I thought that we could be alone
I thought that I could handle you, baby
At night, I'm flicking through your phone
Never used to acting this crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I would die for a sip of your poison
Baby, I would drown just to be in your ocean
Do you know I'd give it all to you?

[Chorus]
I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
I still hold on, after all that we've been through
I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
But I can't let go
No, I can't let go, can't help myself
'Cause I lose my mind when I picture you with someone else
Hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you

[Verse 2]
Lock me up and set me free
You hurt me, then you act like you're my saviour
But every time you're holding me
I stay because I love a little danger

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I would die for a sip of your poison
Baby, I would drown just to be in your ocean
Do you know I'd give it all to you?

[Chorus]
I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
I still hold on, after all that we've been through
I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
But I can't let go
No, I can't let go, can't help myself
'Cause I lose my mind when I picture you with someone else
Hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
PART 1: NOT IN THAT WAY

[Verse 1]
And I hate to say I love you
When it's so hard for me
And I hate to say I want you
When you make it so clear
You don't want me

[Chorus]
I'd never ask you cause deep down
I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say I'm sorry, believe me, I love you
But not in that way

[Verse 2]
And I hate to say I need you
I'm so reliant, I'm so dependent, I'm such a fool
When you're not there, I find myself singing the blues
Can't bear, can't face the truth

[Link]
You will never know that feeling
You will never see through these eyes

PART 2: CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE

[Outro]
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you
Falling in love with you

[Intro: Trugoy the Dove & 2D]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, feel good
Feel Good
Sha, sha ba da, sha ba da, Feel Good
Feel Good
Sha, sha ba da, sha ba da, Feel Good
Feel Good
Sha, sha ba da, sha ba da, Feel Good
(Change) Sha, sha (Change) ba da (Change), sha ba da (Change)
(Change) Sha, sha (Change) ba da (Change), sha ba da (Change)

[Verse 1: 2D]
City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got her kissing, 'cause I don't get sleep, no
*Beep*

[Chorus: 2D]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love has freely
Turned forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Verse 2: De La Soul]
Laughin' gas these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like a** cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
S***, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (yeah)
Care Bear rappin' in harder this year (yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo' sound, you kill the Inc
So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it)
Until you're cheddar head
And watch the way I navigate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha (Ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)

[Interlude: 2D]
Change, change, change, change

[Verse 3: Madonna]
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby
Night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you

[Bridge: Madonna]
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do

[Outro: Trugoy the Dove]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Hook: 2D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on

[Verse 1: Si Phili]
Yo. Yo
Cause I'm this, Gorillaz from the mist lyricist and my thoughts be twisted
I spit the wickedest rhymes from a time that's never existed
My futuristic linguistics turn fools into statistics
I'm a lyrical misfit with the sadistic characteristics
I perform murderous acts on my tracks with a single breath
And if a boy wanna fi test, then I be stampin' upon his chest
Done makin' a mess - not a man could conceive the weed I'm consumin'
And I transform from my cartoon pseudonym, turn to a human
I spit words from my mouth that be turnin' you inside out
And I tie knots in intestines just like I'm a boy scout
That's workin' 'em out - Now rearrangin' your whole skeletal structure
Then I find some nine inch nails to perform some acupuncture
When I punch ya, I rupture one of your rib cage in a rage
And I turn you into a cartoon toon and erase the page
I take you back to the stone age with Barney and Fred Flinstone
Get Dino to tear your Moschinos and then force you to limp home

[Hook: 2D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
