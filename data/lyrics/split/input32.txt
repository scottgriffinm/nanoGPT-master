 in an instant

[Chorus]

[x6]

[Verse 1]
We make all of our suns the same
Every one will suffer the fire we've made
They all explode just the same
And there's no going back on the plans we've made

[Pre-Chorus]
Peacekeeper take your time
Wait for the dark of night
Soon all the suns will rise

[Chorus 1]
Peacekeeper don't tell why
Don't be afraid to fight
Love is the sweet surprise
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Only creatures who are on their way
Ever poison their own well
But we still have time to hate
And there's still something we can sell

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
When the night is cold and still
When you thought you'd had your fill
Take all the time you will
This is not a test, it's not a drill
Take no prisoners, only kill
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 3]
You know all of our friends are gods
And they all tell us how to paint our face
But there's only one brush we need
It's the one that never leaves a trace (leaves a trace, leaves a trace)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
Think of me, sweet darling
When everything is going bad
Think of me, sweet darling
Every time you're feeling sad
Think of me, sweet darling
Every time you don't come
Can you feel the fever?
Think of me, sweet darling
Every time things get rough
Think of me, sweet darling
When the best just isn't enough
Think of me, sweet darling
Every time you don't come
Can you feel the fever?

[Chorus]
Because nobody else is doing it, whoa
And nobody else is doing it, no no
Where's the harmony? Where's the humanity?
Love, was a little too scarce
Hey, hey, ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
I said I was going before it got away
She's been here a while
Living in the guest room
I guess she goes in style
I said I was going before it got away
But I just can't let her go
Can you feel the fever?
Now I lay me down to sleep in this enemy bed
Tomorrow morning I will wake up
Hurting from the things we've said
One thing leads to another
But I guess you know about that
Can you feel the fever?

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
Think of me sweet darling
Every time you don't come

[Verse 1]
Go on, save yourself
Leave the key here
You love someone else
I shouldn't be here
Don't ask me why
You know the answer
If she's so willing, little one
There was no chance there
I have come to know
This world of changing faces
I can't fight the world
I can't change it
So be true to me
My walls are flaming
If she's so willing, little one
I won't be staying

[Chorus]
Ah, ah
(Turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can, just as fast as I can)
Ah, ah
(I should've turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can, just as fast as I can)

[Verse 2]
I am older now
But I still remember
I took the greatest fall
I can't accept her
So be true to me
My walls are flaming
If she's so willing, little one
I won't be staying

[Chorus]
Ah, ah
(Turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can, just as fast as I can)
Ah, ah
(I should've turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can, just as fast as I can)

Ah, ah
(Turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can, just as fast as I can)
Ah, ah
(I should've turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can, just as fast as I can)

[Verse 3]
What you did not need
Was a woman who was stronger
You needed someone
To depend on you
I could not be her
I did not want to
My first mistake
Was to smile at you
Smile at you

[Bridge]
Go on, save yourself
Leave the key here
You love someone else
I shouldn't be here
Don't ask me why
You know the answer
If she's so willing, little one
There was no chance there

[Chorus]
Ah
(Turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can, just as fast as I can)
Ah, ah
(I should've turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can, just as fast as I can)
Ah, ah
(Turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can, just as fast as I can)
Ah, ah

[Outro]
Go on, save yourself
Leave the key here
You love someone else
I shouldn't be here
Go on, save yourself
Go on, save yourself
I shouldn't be here
I shouldn't be here
I shouldn't be here

[Verse 1]
My eyes were consumed
By the silence in the room
Your dreams would not wake
From the words that we break

[Chorus]
Hello, hello, sad angel
Have you come to fight the war
The drums, a fire, a calling
My soul marches out the door
We fall to earth together
The crowd calling out for more
Hello, hello, sad angel
Have you come to fight the war

[Verse 2]
My eyes saw the words
With a prayer and a curse
Your pain had to sleep
With a sword that it keeps

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Outro]
Come to fight the war 

[x2]
Hello, hello, hello 

[x5]

[Verse 1]
Until she herself
Became the deadliest poison
As she grew older
Ooh, until she herself
Became just as fatal
As was her garden

[Pre-Chorus]
And so you run toward
What you know is wrong
There are too many flowers
To cut down
With all the love I have for your life
For the love I have for your life
Turn around

[Chorus]
Never did I mean to (never did I mean to)
Imprison you (imprison you)
Here in my garden (here in my garden)
Like I am imprisoned (like I am imprisoned)
All the love I have for your life

[x2]
Turn around (turn around)

[Verse 2]
Until she herself
Understood her garden
Leaving her heart broken
No future at all
Until she herself
Became the toxic garden
Always frightened
No future at all

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
For the love I have (for the love I have)

[x2]
Turn around

[Verse 1]
She was a silver girl
Lost in a high tech world
She was a golden girl
Immersed in a hard core world
She would have preferred
The last generation
But that's all right
She's on her way
She had the Midas touch
She was Lady Luck
She's got a million bucks
And she looks like it
She's had a few hard times
Sometimes it blows her mind
Those papers she never signed
Sometimes she remembers

[Chorus]
Sometimes she was just an actress
But you'll never really know
A shadow moves across her face
You cannot see her soul
Unless she lets you
See her soul

[Verse 2]
She was a girlie girl
Caught in a man's world
And as her world turns
She feels so alone
Still she's a danger girl
Insane far beyond her years
On some things she's very clear
She's a wild adventurer

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Bridge]
You cannot see her soul

[x2]
You cannot see her soul unless she lets you
See her soul
See her soul, if she lets you
See her soul

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
All alone we go on day after day
All alone we suffer
Oh, to steal your heart away

It's the same old thing in the same old way
All alone we suffer
Oh, to steal your heart away

[Pre-Chorus]
And the lie was creeping
Down, down, down
While we were sleeping
Suddenly we hit the ground

[Chorus]
So come on, let's go, let's run away
If that's all, all there is
Oh, to steal your heart away

[x3]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]

[x4]
Suffer
The lonely suffer
Steal your heart away

[Verse 1]
We see no change in sight
Watching her decline
She gets on a midnight plane
She's done it a thousand times
When love starts out in the darkness
It doesn't do well in the light
Affairs of the heart
That start out in the dark
Usually stay with the night

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you don't agree
(Everyday you tell me)
I know you don't agree

[Chorus]
I know he loves me
Everyday he calls me
He says he adores me
What can I say
You can't love him
You can't have him
I do have him, most of the time
Anywhere we can
Anytime we can
Get away, get away

[Verse 2]
Maybe it's just something else
That you can't tell me
Maybe it's in the way that you
Look away from me
It's not like any words
Need to be said
Well you always know when something's wrong
My friend

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 3]
We see no change in sight
Watching her decline
She gets on a midnight plane
She's done it a thousand times
When love starts out in the darkness
It doesn't do well in the light
Affairs of the heart
That start out in the dark
Usually stay with the night
When nobody sees them
At least, not together
She rarely goes out
She spends every day
Waiting for the day

[Bridge]
When everybody finds out
Don't you know, don't you know

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Walk down this road
When the road gets rough
I fall down
I get up

[Chorus]
I am what I am (Am what I am, I am what I am, am what I am)
A family man (A family man)
I am what I am (Am what I am, I am what I am, am what I am)
A family man (A family man)
Mother... father... brother
Mother... father... brother

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Walk down this road
In the cool of the night
Don't know what's wrong
But I do know what's right

[Chorus]
I am what I am (Am what I am, I am what I am, am what I am)
A family man (A family man)
I am what I am (Am what I am, I am what I am, am what I am)
A family man (A family man)
Mother... father... brother
Mother... father... brother

[Chorus]
I am what I am (Am what I am, I am what I am, am what I am)
A family man (A family man)
I am what I am (Am what I am, I am what I am, am what I am)
A family man (A family man)
Mother... father... brother
Mother... father... brother

[Verse 1]
Maybe we were together in another life
Maybe we are together in a parallel universe
Maybe our paths are not supposed to cross twice
Maybe your arms are not supposed to go around me
I hear about you now and then
I wonder where you are and how you feel
Sometimes I walk by and I look up to your balcony
Just to make sure that you were real
Just to make sure that I can still feel you

[Chorus]
When I see you again
As I always do
It appears to me that
Destiny rules
And the spirits are ruthless with the paths they choose
It's not being together
It's just following the rules
No one's a fool

[Verse 2]
Six weeks in a foreign country, how the time flew
I didn't speak the language, but somehow I knew
That that would be the only time that we could be alone and foolish
We said we'd never come home

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I like the coastal cities, I like the lights
I like the way the city blends into the ocean at night
It's like living on a working river; the coastline is glittering
Like a diamond snake in a black sky

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Just following the rules, no one's a fool

[x3]
No one's a fool

[Verse 1]
So you face yesterday
Thinking on the days of old
And the price that we paid
For a love we couldn't hold
I let you slip away
There was nothing I could do
That was so long ago, yeah
Still I often think of you
I fall down, I get up
And I've always had to fight
Everything that was wrong
For the things that were right

[Chorus]
Now I finally found my way
Now I know just what to do
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
Now I say goodbye to you

[Verse 2]
It's so hard to find your way
When the lies come around
Still it happens everyday
So don't let it get you down
Just a time within a time
Just a scheme within a scheme
A little world within a world
Yes, a dream, just a dream

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Now I best be on my way
Before the night turns blue
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
And now I say goodbye to you
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
Now I say goodbye to you

[Verse 1]
I've been searching
For a pot of gold
Like the kind you find
At the end of the rainbow
I've been dreaming
I thought it was in vain
Ah but now you're here
Can't believe that you're back again

[Chorus 1]
Now I know I can't lose
As long as you follow
I'm going to win
(I'm going to win)
I'm going to beg, steal, or borrow
As long as you follow

[Verse 2]
I've been wandering
Gone away too far
But the road was rough
To get back where you are
And the sun went down
It never seemed to rise
Ah but now you're here
With the light shining in your eyes

[Chorus 1]

[x2]

[Chorus 2]

[x2]
(As long as you follow)
As long as you follow
(As long as you follow)
As long as you follow

[Intro]
It's not home
And it's not Tara
In fact, do I know you?
Have I been here before?
This is a dream, right?
Déjà vu
Did I come here on my own?
Oh, I see

[Chorus]
Welcome to the room, Sara, for Scarlett
Welcome to the choir, sir

[Verse 1]
Ooh, missionary
Well, I will be different
When I get back
And you can take all of the credit
You say everything's fine, baby
But sometimes at night
Where the first cut is the deepest one of all (Scarlett) (First cut is the deepest one of all)
And the second one
Well, it's a worthless thing, so take it all the way back home
Take it home
Ooh, downstairs where the big old house is mine
Ohh, upstairs where the stars laugh and shine
Oh, oh, well, I thought that you were mine
Well, I thought that you were mine

[Chorus]
Welcome to the room, Sara, Sara (for Scarlett)
Welcome to the choir, sir

[Verse 2]
Well, of course it was a problem (for Scarlett)
Front line, baby
Well, you held her prisoner
And after all these years
Well, as well as you knew her (Welcome)
In the never forgotten words of another one of your friends
In the never forgotten words of another one of your friends, baby
When you hang up that phone
Well, you cease to exist

[Outro]
Welcome to the room, Sara
Welcome
Welcome to the room, everyone

[Verse 1]
Don't take me to the tower and take my child away
It was I who was the hourglass
And the sands of time like shattering glass
Went past me like a tunnel to the sea
And I, who went to sleep as two
Woke up as one now only you remain
You'll close your eyes and travel back
To the time when the light went fading fast
And the words you'll never, never forget, oh no
As you slipped away

[Chorus]
Goodbye, baby
I hope your heart's not broken
Don't forget me
Yes, I was outspoken
You were with me all the time
I'll be with you one day

[Verse 2]
And I, who went to sleep in tears
Woke up in tears, for all of the years
And I, who never, never said goodbye
As I slipped away

[Chorus]
Goodbye, baby
I hope your heart's not broken
Don't forget me
Yes, I was outspoken
You were with me all the time
I'll be with you one day
Goodbye, baby
I hope your heart's not broken
Don't forget me
Yes, I was outspoken
You were with me all the time
I'll be with you one day
Yes, I'll be with you one day

[Verse 1: Christine McVie]
So cool, calm and collected
You had a style, a rakish style
Well, my poor heart never connected
You'd stay so long on my mind

[Chorus: Christine McVie & Lindsey Buckingham]
Well, isn't it midnight on the other side of the world?
Do you remember
The face of a pretty girl?
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl?
The face of a pretty girl

[Verse 2: Christine McVie]
Looking back, so long ago
You had a knack, a knack of making women know
Ooh, there wasn't the time
And I knew you'd never be mine

[Chorus: Christine McVie & Lindsey Buckingham]
Well, isn't it midnight on the other side of the world?
Do you remember
The face of a pretty girl?
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl?
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Christine McVie & Lindsey Buckingham]
Isn't it midnight on the other side of the world?
Do you remember
The face of a pretty girl?
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl?
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl?
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl

[Verse 1]
Got a black magic woman
I got a black magic woman
Yes, I got a black magic woman
She's got me so blind I can't see
But she's a black magic woman
And she's trying to make a Devil out of me

[Verse 2]
Don't turn your back on me baby
Don't turn your back on me baby
Yes, don't turn your back on me baby
You're messing around with your tricks
Don't turn your back on me baby
Because you might just break up my magic stick

[Verse 3]
You got your spell on me baby
You got your spell on me baby
Yes, you got your spell on me baby
You're turning my heart into stone
I need you so bad, magic woman
I can't leave you alone

[Outro]
Yes, I need you so bad
Well, I need you darling
Yeah, I need you darling
Yes, I want you to love me
I want you to love me
Whoa, I want you to love me, ah
Whoh, yeah
Oh, whoa, baby
Yes, I need your love
Oh, I need your love so bad
Yes, I want you to love me

[Intro]
When I see you again
Will it be the same?
When I see you again
Will it be over?
When I see you again
Will your great eyes still say

[Chorus]
What's the matter, baby (What's the matter, baby)
What's the matter, baby (What's the matter, baby)
What's the matter, baby, baby, baby
What's the matter, baby (What's the matter, baby)
What's the matter, baby (What's the matter, baby)
What's the matter, baby, baby

[Verse 1]
So she walks slowly down the hall
There are many doors in the hallway
And she stares at the stairs
Ooh, there are many things to stare at these days
If she sees him again
Will your very best friend
Will your very best friend
Oh, have been replaced by some other?

[Chorus]
(What's the matter, baby) What's the matter, baby
(What's the matter, baby) What's the matter, baby, baby, baby
What's the matter, baby (What's the matter, baby)
What's the matter, baby (What's the matter, baby)
What's the matter, baby, baby

[Verse 2]
And the dream says I want you
And the dream is gone
So she stays up nights on end
Well, at least there is a dream left

[Outro]
If I see you again
Will it be over?
If I see you again
Will it be the same?
If I see you again
Will it be over?
Again and again
Over and over

[Verse 1]
And when the roses are half-bud soft flowers
And lovely as the king of flies has come
It was a fleeting visit, all too brief
In three short minutes, he had been and gone

[Verse 2]
He rested there upon an apple leaf
A gorgeous opal crown sat on his head
Although the garden is a lovely place
Was it worthy of so fine a guest?

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Dragonfly, dragonfly

[Verse 1]
To be the last to leave, the last to be gone
Stolen from the ones who held onto it
To be the last in line, oh, the ones that live on
Silhouette of a dream treasured by the ones
Who hung onto it
Almost a breakdown of our love affair
The stiletto cuts quick like a whip through the air
Long distance winners, will we survive the flight?
Not one of us runs from the fire light

[Chorus]
I would love to believe, I believe what you say
In the drama of the moment
Oh no, there is no easy way, no one ever leaves
Everyone stays close until the fire fades
I would love to believe, I believe what you say
In the drama of the moment
Oh no, there is no easy way, no one ever leaves
Everyone stays close until the fire fades

[Verse 2]
To be the last to leave what caused the fearsome
Divorce in the night, there was no competition
Well, to survive, do it right and you believe in the five
To survive the distance everyone fights
Everyone fights and the fire flies
What happened to my feelings
When heartbreak comes in the night?
Some call it my nightmare, my five fireflies
Well, like a sailing ship on one of love's rocks, no one

[Outro]
Of our love affair like a whip through the air
I would love to believe, I believe what you say
Fireflies

[Verse 1]
You've got a sweet heart
Never will you be replaced
And it's so hard
The memory can't be erased

[Chorus 1]
Love shines when I think of you
You make it happen, you make it true
Love shines there can be no doubt
What this feeling is all about

[Chorus 2]
Oh, baby your love shines
Love shines so bright, so bright
Oh, did you know your
Love shines, love shines so bright

[Chorus 3]
On and on it will always be
Rhythm, rhyme and harmony
Yeah, baby your love shines
Love shines tonight, tonight

[Verse 2]
You cast a spell
A magical revelation
And I see so well
My ultimate destination

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Bridge]
After all the reckoning
After all the promises
All the darkness in my heart
Has gone away, gone away

[Chorus 3]
So on and on it will always be
Rhythm, rhyme and harmony
Yes, baby your love shines
Love shines tonight

[Chorus 2]
Oh, don't you know your
Love shines, love shines so bright
Oh, baby your love shines
Love shines so bright

[Verse - Fleetwood Mac]
When I see him, I feel him
There's an intenseness
In him, in his eyes
He wants me to be with him
He wants me with him now
Because she just seems to be missing
How could that happen anyhow?
So how can you say
Well I don't know what love is?
You haven't and you have no time for it
You feel completely different
You feel pushed up against the wall
And then one day it just almost goes away
You spend lots of time alone and
Sometimes you spend years
And you miss those arms that used to go around you
Night after night
No questions asked and
Who cares, the cold wind of it all, every time
Well it's hard to be civil
And it's real hard to be nice
But you did it my love every time
So how can you say well I can't see you
Not now, not tomorrow, not until it's right
Not until
None of us is pushed up against the wall
I don't know, the wind doesn't get you anymore
So today she says, "Well I've changed my mind"
"That's a woman's right", they say
Well I'm frightened and I'm lost and I
Can't give you up, not now I need you now
I'm broken-hearted
Broke down like a little girl
Well I need you now, well I'm broken hearted
Well I broke down, like a little girl

[Chorus - Fleetwood Mac] x2
(I need you now, no questions asked)
Well I broke down like a little girl
(I need you now, no questions asked)
I broke down like a little girl
(Need you now, no questions asked)

(I need you now, no questions asked)
Well I broke down like a little girl
(I need you now, no questions asked)
I broke down like a little girl
(Need you now, no questions asked)

[Verse 1]
You like a man with a future
You like a woman with a past
Well, do you really believe that?
She said to the faces in the crowd

[Chorus]
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
(Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
(Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)

[Verse 2]
And even if you did miss me, you never let me know
You'd prefer to be just a little bit in and out of love with me
And not to scream and shout
You'd prefer to be just a little bit in and out of agony

[Chorus]
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
(Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
(Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)

[Verse 3]
Come on now, let the sad winds blow down
As the rain came, she refused to wear her coat
But deep in her heart she knew
That the song must go on
He says "Well, I have forgotten you
And your beautiful eyes
We were off the wall
We were mirrors of our former selves"
"Well, you could have said, 'No'
You could have said, 'Well I just can't'
Whoa, we were off the wall
We were mirrors of each other passing by"

[Chorus]
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
(Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
(Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Well I was your paper doll
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Paper doll
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Well I was you paper doll
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Paper doll

[Bridge]
And it doesn't even matter
(I was fascinated by somebody else)
It was a real clear answer
(I was fascinated by somebody else)
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
(I was fascinated by somebody else)
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
(I was fascinated by somebody else)

[Chorus 1]
Yes there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
Yes there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
Yes it was these blues you gave me
When you left me
Oh when you left me that day

[Chorus 2]
When somebody leaves you
You just lose a friend
But when you left me babe
Thought it was the end

[Chorus 1]
Because there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
Yes it was these blues you gave me
When you left me
Oh when you left me that day

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
Because there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
Yes it was the blues you gave me
When you left me
Oh when you left me that day

[Verse 1]
Baby, I've just been holding out too long
Maybe I couldn't admit I was wrong
And maybe I've just been lying to myself
And no one else

[Chorus]
Slow down, baby
Cross that line
If you want to save me
It takes time
It takes time

[Verse 2]
Maybe I've wasted all this precious time
I'm trying to prove what is and isn't mine
Wondering to myself if you knew
It was all for you

[Chorus]
It takes time 

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I had another dream about you last night
Sailing on a sea of blue
You were grieving for someone else
I was grieving for you

[Chorus]
Miss fantasy
It may be you don’t remember me
But I remember you

[Verse 2]
In between the shadow and the song
In between the black and blue
From the window I heard your voice
Telling me you were through

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Miss fantasy
I can see you don’t remember me
But I remember you

[Bridge]
Do you still tremble when I fall?
Will you still answer when I call?
Would you still love to lean her up against a wall?
Everyone whispers when you go
Into the silence of down below
Ten thousand voices cry, on with the show

[Verse 3]
Everybody’s singing shine your light
Everybody knows it’s true
But you’re not the queen of the underground
Never leaving a clue

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Miss fantasy
I can see you don’t remember be
But I remember you

I remember you 

[x4]

[Intro]
I know these girls names...
Hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, yeaah hold up (?)

[Verse]
Let me tell you about maria, she let me high, Aalyah
Thank God I ain't blind, I fuck her every time I see her
Smoke a blunt and fuck Aalyah, i don't know, i miss my coke
And get a beer from Sophia, You probably in that area
I know a bitch named Dominique, She live here by the beach
Her pussy get wet when you kiss her on the cheek
Used to fuck her every week, but now We don't speak
Cause I fuck her best friend, Angelina, she got a face
Like a Appleonia, her body like a lollipop
She rode me like a Horse

....
Let's impeach the President for lying
And misleading our country into war
Abusing all the power that we gave him
And shipping all our money out the door

He's the man who hired all the criminals
The White House shadows who hide behind closed doors
They bend the facts to fit with their new stories
Of why we have to send our men to war

Let's impeach the President for spying
On citizens inside their own homes
Breaking every law in the country
By tapping our computers and telephones

What if Al Qaeda blew up the levees
Would New Orleans have been safer that way
Sheltered by our government's protection
Or was someone just not home that day?

Flip - Flop
Flip - Flop
Flip - Flop
Flip - Flop
Let's impeach the president for hijacking
Our religion and using it to get elected
Dividing our country into colors
And still leaving black people neglected

Thank God he's cracking down on steroids
Since he sold his old baseball team
There's lots of people looking at big trouble
But of course our president is clean

Thank God

[Verse 1]
Alright, come close
Let me show you everything I know
A jungle slang
Spinning round my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky, gooey womb
A woozy youth
Dopes up on her silky, smooth perfume

[Pre-Chorus]
Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

[Chorus]
My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

[Verse 2]
Truth be told
I've been there, I've done this all before
I take your gloom
I curl it up and puff it into plumes

[Pre-Chorus]
Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

[Chorus]
My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

[Bridge]
Hold my hand and float back to the summer time
Tangled in the willows, now our tongues are tied
How can I believe you, how can I be nice?
Tripping round tree stumps in your summer smile

[Pre-Chorus]
Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

[Chorus]
My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

[George Bush]
"I'm not a hater... I don't hate Conway West. I was talking about an environment in which people were willing to say things that hurt. Nobody wants to be called a racist if in your heart you believe in equality of races."

[Verse 1]
Now that you've found yourself losing your mind
Are you here again?
Finding that what you once thought was real
Is gone and changing

[Chorus]
Now that you made yourself love me
Do you think I can change it in a day?
How can I place you above me?
Am I lying to you when I say
That I believe in you?
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh I believe in you

[Verse 2]
Coming to you at night, I see my questions
I feel my doubts
Wishing that maybe in a year or two we could laugh
And let it all out

[Chorus]
Now that you made yourself love me
Do you think I can change it in a day?
How can I place you above me?
Am I lying to you when I say
That I believe in you?
Oh oh, ooh ooh, oh oh I believe in you
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh I believe in you

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, Cripple Creek Ferry
Butting through the overhanging trees
Make way for the Cripple Creek ferry
The waters going down, it's a mighty tight squeeze

[Verse]
All alone the captain stands
Hasn't heard from his deck hands
The gambler tips his hat
And walks towards the door
It's the second half of the cruise
And you know he hates to lose

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, Cripple Creek Ferry
Butting through the overhanging trees
Make way for the Cripple Creek ferry
The waters going down, it's a mighty tight squeeze

[Verse 1]
I went into town to see you yesterday
But you were not home
So I talked to some old friends for a while
Before I wandered off alone

[Chorus]
It's so hard for me now
But I'll make it somehow
Though I know I'll never be the same
Won't you ever change your ways
It's so hard to make love pay
When you're on the losin' end
And I feel that way again

[Verse 2]
Well, I miss you more than ever
Since you've gone I can hardly maintain
Things are different round here
Every night my tears fall down like rain

[Chorus]
It's so hard for me now
But I'll make it somehow
Though I know I'll never be the same
Won't you ever change your ways
It's so hard to make love pay
When you're on the losin' end
And I feel that way again
It's so hard for me now
But I'll make it somehow
Though I know I'll never be the same
Won't you ever change your ways
It's so hard to make love pay
When you're on the losin' end
And I feel that way again

[Verse 1]
Think I'll pack it in and buy a pick-up
Take it down to L.A
Find a place to call my own and try to fix up
Start a brand new day
The woman I'm thinking of, she loved me all up
But I'm so down today
She's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear her calling

[Chorus]
See the lonely boy out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy, he tries to speak and
Can't begin to say

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 2]
She got pictures on the wall, they make me look up
From her big brass bed
Now I'm running down the road trying to stay up
Somewhere in her head
The woman I'm thinking of, she loved me all up
But I'm so down today
She's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear her calling

[Chorus]
See the lonely boy out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy, he tries to speak and
Can't begin to say
Oh

[Harmonica Outro]

[Verse 1]
Lover, there will be another one
Who'll hover over you beneath the sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today

[Chorus]
When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over

[Verse 2]
Nestled in your wings, my little one
Is special, morning brings another sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today

[Chorus]
When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over, oh

[Chorus]
I'm gonna give you till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
I'm only waiting till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
Till the morning comes

[Flugelhorn Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm gonna give you till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
I'm only waiting till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
Till the morning comes

[Verse 1]
Did I see you down in a young girl's town
With your mother in so much pain?
I was almost there at the top of the stairs
With her screamin' in the rain

[Chorus]
Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man

[Verse 2]
Did I see you walking with the boys?
Though it was not hand in hand
And was some black face in a lonely place
When you could understand?

[Chorus]
Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man

[Verse 3]
Will I see you give more than I can take?
Will I only harvest some?
As the days fly past, will we lose our grasp?
Or fuse it in the sun?

[Chorus]
Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man

[Verse 1]
Slippin' and a-slidin'
And playing domino
Lefting and then righting
It's not a crime, you know
You got to tell your story
Boy, before it's time to go

[Chorus]
Are you ready for the country?
Because it's time to go
Are you ready for the country?
Because it’s time to go

[Verse 2]
I was talking to the preacher
Said God was on my side
Then I ran into the hangman
He said. "It's time to die
You gotta tell your story boy
You know the reason why"

[Chorus]
Are you ready for the country?
Because it’s time to go
Are you ready for the country?
Because it’s time to go

[Verse 1]
There's a world you're living in
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
Take it in and blow hard

[Bridge 1]
Look around it, have you found it
Walking down the avenue?
See what it brings, could be good things
In the air for you

[Verse 2]
We are leaving, we are gone
Come with us to all alone
Never worry, never moan
We will leave you all alone

[Bridge 2]
In the mountains, in the cities
You can see the dream
Look around you, has it found you?
Is it what it seems?

[Verse 1]
There's a world you're living in
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
Take it in and blow hard

[Verse 1]
Oh, Alabama
The devil fools with the best laid plan
Swing low, Alabama
You got the spare change
You got to feel strange
And now, the moment
Is all that it meant

[Chorus]
Alabama
You got the weight on your shoulders
That's breaking your back
Your Cadillac
Has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track

[Verse 2]
Oh, Alabama
Banjos playing through the broken glass
Windows, down in Alabama
See the old folks
Tied in white robes
Hear the banjo
Don't it take you down home?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Alabama
You got the weight on your shoulders
That's breaking your back
Your Cadillac
Has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track

[Verse 3]
Oh, Alabama
Can I see you and shake your hand?
Make friends down in Alabama
I'm from a new land
I come to you and see all this ruin
What are you doing?

[Chorus]
Alabama
You've got the rest of the Union
To help you along
What's going wrong?

[Verse 1]
Someone and someone were down by the pond
Looking for something to plant in the lawn
Out in the fields, they were turning the soil
I'm sitting here hoping this water will boil
When I look through the window and out on the road
They're bringing me presents and sayin' hello

[Chorus]
Singing words, words
Between the lines of age
Words, words
Between the lines of age

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
If I was a junkman selling your cars
Washing your windows and shining your stars
Thinking your mind was my own in a dream
What would you wonder and how would it seem?
Living in castles a bit at a time
The King started laughing and talking in rhyme

[Chorus]
Singing words, words
Between the lines of age
Words, words
Between the lines of age

[Verse 1]
Oh hello Mr. Soul
I dropped by to pick up a reason
For the thought that I caught
That my head is the event of the season
Why in crowds just a trace
Of my face could seem so pleasing?
I'll cop out to the change
But a stranger is putting the tease on

[Verse 2]
I was down on a frown
When the messenger brought me a letter
I was raised by the praise of a fan
Who said I upset her
Any girl in the world could have easily known me better
She said, "You're strange, but don't change"
And I let her

[Verse 3]
In a while will the smile on my face turn to plaster?
Stick around while the clown who is sick
Does the trick of disaster
For the race of my head and my face
Is moving much faster
Is it strange I should change?
I don't know, why don't you ask her?
Is it strange I should change?
I don't
Is it strange I should change?
I don't

[Verse 1]
Soldier, your eyes
They shine like the sun
I wonder why
Soldier, your eyes
Shine like the sun
I wonder why

[Verse 2]
Jesus, I saw you
Walking on the river
I don't believe you
You can't deliver right away
I wonder why

[Outro]
Jesus, your eyes
Shine like the sun
I wonder why

[Verse 1]
Fourteen junkies too weak to work
One sells diamonds for what they're worth
Down on pain street, disappointment lurks

[Chorus]
Son, don't be home too late
Try to get back by eight
Son, don't wait till the break of day
'Cause you know how time fades
Time fades away
You know how time fades away

[Verse 2]
All day presidents look out windows
All night sentries watch the moon glow
All are waiting till the time is right

[Chorus]
Son, don't be home too late
Try to get back by eight
Son, don't wait till the break of day
'Cause you know how time fades
Time fades away
You know how time fades away

[Harmonica and Slide Guitar Solos]

[Verse 3]
Back in Canada I spent my days
Riding subways through a haze
I was handcuffed I was born and raised

[Chorus]
Son, don't be home too late
Try to get back by eight
Son, don't wait till the break of day
'Cause you know how time fades
Time fades away
You know how time fades away
You know how time fades away
You know how time fades away

[Verse 4]
Thirteen junkies too weak to work
One sells diamonds for what they're worth
Down on pain street, disappointment lurks

[Chorus]
Son, don't be home too late, no no no
Try to get back by eight, eight
Son, don't wait till the break of day
'Cause you know how time fades
Time fades away
You know how time fades away

[Outro]
Time fades away
You know how time, time fades away
You know how time fades away
You know how time fades away
Time fades away
You know how time fades away
Time fades away
You know how time fades away
Son, son, son
Son, don't wait till the break of day
'Cause you know how time fades away

[Verse 1]
Well, you heard about the Great Pretender?
I went to see him and he's not the same
Down by the club on the parking lot cinders
I was to meet him and play his game

[Chorus]
Yonder stands the sinner
He calls my name without a sound

[Verse 2]
I saw his face in the attic window
Yelling down through the broken pane
Sinner man, what you got to run for?
Church bells rang when he said that name

[Chorus]
Yonder stands the sinner
He calls my name without a sound

[Verse 3]
Well, I was about as scared as I could be
I went and hid behind the nearest tree
I peeked out from behind the branches
Sinner!

[Chorus]
Yonder stands the sinner
He calls my name without a sound
To get down

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
I guess you heard about the Great Pretender?
I went to see him and he's not the same
I guess you heard about the Great Pretender?
I went to see him and he's not the same

[Verse 1]
In a matter of time, there'll be a friend of mine
Going to come to the coast
You're going to see him up close for a minute or two
While the ground cracks under you

By the look in your eyes
You'd think that it was a surprise
But you seem to forget
Something somebody said
About the bubbles in the sea
And an ocean full of trees

[Chorus]
And you now, L.A. uptight
City in the smog, city in the smog
Don't you wish that you could be here too?
Don't you wish that you could be here too?
Don't you wish that you could be here too?

[Verse 2]
Well, it's hard to believe so you get up to leave
And you laugh at the door that you heard it all before
Oh it's so good to know
That it's all just a show for you
But when the suppers are planned
And the freeways are crammed
And the mountains erupt
And the valley is sucked
Into cracks in the earth
Will I finally be heard by you

[Chorus]
L.A. uptight
City in the smog, city in the smog
Don't you wish that you could be here too?
Don't you wish that you could be here too?
Don't you wish that you could be here too?

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning with love in mind
It was raining outside but my love still shined
Kept me warm till my plane touched the sky

[Verse 2]
And I've seen love make a fool of a man
He tried to make a loser win
But I've got nothing to lose
I can't get back again

[Bridge]
Man made rules been holdin' back my love
Can't hold it back no more
Churches long preach sex is wrong
Jesus where has nature gone?
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning with love in mind
It was raining outside but my love still shined
Kept me warm till my plane touched the sky

[Verse 1]
The bridge, we'll build it now
It may take a lot of time
And it may be lonely but
Ooh baby, ooh baby
The bridge was falling down
And that took a lot of lies
And it made me lonely
Ooh baby, ooh baby

[Chorus]
The bridge was falling
The bridge was falling
The bridge was falling

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 2]
One day, when you talked to me
I saw myself again
And it made me love you
Ooh baby, ooh baby
And love came running down
Like a river on your skin
And you let me in
Ooh baby, ooh baby

[Chorus]
You let me in
You let me in
You let me in

[Outro]
The bridge, we'll build it now
It may take a lot of time

[Verse 1]
Wake up! It's a Monday morning
No time left to say goodbye
Can't breathe and the lights are changing

[Chorus]
You can live your own life
Making it happen
Working on your own time
Laid back and laughin'
Oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
Headlights make it home by sundown
Feeling that the day is through
Return back to where you come from

[Chorus]
You can live your own life
Making it happen
Working on your own time
Laid back and laughin'
Oh no, oh no

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You wake up in the mornin'
And the sun is comin' up
Its been up for hours and hours and hours
And hours and hours and hours
It's been up for hours and hours and hours
And you light up the stove
And the coffee cup its hot
And the orange juice is cold, cold, cold
Monday morning
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
It's time to go
Time to go to work

[Chorus]
You can live your own life
Making it happen
Working on your own time
Laid back and laughing
Oh no, oh no

[Outro]
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no (Sing with us!)
No, no, no (Come on!)
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no (Sing!)
No, no, no
No, no, no (No, no, no)
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
Negative, negative
Negative, negative
No, no, no
No, no, no
Last dance

[Verse 1]
I hear some people been talking me down
Bring up my name, pass it 'round
They don't mention the happy times
They do their thing, I do mine

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, that's hard to change
I can't tell them how to feel
Some get stoned, some get strange
But sooner or later, it all gets real
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on

[Verse 2]
I remember the good old days
Stayed up all night getting crazed
Then the money was not so good
But we still did the best we could

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, that's hard to change
I can't tell them how to feel
Some get stoned, some get strange
Sooner or later, it all gets real
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on

[Chorus]
See the sky about to rain
Broken clouds and rain
Locomotive, pull the train
Whistle blowing through my brain
Signals curling on an open plain
Rolling down the track again
See the sky about to rain

[Verse 1]
Some are bound for happiness
Some are bound to glory
Some are bound to live with less
Who can tell your story?

[Chorus]
See the sky about to rain
Broken clouds and rain
Locomotive, pull the train
Whistle blowing through my brain
Signals curling on an open plain
Rolling down the track again
See the sky about to rain

[Verse 2]
I was down in Dixie Land
Played a silver fiddle
Played it loud and then the man
Broke it down the middle
See the sky about to rain

[Outro]
Ah, ah ah
Ah, ah ah

Ah, see the sky about to rain
See the sky about to rain
Ah, ah ah
Ah, ah

[Verse 1]
Well, we live in a trailer at the edge of town
You never see us because we don't come around
We got twenty five rifles just to keep the population down
But we need you now and that's why I'm hanging around
So you be good to me and I'll be good to you
And in this land of conditions I'm not above suspicion
I won't attack you but I won't back you

[Verse 2]
Well, it's so good to be here asleep on your lawn
Remember your guard dog? Well, I'm afraid that he's gone
It was such a drag to hear him whining all night long
Yes, that was me with the doves, setting them free near the factory
Where you build your computer love
I hope you get the connection 'cause I can't take the rejection
I won't deceive you, I just don't believe you

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm a barrel of laughs with my carbine on
I keep 'em hopping till my ammunition's gone
But I'm still not happy, I feel like there's something wrong
I got the revolution blues, I see bloody fountains
And ten million dune buggies coming down the mountains
Well, I hear that Laurel Canyon is full of famous stars
But I hate them worse than lepers and I'll kill them in their cars

[Verse 1]
All the sailors with their seasick mamas
Hear the sirens on the shore
Singing songs for pimps with tailors
Who charge ten dollars at the door

[Chorus]
You can really learn a lot that way
It will change you in the middle of the day
Though your confidence may be shattered
It doesn't matter

[Verse 2]
All the great explorers
Are now in granite laid
Under white sheets for the great unveiling
At the big parade

[Chorus]
You can really learn a lot that way
It will change you in the middle of the day
Though your confidence may be shattered
It doesn't matter

[Verse 3]
All the bush league batters
Are left to die on the diamond
In the stands the home crowd scatters
For the turnstiles
For the turnstiles
For the turnstiles

[Verse 1]
I'm a vampire, baby sucking blood from the earth
I'm a vampire, baby sucking blood from the earth
Well, I'm a vampire, baby, sell you twenty barrels worth

[Verse 2]
I'm a black bat, baby, banging on your window pane
I'm a black bat, baby, banging on your window pane
Well, I'm a black bat, baby, I need my high octane

[Verse 3]
Good times are comin', I hear it everywhere I go
Good times are comin', I hear it everywhere I go
Good times are comin', but they sure are comin' slow

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Well I'm a vampire, baby suckin' blood from the earth
I'm a vampire, baby suckin' blood from the earth
Well, I'm a vampire, baby, I'll sell you twenty barrels worth
Good times are comin'

[Verse 1]
Motion pictures on my TV screen
A home away from home and I'm living in between
But I hear some people have got their dream
I've got mine

[Verse 2]
I hear the mountains are doing fine
Morning glory is on the vine
And the dew is fallin'
The ducks are callin'
Yes, I've got mine

[Verse 3]
Well, all those people
They think they got it made
But I wouldn't buy, sell, borrow or trade
Anything I have to be like one of them
I'd rather start all over again

[Verse 4]
Well, all those headlines, they just bore me now
I'm deep inside myself, but I'll get out somehow
And I'll stand before you
And I'll bring a smile to your eyes
Motion pictures
Motion pictures

[Verse 1]
Back in the old folky days
The air was magic when we played
The Riverboat was rocking in the rain
Midnight was the time for the raid

Oh, Isabela, proud Isabela
They tore you down and plowed you under
You're only real with your make-up on
How could I see you and stay too long?

[Verse 2]
All along the Navajo Trail
Burn-outs stub their toes on garbage pails
Waitresses are crying in the rain
Will their boyfriends pass this way again?

Oh, Mother Goose, she's on the skids
Shoe ain't happy, neither are the kids
She needs someone that she can scream at
And I'm such a heel for making her feel so bad

[Verse 3]
I guess I'll call it sickness gone
It's hard to say the meaning of this song
An ambulance can only go so fast
It's easy to get buried in the past
When you try to make a good thing last

[Harmonica Break]

[Verse 4]
I saw today in the entertainment section
There's room at the top for private detection
To Mom and Dad this just doesn't matter
But it's either that or pay off the kidnapper

So all you critics sit alone
You're no better than me for what you've shown
With your stomach pump and your hook and ladder dreams
We could get together for some scenes

[Harmonica Break]

[Verse 5]
Well, I'm up in T.O. keeping jive alive
And out on the corner it's half past five
But the subways are empty
And so are the cafes
Except for the Farmer's Market
And I still can hear him say:
You're all just pissing in the wind
You don't know it but you are
And there ain't nothing like a friend
Who can tell you you're just pissing in the wind

[Harmonica Break]

[Verse 6]
I never knew a man could tell so many lies
He had a different story for every set of eyes
How can he remember who he's talking to?
'Cause I know it ain't me and I hope it isn't you

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night (Yes it is)
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

[Verse 1]
Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
A sparkle was in his eye
But his life was in his hands
Well, late at night when the people were gone
He used to pick up my guitar
And sing a song in a shaky voice
That was real as the day was long

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night, yes, it is
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, yes, it is
Tonight's the night

[Verse 2]
Early in the morning, at the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon
If you never heard him sing
I guess you won't too soon
'Cause, people, let me tell you
It sent a chill up and down my spine
When I picked up the telephone
And heard that he'd died out on the mainline

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
Well, early in the morning
Just about the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night, yes, it is
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, oh yes, it is
Tonight's the night
Oh, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Whoa

[Verse 1]
I went to the movie the other night
The plot was groovy, it was out of sight
I sat with my popcorn, out looking for good times
Lost in the cartoon, I grabbed the lifeline

[Verse 2]
I've been a searcher, I've been a fool
But I've been a long time coming to you
I'm hoping for your love to carry me through
You're holdin' my baby and I'm holdin' you
And it's all right

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Oh, tell me where the answer lies
Is it in the notebook behind your eyes?
When your decision comes to view
I'll be watching my TV and it'll be watching you

[Piano Solo]
Alright Nils, alright

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I've been a searcher, I've been a fool
But I've been a long time coming to you
I'm hoping for your love to carry me through
You're holdin' my baby and I'm holdin' you
Yes I am

[Piano Solo]

[Outro]
Speaking out

[Verse 1]
You know I lose, you know I win
You know I call for the shape I'm in
It's just a game you see me play
Only real in the way
That I feel from day to day

[Verse 2]
Although the answer is not unknown
I'm searchin', searchin', and how I've grown
It's not all right to say goodbye
And the world on a string
Doesn't mean a thing (It's only real)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
No, the world on a string
Doesn't mean a thing
It's only real in the way
That I feel from day to day
No, the world on a string
Doesn't mean a thing (It's only real)

[Verse 1]
I'm climbing this ladder
My head in the clouds
I hope that it matters
I'm having my doubts

[Verse 2]
I'm watching the skaters
Fly by on the lake
Ice frozen six feet deep
How long does it take?

[Verse 3]
I look out on peaceful lands
With no war nearby
An ocean of shaking hands
That grab at the sky

[Verse 4]
I'm singing this borrowed tune
I took from the Rolling Stones
Alone in this empty room
Too wasted to write my own

[Verse 1]
I'm climbing this ladder
My head in the clouds
I hope that it matters

[Chorus]
Baby mellow my mind
Make me feel like a schoolboy on good time
Jugglin' nickels and dimes
Satisfied with the fish on the line

[Verse]
I've been down the road and I've come back
Lonesome whistle on the railroad track
Ain't got nothin' on those feelings that I had
'Cause somethin's so hard to find
A situation that can casualize your mind

[Bridge]
I've been down the road and I've come back
Lonesome whistle on the railroad track
Ain't got nothing on those feelings that I had

[Chorus]
Baby mellow my mind
Make me feel like a schoolboy on good time
Jugglin' nickels and dimes
Satisfied with the fish on the line

[Verse 1: Neil Young]
Well he shot four men in a cocaine deal
And they left them lyin' in an open field
Full of old cars with bullet holes in the mirrors
He tried to do his best but he could not

[Chorus: Neil Young with Ben Keith, Nils Lofgren & Ralph Molina]
Please take my advice
Please take my
Please take my advice
Open up the tired eyes
Open up the tired eyes

[Verse 2: Neil Young]
Well, it wasn't supposed to go down that way
But they burned his brother, you know
And they left him lying in the driveway
They let him down with nothing
He tried to do his best but he could not

[Chorus: Neil Young with Ben Keith, Nils Lofgren & Ralph Molina]
Please take my advice
Please take my advice
Please take my advice
Open up the tired eyes
Open up the tired eyes

[Verse 3: Neil Young]
Well tell me more, tell me more, tell me more
I mean was he a heavy doper or
Was he just a loser?
He was a friend of yours
What do you mean he had bullet holes in his mirrors?
He tried to do his best but he could not

[Chorus: Neil Young with Ben Keith, Nils Lofgren & Ralph Molina]
Please take my advice
Please take my advice
Please take my advice
Open up the tired eyes
Open up the tired eyes

[Harmonica Solo]

[Chorus: Neil Young with Ben Keith, Nils Lofgren & Ralph Molina]
Please take my advice
Please take my advice
Open up the tired eyes
Open up the tired eyes

[Verse 1]
It's too dark to put the keys in my ignition
And the morning sun is yet to climb my hood ornament
But before too long I might see those flashing red lights
Look out, mama, 'cause I'm coming home tonight

[Chorus]
Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I've been standing on this sound
Of some open hearted people going down

[Verse 2]
I'm not going back to Woodstock for a while
Though I long to see that lonesome hippie smile
I'm a million miles away from that helicopter day
No, I don't believe I'll be going back that way

[Chorus]
Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I been standing on this sound
Of some open hearted people going down

[Verse 1]
Well, they say that Santa Fe
Is less than ninety miles away
And I got time to roll a number and rent a car
Oh, Albuquerque

[Verse 2]
I've been flyin' down the road
And I've been starvin' to be alone
And independent from the scene that I've known
Albuquerque

[Harmonica & Pedal Steel Guitar Solos]

[Verse 3]
So I'll stop when I can
Find some fried eggs and country ham
I'll find somewhere where they don't care who I am
Oh, Albuquerque
Albuquerque

[Verse 1]
A hip drag queen and a side-walking street wheeler
Comin' down the avenue
They're all your friends, you'll come to love 'em
There's a load of 'em waiting for you

[Chorus]
Lookout Joe, you're coming home
Old times were good times
Old times were good times

[Verse 2]
Remember Millie from down in Philly?
She took my brain and forgot my name
The woman you were with was about the same
She took your money and left town

[Chorus]
Lookout, Joe
You're comin' home
Old times were good times
Old times were good times
(Take it, Ben!)

[Slide Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Glory Hallelujah
Will I lay my burden down?
Singing on the streets around
Look at that crazy clown
(Look at)

[Guitar Solos]

[Verse 3]
Remember Bill from up on the hill?
A Cadillac put a hole in his arm
But old Bill, he's up there still
Havin' a ball rolling to the bottom

[Chorus]
Lookout, Joe
You're comin' home
Old times were good times
Old times were good times
Old times were good times

[Verse 1]
In a foreign land
There were creatures at play
Running hand in hand
Needing nowhere to stay
Driven to the mountains high
They were sunken in the cities deep
Livin' in my sleep

[Verse 2]
I feel like goin' back
Back where there's nowhere to stay
When fire filled the sky
I still remember that day
These rocks I'm climbing down
Have already left the ground
Careening through space

[Verse 3]
I used to build these buildings
I used to walk next to you
Their shadows tore us apart
And now we do what we do, ah ah
Driven to the mountains high
Sunken in the cities deep
Living in our sleep

[Outro]
I feel like goin' back
Back where there's nowhere to stay
I feel like goin' back
Back where there's nowhere to stay, ah ah ah ah ah
I feel like goin' back
Back where there's nowhere to stay, ah ah ah ah ah
I feel like goin' back
Back where there's nowhere to stay
Ain't it hard when you wake up in the morning
And you find out that those other days are gone?
All you have is memories of happiness lingering on

All your dreams and your lovers won't protect you
They're only passing through you in the end
They'll leave you stripped of all that they can get to
And wait for you to come back again

Yet still a light is shining from that lamp on down the hall
Maybe the star of Bethlehem wasn't a star at all

[Verse 1]
There's a lot to learn
For wastin' time
There's a heart that burns
There's an open mind

[Chorus]
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
You own it
You own it now
You own it

[Verse 2]
There's a weight on you
But you can't feel it
Livin' like I do
It's hard for you to see it

[Verse 3]
Was I hurt too bad?
Can I show you daylight?
How could I be sad
When I know that you might

[Chorus]
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
Look out for my love

[Bridge]
Look out for my love
It's in your neighborhood
I know things are gonna change
But I can't say bad or good, no

[Verse 4]
Silver wings of mornin'
Shinin' in the gray day
While the ice is formin'
On a lonely runway

[Verse 5]
Hydraulic wipers pumpin'
Till the window glistens
Something sayin' somethin'
No one seems to listen

[Verse 6]
Men with walkie-talkies
Men with flashlights waving
Up upon the tower
Time reads daylight saving

[Verse 7]
I'm home again to you, babe
You know it makes me wonder
Sitting in the quiet slipstream
In the thunder

[Chorus]
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
Look out for my love

[Outro]
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
Look out for my love
Look out for my love

[Intro]
La la la la la la la la la
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
It's gonna take a lotta love
To change the way things are
It's gonna take a lotta love
Or we won't get too far
So if you look in my direction
And we don't see eye to eye
My heart needs protection
And so do I

[Verse 2]
It's gonna take a lotta love
To get us through the night
It's gonna take a lotta love
To make things work out right
So if you are out there waiting
I hope you show up soon
'Cause my head needs relating
Not solitude

[Bridge]
Gotta lotta love
Gotta lotta love

[Intro Reprise]
La la la la la la la la la
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

[Outro]
It's gonna take a lotta love (It takes a lotta love)
To change the way things are
It's gonna take a lotta love (It takes a lotta love)
Or we won't get too far
It's gonna take a lotta love (It takes a lotta love)
It's gonna take a lotta love

[Intro]
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la

[Verse 1]
It has often been my dream
To live with one who wasn't there
Like an ocean fish who swam upstream
Through nets, by hooks, and hungry bears
When the water grew less deep
My fins were aching from the strain
I'm swimmin' in my sleep
I know I can't go back again
Can't go back

[Chorus]
I'll never lose it (Got the will to love)
Never lose the will to love (Got the will to love)
Never lose the will (Got the will to love)
It's something from up above (Got the will to love)
Never lose the will to love
La la la la, la la la la

[Verse 2]
I can be like a fire in the night
Always warm and givin' off light
But there comes a time when I shine too bright
Oh, I'm just a fire in the night
And now my fins are in the air
And my belly's scrapin' on the rocks
I still think someone really cares
And I'll keep swimming 'til I stop

[Chorus]
No, no I'll never lose the will to love (Got the will to love)
I got the will to love (Got the will to love)
Got the will to love (Got the will to love)
It's like something from up above (Got the will to love)
I never lose the will to love (Got the will to love)
No, no
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la

[Verse 3]
I'm like a singer on the stage
With the golden lights and liquid rage
Down from the mountains to the sea
Cool running love keeps cleansing me
It keeps my gills from getting dry
But it distorts things in my eyes
Sometimes I see what really isn't there
Like my true lover and I care

[Chorus]
But I'll never lose (Got the will to love)
I got the will to love
I never lose the will to love (Got the will to love)
It's like something from up above
I got the will to love (Got the will to love)
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la

[Verse 4]
Sometimes I ramble on and on
And I repeat myself 'til all my friends are gone
Get lost in snow and drown in rain
And never feel the same again
I remember the ocean from where I came
Just one of millions all the same
But somewhere, someone calls my name
I'm a harpoon dodger and I can't, won't be tamed

[Chorus]
I'll never lose the will to love (Got the will to love)
Never lose the will to love (Got the will to love)
Never lose it (Got the will to love)
It's like something from up above
I'm not gonna lose the will to love
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la

[Verse 5]
Baby, if I see boredom in your eyes
I'll know my river has run dry
But I won't turn back with that lonely tide
I bought that ticket and I'll take that ride
If we meet along the way, please sway beside me
Let us sway together, our tails together
And our fins and mind will leave this water
And let our scales shine
In the sun above and the sky below
So all the water and earth will know

[Outro]
It has often been my dream
La la la la, la la la la
To live with one who wasn't there

[Verse 1]
You know it takes a long, long time
You know it takes a long, long time
You love her so and still you know
That you will never want to let her go
Unless you leave her first
Then you come out on top
But still there's just one thing
You haven't got

[Chorus]
Peace of mind
Like when you treated her kind
It's hard to face that open space

[Verse 2]
You know it takes a long, long time
You know it takes a long, long time
When first you gave and shared your soul
Showed her all those things that take their toll
She knows your weak spot
But she still gets you hot
And so you do it again
Reveal what lies within

[Chorus]
And go for peace of mind
Like when you treated her kind
It's hard to face that open space

[Bridge]
You're looking for peace of mind
Anywhere you can find
Still searching for peace of mind

[Outro]
You know it takes a long, long time
You know it takes a long, long time
You know it takes a long, long time
You know it takes a long, long time
You know it takes a long, long time
You know it takes a long, long time

[Intro]
Woah, you sound like you've been playing together for ten years
Yeah, that was a nice jam

[Chorus]
Homegrown's alright with me
Homegrown is the way it should be
Homegrown is a good thing
Plant that bell and let it ring

[Verse]
The sun comes up in the morning
And it shines that light around
One day, without no warning
Things start jumping up from the ground

[Chorus]
Homegrown's alright with me
Homegrown is the way it should be
Homegrown is a good thing
Plant that bell and let it ring

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Homegrown's alright with me
Homegrown is the way it should be
Homegrown is a good thing
Plant that bell and let it ring
Plant that bulb and let it glow

[Verse 1]
I come down from the misty mountain
I got lost on the human highway
Take my head, refreshing fountain
Take my eyes from what they've seen

[Refrain]
Take my head and change my mind
How could people get so unkind?

[Verse 2]
I come down from the crooked mansion
I went lookin' for the D.J.'s daughter
Since that day I heard it mentioned
That my name is on the line

[Refrain]
Now my name is on the line
How could people get so unkind?

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Now my name is on the line
How could people get so unkind?

[Verse 1]
I come down from the misty mountain
I got lost on the human highway
Take my head, refreshing fountain
Take my eyes from what they've seen

[Refrain]
Take my head and change my mind
How could people get so unkind?

[Verse 1]
What can I do, what can I say
Running down this suspicious highway
I can't forget how love let me down
And when we meet it still gets in my way

[Chorus]
But we're already one
Already one
Now only time can come between us
'Cause we're already one
Our little son won't let us forget

[Verse 2]
Your laughing eyes, your crazy smile
Every time I look in his face
I can't believe how love lasts a while
And looks like "forever" in the first place

[Chorus]
But we're already one
Already one
Now only time can come between us
'Cause we're already one
Our little son won't let us forget

[Verse 3]
In my new life I'm travelin' light
Eyes wide open for the next move
I can't go wrong till I get right
But I'm not fallin' back in the same groove

[Chorus]
Already one
Already one
Now only time can come between us
'Cause we're already one
Our little son won't let us forget

[Verse 1]
I've been wrong before
And I'll be there again
I don't have any answers my friend
Just this pile of old questions
My memory left me here
In the field of opportunity
It's plowing time again

[Verse 2]
I'm goin' back to my house
But I'm not goin' now
It's too early to be leavin' here, somehow
Let me bore you with this story
"How my lover let me down"
While I borrow seeds of sadness from the ground

[Chorus]
In the field of opportunity
It's plowing time again
There ain't no way of tellin'
Where these seeds will rise or when
I'll just wait around till springtime
And then I'll find a friend
In the field of opportunity
It's plowing time again

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
When I'm all done cultivating
I'll be rocking on the porch
Tryin' to picture you and where you are
And there'll be no hesitating
When Cupid lights the torch
With those headlights comin' down the hill
Between the stars

[Chorus]
In the field of opportunity
It's plowing time again
There ain't no way of tellin'
Where these seeds will rise or when
I'll just wait around 'til springtime
And then I'll find a friend
In the field of opportunity
It's plowing time again

[Outro]
In the field of opportunity
It's plowing time again

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck niggas gon' multiply
'Fore the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
'Fore the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply
Fuck niggas won't multiply, fuck niggas won't multiply
Igh, igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh

[Interlude 1: Juicy J]
Yeah nigga, it's your boy Juicy J. Man, you gotta watch out for these old backstabbin', broke ass, you know what I'm sayin', jealous hatin' ass niggas out here man, you know what I'm sayin', man these niggas ain't no real niggas man, know what I'm sayin'? Man these niggas be smilin' in your face

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Back in the buildin', sold crack in the livin' room
Niggas toe-tagged, sold gats for a livin'
Doo rag, keep a red or blue flag in the denim
One you be with be the one to shoot at ya in a minute
Come to Harlem if you never seen Baghdad
First place I seen a nigga sell crack at
Where the hustlers don't sleep, take cat naps
Shorty with the shotty limpin' like he got a bad back, back back
Even in my will, keep it real, thuggin' in my field
'Til the day I peel, keep it trill, anything I feel
Youngins trained to kill, aimin', bangin' steel and slangin' krill
She shake it all for Satan just to paint her nails and pay her bills
I ain't really fuckin' with that Been Trill
Swear them niggas booty like Tip Drill
Nah I ain't really into throwin' shots
But these mothafuckas better give me my props, word to Pac
We're the reason that these niggas gettin' throwed
Reason why you niggas wearin' gold
Jail pose in the pictures, prayin' fingers to your nose
I remember, if Pimp was alive he'd tell these hoes and these niggas

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I...
When the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
When the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
When all the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
But if the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply

[Interlude 2: A$AP Rocky]
I'm the original Balmain badass, nigga
I'm the original Margiela madman, in the words of A$AP Yams
Smack the shit out a nigga in these skinny pants, feel me?
Don't get it fucked up, nigga, we been jiggy, been pretty
Still tell a bitch suck my dick, swag swag nigga

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck with a nigga like me, RIP my nigga Pimp C
HBA shit is weak, you can keep that
Shit, I might fuck around and bring the Jeep back
No doors on it, flexin' with the seat back
B-Boy with the G pack, might fuck around and bring the mink back
Word to Big Boi and 3 Stacks, nigga
If you deaf bring the beat back, nigga
Fuck with a nigga like me, RIP my nigga Pimp C
HBA shit is weak, you can keep that
I'm a trendsetter, you ain't even peep that
Where the hoes, where the weed, where the cheese at?
Fuck the FCC, tell 'em bleep that
(We ain't no fashion killas nigga, we fashionable killas
Y'all got Flacko fucked up)

[Video Beat Switch]

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
I'm the motherfuckin' Lord of this fashion shit
Don't I deserve just to brag a bit?
Set the blueprint, fuck your two cents
Number 1 stunner, ask Tumblr if I'm accurate
My motherfuckin' swag is immaculate
Plus I got enough style just to mack your bitch
I think back to when pockets packin' lint
It's like a nigga got rich on accident
Now back to Pimp, bitches lie, killers never lie
Triggers on the side by side, bet I'm down to ride
Prosper said let's ride to the sky, call it catastrophic
We don't ever die, we just multiply, bitch

[Outro: Juicy J]
Fake ass niggas, you know what I'm sayin'? These niggas be out here talkin' 'bout they a street nigga and shit, man niggas be gettin' extorted like a mothafucka out here man, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
They were hiding behind hay bales
They were planting in the full moon
They had given all they had
For something new
But the light of day was on them
They could see the thrashers coming
And the water shone like diamonds
In the dew
And I was just getting up
Hit the road before it's light
Trying to catch an hour on the sun
When I saw those thrashers rollin' by
Looking more than two lanes wide
I was feeling like my day had just begun

[Verse 2]
Where the eagle glides descending
There's an ancient river bending
Through the timeless gorge of changes
Where sleeplessness awaits
I searched out my companions
Who were lost in crystal canyons
When the aimless blade of science
Slashed the pearly gates
It was then I knew I'd had enough
Burned my credit card for fuel
Headed out to where the pavement turns to sand
With a one-way ticket to the land of truth
And my suitcase in my hand
How I lost my friends I still don't understand

[Verse 3]
They had the best selection
They were poisoned with protection
There was nothing that they needed
Nothing left to find
They were lost in rock formations
Or became park bench mutations
On the sidewalks and in the stations
They were waiting, waiting
So I got bored and left them there
They were just dead weight to me
Better down the road without that load
Brings back the time when I was eight or nine
I was watching my mama's TV
It was that great Grand Canyon rescue episode

[Verse 4]
Where the vulture glides descending
On an asphalt highway bending
Through libraries and museums
Galaxies and stars
Down the windy halls of friendship
To the rose clipped by the bullwhip
The motel of lost companions
Waits with heated pool and bar
But me I'm not stopping there
Got my own row left to hoe
Just another line in the field of time
When the thrasher comes I'll be stuck in the sun
Like the dinosaurs enshrines
But I'll know the time has come to give what's mine

[Verse]
She's a victim of her senses, do you know her?
Can you see her in the distance as she tumbles by?
Veteran of a race that should be over
Can you hear her sigh? With wings to fly
She rolls along doing it wrong

[Chorus]
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long

[Bridge]
There's a place that I know we could go
Get away for a while
I can bring her the peace that she needs
Give her reason to smile

[Outro]
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long

[Chorus: Neil Young]
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down?
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down?
I always get in trouble when you bring it around
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay it down?

[Verse 1: Nicolette Larson]
Well I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
I'm runnin' down the proud highway
Yeah I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
I'm runnin' down the proud highway
And as long as I keep movin'
I won't need a place to stay

[Chorus: Neil Young]
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down?
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down?
I always get in trouble when you bring that around
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay it down?

[Verse 2: Nicolette Larson & Neil Young, Nicolette Larson]
Well I'm here to deliver
I hope you can read my mail, oh yeah
I just escaped last night
From the memory county jail
I see your box is open and your flag is up
My message is ready if there's time enough

[Chorus: Neil Young & Nicolette Larson, Nicolette Larson]
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down? (Down)
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down?
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay it down?

[Verse 1]
All her friends call her Little Wing
But she flies rings around them all
She comes to town when the children sing
And leaves them feathers if they fall
She leaves them feathers if they fall

[Verse 2]
Little Wing, don't fly away
When the summer turns to fall
Don't you know some people say
The winter is the best time of them all?
Winter is the best of all

[Verse 1]
Remember the Alamo
When help was on the way
It's better here and now
I feel that good today
I'd like to take a walk
But not around the block
I really got some news

[Pre-Chorus]
I met a man from Mars
He picked up all my guitars
And played me traveling songs

[Chorus]
And when we got on ship
He brought out something for the trip
And said "It's old but it's good"
Like any other primitive would
Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna ride my llama
From Peru to Texarkana
I wanna ride him good
In my old neighborhood
I'm gonna ride him good
In my old neighborhood

[Chorus]
When we got on ship
He brought out something for the trip
And said "It's old but it's good"
Like any other primitive would
Ah

[Verse 1]
Up and down the old homestead
The naked rider gallops through his head
And although the moon isn't full
He still feels the pull

[Verse 2]
Out on the floor where the cowboys dance
Approaching slowly at a glance
Here comes the shadow of his stance
The reins are falling from his hands

[Verse 3]
"Why do you ride that crazy horse?"
Inquires the shadow with little remorse
Just then a priest comes down the stairs
With a sack of dreams and old nightmares

[Verse 4]
"Who are you," the rider says
"You dress in black but you talk like a fed
You spout ideas from books that you've read
Don't you care about this guy's head?"

[Verse 5]
Just then the sound of hoofbeats was heard
And the sky was darkened by a prehistoric bird
Who flew between the unfulfilled moon
And the naked rider to a telephone booth

[Verse 6]
We'll call the moon and see what's up
I've got some change in this little tin cup
They say that the shadow is growing dim
He needs some light to get back to him

[Bridge]
Just one call should do it all
I'll carve this number on the wall with my beak

[Verse 7]
Flying feathers were all around
And the air was filled with a ringing sound
Two more birds, the second and the third
Came down from the sky to deliver the word

[Verse 8]
"Where have you been?" they said to the first
"Get back to the clouds, we're dying of thirst
There's not enough time to make that call
Let's ditch this rider, shadow and all"

[Verse 9]
The sky was filled with the beautiful birds
Still on the ground some crying was heard
With his dime in his hand and his hand on the dial
His ears were sweating as he forced a smile

[Verse 10]
Hoofbeats beating across the range
He rode through the night with his cup of change
Tired and beaten, he fell into slumber
But up in the sky they still had his number

[Verse 1]
Up and down the old homestead
The naked rider gallops through his head
And although the moon isn't full
He still feels the pull

[Outro]
Still feels the pull
Still feels the pull
Still feels the pull
Still feels the pull

[Verse 1]
I could live inside a tepee
I could die In penthouse thirty-five
You could lose me on the freeway
But I would still make it back alive

[Chorus]
As long as we can sail away
As long as we can sail away
There'll be wind in the canyon
Moon on the rise
As long as we can sail away

[Verse 2]
See the losers in the best bars
Meet the winners in the dives
Where the people are the real stars
All the rest of their lives

[Chorus]
As long as we can sail away
As long as we can sail away
There'll be wind in the canyon
Moon on the rise
As long as we can sail away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
There's a road
Stretched out between us
Like a ribbon on the high plain
Down from Phoenix through Salinas
Around the bend and back again

[Chorus]
As long as we can sail away
As long as we can sail away
There'll be wind in the canyon
Moon on the rise
As long as we can sail away

[Intro]
Live with me
Live with me
Live with me
Live with me
Live with me

[Verse 1]
Lost in space
I heard you were lost in space
That's such a lonely place for you to be
Out of control
Singing with too much soul
I heard you got out on parole
Working for the queen

[Bridge 1]
Gardening again
Landscape again
Keeping all the grounds around her clean
Working for the queen

[Verse 2]
Don't take out the magic pen
Don't draw on the infinity board
Your buildings, if they rise again
Would do much better on the ocean floor
They'll never feel the way
They did before, they did before

[Bridge 2]
Out on the ocean floor
Out on the ocean floor
What could be stranger than the unknown danger
That lies on the ocean floor?

[Verse 3]
Breakers crash on the beach
I count them like lambs in my sleep
They come at me steady, they know I'm not ready
They pound on my mattress door
Have they got a big one in store

[Verse 4]
Losing you
I heard I was losing you
That's not the only thing that I got to lose

[Outro]
I got to lose
The deep sea blues
Look at these blues
The deep sea blues
Live with me
Live with me
Live with me

[Verse 1]
Well, I went with Mary Lou
Tried Peggy Sue
Had a date with Donna
And Barbara Ann too

[Chorus]
But I'm kind of found of Want to
Kind of found of Want to
Yeah, I'm kind of found of Want to
Because Want to always
Want to want to want to

[Verse 2]
Well, I went out with Jenny
Took out skinny Minnie
Long tall Sally
And short fat Fanny

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Did the bop with Miss Ann
The swim with Mary Ann
The stroll with Betty Lou
Screwed runaround Sue
But she wasn't
As good as Want to
No, she'll never be
As good as Want to
I'm kind of found of Want to
Because Want to always
Want to want to want to

[x3]

[Outro]
Kind of found of Want to

[x2]
Yeah, I'm kind of found of Want to
Because Wanda always
Want to want to want to

[x5]

[Verse 1]
I am a young mariner headed to war
I'm thinking about my family and what it was for
There's water on the wood and the sails feel good
And when I get to shore I hope that I can kill good

[Verse 2]
My father was a sailor named Captain Kennedy
He lost his wooden schooner to the Germans on the sea
Exploded on the water for everyone to see
And humiliate that American Captain Kennedy

[Verse 3]
I saw him in Nassau in 1971
His strength was failing but he still ran a run
He worked till his fingers wore to the bone
To buy that wooden schooner and sail on his own

[Verse 4]
He was known in the islands as hundred foot iron
That steel hull freighter was passing its time
And time flew by faster with life on the sea
And the days grew shorter for Captain Kennedy

[Verse 1]
I am a young mariner headed to war
I'm thinking about my family and what it was for
There's water on the wood and the sails feel good
And when I get to shore I hope that I can kill good

[Verse 1]
Our love, baby, feels so right
When you're smiling in the morning light
I ain't leaving no way

[Chorus]
'Cause we got staying power, you and I
Staying power through thick and thin
Staying power, you and I
Staying power through thick and thin

[Verse 2]
Gold and diamonds say you're mine
But true love opens the gates of time
And as we go on our way

[Chorus]
We got staying power, you and I
Staying power through thick and thin
Staying power, you and I
Staying power through thick and thin

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Staying power, you and I
Staying power through thick and thin
Staying power, you and I
Staying power through thick and thin

[Verse]
Down on the coastline, Highway One
People heading out for the sun
That's where I found you long time ago
You're my angel, you're my queen
You're my best friend in between

[Chorus]
We don't back down from no trouble
We do get up in the morning

[Verse 2]
Oowee, baby, what a night
That old moon sure is shining bright
We'll be dancing till the morning comes
High on the mountain top
Above the clouds
No wonder we get a little loud

[Chorus]
We don't back down from no trouble
We do get up in the morning

[Fiddle and Steel Guitar Solos]

[Chorus]
We don't back down from no trouble
We do get up in the morning

[Verse 1]
I'm proud to be a union man
I make those meetings when I can, yeah
I pay my dues ahead of time
When the benefits come I'm last in line, yeah
I'm proud to be a union man

[Verse 2]
Every fourth Friday at 10 am
There's a local meeting of the A F of M, yeah!
"This meeting will now come to order. Is there any new business?"
"Yeah, I think 'Live music are better' bumper stickers should be issued"
"What was that?"
"'Live music is better' bumper stickers should be issued"
"The gentleman says 'Live music is better' bumper stickers should be issued
All in favor of what he said signify by saying 'aye'"
"Aye!, Aye!"
"If, however, you are opposed signify by saying 'no'"
I'm proud to be a union man

[Verse 1]
It's awful hard to find a job
On one side the government
The other the mob
Hey, hey ain't that right
The working man's in for a hell of a fight

[Chorus]
Oh, this country
Sure looks good to me
But these fences are
Coming apart at every nail

[Verse 2]
Way up on the old dew line
Some of the boys were feeling fine
A big light flashed across the sky
But something else went slipping by
Meanwhile at the Pentagon
The brass was a wondering what went wrong

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Hey hey, ain't that right
The working man's in for a hell of a fight

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Ain't getting old
Ain't getting younger though
Just getting used
To the lay of the land
I ain't tongue-tied
Just don't got nothing to say
I'm proud to be living in the U.S.A

[Chorus]
Ready to go, willing to stay and pay
U.S.A., U.S.A
So my sweet love can dance
Another free day
U.S.A., U.S.A

[Verse 2]
In history we painted pictures grim
The devil knows
We might feel that way again
The big wind blows
So the tall grass bends
But for you don't
Push too hard my friend

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Got people here
Down on their knees and praying
Hawks and doves
Are circling in the rain
Got rock and roll
Got country music playing
If you hate us, you just
Don't know what you're saying

[Chorus]
Ready to go, willing to stay and pay
U.S.A., U.S.A
So my sweet love can dance
Another free day
U.S.A., U.S.A

[Verse 1]
He's a perfect stranger
Like a cross of himself and a fox
He's a feeling arranger
And a changer of the ways he talks
He's the unforeseen danger
The keeper of the key to the locks

[Chorus]
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner

[Verse 2]
If you see him in the subway
He'll be down at the end of the car
Watching you move
Until he knows he knows who you are
When you get off at your station alone
He'll know that you are

[Chorus]
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
There was a woman he knew
About a year or so ago
She had something that he needed
And he pleaded with her not to go
On the day that she left
He died but it did not show

[Chorus]
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner

[Verse 1]
All of a sudden she was on my mind
I wasn't ready for her kind
And she was taking her time

[Chorus]
What if she came to me
Would she be kind?
And if she stayed with me
Do you think that  she'd like to do
Anything I would
Or would she leave me?

[Verse 2]
Lately I've found myself losing my mind
Knowing how badly I need her
It's something hard to find

[Chorus]
What if she came to me
Would she be kind?
And if she stayed with me
Do you think that  she'd like to do
Anything I would
Or would she leave me?

[Bridge]
If I could have her tonight
Does she want to go?
Look at those eyes
Does she want to?
If I could have her tonight
If I could have her tonight
If I could have her tonight

[Verse 1]
I've been looking for a woman to save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with the feeling of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could it be tomorrow?

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
Such a long time now

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
Such a long time now
Such a long time now
Such a long time now
Such a long time now

[Verse 1]
Don't call pretty Peggy, she can't hear you no more
Don't leave no message 'round her back door
They say the old laughing lady been here before
She don't keep time, she don't count score

[Verse 2]
You can't have a cupboard if there ain't no wall
You got to move, there's no time left to stall
They say the old laughing lady dropped by to call
When she leaves, she leaves nothing at all

[Verse 3]
See the drunkard of the village falling on the street
Can't tell his ankles from the rest of his feet
He loves his old laughing lady 'cause her taste is so sweet
But his laughing lady's loving ain't the kind he can keep

[Bridge: Gracia Nitzsche, Sherlie Matthews, Gloria Jones, Patrice Holloway, Brenda Holloway & Merry Clayton]

[Verse 4]
There's a fever on the freeway, blacks out the night
There's a slippin' on the stairway just don't feel right
And there's a rumbling in the bedroom and a flashing of light
There's the old laughing lady, everything is all right

[Verse 1]
See somebody
Walking down the street
Hanging head
And a-shuffling feet
Don't take much to see
What they've been thinking of
What makes you hypnotized?
What puts a tear in your eye?
What makes you have to choose?
What brings you the blues?
A little thing called love 

[x2]

[Chorus]
Only love puts a tear in your eye
Only love makes you hypnotized
Only love makes you choose
Only love brings you the blues

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute now, honey
Don't be sad
This may be the best love you ever had
That don't mean that you had enough
A little thing called love 

[x2]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
A little thing called love 

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Now that the holidays have come
They can relax and watch the sun
Rise above all of the beautiful things they've done
Go to the country take the dog
Look at the sky without the smog
See the world laugh at the farmers feeding hogs
Eat hot dogs
What a pity
That the people from the city
Can't relate to the slower things
That the country brings

[Verse 2]
Time itself is bought and sold
The spreading fear of growing old
Contains a thousand foolish games that we play
While people planning trips to stars
Allow another boulevard
To claim a quiet country lane
It's insane

[Verse 3]
So the subtle face is a loser this time around
Here we are in the years
Where the showman shifts the gears
Lives become careers
Children cry in fear
Let us out of here

[Verse 1]
When we were living together
I thought that I knew you would stay
Still when you left me
I tried to pretend we could make it some way

[Chorus]
I don't care if all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air
(What did you do to my life?)
It isn't fair that I should wake up at dawn
And not find you there
(What did you do to my life?)

[Verse 2]
It's hard enough losing
Without the confusion of knowing I tried
But you've made your mind up
That I'll be alone now, there's nothing to hide

[Chorus]
I don't care if all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air
(What did you do to my life?)
It isn't fair that I should wake up at dawn
And not find you there
(What did you do to my life?)
I don't care if all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air
(What did you do to my life?)
It isn't fair that I should wake up at dawn
And not find you there
(What did you do to my life?)

I don't care if all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air
(What did you do to my life?)
It isn't fair that I should wake up at dawn
And not find you there
(What did you do to my life?)

[Verse 1]
I may not mystify you
In your search for higher love
I may just slip right by you
With your eyes turned up above

[Chorus 1]
We may not compromise
I may not suit your taste tonight
My love
But as the time goes by
You might think that I'm all right
My love, my heavy love

[Chorus 2]
A noise, your phone is ringing
Or is that someone at your door
Inside your head I'm singing
Inside your heart I cry for more

[Verse 2]
You may not hear me calling
You may not feel me bawling out
My love
But heavy rocks are falling
Heavy love is coming down
My love, my heavy love

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
My heavy love

[Verse 1]
Well, I used to drive a cab you know
I heard a siren scream
Pulled over to the corner and I fell into a dream
There were two men eating pennies
And three young girls who cried
The West coast is falling, I see rocks in the sky
The preacher took his Bible and laid it on the stool
He said "With the congregation running
Why should I play the fool?"

[Verse 2]
Well, I used to be a woman you know
I took you for a ride
I let you fly my airplane
It looked good for your pride
'Cause you're the kind of man you know
Who likes what he says
I wonder what's it's like to be so far over my head
Well, the lady made the wedding
And she brought along the ring
She got down on her knees and said
"Let's get on with this thing"

[Verse 3]
Well, I used to be a folk singer
Keeping managers alive
When you saw me on a corner
And told me I was jive
So I unlocked your mind, you know
To see what I could see
If you guarantee the postage
I'll mail you back the key
Well I woke up in the morning
With an arrow through my nose
There was an Indian in the corner
Trying on my clothes

[Verse 4]
Well, I used to be asleep you know
With blankets on my bed
I stayed there for a while till they discovered I was dead
The coroner was friendly, I liked him quite a lot
If I hadn't have been a woman
I guess I'd never have been caught
They gave me back my house and car
And nothing more was said

[Verse 5]
Well, I was driving down the freeway
When my car ran out of gas
Pulled over to the station but I was afraid to ask
The servicemen were yellow and the gasoline was green
Although I knew I could not
I thought that I was gonna scream
That was on my last trip to Tulsa
Just before the snow
If you ever need a ride there
Be sure to let me know

[Verse 6]
I was chopping down a palm tree
When a friend dropped by to ask
If I would feel less lonely
If he helped me swing the axe
I said, "No, it's not a case of being lonely we have here
I've been working on this palm tree
For eighty seven years"
I said, "No, it's not a case of being lonely we have here
I've been working on this palm tree
For eighty seven years"
He said, "Go get lost!" and walked toward his Cadillac
I chopped down the palm tree
And it landed on his back

[Verse]
Cars and trucks
Fly by me on the corner
But I'm all right
Standing proud before the signal
When I see the light
I know I'm more
Than just a number
And I stand before you
Or else we just don't see the other
Computer age computer age
Computer age
Bikes and vans
Fly by me on the desert
But I'm all right
Standing out here in the hot sun
When I see the light
I feel like more than just a number
And I stand before you
Or else we just don't see the other
Computer age computer age
Computer age
Precious metal lines
Molded into highways
Running through me
So microscopically
Days and nights
Weeks and months and seasons
Rolling through me
So chronologically
Computer age computer age
Computer age
I need you
To let me know that there's a heartbeat
Let it pound and pound
And I'll be flying like a free bird
And you need me
Like ugly needs a mirror
And day by day
This horizon's getting clearer
Computer age computer age
Computer age

[Verse 1]
We control the data banks
We control the think tanks
We control the flow of air
We're controlling traffic lights
We control computer flights
We control the chief of staff
We control the TV sky
We control the FBI
We control the flow of heat
Computer age in harm's way
We will prevail
And perform our function
C.C.T.B

[Chorus]
We're controlling 

[x2]
We control
We're controlling
We control 

[x2]

[Verse 2]
We control you floor to floor
We control you door to door
We're controlling
While you sleep
Computer age in harm's way
We will prevail
And perform our function
C.C.T.B
Computer age in harm's way
We will prevail
And perform our function
C.C.T.B

[Chorus]
We are in control 

[x12]

This one's for you Al Freed
Wherever you go, whatever you do
Because the things they're doing today
Will make a saint out of you
Payola blues
I've got the payola blues
Even though I already paid my dues
Listen to me Mr. D.J
Hear what I've got to say
If a man is making music
They ought to let his record play

[Chorus]
Payola blues
No matter where I go
I never hear my record on the radio

[Verse 2]
Well, here's three thousand
That ought to get it on
Well, thanks a lot man!
I love your new song

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I got a brand new record company
New manager too
Got a great new record
I can't get through to you

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
How about this new Mercedes Benz
That ought to get it on
Well, thanks a lot man!
I'll play it all day long

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I've got the payola blues, payola blues
I'm paying those payola blues
No matter where I go
I never hear my record on the radio

[Verse 1]
Transformer man, transformer man
You run the show remote control
Direct the action with the push of a button
You're a transformer man
Power in your hand
Transformer man, transformer man

[Chorus]
Transformer man, transformer man
Sooner or later you'll have to see
The cause and effect
So many things still left to do
But we haven't made it yet
Every morning
When I look in your eyes
I feel electrified by you. Oh yes

[Verse 2]
Transformer man, transformer man
Transformer man, still in command
You're eyes are shining on a beam
Through the galaxy of love
Transformer man, transformer man
Unlock the secrets
Let us throw off the chains that
Hold you down

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Transformer man, transformer man

And the wild coyotes yowl
As he trots beneath the floodlights
And of course the rhythm is perfect!

To the city just in time
To bring another system down
And leave your alias behind

Though you may feel tired and blue
The things you say
The things you dream you might do
Come true if you
Hold on to your love

[Verse]
How long the day?
How dark the night spent apart?
Is this the way to learn?
Go your own way
Although you may break a heart
Don't let it start
Hold on to your love

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry

[Verse 1]
Well, old man river just keeps on rolling
On down the line
Like my tears just keep on flowing
All the time
Can't you hear me cry

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well, somewhere there's a rainbow for me
I know it's my time
I am getting so tired
Of standing in this light
Can't you hear me cry

[Outro]
Boo, hoo, hoo, boo, hoo, hoo
Boo, hoo, hoo, boo, boo, hoo
Boo, hoo, hoo, cry, cry, cry
Boo, hoo, hoo, boo, hoo, hoo
Cry, cry, cry, cry

[Verse 1]
When grandma and grandpa
Get out on the floor
They rock until they drop
And then they rock some more

[Chorus]
Yeah, everybody's rocking
Well, everybody's rocking
Everybody's rocking
Rocking to the dancing beat

[Verse 2]
From the shakey city
Down to New Orleans
The Golden Gate
To the Bronx and Queens

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When Ronnie and Nancy
Do the bop on the lawn
They're rocking in the White House
All night long

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Everybody's rocking
Rocking their blues away
Everybody's rocking
Rockin' all night and day

[Outro]
Everybody's rocking
Everybody's rocking
Yeah, everybody's rocking
Everybody's rocking
Everybody's rocking
Rocking to the dancing beat
Everybody's rocking
Dancing to the rocking beat

[Verse 1]
Said the condor to the praying mantis
We're gonna lose this place just like we lost Atlantis
Brother we got to go sooner than you know
The Gypsy told my fortune, she said that nothing showed
Who put the bomb on the sacred altar?
Why should we die if it comes our way?
Why should we care about a little button
Being pushed by someone we don't even know?

[Chorus]
Well. I wish I was an Aztec
Or a runner in Peru
I would build such beautiful buildings
To house the chosen few
Like an Inca from Peru

[Verse 2]
If you want to get high, build a strong foundation
Sink those pylons deep now and reach for the sky
If you want to get lost in the jungle rhythm
Get down on the ground and pretend you're swimming
If you want to put ice in the lava river
First you must climb, then you must stand and shiver
Brother we got to go sooner than you know
The Gypsy told my fortune 

[x3]
She said that nothing showed

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Said the condor to the praying mantis
We're gonna lose this place just like we lost Atlantis
Brother we got to go sooner than you know
The Gypsy told my fortune 

[x3]
She said that nothing showed
Who put the bomb on the sacred altar?
Why should we die if it comes our way?
Why should we care about a little button
Being pushed by someone we don't even know?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I feel sad, but I feel happy
As I'm coming back to home
There's a bridge across the river
That I have to cross alone
Like a skipping rolling stone
Like an Inca

[Verse 1]
I used to carry the weight of the world
On my back
I never trusted my friends or my girl
Can you imagine that?
I used to shuffle my feet
When I walked I hung my head down low
Kept to myself all my private thoughts
But when I met you girl

[Chorus]
I dropped the weight of the world (World)
Weight of the world (World)
I dropped the weight of the world (World)
Weight of the world (World)

[Verse 2]
I knew some people used to dance all night
But not me
I never knew if it was wrong or right
To be so free
I used to close my eyes
And try to hide from the light of love
Spent all my time with the darkness inside
But when I met you girl

[Chorus]
I dropped the weight of the world (World)
Weight of the world (World)
I dropped the weight of the world (World)
Weight of the world (World)

[Bridge]
I was alone for all of my life
I was alone for all of my life
I was alone for all of my life
I was alone for all of my life
Until you came my way
(World, world, world, world)

[Chorus]
I dropped the weight of the world (World)
Weight of the world (World)
Weight of the world
I dropped the weight of the world (World)
Weight of the world (World)
Weight of the world (World)
I dropped the weight of the world
Weight of the world (World)

[Outro]
(World, world, world, world)

[Verse 1]
In the lonely shack
By the railroad track
I spent my younger days
And I guess the sound
Of the outward bound
Made me a slave
To my wandering ways

[Chorus]
And the wayward wind
Is a restless wind
A restless wind
That yearns to wander
And I was born
The next of kin
The next of kin
To the wayward wind

[Verse 2]
Oh, I met him down
In the border town
He vowed we'd never part
Though he tried his best
To settle down
Now I'm all alone
With a broken heart

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Outro]
The next of kin
To the wayward wind

[Verse 1]
Here comes the night
Here comes the anger
Hidden so deep inside
No one can see
Behind these eyes
There walks a stranger
Wandering through the dark
Following me

[Chorus]
Control the violent side
Control the violent side
Control the violent side
Control the violent side

[Verse 2]
Electric light
Shining on your block
Saying to everyone
The power is on
While your alarm
Set up for safety
Keeps out invaders who come
But still can't control

[Chorus]
Control the violent side
Control the violent side
Control the violent side
Control the violent side

[Outro]
Got to fight to control the violent side
I've got to fight to control it
Got to fight to control the violent side
Got to fight to control it
Got to fight to control the violent side
Every day and night
Got to fight to control the violent side
I've got to fight to control it
Got to fight to control the violent side
The violent side
Got to fight to control the violent side
Got to fight to control the violent side
Got to fight to control the violent side

[Verse 1]
Take my advice
Don't listen to me
It ain't paradise
But it used to be
There was a time
When the river was wide
And the water came running down
To the rising tide

[Chorus]
But the wooden ships
Were just a hippie dream
Just a hippie dream

[Verse 2]
Don't bat an eye
Don't waste a word
Don't mention nothin'
That could go unheard
'Cause the tie-dye sails
Are the screaming sheets
And the dusty trail
Leads to blood in the streets

[Chorus]
And the wooden ships
Are a hippie dream
Capsized in excess
If you know what I mean

[Bridge]
Just because it's over for you
Don't mean it's over for me
It's a victory for the heart
Every time the music starts
So please don't kill the machine
Don't kill the machine
Don't kill the machine
Don't kill the machine
Don't kill the machine
Don't kill the machine
Don't kill the machine
Don't kill the machine
Don't kill the machine

[Outro]
Another flower child goes to seed
In an ether-filled room of meat-hooks
It's so ugly
So ugly

[Verse]
Are there any more
Real cowboys
Left out in these hills?
Will the fire hit the iron
One more time?
And will one more
Dusty pick-up
Coming rolling down the road
With a load of feed
Before the sun gets high?
Well, I hope that
Working cowboy never dies
Not the one
That's snorting cocaine
When the honky-tonks all closed
But the one
That prays for more rain
Heaven knows
That the good feed
Brings the money
And the money buys the clothes
Not the diamond sequins
Shining on TV
But the kind the
Working cowboy really needs
Are there any more
Country families
Still working hand in hand
Trying hard to stay together
And make a stand?
While the rows and rows of houses
Come creeping up on the land
Where the cattle graze and
An old grey barn still stands
Are there any more
Real cowboys in this land?

[Outro]
Are there any more
Real cowboys in this land?

[Verse 1]
Have you heard the news?
I lost my baby to another man
I got a bulletin of news
Late breaking story that I don't understand
Should I call her up late?
Should I ask her how she really feels?
Should I try to make a date
For a time when we can touch and feel?

[Chorus]
She's so on fire
She's my desire

[Verse 2]
I've got the bad news beat
And my reception is loud and clear
I've got a man in the street
Telling me what I don't wanna hear
I've got an eye in the sky
Taking pictures that I don't wanna see
She's got a brand new guy
Looks like she's never coming back to me

[Chorus]
She's so on fire
She's my desire

[Outro]
I've got an eye in the sky
I've got a man in the street
I've got the bad news beat
I've got the bad news beat
I've got an eye in the sky (Got an eye in the sky)
I've got a man on the street (I've got a man on the street)
I've got the bad news beat (I've got the bad news beat)
I've got an eye in the sky (I've got an eye in the sky)
I've got a man on the street (I've got a man on the street)
I've got the bad news beat (I've got the bad news beat)
I've got the bad news beat

[Chorus]
Once an angel
Always an angel
You're as close to heaven
As I'll ever be

[Verse 1]
It's been six years now
Since my ring
Slipped on your finger
And those years have made
A better man out of me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
There've been times when
I've treated you so badly
I've done things I know
You'll never understand
But you take me back
Turn your eyes
Towards the window
Where you hide the tears
You don't want me to see

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Outro]
You're as close to heaven
As I'll ever be

[Verse 1]
Out on the road the traffic slowed down to a crawl
Strobe lights flashing on the overpass
The tangled steel could not reveal what no one saw
Or how he walked away without a scratch
He thought of her and walked along the exit ramp
He touched the night between two old street lamps

[Chorus]
And everyone will touch the night
And everyone will touch the night
And everyone will touch the night

[Verse 2]
Image in blue dissolve into the empty night
Slowly fading, no one answering
She walked away and left him standing all alone
Between the shadows of his memory
And those who loved and lost will know the way it feels
To touch the night without the one you love

[Chorus]
And everyone will touch the night
And everyone will touch the night
And everyone will touch the night

[Verse 1]
People on the street need a place to go
People on the street need a place to go
Walkin' with the beat if it's not too slow
Walkin' with the beat if it's not too slow

[Pre-Chorus]
When night's dark shadow falls
On the sidewalk scenes and the concrete canyon walls

[Chorus]
People on the street need a place to go
People on the street need a place to go

[Bridge]
Walking through the night up and down the avenue
Looking for a place
A place to go, a place to go

[Verse 2]
There's a muffled scream from the alley scene
From the alley scene comes a muffled scream
And the siren wails while the system fails
In the steaming heat people walk in the street

[Pre-Chorus]
People can't run and hide
If you want to feel good then you gotta feel good inside

[Chorus]
People on the street need a place to go
People on the street need a place to go

[Bridge]
Rising through the grates come the fumes of industry
Floating to the sky
Keep walking with the beat, walking with the beat
Keep walking with the beat, walking with the beat
Keep walking with the beat, walking with the beat
Keep walking with the beat, walking with the beat
Keep walking with the beat, walking with the beat

[Pre-Chorus]
When the night's dark shadow falls
On the sidewalk scenes and the concrete canyon walls

[Chorus]
People on the street need a place to go
People on the street need a place to go
People on the street need a place to go
People on the street need a place to go

[Chorus]
Don't tell me hard luck stories
And I won't tell you mine
Don't tell me hard luck stories
And I won't, won't tell you mine

[Verse 1]
Every time you're feeling fine
Got another good one on the line
It slips away
You feel it slip away, slip away
I don't want no more from you
Won't do what you want me to
Turn me loose
Come on turn me loose
Turn me loose
Every time I'm feeling good
The phone rings
And I knock on wood
Hoping that it won't be you
Calling like you always do
All you ever seem to say is
How much bad luck came your way
You won't try to start again
You just count on your old friends

[Chorus]
Don't tell me hard luck stories
And I won't tell you mine
Don't tell me hard luck stories
And I won't, won't tell you mine

[Verse 2]
Now you call up every day
Got no money, no place to stay
That girl made a mess of you
You got what was coming too
Build her up and let her down
Tasting everything in town
Treat her right, you never
Treat her right, treat her right
Now she's gone and you're alone
Bite your fingers to the bone
Slip away
You feel it slip away, slip away
You don't know what's going on
How you lost it, what went wrong
Whatever happened to
The love that you once knew?

[Chorus]
Don't tell me hard luck stories
And I won't tell you mine
Don't tell me hard luck stories
And I won't, won't tell you mine

[Intro]
Up in that new space station
Living Kennedy's dream
There was an automatic camera
Shooting elephantine

[Pre-Chorus]
Well the crew was relaxing
Before the video screen
Watching old re-runs
Of Mohammed Ali

[Chorus]
The voice of Houston calling
Brought them back to the scene
Except the sky is falling
Do you know what that means?

[Verse]
Out on that Texas sidewalk
Through the hotel mezzanine
There walked a see-through hooker
To a suite with two TVs
But by the elevator
She began to sneeze
With an attack so uncontrolled
It brought her to her knees
And then the hotel doctor
With nurse and stethoscope
Announced the worst is over
But for her there is no hope
Way down in South Dakota
On the Needles Highway
There's a lone red rider
On the road today
And though his war is over
He's fighting on anyway
Although he's seldom sober
He's drinking whisky all day
Down in that old box canyon
Where only misfits can go
He rides with no companion
But saloon and rodeo
Up in that new space station
Living Kennedy's dream
There's an automatic camera
Shooting elephantine

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I remember long ago
How I wondered where I'd go
While the blizzards
Cold wind and snow
Pounded outside my window

[Chorus]
California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye

[Verse 2]
Land of beauty
Space and light
Land of promise
Land of might
You're my home now
And it's true
California, here's to you

[Chorus]
California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye

[Outro]
The golden state!

[Verse]
Old ways
It sure is hard
To change them
Come what may
It's hard to teach
A dinosaur a new trick
Lately I've been finding out
I'm set in my ways
Old ways
Can be your ball
And chain
Oh, I'm going to stop that grass
And give up all this drinking
Really going to make my life last
Clean up my whole way of living
Up until the party last night
I was a different man
But old ways
Got their way again
The economy was getting so bad
I had to lay myself off
Well, working was a habit I had
So I kept showing up anyway
Then one day
Things turned around
I got my back pay
Old ways
Coming through again

[Outro]
I got old ways

[Intro]
Why are you growing up so fast
My boy?
Oh, you'd better take your time
Why are you growing up so fast
My son?

[Verse 1]
Almost time to live your dream
My boy
Oh, you'd better take your time
Almost time to make some plans
My son

[Chorus]
Vacation gone, school is out
Summer ends year in year out

[Verse 2]
Oh, you'd better take your time
My boy
I thought we had just begun
Why are you growing up so fast
My son?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Why are you growing up so fast
My boy?
Why are you growing up so fast
My son?

[Intro]
Out on the trans-Canada highway
There was a girl
Hitchhiking with her dog
Fireflies buzzing round her head
Like candles in the fog

[Verse 1]
He was three miles down the road
Trying to stay up
But he knew that he couldn't
She was looking
For a ride through the night
But out there, who wouldn't

[Pre-Chorus]
They were bound for glory
Bound for living on the edge
They were bound for each other
Like two comets heading for a bed

[Chorus]
She had a new way of living
New way of looking at life
He had an
'84 International and two kids
He left back home with his wife

[Verse 2]
He was tired of
Writing letters to himself
And living in the dark
She was open to suggestions
And some say
She had a broken heart
He had everything he wanted
Until it all
Turned out to be a job
One fallen asleep trucker
And a girl
Hitchhiking with her dog

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Out on the trans-Canada highway
The sun came climbing up the cab
By the time it hit the window
They were waking up
From what little sleep they had
When that heat hit the blankets
They were looking
For love at second sight
Just staring in each others eyes
Finding it in the morning light

[Pre-Chorus]
They were bound for glory
Bound for living on the edge
They were bound for each other
Like two blankets laying on a bed

[Chorus]

[Intro]
I would be feeling so low
She'd have a new place to go
She'd take me in her arms
And show me all her charms
Until my troubles were gone

[Verse 1]
Then when I left her behind
Never a tear could I find
Just a haunting melody
Coming back to me
Where is the highway tonight?

[Chorus]
Where is the highway tonight?
Where are those old days
And crazy nights?

[Verse 2]
Now the house is
All quiet and still
Coyote howls on the hill
How far did I go
Before we said hello
Where is the highway tonight?
Darling, you'll always be mine
I'll never treat you unkind
But a haunting melody
Keeps coming back to me
Where is the highway tonight?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
A haunting melody
Keeps coming back to me
Where is the highway tonight?

[Chorus 1]
We are men at work
We got a job to do
We got to keep you rocking
To keep your soul from the blue
Well, we work all day
Then we work all night
We got to keep you dancing
Got to make you feel alright

[Chorus 2]
Ten men working
Ten men working tonight

[Chorus 3]
We got to dig the groove
We're going to hammer the blues
You can't sit down
Because we got a job to do
We got to dig the groove
We're going to hammer the blues
You can't sit down
Because we got a job to do

[Chorus 2]
Ten men working
Ten men working tonight

[Chorus 1]
We are men at work
We got a job to do
We got to keep you rocking
To keep your soul from the blue
Well, we work all day
Then we work all night
We got to keep you dancing
Got to make you feel alright

[Chorus 2]
Ten men working
Ten men working tonight

[Chorus 3]
We got to dig the groove
We're going to hammer the blues
You can't sit down
Because we got a job to do
We got to dig the groove
We're going to hammer the blues
You can't sit down
Because we got a job to do

[Chorus 2]
Ten men working
Ten men working tonight
Ain't singing for Pepsi
Ain't singing for Coke
I don't sing for nobody
Makes me look like a joke
This note's for you

[Verse
Not singing for Miller
Don't sing for Bud
I won't sing for politicians
Ain't singing for Spuds
This note's for you

[Bridge]
Don't want no cash
Don't need no money
Ain't got no stash
This note's for you

[Outro]
I've got the real thing
I got the real thing, baby
I got the real thing
Yeah, alright

[Intro]
I got a coupe de ville
I got a bed in the house
Where you once lived

[Verse]
I had a few cheap thrills
But they cost me a lot more
Than I could give

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a right
In this crazy world
To live my life
Like anyone else
How long can I
Carry this monkey around
All by myself

[Chorus]
If I can't have you
I don't want nothing else
If I can't have you
I don't want nothing else

[Bridge] 

[x2]
Well, I hit the wall
Woke up this morning
And I hit the wall

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
People sleeping on the sidewalks
On a rainy day
Families living under freeways
It's the American way
Starving in the city
While the farm goes to seed
Murder in the home
And crime on the streets

[Chorus]
Don't that trouble you brother?
Don't that trouble you pal?
Don't that trouble you sister?
Well, that's life in the city

[Verse 2]
All our old hangouts
Are boarded up and closed
Or being sold to someone
Nobody knows
I got a woman that loves me
And I love her so
She's all dressed up now
With nowhere to go

[Chorus]

That's life in the city

[Verse 3]
Listen to me people
Hear what I have to say
Ever since I was knee high
I rocked my blues away
But people
Sleeping on the sidewalks
And families in need
Murder in the home
And crime on the streets

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
The sun is setting
On the long road home
And I've been gone too long
My little girl's waiting
By the front door
I count the minutes
Till I hold you once more

[Chorus]
Making love to you
While time stands still
I may be dreaming
But I always will
Because I'll be holding you
When the twilight falls

[Verse 2]
Don't be lonely, don't be sad
Because you're the best thing
That I ever had
And true love is so hard to find
And we were looking
For such a long time

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Don't be sad
You're the best thing
That I ever had
The sun is setting
On the long road home

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a married man
Respect my happy home
I'm a married man
Respect my happy home
Don't tempt me baby
Stop singing stop singing
Your old song

[Verse]
Well, I work all day
Take my money back home
Yeah. I work all day
Take my money back home
I haven't got time to party
Haven't got time for you
No more

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Well, I'm a married man

[Verse 1]
Well, the cop made the showdown
He was sure he was right
He had all of the lowdown
From the bank heist last night
His best friend was the robber
And his wife was a thief
All the children were killers
They couldn't get no relief
The bungalow was surrounded
When a voice loud and clear
Said, "Come on out with your hands up"
Or we'll blow you out of here
There was a face in the window
The TV cameras rolled
Then they cut to the announcer
And the story was told

[Verse 2]
The artist looked at the producer
The producer sat back
He said, "What we have got here, is a perfect track"
But we don't have a vocal
And we don't have a song
If we could get these things accomplished
Nothing else could go wrong
So he balanced the ashtray
As he picked up the phone
And said, "Send me a songwriter,"
"who's drifted far from home"
And make sure that he's hungry
Make sure he's alone
Send me a cheeseburger
And a new Rolling Stone
Yeah

[Verse 3]
There's still crime in the city
Said the cop on the beat
I don't know if I can stop it
I feel like meat on the street
They paint my car like a target
I take my orders from fools
Meanwhile some kid
Blows my head off
Well, I play by their rules
That's why I'm doing it my way
I took the law in my hands
So here I am in the alleyway
A wad of cash in my pants
I get paid by a ten year old
He says he looks up to me
There's still crime in the city
But it's good to be free
Yeah

[Verse 4]
Now I come from a family
That has a broken home
Sometimes I talk to Daddy
On the telephone
When he says that he loves me
I know that he does
But I wish I could see him
I wish I knew where he was
But that's the way
All my friends are
Except maybe one or two
Wish I could see him this weekend
Wish I could walk in his shoes
But now I'm doing my own thing
Sometimes I'm good, then I'm bad
Although my home has been broken
It's the best home I ever had
Yeah

[Verse 5]
Well, I keep getting younger
My life's been funny that way
Before I ever learned to talk
I forgot what to say
I sassed back to my mom
I sassed back to my teacher
I got thrown out of Bible school
For sassing back at the preacher
Then I grew up to be a fireman
Put out every fire in town
Put out anything smoking
But when I put the hose down
The judge sent me to prison
He gave me life without parole
Wish I never put the hose down
Wish I never got old

[Intro]
Don't need drugs
Don't want money
You come along
And shook me honey
All I want is
You right by my side

[Verse 1]
With our love taken care of
From now on I am not scared of
Lonely nights, I can
Kiss those days good-bye

[Chorus]
Although we walk in the rain
My heart feels sunny inside
With you babe

[Verse 2]
Long blonde hair, blue blue eyes
Come on baby, please don't cry
Talk to me
Let me know it's alright

[Chorus]

Feel sunny inside
Sunny inside

[Outro]
All day long
I will sing my song to you
All day long
I can sing this song to you

[Verse 1]
Daylight breaks and I go to bed
And I find myself worrying
About things you said
Oh honey
I can't believe your lying
But you tell me things
Things I know aren't true

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well, I lost my job
Thinking about you
Now there's another man
Working in my place
Oh honey
I can't believe your lying
But you tell me things
Things I know aren't true

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Verse 3]
Well, my money's gone
And so are you
My friends all tell me
I have been a fool
Oh honey
I can't believe your lying
But you tell me things
Things I know aren't true

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Well, I've seen some women
They put your soul on ice
They want a piece of the action
But they never
Let you roll the dice
That's the kind of woman
Bring a good man down
That's the kind of woman
I don't want around
Hey hey
I got a woman that dances
She knows how to jump and shout
Now she don't want to use me
Because she knows
How it wears me out
Yeah, she's the woman
With the magic touch
She don't want to lose me
Because she loves me too much
Hey hey

[Bridge]
Hey hey
My woman looks good to me
Hey hey
My woman looks good to me
Yeah, she knows how to please me
She knows how to set me free

[Outro]
Get off of that couch
Turn off that M.T.V
Get off of that couch
Turn off your M.T.V
Hey hey
My woman looks good to me

[Chorus 1]
When I try
To tell you one thing
You don't listen
When I try
To tell you one thing
You don't care

[Chorus 2]
I think we're
Headed for a heartache
That's my suspicion
I think we're
Headed for a heartache
That's how I feel

[Verse 1]
And I don't want
The silent treatment
And I don't need
To feel the chill
You know a body feels empty
With no love inside
Yeah, a body feels empty
With no love at all

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
One of these days
You're going to wake up
And I'll be gone
You'll open your eyes
And see the truth

[Chorus 1]
When I try
To tell you one thing
You don't listen
When I try
To tell you one thing baby
You don't care

[Chorus]
Haven't a day goes by
I don't burn a little bit of my soul
Hasn't a day goes by
I don't burn a little bit of my soul
Scored some friends along the way
Did what I did, said what I had to say
And I'd do it all again if I had to today
When all is said and done
I'm the one

[Verse]
It's a long hard road
When your friends start
To leave you behind
It's a long hard road
When you try to find peace of mind
Some might go for poison
And some go for too much stuff
Some just go to sleep at night
And forget to wake up

[Bridge]
Cocaine eyes
Can't hide your face
It's no surprise
You lose the race
Again

[Chorus]

I'm the one, yeah

[Outro]
Cocaine eyes
It won't hide your face
It's no surprise
You lost the race
Once again
My old friend

[Verse 1]
Though the river flows
Gently to the sea
He was on the shore
Rooted like a tree
She was here and there
Riding on the waves
Through it all, she heard his call
And gave it all she gave

[Chorus]
And though their love
Was hanging on a limb
She taught him how to dance
And start again
And though their love
Was hanging on a limb
She taught him how to dance

[Verse 2]
And when the melody
Through the window called
It echoed in the courtyard
And whispered in the halls
He played it through the night
She knew he had to go
There was something about freedom
He thought he didn't know

[Chorus]
And though their love
Was hanging on a limb
She taught him how to dance
And start again
And though their love
Was hanging on a limb
She taught him how to dance

[Verse 3]
Though the river flowed
Gently to the sea
He was on the shore
Rooted like a tree
She was here and there
Riding on the waves
Through it all, she heard his call
And gave it all she gave

[Outro]
And though their love
Was hanging on a limb
She taught him how to dance

[Verse]
In the crystal ball
The gypsy sees the villa
The riders on the hill
The fire in the fields
She sees the mission bell
Swinging in the silence
Now the shooting starts
The bullets pierce the hearts
The senoritas crying at the well

[Verse 2]
Up in the Gold Hotel
The money hits the table
The heavies all are there
That's why the deal's going down
Beautiful women all dressed in
Diamonds and sable
Down upon the street
Beside a garbage heap
A Mariachi band begins to play

[Verse 3]
Somewhere a blues guitar
Plays echoes in the alleyway
The Tijuana dawn
Claims another day
The golden sun
Rises on the runway
The pilot understands
The money changes hands
Inside the jet
The briefcase snaps goodbye

[Verse 4]
In Eldorado town
There lives a great bullfighter
His eyes are screaming blue
His hair is red as blood
And when the gate goes up
The crowd gets so excited
And he comes dancing out
Dressed in gold lami
He kills the Bull
And lives another day

[Verse 1]
You are my special one
Made my heart come all undone
We've been havin' too much fun
Now someone else
Will sleep with tears
When he hears
What we've done

[Chorus]
Oh, the ways of love
Oh, the ways of love

[Verse 2]
Hear my song and hear my heart
We'll be gone when the music starts
Then we'll never be apart
Just you and I
Go flyin' by
No one to cry
That we're gone

[Chorus]
Oh, the ways of love
Oh, the ways of love

[Verse 1]
You are my special one
Made my heart come all undone
We've been havin' too much fun
Now someone else
Will sleep with tears
When he hears
What we've done

[Chorus]
Oh, the ways of love
Oh, the ways of love
Oh, the ways of love
Oh, the ways of love

[Verse 1]
Rommel wore a ring on his finger
He only took it off when he flew his plane
Once he told me why
He said we all have to fly someday
We all have to fly
Someday

[Verse 2]
TV preacher can't be bothered ("Praise the Lord! Praise and pay!")
With those petty things ("Praise the Lord! Praise and pay!")
He stays a step removed ("Praise the Lord! Praise and pay!")
So they say ("Praise the Lord! Praise and pay!")
He's pipin' music in ("Praise and pay!")
We all have to sin someday
We all have to sin
Someday

[Verse 3]
Workin' on that great Alaska pipeline
Many men were lost in the pipe
They went to fuelin' cars
Now smog might turn to stars someday
Smog might turn to stars
Someday

[Verse 4]
Hold me baby, put your arms around me
Give me all the love you have to give
Tomorrow won't be late
We won't have to wait someday
We won't have to wait
Someday

[Verse 1]
Livin' on the edge of night
You know the sun won't go down slow
Don't know which drug is right
Can't decide which way you wanna go
I feel the way you feel
'Cause not so long ago
It had a hold on me
I couldn't let it go
It wouldn't set me free
It wouldn't set me free
No more, no more, no more

[Verse 2]
Seemed like the easy thing
To let it go for one more day
Like singin' the same old song
And twistin' the words in a different way
Where did the magic go?
I searched high and low
I can't find it no more
I can't get it back
I can't find it no more
I can't find it no more
No more, no more, no more, no more (No more)

[Verse 3]
Searchin' for quality
Havin' to have the very best
Now scroungin' for quantity
Never havin' time to do the test
That's how the story goes
Can't put it down
'Til the last page
I can't put it down
I can't put it down
I can't put it down

[Intro]
When I woke up you were gone
And the sun was on the lawn
Empty pillow with perfume on
I smelled it
Well we met in my favorite bar
Took a ride in my old car
But I still don't know how
We made it home

[Chorus]
Was I too far gone?
Too far gone
Too far gone for you

[Verse 2]
We had drugs and we had booze
But we still had somethin' to lose
And by dawn I wanted to marry you
With our attitudes by day
And our secret dreams by night
Can we really live our lives that way?

[Chorus]
Am I too far gone?
Too far gone
Too far gone for you
Was I too far gone?
Too far gone
Too far gone for you

[Verse 1]
I came to you when I needed a rest
You took my love and put it to the test
I saw some things that I never would have guessed
Well I've been down but I'm comin' back up again

And I'm rolling down the open road
Where my true love, she lies waiting
Right now I'm thinking 'bout these things I know
But the daylight will soon be breaking

[Verse 2]
You were my raft and I let you slide
It seemed like such a long easy ride
I was adrift on a river of pride
Feels like a railroad, I pull a whole load behind me

That ol' white line is a friend of mine
And its good time that we've been making
Right now I'm thinking 'bout those things that I know
But the daylight will soon be breakin'
Breakin'

[Verse 1]
She used to work in a diner
Never saw a woman look finer
I used to order just to watch her float across the floor
She grew up in a small town
Never put her roots down
Daddy always kept moving so she did too

[Chorus]
Somewhere on a desert highway
She rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life
The chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes

[Verse 2]
You know it ain't easy
You got to hold on
She was an unknown legend in her time
Now she's dressing two kids
Looking for a magic kiss
She gets the faraway look in her eyes

[Chorus]
Somewhere on a desert highway
She rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life
The chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Somewhere on a desert highway
She rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life
The chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
From Hank to Hendrix
I walked these streets with you
Here I am with this old guitar
Doing what I do
I always expected
That you would see me through
I never believed in much
But I believed in you

[Chorus]
Can we get it together
Can we still stand side by side
Can we make it last
Like a musical ride?

[Verse 2]
From Marilyn to Madonna
I always loved your smile
Now we're headed
For the big divorce
California-style
I found myself singing
Like a long-lost friend
The same thing that makes you live
Can kill you in the end

[Chorus]
Can we get it together
Can we still stand side by side
Can we make it last
Like a musical ride?

[Verse 3]
Sometimes it's distorted
Not clear to you
Sometimes the beauty of love
Just comes ringing through
New glass in the window
New leaf on the tree
New distance between us
You and me

[Chorus]
Can we get it together
Can we still walk side by side
Can we make it last
Like a musical ride?

[Chorus 1]
Open up your eyes
See how life time flies
Open up and let the light back in
Open up your heart
Let the loving start
Open up and let the light back in

[Verse 1]
I was thinking of you and me
Making love beneath the tree
And now I wonder could it be
Thinking 'bout the times we had
Some were good and some were bad
Guitar fighting the T.V

[Chorus 2]
I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking of you and me
I was thinking about you and me

[Verse 2]
Looking at you just the other night
Dancing in the evening light
True love conquers all
Old man sitting there
Touch of grey, but he don't care
When he hears his children call

[Chorus 2]
I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking of you and me
I was thinking about you and me

[Chorus 1]
Open up your eyes
See how life time flies
Open up and let the light back in
Open up your heart
Let the loving start
Open up and let the light back in

[Chorus 1]
The little creatures run in from the cold
Back to the nest just like the days of old
There in the safety of a mother's arms
The warmth of ages, far away from harm again

[Verse 1]
Ears ringing from the battle fire
The tired warrior aims a little higher
The black falcon or the little sparrow
The healing light or the flash of the barrel

[Chorus 2]
No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of man

[Verse 2]
Silver mane flying in the wind
Down through the planets on the run again
No one knows where they're running to
But every kind is coming two by two
Out on the delta
Where the hoofbeats pound
The daddy's running on the frozen ground
Can't smell the poison as it follows him
Can't see the gas and machines, it's a war of man

[Chorus 2]
No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of man

[Verse 3]
The windows open and the little girl dreams
The sky's her playground as she mounts her steed
Across the heavens to the other side
On wings of magic does the little girl ride

[Chorus 1]
The baby creatures run in from the cold
Back to the nest just like the days of old
There in the safety of a mother's arms
The warmth of ages, far away from harm again

[Chorus 2]
No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of man

[Intro]
One of these days
I'm going to sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
And I'm going to try
And thank them all for the good times together
Though so apart we've grown

[Chorus]
One of these days
I'm going to sit down
And write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be long

[Verse 1]
And I'm going to thank
That old country fiddler
And all those rough boys
Who play that rock 'n' roll
I never tried to burn any bridges
Though I know I let some good things go

[Chorus]
One of these days
I'm going to sit down
And write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be long

[Verse 2]
From down in L.A
All the way to Nashville
From New York City
To my Canadian prairie home
My friends are scattered
Like leaves from an old maple
Some are weak, some are strong

[Chorus]
One of these days
I'm going to sit down
And write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be long

[Outro]
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be long

[Verse]
You are such a woman to me
And I love you
Our love will live
Until the end of all time

[Chorus]
No one else can kill me like you do
No one else can fill me like you do
And no one else can feel our pain
Love is a healer
And I love you
No one else can kill me like you do
No one else can fill me like you do
And no one else can feel our pain
Love is a healer
And I love you

[Outro]
You are such a woman to me

[Chorus]
King went a-running after deer
Wasn't scared of jumping off the truck in high gear
King went a-sniffing and he would go
Was the best old hound dog
I ever did know

[Verse 1]
I had a dog and his name was King
I told the dog about everything
There in my truck the dog and I
Then one day the King up and died
Then I thought about the times we had
Once when I kicked him when he was bad
Old King sure meant a lot to me
But that hound dog is history

[Chorus]
King went a-running after deer
Wasn't scared of jumping off the truck in high gear
King went a-sniffing and he would go
Was the best old hound dog
I ever did know

[Verse 2]
That old King was a friend of mine
Never knew a dog that was half as fine
I may find one, you never do know
Because I still got a long way to go
I had a dog and his name was King
I told the dog about everything
Old King sure meant a lot to me
But that hound dog is history

[Chorus]
King went a-running after deer
Wasn't scared of jumping off the truck in high gear
King went a-sniffing and he would go
Was the best old hound dog
I ever did know

[Verse 1]
I'm a dreaming man
Yes, that's my problem
I can't tell
When I'm not being real
In the meadow dusk
I park my Aerostar
With a loaded gun and sweet dreams of you

[Chorus]
I'll always be a dreaming man
I don't have to understand
I know it's alright

[Verse 2]
I see your curves and
I feel your vibrations
You dressed in black and white you lost in the mall
I watch you disappear past Club Med Vacations
Another sleepless night a sun that won't fall

[Chorus]
I'll always be a dreaming man
I don't have to understand
I know it's alright

[Verse 3]
Now the night is gone a new day is dawning
And our homeless dreams go back to the street
Another time or place another civilization
Would really make this life feel so complete

[Chorus]
I'll always be a dreaming man
I don't have to understand
I know it's alright

[Outro]
Dreaming man
He's got a problem
Dreaming man
Dreaming man
He's got a problem
Dreaming man

[Intro]
On the roller coaster ride
That my emotions have to take me on
I heard a newborn baby cry
Through the night

[Verse 1]
I heard a perfect echo die
Into an anonymous wall
Of digital sound
Somewhere deep inside
Of my soul

[Chorus]
A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature
Don't judge yourself too harsh
My love
Or someday you might find
Your soul endangered
A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature

[Verse 2]
Amazon
You had so much
And now so much is gone
What are you going to do
With your life?
What a lucky man
To see the earth
Before it touched his hand
What an angry fool
To condemn
One more night to go
One more sleep
Upon your burning banks
A greedy man never knows
What he's done

[Chorus]
A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature
Don't judge yourself too harsh
My love
Or someday you might find
Your soul endangered
A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature

[Verse 3]
Went to the rodeo today
I saw the cowgirls
Lined up on the fence
A brand new Chevrolet
A brand new pair of seamless pants
We watched the moment of defeat
Played back over on the video screen
Somewhere deep inside
Of my soul

[Outro]
A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature

[Verse 1]
Got a woman that loves me
And I love her so
But she's all dressed up now
With nowhere to go

All our old hang-outs
Are boarded up and closed
Or being bought by somebody
Nobody knows

But things are not that bad
We still got the kids
We're going out to the movies
Right after this

Going back to school
Saving up my tuition
Going to rewrite all the rules
On the old blackboard
Cause it seems things today
There is no magic in them
They don't cut the grade
Like they used to

[Chorus]
Depression blues
Nowhere to go
Being bought by somebody
Nobody knows

[Verse 2]
Is there anybody out there
With a voice loud and clear
Gonna sing all the words
We all want to hear

[Chorus]
The fruit of love was in the future
Around the corner and over the hill
The act of love was slowly pounding
Slowly pounding
Slowly pounding

The holy war was slowly building
Heroes leaving for the great crusade
Seek reward in the ever after
Ever after
Ever after

Don't wanna have to lose you baby
Don't want to have to take you back
You know I'll never lose you baby
Abuse you baby
Use you baby

You know I'll always help you baby
But I just can't do that
I know I said I'd help you baby
Here's my wallet
Call me sometime
Act of love
Act of love
Act of love
Act of love

The fruit of love was in the future
Around the corner and over the hill
The act of love was slowly pounding
Slowly pounding
Slowly pounding

Act of love
Act of love
Act of love
Act of love

[Verse 1]
I'm an accident, I was driving way too fast
Couldn't stop though, so I let the moment last
I'm for rolling, I'm for tossing in my sleep
It's not guilt though, it's not the company I keep

[Verse 2]
People my age, they don't do the things I do
They go somewhere while I run away with you
And I've got my friends, and I've got my family too
And I got her love, she's got my love too

[Verse 3]
And I can't hear you, but I feel the things you say
And I can't see you, but I see what's in my way
Now I'm floating, 'cause I'm not tied to the ground
Words I've spoken seem to leave a hollow sound

[Verse 4]
On the long plain, see the rider in the night
See the chieftain, see the braves in cool moonlight
Who will love them when they take another life?
Who will hold them when they tremble for the knife?

[Verse 5]
Voicemail numbers on an old computer screen
Rows of lovers, parked forever in a dream
Screaming sirens echoing across the bay
To the old boats from the city far away

[Verse 6]
Homeless heroes walk the streets of their hometowns
And rows of zeros on a field that's turning brown
They play baseball, they play football under lights
They play card games and we watch them every night
Need distraction, need romance and candlelight
Need random violence, need entertainment tonight
Need the evidence, want the testimony of
Expert witnesses on the brutal crimes of love

[Verse 7]
I was too tired to see the news when I got home
Pulled the curtain, fell into bed alone
Started dreaming, saw the rider once again
In the doorway, where she stood and watched for him
Watched for him

[Verse 8]
I'm not present, I'm a drug that makes you dream
I'm an aerostar, I'm a cutlass supreme
In the wrong lane, trying to turn against the flow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow

[Refrain]
I'm the ocean
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow

[Verse]
Across the plain
Flew the lone grey rider
Leather bag
Pounding on his back
Above the clouds the moon
Was climbing higher
A pack of wolves wanted
Their money back
With folded arms
The chief stood watching
Painted braves
Slipped down the hill
In his ears
The spirit talking
As they closed in
For an easy kill
At the house
The door was wide open
Wind blew
Curtains off the rod
She was waiting and hoping
She was praying to her god
He was luckier than most men
He was barely in his prime
As she stood there
In the doorway
Her long dress flowing
Would he make it this time
Over the hill
In the big green country
That's the place where
The cancer cowboy rides
Pure as the driven snow
Before it got him

[Outro]
Sometimes I feel like
He's all right
Sometimes I feel
Like a piece of paper
Sometimes I feel
Like my own name
Sometimes I feel
Different later
Sometimes I feel
I feel just the same

[Verse 1]
There's a place called Downtown
Where the hippies all go
And they dance the charleston
And they do the limbo
Yeah the hippies all go there
'Cause they want to be seen
It's like a room
Full of pictures
It's like a psychedelic dream

[Chorus]
Downtown
Let's go downtown
Downtown at night
Downtown
Let's have a party
Downtown at night

[Verse 2]
Yeah it's
Right around the corner
Up and down the hill
When you hear the band playing
It's gonna give you a chill
Give your money to the gateman
Young blood in his eye
Hold on to your baby
When you slip into the sky

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Jimi's playing in the back room
Led Zeppelin on stage
There's a mirror ball twirling
And a note from Page
Like a water-washed diamond
In a river of sin
Going down like a whirlpool
When you get sucked in

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse]
Can't forget
What happened yesterday
Though my friends say
Don't look back
I can feel it
Coming through me
Like an echo
Like a photograph

[Verse 1]
Saw your friend
Working in this hotel
Says he used to know you when
And your dreams
Lucky as they seemed
They all
Turned their back on him

[Chorus]
Truth be known
Truth be known

[Verse 2]
Way I feel tonight
Living in
This back street town
'Bout my dreams
They all seem to fade
As soon as
I put my money down

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When the fire
That once was your friend
Burns your fingers to the bone
And your song
Meets a sudden end
Echoing
Through right and wrong

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Hi, my name is, my name is nobody famous
Guess what? I'm an anus
I'm here with Mancow, haha
You know how I do it, cause I kick this fluid when i do it
I bust it, I kill it and I crush it with Mancow
You don't understand how we do it
We land now with hits and freestyle flows
Cuz we the ish, I said ish backwards and guess what that is...
Shhh, yea I can't say that, yo, hit the playback
Check it, cause rappers don't know how to display that
Rhymes that I be kicking, freestyle when I be kicking
Sticking these, ribs sticking out, poverty stricken
I'm all hungry cause I ain't ate in ten minutes
I'm infinite, oh, hey, check it out, I'm Ken Kaniff

Oh, hi there man, oh yeah
Hell no bro, oh yeah, no, yeah
Oh here I am I'm chillin' with Mancow
You know how we do it man you know we got the know how
Mancow kick a freestyle

[Chorus]
Peace and love
Flying so high
Peace and love
Too young to die
Peace and love

[Verse 1]
Now you decide
Stay for the children
You don't really want to go
Can't feel it
Pulling like you did

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Only a ride
Strength is gone
Dying inside
Tell me now
What did you find
Found love in the people
Living in a sacred land
Found love in the people

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Found love found hate
Saw my mistake
Broke walls of pain
To walk again
I saw the dream
I saw the wake
We shared it all
But not the take

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Lennon's goodbye
Over Now
Living in time
A broken bell
A nursery rhyme
Deserted by heroes
Strangers in your own land
No way to deny you
No way to deny you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I took it all
I took the oath
I took it all
Til I had most
I took what's left
I gave it breath
I had it all once
I gave it back

[Chorus]
Looking at the grave
At the scenery around you
Home of the brave
Sometimes they leave you
Like they found you
Sometimes they worship you
Sometimes they
Tear your houses down
Sometimes they comfort you
Sometimes they
Spread your life around

[Verse]
Nothing you can see
That they
Won't try to give you
Land of the free
Where the legend
Will outlive you
When you earn their trust
When you are truly in danger
Where greed and lust
Have never been a stranger
Home of the brave
That's where
Heroes need protection
Media image slaves
Live by random selection
You sell your heart
But that's not
The price of freedom
Where things are useful
Only when you need them
Where will you go
When you need
To make some changes
Who will you love
In a world
Of constant strangers
I'll go with you
If you want
To take a hero home
I'll stay behind
If you want
To take a hero home

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Home of the brave

[x6]

[Verse]
Fallen angel
Who's your savior tonight
You're surrounded
By these walls
And neon lights
Hungry people
Move like waves
Behind the beat

[Chorus 1]
Where's the big drum

[Chorus 2]
Where's the feel
Of body heat

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
Good to see you
Good to see you again
Good to see your face again
Good to see you

[Verse 1]
I'm the suitcase in your hallway
I'm the footsteps on your floor
When I'm looking down on you
I feel like
I know what my life is for

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I've been down the endless highway
I've passed on the solid line
Now at last I'm home to you
I feel like making up for lost time

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Working hard every day
Never notice how
The time slips away
People come, seasons go
We got something
That'll never grow old

[Chorus]
I don't care
If the sun don't shine
And the rain keeps pouring
Down on me and mine
Cause our kind of love
Never seems to get old
It's better than silver and gold

[Verse 2]
I used to have a treasure chest
Got so heavy that I had to rest
I let it slip away from me
Didn't need it anyway
So I let it slip away

[Chorus]
I don't care
If the sun don't shine
And the rain keeps pouring
Down on me and mine
Cause our kind of love
Never seems to get old
It's better than silver and gold

I don't care
If the sun don't shine
And the rain keeps pouring
Down on me and mine
Cause our kind of love
Never seems to get old
It's better than silver and gold

[Chorus 1]
My old dad went a walking one day
Pushing tall weeds
Right outta his way
My old dad went a walking one day

[Chorus 2]
Hey now, hey now

[Verse 1]
Corduroy pants
And an old plaid shirt
Daddy went a walking
Just to feel the earth
Got a little dirty
But that's all right

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
Old man crossing the road
You've got to let him go
Old man crossing the road
He's feeling fine

[Chorus 4]
Daddy went a riding in his old car
Took the dog with him
Cause it ain't too far
Daddy went riding in his old car
Hey now, hey now

[Chorus 5]
Brown leather boots
And an old straw hat
Daddy's getting wood
With the barnyard cat
Got a little dirty
But that's all right
Hey now, hey now

[Chorus 3]

[Verse 2]
Mama's waiting
At the top of the hill
They'll be laughing
Oh the stories they'll tell
When he holds her
In his arms again
They'll be sweethearts
With time on their hands

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
Corduroy pants
And an old plaid shirt
Daddy went a walking
Just to feel the earth
Got a little dirty
But that's all right

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 4]

[Chorus 5]

[Verse 1]
Used to play
In a rock 'n' roll band
But they broke up
We were young and we were wild
It ate us up
Now I'm not saying
Who was right or wrong
Looking out on a big green lawn
Girls and boys
Playing in the afternoon sun
Life's a joy
I heard an old song
Playing on the radio

[Chorus]
Buffalo Springfield again

[Verse 2]
I'd like to see those guys again
And give it a shot
Maybe now we can show the world
What we've got
But I'd just like to play
For the fun we had

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
In the canyons of the great divide
Familiar places
That we can run and hide
Are filled with strangers
Walking in our houses alone

[Chorus]
In the great divide
Nothing to decide
No one else to care for or love
In the great divide
You won't fit in too well

[Verse 2]
On the horses of the carousel
She rides alone with you and me
She rides like she knows
Wherever she goes, we'll be there
On the carousel
Life is going well
Anyone can tell, we're in love
On the Carousel
You're gonna like the way you feel
You and I we got caught down there
In the twisted canyons
Of the great divide
We walked the floor
Now we don't go there anymore

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
The painter stood
Before her work
She looked around everywhere
She saw the pictures
And she painted them
She picked the colors from the air

[Verse 2]
Green to green
Red to red
Yellow to yellow in the light
Black to black
When the evening comes
Blue to blue in the night

[Chorus]
It's a long road behind me
It's a long road ahead
If you follow every dream
You might get lost
If you follow every dream
You might get lost

[Verse 3]
She towed the line
She held her end up
She did the work of two men
But in the end
She fell down
Before she got up again

[Verse 4]
I keep my friends
Eternally
We leave our tracks in the sound
Some of them
Are with me now
Some of them can't be found

[Chorus]
It's a long road behind me
And I miss you now
If you follow every dream
You might get lost
If you follow every dream
You might get lost

[Verse 5]
Green to green
Red to red
Yellow to yellow in the light
Black to black
When the evening comes
Blue to blue through the night

[Verse 1]
The flash of a distant camera
Reconnecting
Thoughts and actions
Fragments of our missing dreams
Pieces from here and there
Fall in place along the line
Disappearing between you and me
Life is changing everywhere I go
New things and old both disappear
If life is a photograph
Fading in the mirror

[Chorus]
All I want is a song of love
Song of love to sing for you
All I need is this song of love
To sing for you

[Verse 2]
On the floor where daylight dances
With the ones
That missed their chances
When they couldn't let it show
Lies the land of sweet surrender
Like a dream
It might have ended there
But we didn't even know
Now forever we will live as one
Floating in love's atmosphere
If love is a piece of dust
Shining in the sun

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Song of love

[x2]

[Verse 1]
See the bluebird fly easy as a dream
Dipping and bobbing in the sun
Could she be the one i saw so long ago
Could she be the one to take me home
This pasture is green
I'm walking in the sun
It's turning brown
I'm standing in the rain
My overcoat is worn
The pockets are all torn
I'm moving away from the pain

[Chorus]
Tick-tock
The clock on the wall
No wonder we're losing time
Ring, ring
The old church bell
The bride and her love
Seeking guidance from above

[Verse 2]
Amber waves of grain bow in the prairie wind
I'm hearing willie singing on the radio again
That song from 9/11 keeps ringing in my head
I'll always remember something Chris Rock said
Don't send no more candles
No matter what you do
Then willie stopped singing
And the prairie wind blew
The green kept rolling on
For miles and miles
Fields of fuel rolling on for miles

[Chorus]
Tick-tock
The clock on the wall
No wonder we're losing time
Toll, toll
The fallen soldier bell
The old church on the hill
Still standing when so many fell

[Verse 3]
Back when i was young, the birds blocked out the sun
Before the great migration south
We only shot a few
They last the winter through
Mother cooked them good and served them up
Somewhere a senator sits in a leather chair
Behind a big wooden desk
The caribou we killed mean nothing to him
He took his money just like all the rest

[Chorus]
Tick-tock
The clock on the wall
No wonder we're losing time
Ring, ring
Ring the wedding bells
The bride takes the ring
And the happy people sing

[Verse 1]
I got to bet
That your old man
Became fascinated
With his own plan
Turned you loose
Your mama too
There wasn't a thing
That you could do
But I got faith in you
It's a razor love
That cuts clean through
I got faith in you
It's a razor love
That cuts clean through

[Chorus 1]
You really made my day
With the little things you say

[Chorus 2]
Looking through
The window at a silhouette
Trying to find something
I can't find yet
Imagination is my best friend
Got to look out for
The greedy hand, greedy hand
Make a living like a rolling stone
On the road
There's no place like home
Silhouettes on the window

[Verse 2]
Who was it made
Your eyes flicker like that
Tell me baby
How'd you get the knack
You came to me with open arms
And I really
Took you down the track
Now all I've got for you
Is the kind of love
That cuts clean through
All I got for you is razor love
It cuts clean through

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
I just want to thank you
For all of the things you've done
I been thinking about you
I just want to send my love
I send my best to you
That's my message of love
For all the things you did
I can never thank you enough

[Chorus]
Feel like I'm falling
Falling off the face of the earth
Falling off the face of the earth
(Falling)
Feel like I'm falling
Falling off the face of the earth
Falling off the face of the earth

[Post-Chorus]
Oh

[Verse 2]
I just want to tell you
You sure mean a lot to me
It may sound simple
But you are the world to me
It's such a precious thing
The time we share together
I must apologize
For the troubled times

[Chorus]
Feel like I'm falling
Falling off the face of the earth
(Falling)
Feel like I'm falling
Falling off the face of the earth
Falling off the face of the earth

[Post-Chorus]
Oh

[Chorus]
Feel like I'm falling
Falling off the face of the earth
Falling off the face of the earth
(Falling)
Falling off the face of the earth
(Falling)
Feel like I'm falling
Falling off the face of the earth
(Falling)
Feel like I'm falling
Falling off the face of the earth
(Falling)

[Verse]
Someone's hanging out
We can't forget about
Things that people do
When they're free
Like visitors from space
It's hard to find a place
To blend in and go unrecognized
I'm waiting for a sign
I'm standing on the road
My mind outstretched to you
I'm picking something up
I'm letting something go
Like a dog I'm fetching
This to you
Pictures in mind
Rows of poppy fields
Harmony entwined
Changing gear that grinds
Pictures in my mind
Pictures in my brain
Electrical energy
Fighting drugs with pain
There's a war inside
Pictures in my brain
I'm looking for a job
I don't know what I'm doing
My software's
Not compatible with you
But this I can't deny
I know that you can fly
Cause I'm here
On the ground without you
Angel without wings
Owner without things
Sharpshooter without rings
Around you
The road we used to ride
Together side by side
Has flowers pushing
Through the dotted line

[Verse 1]
When I was a growing boy
A-rocking on my daddy's knee
Daddy took an old guitar and sang
"Bury me on the lone prairie"
Uncle Bob sat at the piano
My girl cousins sang harmony
Those were the good old family times
That left a big mark on me

[Chorus]
Bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
Where the Canada geese once filled the sky
And then I won't be far from home
Bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
You won't have to shed a tear for me
'Cause then I won't be far from home

[Verse 2]
Walking down the Trans-Canada Highway
I was talking to a firefly
Trying to make my way to Nashville, Tennessee
When another car passed me by
Some day I'm gonna make big money
And buy myself a big old car
Make my way on down to that promised land
And then I'm gonna really go far

[Chorus]
Bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
Where the Canada geese once filled the sky
And then I won't be far from home
Just bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
You won't have to shed a tear for me
'Cause then I won't be far from home

[Verse 1]
In the morning when I wake up and listen to the sound
Of the birds outside on the roof
I try to ignore what the paper says
And I try not to read all the news
And I'll hold you if you had a bad dream
And I hope it never comes true
'Cause you and I been through so many things together
And the sun starts climbing the roof...

[Chorus]
It's a dream
Only a dream
And it's fading now
Fading away
It's only a dream
Just a memory
Without anywhere to stay

[Verse 2]
The red river stills flows through my hometown
Rollin' and tumblin' on its way
Swirling around the old bridge pilings
Where a boy fishes the morning away
His bicycle leans on an oak tree
While the cars rumble over his head
An airplane leaves a trail in an empty blue sky
And the young birds call out to be fed

[Chorus]
It's a dream
Only a dream
And it's fading now
Fading away
It's only a dream
Just a memory
Without anywhere to stay

[Verse 3]
An old man walks along the sidewalk
With sunglasses and an old Stetson hat
Fall winds blow the back of his overcoat away
As he stops with the policeman to chat
And a train rolls out of the station
That was really somethin' in its day
Pickin' up speed on the straight prairie rails
As it carries the passengers away

[Chorus]
It's gone
It's only a dream
And it's fading now
Fading away
Only a dream
Just a memory
Without anywhere to stay
It's a dream
Only a dream
And it's fading now
Fading away
It's only a dream
Just a memory
Without anywhere to stay

[Outro]
It's a dream
It's only a dream
And it's fading now
Fading away

[Verse 1]
Tryin' to remember what my Daddy said
Before too much time took away his head
He said we're going back and I'll show you what I'm talking about
Going back to Cypress River, back to the old farmhouse

[Chorus]
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Tryin' to remember what Daddy said
Prairie wind blowin' through my head

[Verse 2]
I tried to tell the people but they never heard a word I say
They say there's nothing out there but wheat fields anyway
Just a farmer's wife hanging laundry in her backyard
Out on the prairie where the winds blow long and hard

[Chorus]
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Tryin' to remember what Daddy said
Prairie wind blowin' through my head

[Verse 3]
Late at night, lights dancin' in the northern sky
Like the Indian spirits tryin' to show me how to fly
You can see into the future but it may be a mirage
Like a new car sittin' there in your old garage

[Chorus]
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Tryin' to remember what Daddy said

[Verse 4]
There's a place on the prairie where evil and goodness play
Daddy told me all about it but I don't remember what he said
It might be afternoon and it might be the dead of night
But you'll know when you see it 'cause it sure is a hell of a sight

[Chorus]
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
(Prairie wind blowin' through my head)
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
(Tryin' to remember what my Daddy said)
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
(Before too much time took away his head)
Prairie wind blowing through my head
(He said we're gonna go back
And I'll show you what I'm talking about)
Prairie wind blowing through my head

[Outro]
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
(Going back to Cypress River, back to the old farmhouse)
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Prairie wind blowin' through my head
Tryin' to remember what Daddy said
Prairie wind blowin' through my head

[Verse 1]
When your summer days come tumbling down
And you find yourself alone
Then you can come back and be with me
Just close your eyes and I'll be there
Listen to the sound
Of this old heart beating for you

[Chorus]
Yes I'd miss you
But I never want to hold you down
You might say
I'm here for you

[Verse 2]
When the winter comes to your new home
And snowflakes are falling down
Then you can come back and be with me
Just close your eyes and I'll be there
Listen to the sound
Of this old heart beating for you

[Chorus]
Yes I'd miss you
But I never want to hold you down
You might say
I'm here for you

[Bridge]
In the spring, protective arms surrounding you
In the fall, we let you go your way
Happiness I know will always find you
And when it does, I hope that it will stay

[Chorus]
Yes I'd miss you
But I never want to hold you down
You might say
I'm here for you
Yes I'd miss you
But I never want to hold you down
You might say
I'm here for you
I'll always be
Here for you

[Verse 1]
This old guitar ain't mine to keep
I'm just taking care of it now
It's been around for years and years
Just waiting in its old case

[Verse 2]
It's been up and down the country roads
It's brought a tear and a smile
It's seen its share of dreams and hopes
It never went out of style

[Verse 3]
The more I play it, the better it sounds
It cries when I leave it alone
Silently it waits for me
Or someone else I suppose

[Chorus]
This old guitar
This old guitar
This old guitar

[Verse 4]
This old guitar has caught some breaks
But it never searched for gold
It can't be blamed for my mistakes
It only does what it's told

[Verse 5]
It's been a messenger in times of trouble
In times of hope and fear
When I get drunk and seein' double
It jumps behind the wheel and steers

[Verse 6]
This old guitar ain't mine to keep
It's mine to play for a while
This old guitar ain't mine to keep
It's only mine for a while

[Chorus]
This old guitar
This old guitar
This old guitar
This old guitar
This old guitar
This old guitar
This old guitar

[Outro]
This old guitar
This old guitar
This old guitar
This old guitar
This old guitar

[Intro: Neil Young & Ben Keith]
Okay, we're gonna start with a, um, start on an F. Just riding on the F. Maybe that's a good way to start. Or maybe the D. What do you think, Ben?
Uh, the F sounds good...
Just like a—

[Verse 1]
The last time I saw Elvis
He was shootin' at a color TV
The phones were ringing in the pink motel
And the rest is history
He was the king

[Verse 2]
The last time I saw Elvis
He was singin' a gospel song
You could tell he had the feeling
And the whole world sang along
He was the king (He was the king)

[Verse 3]
The last time I saw Elvis
He was up on the silver screen
Pushin' a plow in a black and white movie
And everybody started to scream
'Cause he was the king

[Bridge]
The last time I saw Elvis
It was some kind of Vegas dream
Spotlights flashed on a silver cape
And a blue-haired lady screamed
He was the king

[Verse 4]
The last time I saw Elvis
He was frontin' a three-piece band
Rockin' on the back of a flatbed truck
With an old guitar in his hand
He was the king

[Verse 5]
The last time I saw Elvis

[Verse 6]
The last time I saw Elvis
He was ridin' in a pink Cadillac
Wind was blowin' through his hair
And he never did look back
He was the king

[Verse 7]
Thank you very much

[Verse 8]
The last time I saw Elvis
He was singin' that gospel song
You could tell that he had the feelin'
And the whole world sang along
He was the king (He was the king)
He was the king
He was the king

[Outro: Various band members]
Elvis has left the arena. But he was rockin' while he was gettin' out of there. Ah man, you put me right out of my seat when you said "Thank you very much." I almost stopped playing. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.

[Verse 1]
Was he thinkin' about my country
Or the color of my skin?
Was he thinkin' 'bout my religion
And the way I worshipped him?
Did he create just me in his image
Or every living thing?

[Chorus]
When God made me
When God made me

[Verse 2]
Was he planning only for believers
Or for those who just have faith?
Did he envision all the wars
That were fought in his name?
Did he think there was only one way
To be close to him?

[Chorus]
When God made me
When God made me

[Bridge]
Did he give us the gift of love
To say who we could choose?

[Chorus]
When God made me
When God made me
When God made me
When God made me

[Verse 3]
Did he give me the gift of voice
So some could silence me?
Did he give me the gift of vision
Not knowin' what I might see?
Did he give me the gift of compassion
To help my fellow man?

[Chorus]
When God made me
When God made me
When God made me
When God made me

[Verse 1]
One morning when I was riding in my old pickup truck
A beautiful bluebird came flying down
My eyes caught the color, as it lead me down the road
Dipping and bobbing in the sun

[Chorus]
Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies
Looks like she's always going home
If heaven had a window where the sun came shining through
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flying back to you
Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies
Looks like she's always going home

[Verse 2]
I've never seen that blue before, except in one place
And she's not here with me right now
And just like a lover, I watched her fly away
And that's what I remember now

[Chorus]

[Outro]
If heaven had a window where the sun came shining through
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flying back to you
If heaven had a window where the sun came shining through
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flying home to you

[Chorus]
I'm just a passenger on this old freight train
I ride the boxcar through the night
I doesn't matter where I might get off
I doesn't matter where I lie

[Verse]
I've been to cities, I've been to countries
I've left a lover in many towns
I don't care if I ever get back to
Where I'd already been around
I'm like an eagle, I like to fly high
I'm like a snake, I like to lay low
I'm like a black man, I'm like a white man
Maybe a red man, I don't know

[Chorus]
Two out of work models and a fashion slave
Try to dance away the Michelob night
The bartender poured herself another drink
While two drunks were watching the fight
The champ went down and he got up again
Then he went out like a light
Fighting for the people
But his timing wasn't right
The high rolling people
Taking limos in the neon light
The Las Vegas people
They came to see a Las Vegas fight
Fighting for the people

There's a man in the window with a big cigar
Says everything's for sale
He had a house and a boat and a railroad car
The owner's got to go to jail
He acquired these things from a life of crime
Now he's selling them to make bail
He was ripping off the people
Selling guns to the underground
Living off the people
Skimming the top when there was no one around
Trying to help the people
Lose their ass for a piece of ground
A patch of ground people
He was dealing antiques in a hardware store
But he sure had a lot to hide
He had a back room full of the guns of war
And a ton ammunition besides
Yeah, he walked with a cane
Kept a bolt on the door with five pit bulls inside
Just a warning to the people
In case they might try to break in at night
Protection from the people
He's selling safety in the darkest night
Trying to help the people
Get the drugs to the street all right
Trying to help the people

Well, it's hard to say where a man goes wrong
Might be here and it might be there
What starts out weak might get too strong
If you can't tell foul from fair
But it's hard to judge from an angry throng
Of hands stretched up in the air
Vigilante people
Taking the law into their own hands
The conscientious people
Cracking down on the drug lord and his bands
Government people
Confiscating all the dealer's land
The patch of ground people
A new Rolls Royce, a company car
They were racing down the street
Each one was trying to make it to the gate
Before employees manned the fleet
The trucks full of products for the modern home
Were set to roll out into the street
Of ordinary people
Trying to make their way to work
The downtown people
Some are saints and some are jerks (that's me!)
That's me, everyday people
Stopping for a drink on their way to work
Alcoholic people
Yeah, yeah
Taking it one day at a time

Down on the assembly line
They keep putting the same things out
The people today, they just ain't buying
Nobody can figure it out
They try like hell to build a quality in
They're working hard without a doubt
Ordinary people
But the dollar's what it's all about
Lee Iaccoca people
But the customers are walking out
The nose to the stone people
Yeah, they look but they just don't buy
The patch of ground people
In a dusty town the clock struck high noon
Two men stood face to face
One wore black and one wore white
But of fear there wasn't a trace
A hundred and eighty years later
Two hot rods drag through the very same place
A half million people
They moved in to pick up the pace
A factory full of people
Making parts to go to outer space
A train load of people
They were leaving for another place
Out of town people

Down at the factory they're putting new windows in
The vandals made a mess of things
And the homeless just walked right in
Well, they worked here once and they live here now
But they might work here again
The ordinary people
They're just living in a dream
Hard working people
Just don't know what it means
To give up people
They're just like they used to be
Patch of ground people

Out on the railroad track they're cleaning old number nine
They're scrubbing the boiler down
She really is looking fine (a beauty, that number nine!)
Times'll be different soon they're going to bring her back on line
Ordinary people
They're going to bring the good things back
Hard working people
They put the business back on track
The everyday people
I got faith in the regular kind
Patch of ground people

[Verse]
Shining light, you always showed me
You always guide me, I don't know where I'm going
Show me now, I'm waiting to see you
I'm waiting to feel you around me again
Show me your love, show me your kind love
Share your compassion, let me feel mine
Shed your light all around me
Now that you've found me and I've found you

[Chorus]

[x2]
Shining light, what will you show me now?
What can I bring to you to stand in your glow?
Shining light, when will you show your love?
When can I see you and stand in your glow?
Shed your light, show your love 

[x3]

[Outro]
Shed your light, show your love
Shed your light, shed your light

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, ayy, Jerm, Jerm
Yeah, ah! Ah!

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Ah, I'm the muh'fuckin' greatest, y'all don't know that yet

I'm on my worst behavior (Woo)
Bad side piece with the pertinent flavor (Woo)
Muh'fuckers never loved us
Comin' for your money, muh'fucker don't trust us (Nah)

Already been but I'm back for more
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for
Don't sleep!

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
(Look bitch, don’t try and speak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
(Bitch I don't speak French, look bitch, don't try and speak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac (Oh, hello Q)
Yeah, yeah, said, said

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I'm a maniac, crazy, act insane
Think I might need a cage in fact
Chain reactions happen when I make a pact
A psycho, God made me that
'Cause I fade to black, I gets down like a plane attack
You muh'fuckers just made me laugh
Ha ha, God damnit, this ain’t a drill, do not panic
Let me see how loud you scream (Argh!)
I'm off the map, muh'fuckas start lookin'
But they're never gonna see where I be
She only speak French
Said "Bitch look, don't try and speak around me"
And I don't sleep at all
If you on that bullshit, I ain't gonna be involved
Shit, shit, shit
I could make a million puttin' my lyrics on a tee (Woah)
Fearless, Jet Li, fourth quarter, Gretzky
Take your bitch, Joe Pesci, don't test me
Don't flex if you ain't got shit on me
And, you ain't got shit on me, come get it
(Come get it, come, come get it, come, come)
Jar full of fresh white snow, bag full of unleaded
I don't get enough credit (Get enough credit, woah)
Don't sleep!

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
M-M-M-M-M-M
They done fucked up, huh?
The biggest bezzle, huh?

M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
My weed burnin', my chain glitter
He's self made, Mac Miller my real nigga
Fuck who don't like it, bitch, come see me
Fuck who don't like it, hitta, hitta, hitta
G-G-G-Gettin' money so complicated, I'm the shit, I'm constipated
Yo baby mama, straight G, let me use the crib to mail all the weed
California, Atlanta, white girl in a black Phantom
My top down, mid-December, ride with a big black fat nigga
Krispy Kreme then it's chicken wings, introduce, different things
Jet skis and the best weed, think it's fake? Bitch, test me
I'm jet-lagged, don't need a stylist, pants sag, Jimmy Fallon
Blowin' green in the green room, Def Jam like, "Boss really wildin'"
Yeah, they hate but won't box a nigga
Bought the estate from a boxer nigga
Paranoid, I'm walkin' round
I'm butt naked with my chopper, nigga (Huh)
My chopper, nigga (Huh)
Hahahahaha! I'm butt naked with my chopper, nigga

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Said I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
(Look bitch, don’t try and speak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
(Bitch I don't speak French, look bitch, don't try and speak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac

[Verse 1]
Taking a trip across the USA
Gonna meet a lot of people along the way
From far and Wide
Floating along on the Rio Grande
Coca Cola in my hand
In the promise Land
Living my days in the old jail cell
Somehow life just goes to hell
With one bad hand

[Chorus]
Love is love
Hate is hate
Now is now
And late it late
Truth is fiction
Truth is lies
Strange things happen
When worlds collide
Strange things happen
When worlds collide

[Verse 2]
Cruising down Route 66
Where the guys and gals
Used to get their kicks
In the old days
Running low on the people's fuel
Riding in something that's really cool
On the proud highway
Living my days in an old jail cell
Somehow things just go to hell
When worlds collide

[Chorus]
Black is black
White is white
Wrong is wrong
And wrong is right
Truth is fiction
Truth is lies
Strange things happen
When worlds collide
Strange things happen
When worlds collide

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Strange things happen

[x3]

[Verse 1]
Her engine's running and the fuel is clean
She only uses it cause she's a machine
She don't use much though, just to get around

[Chorus 1]
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)

[Verse 2]
The awesome power of electricity
Stored for you in a massive battery
She don't use much though, that's smart for a car

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Fill her up!

[X4]

[Verse 3]
The world is ready for a whole new game
Some old-timers wanna stay the same
They like to advertise how clean and green they are

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
But she don't listen to what they say
She burned the mess they clean(?) instead
She don't use much though, that's smart for a car

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[X4]

[Verse 5]
She's not the car that she used to be
Keep ready for you, and she's ready for me
Into the future that's her destiny

[Chorus 1]

[X2]

[Chorus]
You can play my guitar
See it where it will go
Send this song to a distant star
While the rhythm explodes
Just singing a song won't change the world

[Verse]
You can ride in my car
See how it rolls
Feel the new energy
As it quietly rolls
Just singing a song won't change the world

[X3]
You can sing about change
While you're making your own
You can be what you try to say
While the big wheel rolls
Just singing a song won't change the world

[X3]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Johnny Magic has a way with metal
Has a way with machines
One day in a garage far away
He met destiny
In the form of a heavy metal Continental
She was born to run on a Proud Highway
Then the whole world started running out of money
People losing their jobs
Right here in Wichita

[Chorus]
Wichita
The home of the heavy metal Continental
Where the Motor-Head Messiah was tuning the system in
Johnny Magic, Johnny Magic
Johnny Magic, Johnny Magic

[Verse 2]
She burst from the garage in a blaze of silence
Disappearing down Douglas at lightning speed
She was gone before the garage door was down

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Wichita
The home of the heavy metal Continental
She was born to run on a Proud Highway
Now she goes long range on domestic green fuel
100 miles per gallon is the Continental Rule
Out on the Kansas two-lane flats near Wichita

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
The Motor-Head Messiah went to Washington
To show them what he'd done
The senators and congressmen came down
In Washington
And they rode in the heavy metal Continental
She was born to run on a Proud Highway
Johnny Magic, Johnny Magic 

[X2]
Wichita
The Motor-Head Messiah was tuning the system in
Wichita (repeats until fade)

[Chorus]
I'm living with war everyday
I'm living with war in my heart everyday
I'm living with war right now

[Verse 1]
And when the dawn breaks I see my fellow man
And on the flat-screen we kill and we're killed again
And when the night falls, I pray for peace
Try to remember peace (visualize)
I join the multitudes
I raise my hand in peace
I never bow to the laws of the thought police
I take a holy vow
To never kill again
To never kill again

[Chorus]
I'm living with war in my heart
I'm living with war in my heart in my mind
I'm living with war right now

[Verse 2]
Don't take no tidal wave
Don't take no mass grave
Don't take no smoking gun
To show how the west was won
But when the curtain falls, I pray for peace
Try to remember peace
In the crowded streets
In the big hotels
In the mosques and the doors of the old museum
I take a holy vow
To never kill again
Try to remember peace

[Bridge]
The rocket's red glare
Bombs bursting in air
Give proof through the night
That our flag is still there

[Chorus]

[x2]
I'm living with war everyday
I'm living with war in my heart everyday
I'm living with what right now

[Chorus 1]
(Cough up the bucks)

[x8]

[Chorus 2]
Where did all the money go
Where did all the cash flow
Where did all the money go

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 3]
(Cough up the bucks)

[x2]
It's all about my car (Cough up the bucks)

[x2]
And my girl
It's all about my world, my world

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Where did all the money go
Where did all the cash flow
Where did all the revenue stay

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 3]
(Cough up the bucks)

[x2]
It's all about my girl (Cough up the bucks)

[x2]
And my dream
It's all about my world, my world

[Chorus 1]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
You know she needs attention
So take her for a ride
(You gotta get behind the wheel) She loves to go around anywhere
(In the morning and drive) Anytime that you decide

[Chorus]
(You gotta get behind the wheel) In the morning and drive
You gotta get behind the wheel

[Verse 2]
You know she loves those long slow curves
So take her for a spin
(You gotta get behind the wheel) She always wants to please you
(In the morning and drive) No matter what shape your in

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 3]
You know she takes a little care
She's always looking good
(You gotta get behind the wheel) Pull over and put the top down
(In the morning and drive) Check out what's under the hood

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
When the day is done
And the sun is sinking low
When you've see the light
When you've been most everywhere

[Bridge]
You go

[x2]
When the traffic's slow
Break lines lined up for miles and miles

[Chorus]
And you know the end is not in sight
You can never take your eyes
Off the road

[Xx2]

[Verse 2]
When you're all alone
And you've been driving through the night

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
She looks so beautiful, with the top down
Let's jump inside and take a trip to town
(Let's hit the road) Let's make some miles and spend a little time
(And go to town) And when we get there we'll stop our only dime

[Chorus]
(Let's hit the road) And go to town

[x2]

[Verse 2]
On the freeway in the middle of the commute
Bumper to bumper in a giant cloud of fumes
From city to city everyone is on the move
(And go to town) Try to find the energy to stay in the groove

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When I'm rolling on those big round wheels
Puts me in heaven that's exactly how I feel
Just jump inside and turn the key
Your satisfaction is guaranteed

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Someone's trying to find the peoples fuel
No fear of failure for that crazy fool

[Outro]
(Let's hit the road)

[Verse 1]
Instead of cursing the darkness
Light a candle for where we're going
There's something ahead, worth fighting for

[Chorus 1]
When the light of time is on us
You will see our moment come
And the living soul inside will carry on

[Chorus 2]
It's a chance to give new meaning to every move we make
In the cavern, in the cave, where we come from

[Verse 2]
When the light of dawn is on us
We will see what we can be
And the ancient ones can sleep an easy sleep
In the hallways of the ages, on the road to history
What we do now will always be with us

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
Instead of cursing the darkness
Light a candle for where we're going
There's something ahead, worth looking for

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]

[x2]
Light a candle in the darkness
So others might see ahead
Light a candle in the darkness, when you go

[Verse 1]
Got a pot belly
It's not too big
Gets in my way
When I'm driving my rig
Driving this country
In a big old rig
Things I've seen
Mean a lot
Friend has a pickup
Drives his kid to school
Then he takes his wife
To beauty school
Now she's doing nails
Going get a job
Got a good teacher
There's a fork in the road ahead
I don't know which way I'm going to turn
There's a fork in the road ahead
About this year
We salute the troops
They're all still there
In a fucking war
It's no good
Whose idea was that?
I've got hope
But you can't eat hope
I'm not done
Not giving up
Not cashing in
Too late

[Chorus]
There's a bailout coming but it's not for me
It's for all those creeps watching tickers on TV
There's a bailout coming but it's not for me

[Verse 2]
I'm a big rock star
My sales have tanked
But I still got you
Thanks
Download this
Sounds like shit
Keep on blogging
Until the power goes out
Your battery's dead
Twist and shout
On the radio
Those were the days
Bring them back

[Chorus]
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you
It's for all those creeps hiding what they do
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you
Bailout coming but it's not for you

[Verse 3]
Got my flat screen
Got it repo would now
They picked it up
Left a hole in the wall
Last Saturday
Missed the Raider's game

[Outro]
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you

[x2]
It's for all those creeps hiding what they do

[Verse 1]
The people have heard the news
The people have spoken
You may not like what they said
But they weren't joking
Way out on the desert sands
Lies a desperate lover
They call her the "Queen of Oil"
So much to discover
Don't need no ad machine
Telling me what I need
Don't need no Madison Avenue war
Don't need no more boxes I can see
Covered in flags but I can't see them on TV

[Chorus]
Don't need no more lies 

[x4]

[Verse 2]
The restless consumer flies
Around the world each day
With such an appetite for taste and grace
People from around the world
Need someone to listen
We're starving and dying from our disease
We need your medicine
How do you pay for war
And leave us dying?
When you could do so much more
You're not even trying
Don't need no TV ad
Telling me how sick I am
Don't want to know how many people are like me
Don't need no dizziness
Don't need no nausea
Don't need no side effects like diarrhea or sexual death

[Chorus]
Don't need no more lies

[x4]

[Verse 2]
The restless consumer lies
Asleep in her hotel
With such an appetite
For anything that sells
A hundred voices from a hundred lands
Need someone to listen
People are dying here and there
They don't see the world the way you do
There's no mission accomplished here
Just death to thousands
A hundred voices from a hundred lands
Cry out in unison
Don't need no terror squad
Don't want no damned Jihad
Blowing themselves away in my hood
But we don't talk to them
So we don't learn from them
Hate don't negotiate with good

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The restless consumer flies
Around the world each day
With such an appetite for efficiency
And pace

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I'm just a believer, babe
And those dreams of mine
You see, they just keep on coming
In a long, long line
Oh yeah, I'm a believer
Like that songbird singing
Whether it's red or blue
Just like those church bells ringing
I'm keeping my faith in you

[Chorus]
(I believe in you)
Oh yeah, I'm a believer
(I believe in you)
Oh yeah, I believe in you

[Verse 2]
And though the seas may rise
Until they do
I keep doing the things I'm doing
And believe in you
I'm making the change
I'm keeping my faith in you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sure is a windy road
That I walk with you
Look how the trees are bending
Their leaves are falling too

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I remember my mama saying
I want to be
On this windy road
For eternity
I'm making the change
I'm keeping my faith in you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh yeah, I'm the believer
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Down on the West coast, they got a sayin'
"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'"
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment
Boy Blue, yeah, you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're falling hard, I push away, I'm feelin' hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, my love

[Chorus]
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move, baby, move, baby, I'm in love
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)

[Post-Chorus]
(Mic-check)
(One, two)
(Two, two)
(Get it, girl)

[Verse 2]
Down on the West coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and Rock 'n' Roll groupies
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo, cariño, boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, my love

[Chorus]
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move, baby, move, baby, I'm in love

[Chorus]
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move, baby, move, baby, I'm in love

[Outro]
I'm in love
I'm in love

[Verse]
I feel your love
I feel your strong love
I feel the patience among conditional love
I feel a strength
I feel your faith in me
I'll never let you down no matter what you do
If you just walk with me and let me walk with you
I'm on this journey I don't wanna walk alone

Walk with me

[x4]

Walk with me
Shine me a light
Walk with me

[x2]

I lost some people I was traveling with
I missed a soul in the old friendship

[Verse 1]
When we go for a little walk
Out on the land
When we're just walking and holding hands

You can take it as a sign of love
When the winds of fate
Keep blowing and we both understand

[Chorus]
Sign of love
It's a sign of love
Sign of love

[X2]

[Verse 2]
When we both have silver hair
And a little less time
But there still are roses on the vine

You can take it as a sign of love
When I look at you
When I'm looking at you for a long, long time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When I first saw you
You were just a girl
And I was a man
While the music played
I watched you dance

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Somewhere in the rays of sunshine, you find the dark
Somehow when you see the spark, it burns your heart
Someone's gonna rescue you and bring you back

I see you standing there, I hear you call
And when you look at me, you don't see it all
Someone's gonna rescue you before you fall

No one can do the things you do
Someone can save you

You're scared of the way it goes sometimes in the night
When it gets the best of you, you put up a fight
Someone's gonna rescue you and make it right

Someone's gonna rescue you

[X3]

[Verse]
When I sing about love and war
I don't really know what I'm saying
I've been in love and I've seen a lot of war
Seen a lot of people praying
They pray to Allah and they prey to the lord
But mostly they pray about love and war
Pray about love and war

I've seen a lot of young men go to war
And leave a lot of young brides waiting
I've watched them try to explain it to their kids
And seen a lot of them failing
They tried to tell them and they tried to explain
Why Daddy won't ever come home again
Daddy won't ever come home again
I said a lot of things that I can't take back
But I don't really know if I want to
There've been songs about love
I sang songs about war
Since the backstreets of Toronto
I sang for justice and I hit a bad chord
But I still try to sing about love and war
Sing about love and war
The saddest thing in the whole wide world
Is to break the heart of your lover
I made a mistake and I did it again
And we struggled to recover
Then I sang in anger, hit another bad chord
But I still try to sing about love and war
I've been in love and I've seen a lot of war
Seen a lot of people praying
They pray to Allah and they prey to the lord
But mostly they pray about love and war
Pray about love and war

[Verse 1]
There's a long highway in your mind
The spirit road that you must find
To get you home to peace again
Where you belong my love lost friend
When you're alone, you cheat yourself
You paint yourself in a dark, dark place
You get your shoes and get your hat
Get out of here, while you still can
There's nothing right that you can say
You keep on talking anyway
And everyone seems to turn on you
There's nothing right that you can ever do

[Chorus]
Spirit road
Spirit road
Spirit road
Spirit road

[Verse 2]
Now you're on that long highway in your mind
The spirit road that you had to find
You're headed home to peace again
Where you belong my love lost friend
You stop to eat, you start to drink
But you don't stop and you don't think
You lost your keys, you're on your knees
You're on your back and looking up in the trees
And the night swirls for a little girl
A speck of dust in the giant world
There's a spirit road that you must find
A long highway in your mind

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
There's a long highway in your mind
The spirit road that you must find
To get you home to peace again
Where you belong my love lost friend
Don't feed that snake that turns on you
You starve it out, that's what you do
And it makes you lie, it makes you cheat
It steals your shoes and cuts your feet
The snake keeps feeding through the night
You lose your soul without a fight
There's nothing right that you can say
You keep on talking anyway
There's a long highway in your mind
(Spirit road, spirit road)
The spirit road that you must find
(Spirit road)
Peace again, peace again
(Spirit road)
A long highway in your mind
The spirit road that you must find
To get you home to peace again
Where you belong my love lost friend
When you're alone, you cheat yourself
You paint yourself in a dark, dark place
Get your hat, get your shoes
Get out of here while you can still choose

[Chorus]

[x2]
When I was a hitchhiker on the road
I had to count on you
But you needed me to ease the load
And for conversation too
Or did you just drive on through

You didn't see me in Toronto
When I first tried out some hash
Smoked through a pen and I'd do it again
But I didn't have the cash
I didn't have the cash

Then I tried amphetamines
And my head was in a glass
Taped underneath the speedometer wires
Of my 48 Buick's dash
But I knew that wouldn't last

Then came California
Where I first saw open water
In the land of opportunity
I knew I was getting hotter
I knew I was getting hotter
But the neon lights
And the endless nights
They took me by surprise
The doctor gave me Valium
But I still couldn't close my eyes
I still couldn't close my eyes

Then came paranoia
And it ran away with me
I couldn't sign my autograph
Or appear on TV
Or see or be seen

Living in the country
Looked good to me
Smoking grass while the summer passed
In a real organic scene
Where everything was green

Then we had a kid and we split apart
I was living on the road
And a little cocaine went a long, long way
To ease that different load
And my head did explode
My head did explode
I thought I was an Aztec
Or a runner in Peru
I would build such beautiful buildings
To house the chosen few
Like an Inca from Peru

Now many years have come and gone
Like friends and enemies
I tried to leave my past behind
But it's catching up with me
It's catching up with me

I don't know how I'm standing here
Living my life
I'm thankful for my children
And my faithful wife

[Verse 1]
Looking for a leader
To bring our country home
Reunite the red white and blue
Before it turns to stone
Looking for somebody
Young enough to take it on
Clean up the corruption
And make the country strong

[Verse 2]
Walking among our people
There's someone who's straight and strong
To lead us from desolation
And a broken world gone wrong
Someone walks among us
And I hope he hears the call
Maybe it's a woman
Or a black man after all

[Verse 3]
Maybe it's Obama
But he thinks that he's too young
Maybe it's Colin Powell
To right what he's done wrong
America has a leader
But he's not in the house
He's walking here among us
And we've got to seek him out

[Verse 4]
Yeah we've got our election
But corruption has a chance
We got to have a clean win
To regain confidence
America is beautiful
But she has an ugly side
We're looking for a leader
In this country far and wide
We're looking for a leader
With the great spirit on his side
Looking for a leader
With the great spirit on his side

[Outro]
Someone walks among us
And I hope he hears the call
And maybe it's a woman
Or a black man after all

[Verse]
One day shots rang across the peaceful valley
God was crying tears that fell like rain
Before the railroad came from Kansas City
And the bullets hit the bison from the train
First shots rang across the peaceful valley
And the white man laid his foot upon the plain

The wagon train rolled through the dusty canyon
The settlers full of wonder as they crossed
A gentle creek where two old oaks were standing
Before the west was won there was a cost
A rain of fire came down upon the wagons
A mother screamed and every soul was lost

Change hit the country like a thunderstorm
Ancient rivers soon began to boil
People rushed like water to California
At first they came for gold and then for oil
Fortunes were made and lost in lifetimes
Mother earth took poison in her soil
An Electra Cruiser coasted towards the exit
And turned on Peaceful Valley Boulevard
"People make the difference" read a billboard
Above a long line of idling cars

Who'll be the one to lead this world
Who'll be the beacon in the night
Who'll be the one to lead this world
Who'll be the beacon in the night
Who'll be the one to lead the nations
And protect God's creations

A polar bear was drifting on an ice floe
Sun beating down from the sky
Politicians gathered for a summit
And came away with nothing to decide
Storms thundered on, his tears of falling rain
A child was born and wondered why

[Chorus]
I feel the rumbling in her ground
I feel the rumbling
I feel the rumbling in her ground
I feel the rumbling

[Verse]
When will I learn how to listen?
When will I learn how to feel?
When will I learn how to give back?

[X2]
When will I learn how to heal?
I can feel the weather changing
I can see it all around, all around
Can't you feel that new wind blowing?
Don't you recognize that sound that sound, that sound?
And the earth is slowly spinning, spinning slowly, slowly changing
I feel something in the air

[Chorus]

[X2]

[Outro]
When will I learn?

[X2]
When will I learn how to give back?

[X2]
When will I learn how to heal?

[Chorus]
I'm a dirty old man
I do what I can
Trying to make a living
I'm a dirty old man

[Verse 1]
I like to get hammered
On Friday night
Sometimes I can't wait
So Monday's alright
It's a battle with the bottle
I'll win it alright
But I lost another round
In the bar last night

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm going to get fired
For drinking on the job
Got caught with the boss' wife
In the parking lot
I'm going to get killed
For doing this again
But I just can't help it
It's under my skin

[Chorus]
I'm a dirty old man
I do what I can
I'm going to get hammered
And do it again

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Got a bag of frozen peas
I use on my knees
I injured from begging
And trying to please
If you believe that
I'm losing my fat
Got a workout program
And a new rubber mat

[Chorus]

I'm a dirty old man

[Outro]
It's a battle with the bottle
I'll win it alright
But I lost another round
In the bar last night
I'm a dirty old man

[Verse]
When you hear that rooster crowing
In the dawn, in the dawn
There's really no way of knowing
What goes on, what goes on
The world is full of questions
Some are answered, some are not
The only faith you're keeping
Is the faith that you still got
I love the sound of laughter
And music in the air
And in the ever after
I know it's always there
A man had many boxes
And he liked them quite a lot
But they would not be opened
Because the value would be shot
Sometimes when I go walking
In the trees, in the trees
That's where I do my praying
In the trees, in the trees
The world is full of answers
Some are right, some are wrong
The one that I believe in
Is a wish in a song

[Outro]
I love to see you smiling
And hear your voice so fair
And in the ever after
I know you're always there

[Verse 1]
Sometimes when I go walking among the tall trees
I feel the light coming down on me
Under moon, under sun, I feel the chosen one
Through the mist, come walking here with me
And the leaves on the ground make a rustling sound
In the wind now blowing in my face
It's that cool wind again, I feel my missing friend
Whose counsel I can never replace

[Chorus]
Show me the way
And I'll follow you today
Show me the way
And I'll follow you today
(Show me the way)
No more darkness, no more wasted time
(Show me the way)
Let me stay here with this heart of mine
And with you I feel no hidden path
No hidden path, no hidden path
No hidden path, no hidden path
No hidden path

[Verse 2]
How you change, how you change
And how you rearrange, everything that touches me
Now you're her, now you're her
She's sleeping here with me, everything that touches me
Ocean sky, sea of blue, let the sand wash over you
Giving all that you can give
Will the Northern lights still play as we walk our distant days?
Giving all that we can give

[Chorus]
Show me the way
And I'll follow you today
Show me the way
And I'll follow you today
(Show me the way)
There's a cold wind blowing through my mind
(Show me the way)
But I'm holding on to the threads of time
And with you I feel no hidden path
No hidden path, no hidden path, no hidden path

[Outro]
Will the Northern lights still play as we walk our distant days?
Ocean sky, sea of blue, let the sun wash over you

[Outro]
Ocean sky, sea of blue, let the sun wash over you

[x3]

[Intro]
Lights (lights)
Camera, acción
Lights (lights)
Camera, acción

[Verse 1]
You say you a bad guy
You-you-you a bad guy
That’s why everyone likes you
They say that you’re so fun
And you’re so cool
They call you Baby Blue
'Cause it’s your favorite color, boy
I’m not like every other little girl
He knows that too

[Chorus]
A-A-A-A-A-And they call you Baby Blue
'Cause it’s your favorite color
A-A-A-A-A-And they call you Baby Boy
Because they like you, oh

[Verse 2]
It’s not a joke how much I like you
I know I played it off, but I lie to you
You say 'Hi', say 'Hi', boo
Everyone knows why I do what I do

[Pre-Chorus]
This is dangerous
I need your kiss to survive
This is hard to resist
I would advise
It’s nice, ice, baby
How much I’m liking you
Stone cold, baby
Rock, rock, baby, throw your money, come and pay me
Rock, rock, baby, throw your money, come and save me
Rock, rock, baby, you don't wanna come and save me?

[Chorus]
Baby Blue
'Cause it’s your favorite color
Baby Blue

[Verse 3]
You’re always so high
You’re such a tough guy
What happened to boy I knew
How come you got so bad
Remember what we had
Remember my Baby Blue

[Chorus]
A-A-A-A-A-And they call you Baby Blue
'Cause it’s your favorite color
A-A-A-A-A-And they call you Baby Boy
Because they like you, oh

[Hook]
'Cause they like you

[Outro]
The city is dangerous
I need your kiss to survive
The city is my dirtiest
I would advise
It’s nice, ice, baby
How much I’m liking you
Stone cold, baby
Rock, rock, baby, throw your money, come and pay me
Rock, rock, baby, throw your money, come and save me
Rock, rock, baby, you don't wanna come and save me
Rock, Baby Blue

[Chorus]
The way, we know the way
We've seen the way, we'll show the way
To get you back home
To the peace where you belong
If you're lost and think you can't be found
We know the way, we've got the way
We'll lead the way to get you back home
To the peace where you belong
The way, we know the way
We've got the way, we'll share the way
To bring you back home
To the peace where you belong

[Verse 1]
So many lost highways used to lead home
But now they seem used up and gone
They sure had the magic when they were first found
But not this road, this road has never been closed
It's still brand new

[Chorus]
The way, we know the way
We've seen the way, we'll show the way
To bring you back home
To the peace where you belong
If you're lost and think you can't be found
We know the way, we've got the way
We'll lead the way to get you back home
To the peace where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, we know the way
To get you back home
To the peace where you belong

[Verse 2]
When faceless and anonymous
Come to beat down your door
And say you're all washed up and done
You can just say they have nothing
In store to touch this soul
Because they just don't know
They just don't know the way

[Chorus]
The way, we know the way
We've seen the way, we'll show the way
To get you back home
To the peace where you belong
The way, we got the way
We know the way, we'll lead the way
To get you back home
To the peace where you belong
If you're lost and think you can't be found
We know the way, we've found the way
We'll share the way to get you back home
To the peace where you belong

[Outro]
The way, we know the way
We've seen the way, we'll show the way
To get you back home
To the peace where you belong

[Verse 1]
Selling papers on the corner
I saw a man yesterday
I asked him if he'd wanna
Tell me what made him this way

[Chorus]
He said, when it's born, it's warm
Then it gathers strength in lies
When it falls, it falls all over you

[Verse 2]
He used to pick his friends
They left him in the end
An easy thing to lose
The right to pick and choose
When it's born, it's warm
Then it gathers strength in lies
When it falls, it falls all over you
He said he left his wife
The back-bone of his life
Another came along
But now I guess she's gone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I think I used to see
That old man on TV
Can you be the same?
It seems like such a shame
When it's born, it's warm
Then it gathers strength in lies
When it falls, it falls all over you
The world he thought he knew
Has better things to do
As I went on my way
I thought I heard him say

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Is my world not falling down?
I'm in pieces on the ground
And my eyes aren't open
And I'm standing on my knees

[Chorus]
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you

[Verse 2]
Turn me up or turn me down
Turn me off or turn me round
I wish I could have met you in a place
Where we both belong

[Chorus]
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you

[Bridge]
Sometimes I feel
Like I'm just a helpless child
Sometimes I feel like a king
But baby, since I have changed
I can't take nothing home

[Verse 3]
City lights at a country fair
Never shine but always glare
If I'm bright enough to see you
You're just too dark to care

[Chorus]
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you

[Outro]
I'll miss you
I'll miss you
I'll miss you
I'll miss you

[Chorus]
All through the lonesome night
I tossed and I turned
Lost in these dreams of you
Since the day I learned
How could you give yourself
To another man
A fool for your love 

[3x]

[Verse]
Look how your eyes have changed
All the love has gone
Where did I lose you babe
What did I do wrong
How could you give yourself
To another man
I'm a fool for your love 

[3x]
Now you won't say goodbye
But you don't want to stay
I never thought that I
Would lose you this way
A fool for your love

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Fool for your love 

[2x]
I hold on your love
I'm just a fool in love with you
I'm a fool, fool for your love 

[3x]

[Verse 1]
Crossing the river in a big old boat
With a dollar bill in my hand
Gonna go fishing in the afternoon
Got a simple plan
Oh yeah, baby

[Chorus]
I got to hold on
I got to be strong
I got to live long
And be with you

[Verse 2]
Lonely nights and lonely days
When i'm not with you
Learned to trust and i learned to give
Found a love that's true
Oh yeah, baby

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Girl it shouldn't be too hard
To live with you
It's really not complicated
Until i get the blues
Come on over and sit right down
Let me take your hand
I got a love gonna fill you up
Take you to the promised land
Oh yeah, baby, oh yeah

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Be with you baby
Be with you baby
I got to be with you babe
Be with you baby, oh alright

[Verse 4]
Lonely nights, lonely days
When i'm not with you babe
Learned to trust and i learned to give
Found a love that's true, babe
Oh yeah, baby

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Every morning got sun to shine
Every day got plenty of time
Every night
There's a moon so fine
There for you, my amber jean

[Verse]
Still some lines
That should get crossed
Still some coins
That might be tossed
Still some love
That hasn't been lost
There for you, my amber jean

[Bridge]
Amber jean, oh, amber jean
Prettiest eyes i've ever seen

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Are you passionate?
Are you living like you talk?
Are you dreaming now
That you're going to the top?
Are you negative
In a world that never stops

[Chorus]
Turning on you?
Turning on me?
Turning on you?

[Verse 2]
Are you loving it?
Can you ever get enough of it?
Is it everything?
A love that never stops

[Chorus]
Coming to you?
Coming to me?
Coming to you?

[Verse 3]
Once I was a soldier, I was fighting in the sky
And the gunfire kept coming back on me
So I dove into the darkness and I let my missiles fly
And they might be the ones that kept you free

Once I was a prisoner, I was riding in a truck
Cleaned up for public display
I looked at those around me and when they looked at me
I let them see my soul that day

Are you scared of it, do you wish that it would stop?
Does it bother you when you hear your spirit talk?
Well I'm right with you
Yes I'm right with you

[Chorus]
It's working on me
It's working on you
It's working on me

[Verse 1]
The Statue of Liberty
Is breathing in the air
Atlantis is waiting down below
Late at night, flashing lights
Are sighted in the air
It's no secret
What everybody knows
It really don't matter much
Which way I go
But remember
To pull over in the storm

[Chorus]

[2x]
Have you seen the evening coconut
Bobbing on the bay?
Standing on
The water's edge of stone
Someone there besides you
To hear the words you say
To show you things
Your eyes have never known

[Bridge]
Evening coconut, evening coconut 

[x5]

[Verse 2]
The Statue of Liberty
Is breathing in the air
While Atlantis
Is waiting down below
Late at night, flashing lights
Are sighted in the air
It's no secret
What everybody knows

[Outro]
Evening coconut 

[x4]

[Verse 1]
If you're looking for me
You'll find me
Resting in the shade
Of the mountains and trees
Beneath the cool summer breeze
And I don't mind if you stay

[Chorus]
Everybody's alone

[x2]

[Verse 2]
People talking to me
Someone saying
That I'm not the same
That's not so easy to be
But when I'll learn to be free
I wonder if I'll miss the pain

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All I want you to know
Is that I love you so much
I can hardly stand it
When everybody's alone

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I told you babe once before
Don't want you hanging
Around my door

[Chorus]
You better find another shoulder
Find another shoulder

[x2]
Cause honey
I don't love you anymore

[Verse 2]
I told you babe, you're no good
Don't want you
Messing up my neighborhood

[Chorus]
You better find another shoulder
Find another shoulder, babe
Find another shoulder
Cause honey
I don't love you anymore

[Chorus]

[x2]
Find another shoulder

[x3]
Cause honey
I don't love you anymore

[Verse]
Try to find
The perfect time
To say something to you
Filled with meaning
Filled with truth
If I could just live my life
As easy as a song
I'd wake up someday
And the pain will all be gone
Help me now I'm sinking fast
I gotta get along
To the Gateway of Love
Gateway Of Love
Background noise
On a changing sky
You'll be making love to me
I still feel you
In my heart's eye
But I'm just a dusty soul
With nothing much to say
Down here in the hay
Bound to stay that way
I've got almost everything
Except that little key
To the Gateway of Love
Gateway of Love
Some will say
Theres a place on high
Where angels rip their wings
And babys learn to fly
Some will say
There's a place on high
But I'd like to stay down here
Try to love someone
Here in this life
Where we watch the bouncing sun
I'd just like to hold her hair
And bring her back to me
At the Gateway of Love
Gateway of Love

[Verse 1]
I got a problem I can't explain
It's hard to solve it, I can't lose face
They all try to help me but I can't see the light

[Verse 2]
Me and my shadow are so in despair
'Cause we keep hurting someone who cares
Every time we talk about it I break out in a cold sweat (Huh)
There must be some way out of here but I can't find it yet

[Bridge]
I got a problem that's so intense
I try to fight it but there's no defense

[Verse 3]
Every time we talk about it I break out in a cold sweat (Huh)
There must be some way out of here but I can't find it yet

[Outro]
I got a problem
I got a problem
I got a problem
I got a problem
Every time we talk about it I break out in a cold sweat

[Verse 1]
A funny thing happened yesterday
I felt the pressure in a brand new way
It kept hitting me from all directions
I got this feeling I was cracking up
My knees were shaking and I couldn't close my eyes
I fought to gain control and make corrections
A funny thing happened yesterday
I felt the pressure in a TV way

[Chorus]
Don't feel, don't feel
Feel pressure from me
Don't feel, don't feel
No pressure from me
Don't feel, don't feel
Feel pressure from me

[Verse 2]
You watch the box and the video jocks
If you could talk that could even be you up there
That's why you need Max Headroom
Too much pressure for peace on earth
Too much trying to get your money's worth
Too much dying
The Eldorado, the Mercedes-Benz
The job security that never ends

[Chorus]
Don't feel, don't feel
Feel pressure from me
Don't feel, don't feel
No pressure from me
Don't feel, don't feel
Feel pressure from me
Don't feel, don't feel
No pressure from me

[Verse 3]
I feel the pressure building every night
One of these days I'm gonna go out like a light
Oh baby
I feel the pressure building every night
One of these days I'm gonna go out like a light

[Verse 1]
I'm just a drifter
I'll stay until you try to tie me down
I'm not a quitter, baby
I'd like to stay and see the whole thing go down
Don't try to tell me
What I gotta do to fit
Don't try to rescue me
I'm going to go with my ship

[Chorus]
What about you, did I ever take a thing from you?
What about me, how do I know that your love is true?
What about you, how can I count on you to count on me?

[Verse 2]
I like to drive my car
If I've got someplace to go
I like to feel the wheel
Put down the top and let it roll
Don't try to fence me in
Don't try to slow me down
Don't try to speed me up
Or tie my feet down to the ground

[Chorus]
What about you, did I ever take a thing from you?
What about me, how do I know that your love is true?
What about you, how can I count on you to count on me?

[Verse 3]
I'm just a drifter
I'll stay until you try to tie me down
Don't try to rescue me
Don't try to rescue me
I like to feel the wheel
I like to feel the wheel
I like to feel the wheel

[Chorus]
When I was a younger man
Got lucky with a rock 'n' roll band
Struck gold in hollywood
All that time I knew I would
Get back to the country
Back where it all began
Get back to the country
Back in the barn again

[Verse]
Now when we hit the road
Big buses and trucks unload
After the curtain falls
Load up and then we all
Get back to the country
Back where it all began
Get back to the country
Back on the road again

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
A lonely man I made myself to be
It's not as bad as some things I have seen
The picture painted here is not a dream
It's only reality the way it seems

[Pre-Chorus]
The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all

[Chorus]
Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's gone

[Verse 2]
I'm riding down this wet road in my old car
The moon is almost full except for star shine
The party ended long before the night
But she made me feel alive and that's all right

[Pre-Chorus]
The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all

[Chorus]
Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all

[Chorus]
Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's gone
I know I said I love you, I know you know it's true
I've got to put the phone down and do what we got to do
One's standing in the aisleway, two more at the door
We've got to get inside there before they kill some more

Time is running out
Let's roll
Time is running out
Let's roll

No time for indecision, we've got to make a move
I hope that we're forgiven for what we've got to do
How this all got started, I'll never understand
I hope someone can fly this thing and get us back to land

Time is running out
Let's roll
Time is running out
Let's roll

No one has the answer, but one thing is true
You've got to turn on evil when it's coming after you
You've got to face it down and when it tries to hide
You've got to go in after it and never be denied
Time is running out
Let's roll

Let's roll for freedom, let's roll for love
We're going after Satan on the wings of a dove
Let's roll for justice, let's roll for truth
Let's not let our children grow up fearful in their youth

Time is running out
Let's roll
Time is running out
Let's roll

[Verse 1]
On the hill where Custer was making his last stand
With the Indians all around and his gun in his hand
Such a wind was blowing that day through the battleground
I could feel it in my hair as I turned towards downtown
Weaving through the buildings, cutting though the streets
Slicing through the culture, piling on the weeks

[Chorus]
Going home, I'm going home
Going home, I'm going home
Going home

[Verse 2]
Dropping in on you, my friend, is just like old times
Said the fool who signed the paper to assorted slimes
It's hard to get blood from a stone but for you I'll give it a try
To provide your accommodations and leave you satisfied
You'd think it was easy to give your life away
To not have to live up to the promises you made

[Chorus]
Going home, I'm going home
Going home, I'm going home
Going home

[Verse 3]
Elusively she cut the phone, moved from cell to cell
Really looking remarkable and obviously doing well
She made a turn on a wooden bridge into the battleground
With a thousand warriors on the ridge, she tried to turn her radio down
Battle drums were pounding all around her car
She saw her clothes were changing into sky and stars

[Chorus]
Going home, I'm going home
Going home, I'm going home
Going home

[Verse 1]
You're picture-perfect blue
Sunbathing under the moon
Stars shining as your bones illuminate
First kiss just like a drug
Under your influence
You take me over, you're the magic in my veins
This must be love

[Chorus]
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

[Verse 2]
No silver or no gold
Could dress me up so good
You're the glitter in the darkness of my world
Just tell me what to do
I'll fall right into you
We're going under cast the spell, just say the word
I feel your love!

[Chorus]
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

[Bridge]
You are the light and I will follow
You let me lose my shadow
You are the sun, the glowing halo
And you keep burning me up with all your love, oh

[Chorus]
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

[Verse 1]
The night was cold
And the wind was howling
I was awaken by the sound
Of hoof beats pounding
Outside the window
On the ground
Our hound dog was growling
Grey Riders flew across my lawn
I looked again
And they all were gone

[Chorus]
That voice was calling
And it cut through the night
Come on boys, let her go

[Verse 2]
Up on a hill
They rode in one long column
They were freezing with the chills
Of the new day dawning
Their hair long and grey
They heard just one voice calling
Grey Riders on the morning sky
The sun made diamonds
Of their road-weary eyes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The night was cold
And the wind was howling
I was awaken by the sound
Of hoof beats pounding
Outside the window, on the ground
Our hound dog was growling
Grey Riders flew across my lawn
I looked again
And they all were gone

[Chorus]

[2x]

[Bridge]
Outside the window, on the ground
Our hound dog was growling
Grey Riders flew across my lawn
I looked again
And they all were gone

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[x2]
Well, hello lonely woman
Won't you take a walk with me
I know a place where we can go
Grab a bite to eat
Hello lonely woman
Are you feeling all right?
Well, you look just like heaven
On a clear clear night
Well, I know you're a lonely woman
And I know what's on your mind
I won't ask you any question
I'm familiar with your kind
I know you need me
Like a river needs rain
I won't ask you any favors
Until I pass this way again

[Verse]
Well, I'm a little light-headed
But my body feels the same
And it feels like falling on down
And find another name
But the sand in my shoes
May trickle to my brain
Well, I ain't got the blues
But something more tame
Oh yeah, something more tame 

[x2]
Well the sound of the drums
Is pounding in my head
Like ten thousand dancers
With bodies full of lead
And I feel like a bull
With an eye-full of red
Well, I ain't got the blues
But something better bred
Oh yeah, something better bred 

[x2]
If tomorrow sees another
Kind of farm I know
Well, the people and the soldiers
And the gypsies groan
It would be like a wonder
And I cannot let it go
Well, I ain't got the blues
But something more slow
Oh yeah, something more slow 

[x2]
But the people in the cities
And the other ones too
Ain't got too many wonders
That they're not tied to
And I can't help but feeling
As I'm wearing straight through
Well, I ain't got the blues
But something more true
Oh yeah, something more true 

[x2]

[Verse 1]
There was an ill wind blowing
Through my hair last night
That froze me in my blue jeans
I couldn't find a light
I know that something's coming
I can feel it in my bones
Thank God for those old country boys
I ain't out here alone
My friends all tell me
I got daggers in my eyes
There's an anger in my heart
That they don't realize
I'm mad as hell at something
That I don't understand
Thank God I'm on the road tonight
With this old hillbilly band

[Chorus]
Thank God I'm on the road tonight
With this old hillbilly band
We may not be good looking
But we sure get out of hand
Was that The Devil's stagecoach
Flying over the Rio Grande?
Thank God I'm on the road tonight
With this old hillbilly band

[Verse 2]
I swear that The Devil
Came visiting me last night
Surrounded my old stagecoach
With his eerie light
He was pounding on my windows
Rattling my wheels
I may not be The Devil
But I know just how he feels

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I'm not the same man
I was a while ago
I've learned some new things
I hope that it shows
I'm free to give my love
But you're not the one
I'm thinking of
So for me
The wheels are turning
Got to keep
The homefires burning
I'll walk these borders
In search of a line
Between young lovers
Who live separate lives

[Chorus]

[x2]
How long can this go on?
I can hear another song
Late at night when I've been drinking
Substitute comes at me winking

[Verse 2]
I'm not the same man
I was a while ago
I've learned some new things
I hope that it shows
I'm free to give my love
But you're not the one
I'm thinking of

[Verse 1]
I am a child, I'll last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
You hold my hand rough up my hair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]
God gave to you, now, you give to me
I'd like to know what you learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color when black is burned?
What is the color?

[Verse 2]
You are a man, you understand
You pick me up and you lay me down again
You make the rules you say what's fair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I am a child, I'll last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm going, I'm going
Going on a downhill slide
I'm going, I'm going
Going on a downhill slide
Things feel so easy
I'm never going to change my mind

[Chorus]
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going

[Verse 2]
Well, ride me babe
Hang on to my hat
Ride me babe
Hang on to my hat
I'll howl like a wolf
Scream like an alley cat

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna change my mind
Don't wanna reel it in
Don't wanna stop this sliding honey
That's the shape I'm in
I'm going, I'm going on a downhill slide
Things feels so easy
I'm never going to change my mind

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Watch me now, watch me now
Going, going, going, going, going

[Verse 1]
When you walk in a room
You hold your head up high
You talk to people eye to eye
There's nothing to hide
You're feeling so complete inside
Your heart feels so complete inside
Because you got love

[Chorus]
If you got love
You know you got it
If you got love
Can't live without it
If you got love
The world you're walking in
Is at your command

[Verse 2]
You're staring in the face of scorn
You know your spirit can't be torn
You're living like a satellite
Maintain your distance through the night
You know that something isn't right
Your heart tells you it's just not right
Because you got love

[Chorus]

[Outro]
If you got love
The world you're walking in
Is at your command
If you got love to share 

[x2]

[Verse 1]
The saddest words of tongue or pen
Are these four words it might have been
We had big dreams
We made big plans
How could they slip
Right through our hands

[Chorus]
Instead of tearing
Our our romance to pieces
Why don't we try
To right what we've done wrong

[Verse 2]
It's not too late
To set things straight
Let's never say
It might have been

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's not too late to set things straight
Let's never say it might have been

[Verse 1]
Someone wants to blow up the planet
Johnny wants to find out why
Johnny did a show in St. Louis
Love came through the sky
Oh yeah, they were camped out
Waiting for the sun to rise
Oh yeah, Johnny sang out
Love into the sky

[Chorus]
Johnny found a place out in Texas
Waiting for him to come
Made himself a reservation
And hope came, in the gun

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah, he was flying
Waiting for the sun to rise
Oh yeah, color by numbers
Waiting for the sun to rise
Johnny did some time in the army
Johnny did a stint in Vietnam
Now he can't forget it
His mind is confused
Slipping from his twisted hand
Oh yeah, he's still back there
With one hand on the gun
Oh yeah, he's still back there
Waiting for the rising sun

[Chorus]
Now Johnny likes to go down the highway
The wind singing in his ears
Right up as most things go whirring by
By day everything looks clear
Oh yeah, Johnny ride on
Gonna find a special home
Oh yeah, down the highway
Looking for the rising sun

[Verse]
I feel like I just woke up
From a bad dream
And it's so good to have you
Sleeping by my side
Although I'm not so sure
If I even know your name
Hold on, baby, hold on
We can go gliding through the air
Far from the jeers and lies
Yeah you are the one
I'm talkin' to this morning
With your mind so fine
And your friendly body lying
In my bungalow with stucco
With glory and sunset spa
Hold on, baby, hold on
It doesn't matter if you're the one
Because we'll know before we're done

[Verse 1]
There's colors on the street
Red, white and blue
People shuffling their feet
People sleeping in their shoes
But there's a warning sign on the road ahead
There's a lot of people saying we'd be better off dead
Don't feel like Satan, but I am to them
So I try to forget it any way I can

[Chorus]
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

[Verse 2]
I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she puts the kid away and she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life, and what she's done to it
There's one more kid that will never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool

[Chorus]
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin'  in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

[Verse 3]
We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler machine gun hand
We got department stores and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people, says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive

[Chorus]
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

[Verse 1]
When you see the golden trigger
Stand before your eyes
By the time you stop to figure
Lady Wingshot flies away

[Chorus]
You are so inviting
And I feel so in tune with you
Your draw is fast as lightning
My eyes are captured by your moves

[Verse 2]
You ride in three-ring splendor
I find I'm rising with the crowd
Too small for you to see me
Although I'm yelling right out loud
When you see the golden trigger
Stand before your eyes
By the time you stop to figure
Lady Wingshot flies away

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
My my, Lady Wingshot
Why can't you slow down in a crowd
Bye bye, Lady Wingshot
Each blow is ringing true and loud

[Chorus]
Here comes another day
And another
I got so many ills and pills
I'm about to smother
Hit 39, leavin' the top 40 behind
Holding on to what I got

[Verse 1]
I tried to tell myself
It doesn't matter
It's just the time of life
Another rung in the ladder
Each morning I
Look in her sky-blue eyes
The downside of life looks better
That old man standing on the corner
He should be proud of those lines on his face
Because either he's been laughing too much
Or feeling too much pain

[Chorus]
Here comes another day
And another
I sure am glad
I got you for a lover
Hit 39, leavin' the top 40 behind
Holding on to what I got

[Verse 2]
That old man standing on the corner
He should be proud
Of those lines on his face
Because either he's
Been smiling too much
Or feeling too much pain

[Chorus]
Here comes another day
And another
I sure am glad
I got you for a lover
Hit 39, I'm leavin' the top 40 behind
Holding on to what I got
Hit 39, leavin' the top 40 behind
Holding on to what I got

[Verse 1]
Back in the days of covered wagons
A man had his own way
Whether talking to a woman
Or crossing the U.S.A
No telephones were ringing
No angry words exchanged
I wish I was back in the saddle now
Riding on the range

[Chorus]
Let your fingers do the walking
Call me up some time
I'm listed under Broken Hearts
Looking for a good time
I can't reach out and touch you
You're hung up on the line
I'm your disconnected number now
And you're a private line

[Verse 2]
Well, I used to be so happy
When you gave good 'phone
I could call you up from anywhere
For a little bit of home
But now my heart is aching
After every call
By the way you talk you'd think
You never gave good 'phone at all

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Live to ride, ride my dream machine
Good conditions sometime are extreme
Running from the daily grind
He was, he was a friend of mine

[Chorus]
Going to take a long, long time
But the stain will fade away
Running from the daily grind
He was, he was a friend of mine

[Verse 2]
Live to ride, ride in the lonesome wind
Cross the line, you can't come back again
Never let a dream machine
Gather dust in your garage

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
Live to ride, ride my dream machine

[Verse 1]
I've got the love art blues
Don't know which one to choose
There's really something to lose
With these love art blues
I went and played too hard
And I lost my mind
Oh, these love art blues
Leave me a heavy one

[Chorus]
My songs are all so long
And my words are all so sad
Why must I choose
Between the best things I ever had

[Verse 2]
I spilled my promise cup
I really don't know why
Now the distance lies
Between you and I

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've got the love art blues
Don't know which one to choose
There's really something to lose
With these love art blues
I went and played too hard

[Verse 1]
If you travel with
Those who know you well
I can recommend
Stay at Love Hotel

[Chorus]
Every room a hallway
Softly sell
Don't get stranded on the lift
Of the Love Hotel
Love Hotel 

[x3]

[Verse 2]
Don't deny yourself
It wants simple truth
Ring for give and take
As the floor and room

[Chorus]
Every room a hallway
Who can tell
Don't get stranded by the lift
Of the Love Hotel
Love Hotel 

[x3]
Every room a hallway
Softly sell
Don't get stranded by the lift
Of the Love Hotel
Love Hotel, Love Hotel

[Verse 1]
Love is a rose but you better not pick it
It only grows when it's on the vine
A handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it
You lose your love when you say the word mine

[Bridge]
I want to see what's never been seen
I want to live that age old dream
Come on, lass, we can go together
Let's take the best right now
Take the best right now

[Verse 2]
I wanna go to an old hoedown
Long ago in a western town
Pick me up but my feet are dragging
Give me a lift and I'll hay your wagon

[Verse 1]
Love is a rose but you better not pick it
It only grows when it's on the vine
A handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it
You lose your love when you say the word mine, mine, mine

[Outro]
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose

[Verse]
Mediterranean
If I could meet you there
Who would ever care
We'll get in right on time
Right on time
Right on time
I dreamed my dream and I
Were walking in the rain
A sudden spirit came
And made us go away
To holiday from fame
Vacation came
Mediterranean

[Verse 1]
We live in a modern world
With communication between boy and girl
Oh Yeah
But under the stars above
We just don't recognize the power of love is free

[Chorus]
We got to change 

[x2]
We got to change how we feel
We got to change 

[x2]

[Verse 2]
When anger has closed the door
My eyes go blind
And I can see inside
I hurt you and you hurt me
With crimes of love
In the first degree
Oh yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We live in a modern world
With communication
Between boy and girl
Oh yeah
But when there are clouds above
We just don't recognize
The power of love is free

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Where did all the feelings go, what about that happy glow?
Was that so long ago when we were first in love?
I didn't feel the change, everything was still the same
And when that moment came, I didn't know

I miss the feeling, I miss the light
But I got faith in something, I'll never give up the fight
Why's it so heavy, this love of mine?
I lost the feeling, I lost the time

[Chorus]
I'd like to shake your hand
Disappointment
Looks like you win again
But this time might be the last

[Verse 2]
Let's say I got a habit, let's say it's hard to break
Let's say we got to do something before it's just too late
I want to get you back, I don't know how to do that
I miss you loving me the way you used to
I'm taking the blame myself for living my life in a shell
And now I'm breaking out, but will you still be there?
Let's say that love is blind, let's say that time is kind
Let's say that it's not over until it's over

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm saving the best for last, let's leave this all in the past
The beauty of loving you is what we've both been through
So now it's up to me to set your spirit free
So you can swing again on our gate

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
New mama's got a son in her eyes
No clouds are in my changing sky
Each morning when I wake up to rise
I'm living in a dreamland

[Verse]
Changing times
Ancient reasons
That turn to lies
Throw them all away
Head in hand
Gift of wonders to understand
And open all the way

[Chorus]
New mama's got a son in her eyes
No clouds are in my changing sky
Each morning when I wake up to rise
I'm living in a dreamland

[Chorus]
Once I was in love
Now it seems that time
Is better spent
Searching than in finding
But no one seems to know

[Verse]
So don't say you lose
Don't say you lose
Don't say you win
And no one else will know
No one else will know
When you're down
You gather strength
To leave the ground
And when you're high
It makes you weak
And you fall back down

[Chorus]
Once I was in love
Now it seems that time
Is better spent
Searching than in finding
But no one seems to know

[Verse 1]
There's plenty of food on the table
Lots of love in the house
The children all do what they're able to do
We got so much to be happy about
I got a woman standing beside me
She really knows how to stand by her man
She's strong and she's soft and she's honest to me
She really helps me to be a good man

[Chorus]
But nothing is perfect in God's perfect plan
Look in the shadow to see
He only gave us the good things so we'd understand
What life without them would be?

[Verse 2]
There's plenty of wheat on the prairies
Lots of coal in the mines
We got soldiers so strong they can bury their dead
And still not go back shooting blind
There's women and men on the workforce
Doing forty hours plus overtime
So the hostages held at the airport
Can come home to something worthwhile

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And there's plenty of food on the table
Lots of love in the house
The children all do what they're able to do
We got so much to be happy about
I got a woman standing beside me
She really knows how to stand by her man
She's strong and she's soft and she's honest to me
It really helps me to be a good man

[Chorus]

[Intro]

So I ain't moving slow

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I see the light
Of a thousand lamps
Burning in your eyes
Still i have to turn away
For you to stay alive

[Chorus]
Because i was born to run
I was born to run
I was born to run
I was born to run run run

[Verse 2]
Security had a hold on me
I had a thousand friends
But reality wasn't told to me
And i found out in the end

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
If you wake up in the morning light
Something doesn't seem
Or know is right
Lay back and let your feeling show
Come on and let the people know

[Chorus]
Oh, that's the price that you pay
Oh, that's the price that you pay

[Bridge]
Just, money
Your baby
Now come on boys

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 2]
Bad news is just an excuse
Get down and
Let yourself keep loose
Go on and live for tomorrow
So much spent today in sorrow

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I am a lonely visitor
I came too late to cause a stir
Though I campaigned all my life
Towards that goal
I hardly slept the night you wept
Our secret's safe and still well kept

[Refrain]
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got soul

[Verse 2]
Traffic cops are all color blind
People steal from their own kind
Evening comes too early for a stroll
Down neon streets the streaker streaks
The speaker speaks but the truth still leaks

[Refrain]
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got it, soul

[Verse 3]
The podium rocks in the crowded waves
The speaker talks of the beautiful saves
That went down long before
He played this role
For the hotel queens and the magazines
Test tube genes and slot machines

[Refrain]
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got it, soul

[Verse 4]
Hospitals have made him cry
But there's always a freeway in his eye
Though his beach just got too crowded for a stroll
Roads stretch out like healthy veins
And wild gift horses strain the reins

[Refrain]
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got soul

[Outro]
I am a lonely visitor
I came too late to cause a stir
Though I campaigned all my life
Towards that goal

[Verse 1]
Hand me an eighth, beam me up and land me in space
I'mma' sit on top of the world and spit on Brandy and Ma$e
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white person trapped in a room with Lauryn Hill
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
Cause I'mma' still be the Madd Rapper
Whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin', makin' fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back striking at Ford
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicodin for?
Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No wonder I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself?

[Verse 2]
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood dripping from it
Ripping your stomach up from the waist up?
You talk a lotta' junk but you was never ill though
I'm strong enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe
Snapped his neck and broke it in half
Waging wars, went on stage
And sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source
The demon is here, I'm steaming this year
I rip Mystikal's voice box out and scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick trick; it's an image, I live it
Give a damn, I don't know what a damn is to give it
Man I don't think this guy is well, I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail
I'll friggin', I'll friggin', lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them stuffs with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and glue your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered a prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itching to leave you disfigured
And stiffer than Chris-stiff-er Reeves
I was teething with strep throat
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beating your knees
And walking through South Central L.A., bleeding in jeans
Flashing back to being shot and repeating the scenes
On how you just got smoked
And if you do live, you'll be too scared to tell it like a Biggie and Pac joke

[Verse 3]
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon, hop out of a Grand Am and land in it hand-standing
Any man planning to battle will get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standing
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this, and you better inhale
Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Came home in a frenzy, pushing a ten speed
Screaming to Aunt Peg with three spokes
Sticking outta my pant leg
Forget a headache, give me a migraine, dammit I like pain
And you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack, you act up and I'm throwing you
Down a flight of steps then I'm throwing you back up them
If they don't like the track, f- them, the rap struck 'em harder
Than getting hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'mma' climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left

[Verse 1]
Come along and say you will
Be the one to change the meaning of the writing on the wall
The lonely politicians are lying in the hall

[Verse 2]
Come along and say you can
Be the one to change this feeling, I'll never understand
Why walk around a sinner with a nail through your hand?

[Bridge]
It's another way to run
It's a lonely weekend and what have you done?
You know you got a reason to run, babe
You know you got a reason to hide, babe

[Verse 1]
Come along and say you will
Be the one to change the meaning of the writing on the wall
The lonely politician is lying in the hall

[Verse 2]
Come along and say you can
Be the one to take this feeling, I'll never understand
Why walk around a sinner with a nail through your hand?

[Verse 1]
On the lake, the deep forbidden lake
The old boats go gliding by
And the leaves are falling from the trees
And landing on the logs and I
See the turtles heading for the bog
And falling off the log
They make the water splash and feeling no backlash
They climb the happy banks

[Verse 2]
On the boats, the old and creaky boats
The shoreline goes gliding by
And the wind that was a dying breeze
Is making the banners fly
See the colors floating on the sky
The pride of the captain's eye
As he glides his slender craft inside
And opens up the door

[Verse 3]
On the coast, the long and tempting coast
The cards on the table lie
And a speech so eloquent in reach
Was made by a passerby
Passing by the way between here and left behind
And it ripples through the crowds
Who run and cast their doubts
In the deep forbidden lake

[Outro]
Yes, it echoes through the crowds
Who run and cast their doubts
In the deep forbidden lake
Wish you told me by and by that my life would come to this
That I'd have to find a way to let things go
That my friends would turn to foes
And my love could come to blows
Then I would have done some things differently

Differently, I would ask you out every night
Differently, and I would make you feel so good
Differently, and appreciate the things that you bring to me, babe
Differently, oh yes I would

Yeah, I know you tried and tried but your signal I just missed
When you said my little girl would soon be gone
Yes I didn't hear you then and it might be too late now
That's another thing I'd do differently

Differently, like trying to make you feel loved every day
Differently, and saying little things to let you know how I feel
Differently, yes I can hear your young voice calling me, babe
Differently, oh yes I can
When I'm away, I call you up
And you don't seem to miss me as much
But I know our love
Is still there in your heart, just differently

Differently, yes, I can hear your young voice calling me, babe
Differently, oh yes I can
Differently, I'd appreciate the things that you bring to me babe, yes I would
Differently, oh come on back to me babe, bring your love back to me
Differently, oh yeah I need your love, I need your love
Differently, yes I can tell you babe, I need your love
Differently, today is a brand new day, yes it is
Differently, got to get your love back, babe, come on now bring it back to me
Differently, turn it around babe, turn it around and bring it back
Differently, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, got to get your love back, come on babe
Differently, yeah I can hear your young voice calling me babe
Differently, come on back to me, come on back, yeah yeah, turn it around
Differently, oh yes I can, yes I can
Differently

[Verse 1]
Well, I came home late one night
And much to my surprise
I was thrown
Right across the kitchen floor
She hit me right between the eyes

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I was out with a friend of mine
We were feeling mighty fine
And we sure was moving fast
And I didn't make it back on time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I had a big tall red
With one of my friends
He was feeling mighty fine
When I came home late that night
She hit me right between the eyes

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 4]
So if you find yourself
In a party mood
Let your conscience be your guide
Don't be like me and let lefty win
Or you'll find yourself outside

[Outro]
Living in the doghouse, doghouse
Doghouse, doghouse
Doghouse, doghouse

[Chorus]
Don't say you love me
That's what she said
Don't say you love me
That's what she said

[Verse 1]
Hey baby, I'm your man
I know I treated you bad, but I'm doin' the best I can
Now is not the time to cash it in
I'm with you babe, I've always been
And I got to tell you baby that our love is strong
And I'm the one, the one that did you wrong

[Chorus]
Don't say you love me
That's what she said
Don't say you love me
That's what she said

[Verse 2]
Hey baby, don't count me out
I still got a lot to give, stick around and find out
I might surprise you with what our love still brings
I'm never quitting you even if you quit me
And I got to tell you baby, our love is strong
And I'm the one, the one that did you wrong

[Chorus]
Don't say you love me
That's what she said
Don't say you love me
That's what she said

[Outro]
Don't say you love me
Don't say you love me
Don't say you love me
Don't say you love me

[Chorus]
Today's the day our younger son
Is going off to war
Fighting in the age old battle
We've sometimes won before
Flags that line old main street
Are blowing in the wind
These must be the flags of freedom flying

[Verse]
Church bells are ringing
As the families stand and wave
Some of them are crying
But the soldiers look so brave
Looking straight ahead
Like they know just where they're going
Past the flags of freedom flyin'
Sister has her headphones on
She hears the music blasting
She sees her brother marchin' by
Their bond is everlasting
Listening to Bob Dylan singing in 1963
Watching the flags of freedom flying
She sees the president speaking
On a Flat-screen TV
In the window of the old appliance store
She turns to see her brother again
But he's already walking past
The flags of freedom flying
Have you seen the flags of freedom?
What color are they now?
Do you think that you believe in yours
More than they do theirs somehow?
When you see the flags of freedom flying

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Give it to me

Got that senile, make a grown man crazy

Baby, give me some yum yum (woo)

Shake what your mamma gave you, misbehave you
I just wanna strip you, dip you, flip you, bubble bathe you
What they do, taste my raindrops, 'kay, boo?
Now what you're willing, what you wanting, what you may do
Completely separated 'til I deeply penetrate it
Then I take it out and wipe it off, eat it, ate it, love it, hate it
Overstated, underrated, everywhere I been
Can you wiggle, wiggle for the D-O-double G again?

[Bridge: Jason Derulo]
Come on, baby, turn around (Turn around, turn around, turn around, yeah)
You're a star, girl, take a bow (Take a bow, take a bow, take a bow, haha, yeah)

[Intro]
I had that little bad bitch with me the other night
She gon ask me why I don't ever go to sleep cause I was up
You know what I told that ho

[Bridge]
I ain't going to sleep until I touch a hundred million
Bitches know its money when we step up in the building
Neck is saying cool but my wrist is saying chillin'
Stuntin' so hard I could hurt a hater feeling

[Verse 1]
Grind hard then you shine hard that's the motto
Shitting on these niggas like I fucking hit the lotto
Who you know fresh from out the hood to a Gallardo
House up on the hill stupid crazy dumb retardo
Y'all know, either going home or going hard doe
You only live once and I'm a ball until I fall ho

[?] all that hatting shit ain't even called for
We just pull up on you haters looking like a car show
Made a hundred grand and I blew it
Made another hundred grand and I ran through it
Every time I get it spend it like its nothing to it
If I see it and I like I'm like Nike I just do it
I just cop it I just drop it 

[?]
Gucci Louis Polo 

[?]
Breitling Rollie Audemar
Fuck it I want all of it
Kobe though I'm balling bitch
Competition calling quick
Addicted to the money I guess I'm a cake-a-holic then

[Bridge]

[Hook]
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich (you heard me ho)
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich (what did you tell that ho?)
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich
All them bitches know its money when we step up in this bitch

[Verse 2]
They say ain't nothing coming to a sleeper but a dream
And I ain't been to sleep since I was fucking seveteen
Money that you've never seen
Graveyard shifting it
Late night getting it
All about the Benjamins
Break the work down let the Pyrex heat up
Hit my youngins off to count the money with my feet up
Let them sleep we up, hating nigga D up
Hustlers hear this shit then bring it back like its the re-up
I ain't going to sleep until I touch a hundred million
They talking about no homicide I say that I'm a kill them
Talking about that blow paper money to the ceiling
Bitch I'm about my mula give a fuck about your feelings
Chill then, ain't no time for cuddling and kissing
Just hustling and 

[?]
You tired just like Michelin
I be up like all night counting my percentages
Trapping all day and serving fiends like this was tennis here

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich like porter
Stared with a dollar turned that to four quarters
I hustle like I got three sons and four daughters
Watching for the D's dipping in the Ford Taurus
I'm porridge, flaming hot
You hating if you say I'm not
I buy that shit you say you got
I hustle I don't play a lot
Dawg I let my swagger do the talking I don't say a lot
Hustle and make it five times back I never save a lot

[Bridge + Hook]

[Outro]
Word up
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich nigga
How do some of you niggas go to sleep dead broke
I don't understand them

You already know
Meek Milly Flamerz

[Verse 1]
Said, "Baby, what you doin' tonight? (Hello)
We could watch the world get ruined tonight," livin' this life
Got you flexin', feelin' colder than ice, let it melt
As we follow all the stupid advice, and I don't usually like (Okay)
To be this honest wit' ya (Honest wit' ya)
I must have lost the picture (Lost the picture)
Gimme a box of swishers, room full of obnoxious bitches (Got you)
Why you lyin' to me? Just grab your ladies
That Mercedes all kinds of roomy, and when the times are gloomy
Hit me up, I can make you feel like that perfect girl you wish you was (Huh?, was)
Givin' you that feelin' like when Christmas come (When Christmas come)
I just take all of my problems, throw 'em in the blunt
Light 'em up and watch 'em float away, ayy (That smoke)

[Pre-Chorus]
Watch 'em float
I can take you anywhere that you wanna go
Can you dream?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Okay, said

Got a shortcut, baby? I'll pass on it, my dick, throw your ass on it (Blaow)
Pass the time, ask for my alibi, tryna tell you I need that (I need that)
Just relax (Just relax)
Put that money in my motherfuckin' hand (In my hand)
Take another pull, goddamn (Goddamn)
Ain't part of the plan, like a car in a van
I'm rollin', I'm feelin' good, I'm golden
My man (My man), let me just do my dance (My dance)
'Cause, motherfucker, this my jam, said this my jam, this my jam (This my mother fuckin' jam)
How many times you 'bout to let them opportunities pass you by?
I used to be a pretty passive guy, since before I was a goddamn mastermind (Uh-huh, woo)
In that castle of mine, I came up in half the time as these lame fucks
You can't rush that greatness, that mansion where my maid lives
Like, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Watch 'em float
I can take you anywhere that you wanna go (That you wanna go)
Can you dream? (Can you dream)
Can you tell me how's it feel?

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Lil' Kim stay on y'all brains
Nothin' ass broads tryin' to come up off my name
And i don't even know these bitches though
Come to think about it, i never even seen em before
Miserable birds, rather see me singing the blues
Walkin' round barefoot, give them my shoes
Let 'em live off me till my bank is bruised
So i fucked up and back in the hood with you
Homegirl, don't believe that song
That bitch is wrong, snakes don't live that long
Quick to leave a bitch in the atlantic ocean
Hypnotize niggas with that honey bee potion
I like fast money, y'alls come in slow motion
Frank left me the formula son, i'mma take it and run
Fall back, what's done is done
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Wait a minute, let me skate up in it
I see your face got the hate up in it
The briefcase got the cake up in it
Call me Lil Wayne,ma' your girl make it rain
These silly rappers don't impress me
I'm eating red snappers on a jet ski
I mean, I gotta giggle, I gotta laugh a little
Mami, I been hot since Monie was in the middle
Nicki Minaj, Lil' Kimberly
When you see the squad, bitches better salute like an assembly
Come on mami, I got dudes that will kill for me
These broke bitches got it in for me
I done did what I had to do
Rep the NY like an apple do
Step to these broads like a Kappa do
Boo, You sold a million, now you half of who?
Get off my dick, kick it bitch

[Intro: Gucci Mane]

See I'm the boss of bosses so please proceed with caution
Jewelry cost a fortune, my financial consultants
My 9 o'clock appointment, smokin' in ma office
Sippin on a latte, the speaker phone I'm talkin' (Hello)
Five thousand dollar jeans a quarter brick is balkin'
Chicken for a feature, but we feel that it's a bargin
The bezzle on my Bentley, wash it off just like a biscuit
Gucci Mane you pussies better bring security
Pitty you don't pitty me boy go join a sorority
So Icey the minority, it's Gucci the priority

Pounds of weed and ecstasy, my jewelry ??? is prejudice

The DEEP WEB TOUR started

Oakland was hard because we didn’t play.  which was weird.  people were mad.  but then someone got married, rather engaged, outside so people got happy again and forgave.  it was the computer’s fault tho

We talked about getting a tour pet.  stefan is unofficially the tour pet

It’s very cool to see people use the DEEP WEB app. people draw dicks and swastikas

In santa barbara, we got to play outside.  i had a burrito for breakfast that morning. it was fun cause fam and i wore backpacks to blend in to the crowd on campus to get there.  someone said “that nigga think he childish gambino”. i did think that

When we get to stop at a hotel,  we call down and tell the concierge to check on our children at 9pm because “we’re going out to a cocktail party and they should be in bed by that time”. and when they go up there, steve and swank (two grown men who are probably smoking blunts and listening to young scooter) are up there. the reaction is always enjoyable.  we’re trying to find an older white couple to come downstairs and tell the concierge for us, to really sell it. but we haven’t found someone willing to yet


“you’re gonna miss every moment of this…of everything.”

Sometimes i feel like i’m already gone/ahead and i’m just vividly remembering everything that’s happening in the moment. fur real. sometimes everything feels too familiar to be just happening for the first time. the shows feel like that sometimes. you can’t understand something totally and enjoy it at the same time, i think. but it’s fun to not know all of it.  everybody wants some magic.  something they can’t quite figure out

Someone put girl scout cookies in the freezer. hot damn

[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1]
Looking at the clock it's about that time
Can I introduce myself?
I been watching you from far,and it's been too long, can I have this song
I just get so mesmerized when you up and against that pole
I just wanna take you home
Who are they to criticize
How you decide to make your money
I will spend every dime on you baby, take it from me
Since I saw you in the corner
Had to let you know I want ya
All these bitches say you bougie
Didn't stop me from approaching
I don't give a fuck, what your reputation is
I just won't repeat this night and do it all over again
These are the thoughts in my mind
Hope you don't think I'm crazy
Just don't ever try to play me
These are rules aI'm engaging
I sit back in the back and wait for the perfect time
Seems you don't have the time
Wish I could re-reverse the time
Pretty little thang, give me love out of a sippy cup
Sit me up, finish up, zip it up, this is lust

[Hook]
Walk up in this bitch said I need that (need that)
Shawty caught my eyes said I need that (need that)
Let me get a feel, man I hope it feel real

Walk up in this bitch said I need that (need that)
Shawty caught my eyes said I need that (need that)
Let me get a feel, man I hope it feel real
I’m the fuckin' real deal, bend over bitch you know the drill

[Verse 2]
Pretty pussy popping put your back into that, hand-stands
Am about to have a heart attack, let me handle that
Can we go somewhere private, show me for a private dance
You been working way too hard, I just think you need a man
I can be your fucking man, we can fuck and do some things
I can make the headboard bang, let me make your clit sing
I'm not tryna be rude
I just wanna see your birthday suit, if it's cool with you
Let me taste, taste your best friend too
Knew you were such a super freak
I could only daydream about it, now it's all reality
I pretend she was you when you make a squirt scene
Am I choking you too hard?
Hope nobody hears you scream
Am a little crazy when it comes to you baby
We can live together, you're my midnight fantasy
I won't let them hurt you
I be right back to the ATM
These are the thought in my conscious can you hear them? (hear them)

[Hook]
Walk up in this bitch said I need that (need that)

[Verse 1]
Oh, street walker in
Cloves, tell me where you
Go, tell me where you
Go...

Tell me where you go
Go...

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Tell me where you
Walk, without moving at all

[Chorus 1]
Oh, what a pretty high note
Where you run to, I'll go glistening
I should never know that
You were far from me, but here in sin

'Cause I want water where it's
Found, but you know
There, there...

[Verse 2]
Oh, tell me where you
Go in the night
Shadows are walking on the walls...

Street walker, where I go
Is all of my fault
Just tell me where you are...

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Tell me where you
Love without leaving at all, and I'd go!

[Chorus 1]
Oh, what a pretty high note
Where you run to, I'll go glistening
I should never know that
You were far from me, but here in sin

'Cause I want water where it's
Found, but you know
If there is water that you'll drown
You'll drown down in it

[Bridge]
Drown in it
Drown in it, it
Drown in it
Drown in it, it

[Chorus 2]
Oh, what a pretty high note
Where you run to, I'll go glistening
I should never know that
You were far from me, but here in sin

'Cause I want water where it's
Found, but you know
If there is water that you'll drown
You'll drown down in it

[Chorus]
Sometimes I think that I know
What love's all about
And when I see the light
I know I'll be all right

[Verse 1]
I've got my friends in the world
I had my friends
When we were boys and girls
And the secrets came unfurled

[Verse 2]
City of brotherly love
Place I call home
Don't turn your back on me
I don't want to be alone
Love lasts forever
Someone is talking to me
Calling my name
Tell me I'm not to blame
I won't be ashamed of love
Philadelphia
City of brotherly love
Brotherly love

[Chorus]
Sometimes I think that I know
What love's all about
And when I see the light
I know I'll be all right

[Chorus 1]
I don't want to bring you down
I don't want to change you
All I want is
Your love again

[Verse 1]
You and I want different things
But we need each other
All I want is
Your love again
Love is always changing faces
Who knows what it means
The whole world is trying to find
The answer to it's dreams
Why should we lose what we got
We could rearrange it
All I want is
Your love again

[Chorus]
I don't want to break your heart
I just want to hold you
All I want is
Your love again

[Verse 2]
You and I knew from the start
Now we got to make it happen
All I need is
Your love again
When you walked into my life
On the heels of a dream
I thought I saw in your eyes
A little bit of me

[Chorus]
I don't want to change your life
I just want to share it
All I want is
Your love again

[Outro]
All I want is
Your love again

[Verse 1]
Good looking Milly's got a gun in her hand
But she don't know how to use it
Sooner or later she'll have to take a stand
And she isn't about to lose it
All the towns people gather around
They've come to see what's going down

[Chorus]
Although no one hears a sound
There's another poor man falling down
Falling down, falling down
Although no one hears a sound
There's another poor man falling down
Falling down, falling down

[Verse 2]
On this lazy shore
Standing at the edge of you
Could those dreams of yours be true
Or did you, did you, did you
Pushed it over the end?
How much time did you spend?
Pushed it over the end
Good looking Milly's into politics now
And things are looking much better

She keeps ten men in her garage
Knitting her fine sweaters
At the end of a weary day
She feels hard and she looks hard

[Chorus]
Although no one hears a sound
There's another poor man falling down
Falling down, falling down
Although no one hears a sound
There's another poor man falling down
Falling down, falling down

[Verse 3]
I came back for more
And found you waiting at the door
And far inside your walls I called
Did you, did you, did you
Pushed it over the end?

How much time did you spend?
Pushed it over the end
How much love did you spend?
Pushed it over the end

[Chorus 1]
It's raining in paradise

[x3]

[Verse 1]
Here come the clouds
There's a big wind blowing through town
The rooster crows
But we're sleeping in past dawn
It's raining in paradise

[x2]

[Chorus 2]
When you chase the sun
Chase it half way around the world
The rainbow comes
When you least expect it to

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
Sun comes up

[x2]

[Chorus 2]
When you chase the sun
Chase it half way around the world
The rainbow comes
When you least expect it to

[x3]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse]
One day a visitor took a trip through my town
We all were dancing till he took his beat away
Come to think of it, he thought of every last detail
Slipped out late one night
Completely out of sight
Left his message etched into my brain
And when the gates are closed on the road of plenty
The fist comes pounding down you feel it everyday
It's hard to really know if you are full or empty
Here it comes again
You think I'm your old friend
But now we're not so easily found
Me and my old corvette, we were flying through the night
Chasing my blonde lover down skyline
She saw the tail lights flash to avoid the crash
It was way too late
When I hit the brakes
And we went spinning with a screeching sound
I was talking to my friend, telling him I lucked out
He smiled at me and said I'm glad you feel that way
And when I wrote that down on a piece of paper
Beneath a garbage heap
Down upon the street
A mariachi band began to play
Up in the gold hotel, the money hits the table
The heavies are all there, that's why the deal goes down
With beautiful women all dressed in diamonds and sable
Down upon the street
Beside a garbage heap
A mariachi band began to play
In Eldorado town there lives a great bullfighter
His eyes are screaming blue, his hair is red as blood
And when the gate goes up, the crowd gets so excited
Then he comes dancing out
Dressed in gold lami
He kills the bull and lives another day

[Chorus]
Run around babe
I'm only losing my mind
Run around babe
Don't try to be
Something you weren't meant to be
If you are not loving me
I'll know it's because
You want to be free
Oh, oh, run around babe

[x2]

[Verse]
When we were young
We left our worries behind
When we were young
Left not to be
The worry is back on me
And it's not hard to see
That that's the way it has to be
Oh, oh, run around babe

[x2]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Down the highway
All across the nation
Trucks are moving rough
We pass the break of day
Sure looks like

[Chorus]
We're all going to rock forever
Rock, rock, rock

[Verse 2]
After midnight you see
The big trucks rolling
Pushing metal on down the super slab
Sure hard to tell from here
Where we are going
Rock, rock, rock
Do it inside, do it outside, baby
Do it over again in the same old way
From now on

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sure looks like
We're all going to rock forever
The way we just keep rolling on and on
Yeah, sure looks like

[Chorus]

[Refrain]
Oh, let it begin
Let it begin
Let it begin
Oh, let it begin
Let it begin
Let it begin

[Verse 1]
Oh, darling
You are the son of an evil man
I know you hate yourself
But you’re nothing like him
And it’s over now
You can pick yourself off the ground
'Cause you’re cool now
You’re nothing like him

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve seen the world
And there’s no heaven and there’s no hell
I’ve seen the world
And there’s no heaven and there’s no hell

[Chorus]
And I believe
That when we die, we die
So let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
And I believe
That when we die, we die
So let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight

[Refrain]
Oh, let it begin
Let it begin
Let it begin
Oh, let it begin
Let it begin
Let it begin

[Verse 2]
Oh, we were a pretty thing
But you’re full of fear
Well, not here
No, never here
You can love them
You can hate them
You never wronged them
So you don’t owe them

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve seen the world
And there’s no heaven and there’s no hell
I’ve seen the world
And there’s no heaven and there’s no hell

[Chorus]
And I believe
That when we die, we die
So let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
And I believe
That when we die, we die
So let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight

[Bridge]
You can love them, you can hate them
You never wronged them, so you don’t owe them
You can love them, you can hate them
You never wronged them, so you don’t owe them
You can love them, you can hate them
You never wronged them, so you don’t owe them
You can love them, you can hate them
You never wronged them, so you don’t owe them

[Chorus]
And I believe
That when we die, we die
So let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
And I believe
That when we die, we die
So let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight

[Verse 1]
I won't apologize
The light shone from in your eyes
It isn't gone
It will soon come back again

[Chorus 1]
Though we go our separate ways
Looking for better days
Sharing our little boy
Who grew from joy back then

[Chorus 2]
And it's all because of that love we knew
That makes the world go round
Separate ways, separate ways

[x2]

[Verse 2]
Me for me, you for you
Happiness is never through
It's only a change of plan
And that is nothing new

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
And it's all because of that love we knew
That makes the world go round
And it's all because of the love we knew
It makes the world go round
Separate ways, separate ways

[x2]

[Verse 1]
There isn't no way I'm going to let the good times go
There isn't no way I'm going to let the good times go
The touch of my woman can soothe my soul
When she makes me feel right that's when the good times roll

[Chorus]
Oh she's a healer to me
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
My blue-eyed woman is a mystery to me
My blue-eyed woman is a mystery to me
The touch of my woman can soothe my soul
When she makes me feel right that's when the good times roll

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Way out on the prairie where the wheat fields grow
Way out on the prairie back where the wheat fields grow
I stop to slap plastic at an Esso station
About a thousand miles from my destination

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
All I got is a broken heart
And I don't try to hide it
When I play my guitar

[Verse 4]
My blue-eyed woman is a healer to me
Without that woman I'm history
My blue-eyed woman is a love ghost
Without that woman I'm toast

[Chorus]

[Outro]
All I got is a broken heart
And I don't try to hide it
When I play my guitar

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
Ahh! I hate you so much right now

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is powerful
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface (beneath the surface)
Consuming (consuming), confusing (confusing)
This lack of self-control, I find so overwhelming (so overwhelming)
Controlling (controlling), I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find the strength within, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence and I'm convinced
That there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is powerful
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
This comfort endlessly has made itself upon me (itself upon me)
Distracting (distracting), reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection (my own reflection)
It's haunting (it's haunting) how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find the strength within, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence and I'm convinced
That there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Raindrops put the rhythm on the pavement
And drip from the blacktop into the basement
Traces of the rain pervade this
To erase your hate and take this from the fakeness

Raindrops put the rhythm on the pavement
And drip from the blacktop into the basement
Traces of the rain pervade this
To erase your hate and take this from the fakeness
Raindrops put the rhythm on the pavement (To find the strength within, my walls are closing in)
And drip from the blacktop into the basement
Traces of the rain pervade this
To erase your hate and take this from the fakeness

Raindrops put the rhythm on the pavement (I've felt this way before, so insecure)
And drip from the blacktop into the basement
Traces of the rain pervade this
To erase your hate and take this from the fakeness

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is powerful
Confusing what is real

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is powerful
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1]
Do I remind you of the pain
That he put you through, girl?
Is that the reason I'm to blame
Before I do it?
Is it because he treated you badly
I always stand accused?
Protecting yourself from somebody else
I'm not who's hurting you, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's killing me, girl, knowing
You compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, no, I can't win

[Chorus]
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes

[Verse 2]
He left a scar across your heart
I understand, girl
Don't let his wrongs tear us apart
'Cause girl, I'm your man
Just because he did, you swear I'm cheating
You think I just don't care
Why must I do time for another man's crime?
Girl, you know that ain't fair

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's killing me, girl, knowing
You compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, no, I can't win

[Chorus]
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes

[Bridge]
I know he did you wrong
But tell me, what does that have to do with me?
Trying to show you something real
Figure out what is going on
Before you look up and I'll be gone

[Chorus]
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do, girl
I love you, and I love you, I love you
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do, girl
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes

[Intro]
Yeah, um...
See, it's situations like this
That cause us playas to get caught up (Truth hurts)
In, um, the truth, yeah, yeah (Truth hurts)
What you been doing, where you been?
I paged you and you ain’t hit me back (Truth hurts)
And I've been calling and I know you see my number on that caller I.D (truth hurts)
Just listen to the words

[Verse 1]
(I got reason to believe that you've been fooling around)
The way you feel, the past you lived
The things you did
It don’t matter to me
For what it’s worth, just don’t lie to me
'Cause that ain’t what I need right now
Baby, everything we built on trust
You're tearing it down
'Cause I know the truth hurts (Truth hurts)

[Chorus]
Tell me the truth now
What you been doing and who you been doing it with (Truth hurts)
Where you been going and how you been putting your thing down (Truth hurts)
Whatever you was working, I hope that it was worth it, baby (Truth hurts)
I got reason to believe that you been fooling around

[Verse 2]
Girl, I'm really trying hard to understand
I want to move on and put it in the past
'Cause you claim that you ain’t doing nothing
Must be my insecurities
It’s got the best of me right now, uh
What I know, I can't hold it inside of me
It’s gon' drive me insane
That's how I know the truth hurts, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell me the truth now
What you been doing and who you been doing it with (Truth hurts)
Where you been going and how you been putting your thing down (truth hurts)
Whatever you was working, I hope that it was worth it, baby (Truth hurts)
I got reason to believe that you been fooling around

[Bridge]
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah (Sing it with me now)
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah (Oh yeah)
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah (I can't hold on)
Truth hurts

[Verse 3]
Now wait a minute
Oh, listen babe (Truth hurts)
The truth is, I've got the secret
I've been keeping from you, baby
'Cause I know that you gonna tear up the place
Punch me in my face
Pull the hot grits out, I think you need to sit down, oh
I've been blaming you when I'm the one that's doing wrong
I'm gonna go on
My guilty conscience is the real reason I wrote this song
Girl, I know the truth hurts, baby

[Chorus]
Tell me the truth now
What you been doing and who you been doing it with (Truth hurts)
Where you been going and how you been putting your thing down (Truth hurts)
Whatever you was working, I hope that it was worth it, baby (Truth hurts)
I got reason to believe that you been fooling around
Tell me the truth now
What you been doing and who you been doing it with (Truth hurts)
Where you been going and how you been putting your thing down (Truth hurts)
Whatever you was working, I hope that it was worth it, baby (Truth hurts)
I got reason to believe that you been fooling around

[Outro]
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

[Verse]
Over here, come slowly
Come slowly to me
I've been waiting
Patient, patiently
I didn't get it, but now I can see

[Outro]
That there's a way out, that there's a way out
That there's a way out, that there's a way out
That there's a way out

[Intro]
C'mon

[Verse 1]
Baby, we could go back to the basics
Trailer park love, wearing them ASICS and gold
I can speak Spanish
You can sing for the neighbors
You've been pretty stupid ever since you got famous

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, wrong side of the tracks, boy
Oh-oh, oh-oh, if only we'd go backward
'Cause nobody does it like you
I like the way that you move
That's why I never go through
With leaving you

[Chorus]
Everybody's saying that you're no good for me
Your friends all swear that you've changed
But I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on, sing our song
And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby
Back to the basics
When you're not wasted, I know you'll see

[Verse 2]
Baby, we could go back to the basics (C'mon)
We were best friends, crazy and shameless in love
You can mow the lawn for money
I can make you playlists
You bought me dimebags
Felt like we were famous

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, best I ever had boy
Oh-oh, oh-oh, can you remember that, boy?
Nobody knew what we knew
We had it figured out, too
Us against the world just
Me and you (Ooh)

[Chorus]
Everybody's saying that you're no good for me
Your friends all swear that you've changed
But I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on, sing our song
And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby
Back to the basics
When you're not wasted, I know you'll see

[Bridge]
We could drive forever, my baby
We could leave it all and never look back
If you wanted heaven, baby
Sit back in my pink Cadillac

[Breakdown]
Everybody's saying that you're no good for me
Your friends all swear that you've changed
But I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on, sing our song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
Everybody's saying that you're no good for me
Your friends all swear that you've changed
But I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on, sing our song
And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby
Back to the basics
When you're not wasted, I know you'll see

[Verse]
All the champs and the heroes
They got a price to pay
They go from sixty to zero
In the split of a hair
They see the face in the window
They feel a shadow out there
They've got the places they can go
They've got the people who stare
They've got to walk in their shoes
They've got to see what they see
They've got the people around them
Getting too much for free
All the pimps and the dealers
All the food they can eat
All the screamers and squealers
When they walk down the street
Yeah
He's just a rich old man
He never cared for anyone
He likes to count his possessions
He's been a miser from penny one
He never cared for his children
Never cared for his wife
Never made anyone happy
That's the way he lived his life
And one day in the sunshine
He got a bolt from the blue
Unloaded all of his possessions
Sold his investments too
And now he lives with the homeless
Owns 900 hospital beds
He prefers to remain nameless
It's publicity he dreads
Yeah
There's a judge in the city
He goes to work every day
Spends his life in the courthouse
Keeps his perspective that way
But I respect his decision
He's got a lot on his mind
He's pretty good with the gavel
A little heavy on the fines
One day there was this minstrel
Who came to court on a charge
That he blew someone's head off
Because his amp was too large
And the song he was singing
Was not for love but for cash
Well, the judge waived the charges
He fingered his mustache
Yeah
Well, there's a clown in a carnival
He rode a painted horse
He came from somewhere out west
He was very funny of course
But that is not what I noticed
It was the incredible force
With which he held his audience
While he rode on his horse
His jokes were not that off-color
His smile was not that sincere
His show was that not that sensational
Reasons for success were not clear
But he still made big money
One day the circus was his
Now he's married to the acrobat
And they're training their kids
Yeah
Now the jailhouse was empty
All the criminals were gone
The gate was left wide open
And a buck and fawn
Were eating grass in the courtyard
When the warden walked in
And took a rifle from the prison guard
And said to him with a grin
To shoot those deer would be stupid, sir
We already got them right here
Why not just lock the gates and keep them
With intimidation and fear?
But the warden pulled the trigger
And those deer hit the ground
He said nobody'll know the difference
And they both looked around
Yeah
Well, the cop made the showdown
He was sure he was right
He had all of the lowdown
From the bank heist last night
His best friend was a robber
And his wife was a thief
All the children were murderers
They couldn't get no relief
The bungalow was surrounded
When a voice loud and clear
Come out with your hands up
Or we're going to blow you out of here
There was a face in the window
Tv cameras rolled
And they cut to the announcer
And the story was told
Yeah
Well, the artist looked at the producer
The producer sat back
He said what we have got here
Is a pretty good track
But we don't have a vocal
And we still don't have a song
If we could get this thing accomplished
Nothing else could go wrong
So he balanced the ashtray
And he picked up the phone
And said send me a songwriter
Who's drifted far from home
And make sure that he's hungry
And make sure he's alone
And send me a cheeseburger
And a new rolling stone
Yeah
Well, the sioux and dakota
They lost all of their land
And now a basketball player
Is trying to lend them a hand
Maybe someday he'll be president
He's quite a popular man
But now the chief has reservations
And the white man has plans
There's opposition in congress
The bill is up against cash
There's really no way of predicting
If it will fly or it will crash
But that's the nature of politics
That's the name of the game
That's how it looks in the tepee
Big winds are blowing again
Yeah
There's still crime in the city
Said the cop on the beat
I don't know if I can stop it
I feel like meat on the street
They paint my car like a target
I take my orders from fools
Meanwhile some kid blows my head off
Well, I play by their rules
So now I'm doing it my way
I took the law in my own hands
Here I am in the alleyway
A wad of cash in my pants
I get paid by a ten year old
He says he looks up to me
There's still crime in the city
But it's good to be free
Yeah
Now I come from a family
That has a broken home
Sometimes I talk to my daddy
On the telephone
When he says that he loves me
I know that he does
But I wish I could see him
Wish I knew where he was
But that's the way all my friends are
Except maybe one or two
Wish I could see him this weekend
Wish I could walk in his shoes
But now I'm doing my own thing
Sometimes I'm good, then I'm bad
Although my home has been broken
It's the best home I ever had
Yeah
Well, I keep getting younger
My life's been funny that way
Before I ever learned to talk
I forgot what to say
I sassed back to my mummy
I sassed back to my teacher
I got thrown out of sunday school
For throwing bibles at the preacher
Then I grew up to be a fireman
I put out every fire in town
Put out everything smoking
But when I put the hose down
The judge sent me to prison
Gave me life without parole
Wish I never put the hose down
Wish I never got old

[Verse 1]
Time for me to show my hand
Let them know just who I am
Because I've been down and back again

[Chorus]
I'm so tired of talking to strangers
Close my eyes and I see the danger
I feel like making some changes

[Chorus]
So tired of talking to strangers
Close my eyes and I see the danger
I feel like making some changes

[Chorus 1]
You can't help nobody
Until you help yourself
You can't help nobody
Until you help yourself
Nobody's going to help you
Better than somebody else

[Chorus 2]
You know a man needs a woman
Right by his side
A man needs a woman
Right by his side
She keeps him warm at night
He keeps her satisfied

[Chorus 3]
Soul of a woman, soul of a man
A perfect combination
Ever since the world began
Soul of a woman
Soul of a woman, soul of a man

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Verse 1]
I don't want to get personal
Why have you put me on the spot?
I don't know how you feel
But for me it's getting hard
Swimming in the deep blue sea
Marching in the big parade

[Chorus]
All I need is a little shade
Standing in the light of love

[x2]

[Verse 2]
Doesn't matter who you are
Or who you're not
All it takes is a little love
To make a handout worth a lot
Swimming in the deep blue sea
Marching in the big parade

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Drowning in the deep blue sea
Drudging in the long parade

[Chorus]
All I need is a little shade
Standing in the light of your love
Standing in the light of love

[x3]

[Chorus]
You can say the soul is gone and the feeling is just not there
Not like it was so long ago

[Verse 1]
On the empty page before you, you can fill in what you care
But try to make it new before you go
Take the simple case of the sarge who can't go back to war
'Cause the hippies tore down everything that he was fighting for
Or the lovers on the blankets that the city turned to whores
With memories of green kissed by the sun

[Chorus]
You can say the soul is gone and close another door
Just be sure that yours is not the one

[Verse 2]
And I'm singing for the stringman who lately lost his wife
There is no dearer friend of mine that I know in this life
On his shoulder rests a violin, for his head where chaos reigns
But his heart can't find a simple way to live with all those things

[Outro]
All those things
All those strings to pull
He's a stringman
All those things

[Verse]
Sweet Joni from Saskatoon
There's a ring for your finger
It looks like the sun
But it feels like the moon
Sweet Joni from Saskatoon
Don't go, don't go too soon

[Bridge]
Who lives in an old hotel
Near the ancient ruins
Only time can tell
Time can tell
Go easy, the doorman said
The floor is slippery
So watch your head
This message read

[Verse]
Sweet Joni from Saskatoon
There's a ring for your finger
It looks like the sun
But it feels like the moon
Sweet Joni from Saskatoon
Don't go, don't go too soon

[Chorus 1]
My brother went to prison
He's in Kingston doing time
He got seven years for selling
What I've been smoking all my life

[Verse 1]
Time off for good behavior
But the boy don't feel too good
Locked behind those steel bars
I don't know if he should
Yeh a few years ago they called me
Back home to get a big award
They also called my brother
But they made him say "My Lord"
They locked me up in a Hall of Fame
And threw away the keys
But when they put my brother away
It really did something to me

[Chorus 2]
Now I'm guilty as hell for saying
"Boy you better go back home"
You know you'll
Get a fair shake there
We're running all alone
When he called me up
From the border
With the Mounties on his tail
I said go back to Canada
We can raise the bail

[Verse 2]
Now I get these letters
From a cell with no TV
He says he's outside one hour
And inside twenty three
Time off for good behavior
But the boy don't feel too good
Locked behind those steel bars
I don't know if he should

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse]
Believe me
When I tell you
That a love true
Isn't hard to find
Because I found mine
And she's so fine
Like a lifeline
From across the sea
None of the neighbors
Remember names
They only see the faces
With destinations still unnamed
It's hard to leave the traces
For someone to follow

[Verse]
The summer ends and the winter winds
Begin to holler all around the bend
We will smile and sail away
This won't be no sadness day
When the winter winds
Greet the trees back there

[Chorus]
We can watch the turbine
Turning in the wind
Up on the ridge line
Before the fog rolls in
Falling leaves in the autumn air
People feeling good everywhere
When the winter winds greet
The trees back there

[Chorus]
We can watch the turbine
Blowing in the wind
Up on the ridge line
Before the fog rolls in
We will smile and sail away
This won't be no sadness day
When the winter winds
Greet the trees back there

[Verse 1]
Preacher went up to the Golden Gate
And met God there
With the glow of love in his flowing hair
I'm dreaming of a time when love and music
Is everywhere
Can you see that time coming?
No my son that time has gone
There's things to do
The world has changed since I first met you
Back when The Band played Rock of Ages
In their prime
And the old juke joint was rocking

[Chorus 1]
Oh Lord there's so much hate
In a world where we're from another place
Show me how to be like you
See no evil, hear no evil
Feel no evil in my heart

[Chorus 2]
In my heart, in my aching heart
In my heart, in my heart
In my old black heart
In my heart, in my heart
In my beating heart

[Verse 2]
Sky had turned a lot of shades of gray
As they walked on
And a gentle rain fell down on them
They found faith in the way things are and
The way things change
And they said goodbye like two old friends
Take me up to the mountains high
Or a building top where the spirits fly
Show me how to be like you
See no evil, feel no evil
Fear no evil in my heart

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
There's a face in the window
Looking back at me
There's a face in the window
I just can't see
That face in the window
Keeps haunting me
I went walking after midnight
Up and down the street
I went walking after midnight
Up and down the street
When I stopped for a smoke
I heard shuffling feet

[Chorus]
Well, I stopped for a smoke
What did I see?
A face in the filter
Looking back at me

[Verse 2]
Ah, listen to me baby
Hear what I have to say
Yeah, listen to me baby
Hear what I have to say
These midnight blues
They won't go away
These midnight blues
Won't go away

[Chorus]
Yeah, I stopped for a smoke
What did I see?
A face in the filter
Looking back at me

[Outro]
I'm walking after midnight
Well, I'm walking after midnight

[Verse 1]
In the morning when you wake up
You've got planes flying in the sky
Flying bombs made to break up
All the lies in your eyes
There's a man says he can put an end to war

[Bridge]
They shot George Wallace down
He'll never walk around
Mines are sleeping in the sea
Blow those bridges down
And burn that jungle down
And kill those Vietnamese

[Refrain]
There's a man says he can put an end to war

[Verse 1]
In the morning when you wake up
You've got planes flying in the sky
Flying bombs made to break up
All the lies in your eyes
There's a man says he can put an end to war

[Chorus 1]
Welcome to the big room
Everything's alright
People, welcome to the big room
Because everything's alright
It's alright
It's alright, It's alright

[Verse 1]
Don't have no cameras in the big room
Too much for one lens to see
Don't allow no cameras in the big room
Too much for one lens to see
It's alright
It's alright, It's alright

[Chorus 2]
There's always tellers in the big room
Every day and every night
There's always tellers in the big room
Every day and every night
It's alright
It's alright, It's alright

[Bridge]
There's always dancing in the big room
Every day and every night
There's always dancing in the big room
Every day and every night
It's alright
It's alright, It's alright

[Chorus 2]
There's always telling in the big room
Every day and every night
There's always telling in the big room
Every day and every night
It's alright
It's alright, It's alright

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, people, welcome to the big room
Everything's alright
People, welcome to the big room
Everything's alright
It's alright
It's alright, It's alright

[Outro]

[x2]
Yeah, people, welcome to the big room
Leave your troubles at the door
People, welcome to the big room
Leave your troubles at the door
It's alright
It's alright, It's alright

[Chorus]
And our days go by
And I never needed you
And our days go by
And I never needed you

[Verse 1]
And I worked so hard
And I killed myself
And you broke my bones
And I sold my soul

[Chorus]
But now days go by
And I never needed you
But now days go by
And I never needed you

[Verse 2]
And I could have been your mother
And I could have been your sister
Be your twin brother
I just wanted to be

[Chorus]
And our days go by
And I never needed you
And our days go by
And I never needed you

[Bridge]
We were just wasting time, we were just wasting time
We were just wasting time, we were just wasting time
We were just wasting time, we were just wasting time

[Chorus]
And our days go by
And I never needed you
And our days go by
And I never needed you
But now days go by
And I never needed you
But now days go by
And I never needed you

[Verse 1]
Well I took you for a walk upon the forest floor
Because I wanted to share some things
But it sure looked to me like you've been there before
It was such a natural thing

[Chorus 1]
You're my girl and you're showing me now
Just how grown up you are
You're my girl
And I'll be letting you go someday

[Chorus 2]
Please don't tell me that you're leaving me just yet
'Cause I know I got to let you go
Please don't tell me that you're saying goodbye
Say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Well I lit a candle on the Fourth of July
But it didn't bring you home to me
You went heading into summer on a natural high
With the world at your feet

[Bridge]
It's your time and you're showing me now
Just how grown up you are
It's your time
And I'll be letting you go someday

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
We went looking for faith on the forest floor
And it showed up everywhere
In the sun and the water and the falling leaves
The falling leaves of time

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Please don't tell me that you're leaving me quite yet
'Cause I know I got to let you go
Please don't tell me that you're saying goodbye

[Intro]
Whoo! And that's how we motherfucking do it!
(Turn it Up. Turn it Up. Turn it Up.)

[Hook]
Sweet Home, Atlanta
On that east side, howdy-do
So if you from that there Atlanta
Then this blunt goes out to you, to you

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Country boy walking, country boy talking
Don't nobody visit these here parts often
That's why we be sparking, see gorillas often
Take a hit and 

[?] a whip, it's smelling like a forest
I remember back when I was staying in apartments
A bad ass kid, jumping off the park bench
Dirty head full of lint from the carpet
Couldn't stay in one spot, I was carsick
Sweet Home!
When I was growing up we didn't have no heat on in the home
So in the winter we just lit heaters for the cold
And in the kitchen was nothing to eat but cereal

[Hook]
Sweet Home, Atlanta
On that east side, howdy-do
So if you from that there Atlanta
Then this blunt goes out to you, to you

[Chorus 1]
When I hold you in my arms
It's a breath of fresh air
When I hold you in my arms
I forget what's out there
All those people with their faces
Walking up the street
They don't have to say a thing
Just look around and you see

[Chorus 2]
New buildings going up
Old buildings coming down
New signs going up
Old signs coming down
You got to hold onto something in this life

[Verse 1]
Well the older generation
They got something to say
But they better say it fast
Or get out of the way
All those gangsters with their crimes
They make it look so good
We've been blowing up the planet
Just like the old neighbourhood

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
If I only had a heart
It would beat all night for you
If I only had a heart
I would cry the whole day through
When I hold you in my arms
It's like a breath of fresh air
When I hold you in my arms
I forget what's out there

[Bridge]
Old heart's going up
Old heart's coming down
My feelings going up
My feelings coming down
You got to hold onto someone in this life

[Chorus 1]
When I hold you in my arms
It's a breath of fresh air
When I hold you in my arms
I forget what's out there

[Verse 1]
I waited for you winterlong
You seem to be where I belong
It's all illusion anyway
If things should ever turn out wrong
And all the love we have is gone
It won't be easy on that day

[Bridge]
Waiting to follow
Through the dreamlight of your way
Is not so easy for me now
Half the time has passed away (Sha-la-la-la)
Things we thought of yesterday (Sha-la-la-la)
Come back now, come back now, whoa-oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Waiting to follow
Through the dreamlight of your way
Is not so easy for me now
Half the time has passed away (Sha-la-la-la)
Things we thought of yesterday (Sha-la-la-la)
Come back now, come back now, whoa-oh

[Outro]
I waited for you winterlong
You seem to be where I belong
I waited for you winterlong
You seem to be where I belong
I waited for you winterlong
You seem to be where I belong

[Verse 1]
Drama is a must
Kinda like a condom when I buss
I'm rotten but I'm polished
I'm a diamond in the rough
From North Cacs
Never could I come off whack
Some of y'all cats is pussys I ain't hung off that
Call your squad get every nigga off the block
Call the cops the SWAT team
All to stop me
I cock these
Y'all niggas is frost cuz you talk a lot
But never strap like a halter top
Y'all are not gangters for God's sake cool it
'For you snooze and pick the wrong nigga to fool with
An you get introduced to two fists, Timbaland boots are mint
And beat to death with a pool stick
I'm through with jokes
I'm through with stupid folks that say they get hanged
Whats the use its hopeless
You fools is smokin
Me loosing focus
It's like a mother fucker drinking juice and chocking
My mood is upset
Your crew is suspect
My unit is some niggas I dare you to fuck with
Plus, I'm the illest as soon as I feel it hittin
You can't fight the feeling revealing mi killah instinct

[Hook]
I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
You willing to die, No
That's why we all gotta live a killer inside yo
Whether it's a tool or I use a knife
If the mood is right concludes your life
I'm bruisin
N I'll take it to any nigga to doubt that
This killa be killed and I ain't even out yet

[Verse 2]
The bigger they come the harder they drop
I give it all that I got
My money couldn't find another artist to rock
Harder I'm cock
Diesel i'm nice
Move like a theif in the night
Sickest Mo'fucker to ever breath on the mic
Is here in the flesh
Sincere when I swear I'm the best
Niggas ain't tryna hear it unless you do it correct
Never losing a step
Never losing respect
You act stupid and step I'll introduce you to death
I'm losing my head
A few screw lose in my neck
I'm not stable
I came real y'all drop fakers
You not able to hang one around your finish
I never draw the line unless you're surrounded in it
Watered down niggas drownin in it
But surrounded by angus
Niggas hold me down and menace
Crash you this major don't take offence please
Blaming your face is a basic instinct

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You 

[?]some shit fucked
Cuz every word I utter is intent you faggot
Fukin with this is like punching cement
I know your type you bluffin with tough talk
You scared to brawl
Never steppin but your mind is running marathons
It's hopeless, I'm focussed, I won't miss
Any fool wanna oppose get your throat slit
You can't call it I'm flawless this shit is so sick
If I learn from my mistakes I wouldn't know shit
Throw fists even if your voice is deep
Niggas suffer from arthritis their joints is weak
North Cacs where the mo'fuckin turf is at
You act bad but you rhyme even worse than that
Yo Funny how tables turn in life
Pay your dues earn your stripes
Never be concerned with ice
Cuz check it out
The more money you pay for it
It's just giving even me more reasons to take this shit
The main event, serving niggas
The way y'all run through these herds with these words is disturbing niggas
So leave it alone
I'm zoned and never leaving my throne
Don't need to play games, I'm in a league of my own
It's Therapist niggas
Dismiss you dick kisses
For you to get bigger your shit is slimmer than stick figures
Faggots can't stand how much love I get
But if you don't bump my shit then suck my dick
I'm takin over
I got what it takes to make it over the top
You tryna test me then stop and think it over
I'm greater than any nigga you feelin the most
Stepped off stage got arrested for stealing the show
Mother fucker

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah cuz I ain't going out yet, Mo'fucka
It's Therapist I got the killah instinct
Nervous Reck he got the killah instict
F

[?] Rich he got the killah instinct
The whole fucking Crash room they got the killah instinct
My man All Mighty he got the killah instinct
My man Dialect he got the killah instinct
The nigga Volatile he got the killah instinct
Omen and Elite them niggas got the killah instinct
It's killah instinct

[Intro: Snoop Dogg and (Mr. Porter)]
Alright I'm ready

Cause my life's worth more than
The money that ya' live and die for
And where I'm from my nigga you get shot
For sellin' out your man when he the reason you got on

You know they say, that gangsters don't live that long
But how can I be here homes if I wasn't real-ly that strong
I pro'ly should be long gone
Tell me (Tell me, tell me, tell me)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Tell me, what does it take to be dangerous
Everytime I look around, the game steady changin'
From coast to coast, rearranging
Them boys out west, we insist to keep it bangin' (Westside)
Ah yeah, we maintaining, burnin' up the charts, we spark, now we blazin'
My young home boy, he amazing
The cookie, rookie, shook him and took him
And now he famous (wow)
Couldn't quite picture that, wonder what he fishin' at
Now ya talkin' bout this and that
But pass that loc, I don't diss no mo'
I make number one hits, you know
Believe me, I make it look easy
You wanna know how to do it, then watch Snoop Deezie

[Hook: Mr. Porter]
Cause my life's worth more than
The money that ya' live and die for
And where I'm from my nigga you get shot
For sellin' out your man when he the reason you got on

You know they say, that gangsters don't live that long
But how can I be here homes if I wasn't real-ly that strong
I pro'ly should be long gone
Tell me (Tell me, tell me, tell me)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, cuz, the game won't wait up
Dismissed all the beef and shook all the haters
And took on the new routine
Started coaching youth football to go straight clean
Like mean Joe Green, I step on the scene
They want an autograph and a picture, you know what I mean? (nah mean?)
I get to 'em, nigga, don't ask why
I'm real to my people, that's just how I ride
Yeah, since I slid in the do', I been at this
Some gangsta mack shit, but I did it with practice
Yeah, yeah, y'all know I get actin'
I live to learn, teach to reach my status
Top of the charts, have heart, have money
To have money, you gotta have heart

[Hook: Mr. Porter]
Cause my life's worth more than
The money that ya' live and die for
And where I'm from my nigga you get shot
For sellin' out your man when he the reason you got on
(I ain't trippin')
You know they say, that gangsters don't live that long
But how can I be here homes if I wasn't real-ly that strong
I pro'ly should be long gone
Tell me (Tell me, tell me, tell me)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
It's been thirteen years, no pain, no tears
Respected by all my peers
No matter where I'm posted at, my hands stay close to that
Ratta da dat dada dadat dadat
And as a matter of fact, no beef on the streets
No black on black. We gon' be all on one track
So I fall in ride or get lost in the pack
It's like that, fo' real, we ain't bluffin'
Right now it's West Coast or nothin'
I'll push that line and in due time
Y'all gon' respect this cause out here, fool, we rhyme
Oh, yeah, we bang, but right now it ain't time
So put away yo' nine, an' fall in line
(Tell 'em why)

[Hook: Mr. Porter] 2x
Cause my life's worth more than
The money that ya' live and die for
And where I'm from my nigga you get shot
For sellin' out your man when he the reason you got on
(I ain't trippin')
You know they say, that gangsters don't live that long
But how can I be here homes if I wasn't real-ly that strong
I pro'ly should be long gone
Tell me (Tell me, tell me, tell me)

[Intro: Mark Wakefield, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' right when I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "why did I try?")
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' right when I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "why did I try?")

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, with Mark Wakefield]
From the thread to the needle, middle-to-end
When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend
The rain then sends dripping an acidic question
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then, with the eyes tightly shut
Lookin' through the rust, and rot and dust
A spot of light floods the floor
And pours itself upon the world of pretend
Then the eyes ease open, and it's dark again

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Wakefield, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' right when I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "why did I try?")
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' right when I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "why did I try?")

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Movin' all around, screamin' of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
And as the wheels go 'round, the sunset creeps
Past the street lamps, cars, chain-links, and concrete
A window then grows and captures the eye
And cries out yellow light as it passes it by
A small black figure sits in front of a box
Inside a box of rock with the needles on top
Nothin' stops in this land of the pain
The same lose, not knowin' they were part of the game
And then, the insides change, but the box stays the same
In shame, shovel up the pieces to the pain
You can try to hide yourself in the world of pretend
But when the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Wakefield, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' right when I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "why did I try?")
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' right when I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "why did I try?")

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda, Mark Wakefield, both]
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back (Afraid of the end)
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back (Afraid of the end)
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back (Afraid of the end)
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back (Afraid of the end)
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

[Outro: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies keep piling up

[BOYS]
We're here in school today to get a perfect education
Yes, we're going up
We're keen to learn the rules and laws that civilization taught us
Yes, we're growing up
Not for ourselves, B
But for the whole world were we born
And we were born in Liverpool
Our teachers say that ignorance will always drag us down
It's like a nagging cough

[SHANTY (thrown away)]
But I can say that looking back
The most important thing I found was sagging off!
Not for the whole world
But for yourself were you born
And you were

[SHANTY and BOYS]
Born in Liverpool

[BOYS]
Not Birmingham
Nor Edinburgh
Not Manchester
Or Sunderland

[SHANTY]
Being born where you were born
Carries with it certain responsibilities

[BOYS]
This school is good for us

[SHANTY]
This school is only good for those
Who want to learn from books

You'll lose your sense of purpose

But we dare not answer back
We're scared of teacher's looks
Not for ourselves
But for the whole world were we born
And we were born in Liverpool

Being born where you were born

[HEADMASTER]
Walk in single file out of the classroom
Down the stairs and into the playground

[BOYS]
Through the school gates
Cross the road, and over the cemetery fence
Down the hill to where the grave-stones
Lie inviting in the sun
Settle down
Settle down
Let the afternoon slip by
Settle down
Settle down
It's the perfect place for a kip

[Shanty falls asleep on a grave-stone and dreams]

[SHANTY]
Kept in confusion
Trapped by illusion
Thinking of speaking my mind
Dreams of the future
Ghosts of the past left behind
Constantly drifting
Endlessly lifting
More weight than one man can bear
Into the future
Ghosts of the past everywhere

[MEN'S Chorus (ghosts)]
You're sleeping amongst us
We're in your dream
Who are you?
Why call us?
What does this mean?
Disturbing our slumber
You move so fast

[SHANTY]
Ghosts of the past
Tossing and turning
Somehow I'm learning
Secrets I'd rather not know
Can't it be simple?
Why does it have to be so?

[MARY DEE (as ghost)]
I ll always be here
I ll never leave you
I ll always be in your mind
Dreams of the future
Ghosts that the past left behind

[WOMEN'S Chorus (Ghosts)]
You're sleeping amongst us
We re in your dream
Who are you?
Why call us?
What does this mean?

Disturbing our slumber
You move so fast

Fighting with the troops
You may call her Sir!

[SHANTY]
And so it was that I had grown
Into a youth uncertain, thrown
Amongst the lions and the lambs
To pass the time we watched the children dance
I used to come here when this place was a crypt
Now the music plays
Oh don't you sometimes wish they'd stick to the script
As the local preacher says
Rain from heaven will blessings bring
Behold the harvest grown. R
Ian from heaven falls down on you
But me, I feel alone

[PREACHER (sympathetically)]
Alone

[SHANTY]
Alone

[PREACHER]
If they won't come to worship
God in a church
Something must be done
We have to instigate a nationwide search
For a way to make it fun
Rain from heaven will blessings bring
Behold the harvest grown

[SHANTY and PREACHER]
Rain from heaven falls down on you

[SHANTY]
But me, I feel alone
Alone
Here now
What am I doing here now?
Hear me
Why do you never hear me?
Why do you never hear me?

[MARY DEE (as half-ghost)]
I'll always be here
I'll never leave you
I'll always be in your mind
Dreams of the future
Ghosts of the past left behind

[WOMEN'S Chorus]
(Ah)

[SHANTY]
Thought I had a vision
Lying in a graveyard
Thought I heard a melody inside
Could it be the future
Speaking with the voice of those who died?
Thought I saw a kingdom
Happiness and laughter
Somewhere for an innocent to play
Is there any justice?
Do these things still happen in this way?

[MARY DEE]
Don't tell him no
It isn't fair
For he was told by those who know
There was love everywhere

[SHANTY]
Love everywhere

[MARY DEE]
Now's the time to tell him
While his mother's crying
Break it to him gently as she weeps
Let him know his father
Will be well looked after, where he sleeps

[Chorus (ghosts)]
He's sleeping amongst us
He's in our dreams
Don't worry. he's with us now

[SHANTY]
Don't say it's so
It isn't fair
For I was told by those who know
There was love everywhere
Alone

[Chorus (mourners)]
Father, Father
Father, Father

[CHIEF MOURNER]
O Father, you have given
Time to your children
You will look after
Those in your care

[WOMEN'S Chorus (mourners)]
We beg you
Look after us
Father, Father

[CHIEF MOURNER]
Father

[WOMEN'S Chorus]
Into the future
In ever-growing circles

[CHIEF MOURNER]
You will be there
And your spirit will keep us moving
In the right direction

[FULL Chorus (mourners)]
(Ah)
O Father, you have given
Time to your children
You will look after
Those in your care
Into the future
In ever-growing circles
You will be there

[CHIEF MOURNER]
And your spirit will keep us moving
In the right direction

[SHANTY]
Hey, wait a minute
You didn't tell me
I fell into a place
I didn't wanna go
It doesn't matter
I swear
I'll never go through another of those things
In my life
You should have warned me Of all the dangers
But maybe there were some things you just didn't know
But you're my father
And surely fathers ought to know about most things
In this life
Don't tell me
I thought you were the best
You were only human
And a lot like all the rest
Like me you were fragile
Not secure
With the fast tide of life
That would speed past your door

[Chorus (mourners)]
Father, Father, Father

[BOYS and Chorus]
Toti mundo nati

[Chorus]
Father
(Ah)

[SHANTY]
I forgive you
Will you forgive me?

[CHIEF MOURNER]
You will be there

[CHIEF MOURNER and Chorus]
And your spirit will keep us moving
In the right direction

[SHANTY]
I know I should be glad of this
For to be thankful is
To know
I hope
That you will still be here
The time is drawing near
For us to know

[MARY DEE (no longer as a ghost)]
I'll always be here
As long as you've got time for me
Whether it's joy or sadness
It doesn't matter
As long as you have time for me
We will be together

[SHANTY]
I know That to be thankful is
Not what I need, but just for right now
It's all I've got
I know that patience is a virtue
But at this time in my life
I need something more
Something in the air
Is slowly drawing us together

[MARY DEE]
Sit tight
Be brave
And believe in something more

[SHANTY]
If I could sit still
It I could be courageous
I have a feeling that there's something
Drawing us inevitably towards it

[MARY DEE]
If you have patience
You needn't wait for ever
This is the story that they tell the children
Who are always asking the question

[SHANTY]
I know Someone is making sense

[MARY DEE]
We have a common sense
(Ah)

[SHANTY and Chorus]
(Ah)

[BOYS]
Father, hear our humble voices
We will praise Thee all our days
Cleanse our sins, release our minds
We will be together

[PREACHER and WOMEN'S Chorus]
Lord, deliver Thy salvation
Unto those that bless Thy name

[FULL Chorus]
Let them live in harmony

[SOLO QUARTET]
With Thy Holy Spirit

[Chorus]
Hosanna, Hosanna
Gloria in excelsis Deo

[MARY DEE and SHANTY]
God in heaven, save Thy thunder
For the enemies of love
Bathe us in Thy holy light
We will live together

[Chorus]
Amen

[Mary Dee's Office]

[WOMEN'S Chorus (office staff)]
Working women at the top
Will it ever stop?
Papers piling up and up
Days go by like Monday, Tuesday
Work until we drop
All the time looking great
Running late
In a state, losing weight
Running late again
And again

[MARY DEE]
Let me have the letter that you typed up yesterday
Did Mr. Fisher send the fax to LA?
Make sure the flowers don't arrive too late
And cancel my appointment at the Squash Club

[WOMEN'S Chorus]
What club?

[MARY DEE]
Squash Club

[WOMEN'S Chorus]
Working women on the go
Will they ever know
What it takes to run the show?
Days go by like lightning
Will it ever slow?
Half the time feeling dead
Over-fed
Aching head
Miss my bed
Over-fed again And again

[MARY DEE]
Did they ever pick up the accountant's resume?
Make sure the car arrives in time for the plane
Get me the details of the takeover bid
And write another letter to the Minister

[WOMEN'S Chorus]
Minister?

[MARY DEE]
The Minister of love

[WOMEN'S Chorus]
Love
(La)

[MARY DEE]
Where's the time for standing still?

[WOMEN'S Chorus]
Holding hands and walking free

[MARY DEE]
Where's the time for you

[MARY DEE and WOMEN'S Chorus]
And me?

[MARY DEE]
Did I sign the letter that you typed up yesterday?
Is Mr. Fisher on the flight to LA?
He's got the details of the takeover bid
And I'll be in a meeting with the Minister

[WOMEN'S Chorus]
Minister, Minister of love
Love

[MARY DEE]
Feeling confusion
Fear of intrusion
Frightened of losing my mind
Dreams of the future
Thoughts of myself left behind

[WOMEN'S Chorus]
Working women at the top

[MARY DEE]
Will I ever stop?
Orders piling up and up

[WOMEN'S Chorus]
Days go by like Thursday, Friday

[MARY DEE]
Always on the go
Part of myself lives inside

[Shanty's office]

[MEN'S Chorus]
When you ask a working man
'Does he ever stop?
Will he make it to the top?
Should he take a break on Sunday?
Work until he drop

[SHANTY]
My early days in school required
A lot of concentration
I was finding out
But now in later years I find
My colleagues here are more inclined
To mess about
My wife at home
Would surely never understand
If I so much as look at someone else

[MEN'S Chorus]
If men had been the faithful sort
It surely would have changed the course of history
Don't ask me who the first man was
That dared to take a mistress
It's a mystery
Your wife at home
Would surely have to understand
If you were ever seen with someone else

[MR. DINGLE]
Oh, no she won't!

[MEN'S Chorus]
You wouldn't dare!

[SHANTY]
Oh, yes I would!

[MR, DINGLE]
Oh, no you don't!

[MEN'S Chorus]
All things matrimonial
Carry with them certain responsibilities

[SHANTY and MR. DINGLE]
(Ah)
Carry with them certain responsibilities

[MR. DINGLE]
Let's find ourselves a little hostelry
Where you can sit and have a drink on me
We'll get a chance
To talk about anyone who bothers us
There's so much more to life than meets the eye
It's quite enough to make a throat feel dry
So let's repair
To where no-one else would dare to bother us
Let's have a drink
While we think what to do
And while we think
I'll accept a little drink from you
If everybody took a serious view of life
We all would feel the same as you
But, as it is
We don't, so it isn't going to  bother us
Let's have a drink
While we think what to do
And while we think
I'll accept a little drink from you

[MARY DEE]
Part of myself grows inside

[Mary Dee and Shanty's home]

[MARY DEE (alone in bedroom)]
The world you're coming into
Is no easy place to enter
Every day is haunted
By the echoes of the past
Funny thoughts and wild; wild dreams
Will find their way into your mind
The clouds that hang above us
May be full of rain and thunder
But in time they slide away
To find the sun still there
Lazy days and wild. wild flowers
Will bring some joy into your heart
And I will always love you
I'll welcome you into this world

[MARY DEE and BOY SOLO]
You-re mine and I will love you

[SHANTY]
Where-s my dinner?
I've been working hard all day
And a man can work up quite an appetite that way
What's for dinner?
Something nourishing and hot?
I could tackle quite a lot of you know what
And all I've got to say to you is 'Why no dinner?
I've got nothing on my plate
It's expected of a mate
Why'd 'ya have to make me wait?
Where's my

[MARY DEE]
This is the way we put out the candle
Farewell to childhood
Deep in the wild wood a fire goes out
And what are we left with
Now we are grown up?

[SHANTY]
This is the way we pull up the anchor
Goodbye to romance
Out on the ocean a good ship is lost
And what are we left with
Now we are grown Up?

[MARY DEE]
Time to be thinking of real life feelings
I must get on

[SHANTY]
Time to be buying those little trinkets
I can't afford
Lord knows
I want to give her the best
But where will
I find the rest of the cash?

[MARY DEE]
It's one mad dash
To fame and fortune
The cymbals clash
And then you're gone

[SHANTY]
So what are my chances
Of getting promotion?
The way things are going
It doesn't look good

[MARY DEE]
What good is complaining
It's getting you nowhere
And I'm in the middle of your whirlwind
In the eye of your storm

[SHANTY]
Let's not argue

[MARY DEE]
Spare me your excuses

[SHANTY]
No excuses

[MARY DEE]
Pardon my anger

[SHANTY]
Why are you driving me so hard?

[MARY DEE]
I can't believe what I'm hearing

[SHANTY]
You didn't cook any dinner

[MARY DEE]
I'm not a slave
I work for a living
I can command the respect of my peers
Where did you go?
You were out with the boys

[SHANTY]
So what if I went for a drink?
You'd think to listen to you
It was some sort of crime

[MARY DEE]
I needed someone to talk to
But all I could find was myself
If you were the same man I married
You'd know that your woman needs love

[SHANTY]
And what about me?
I suppose I don't matter
I'm not even sure
If you ever loved me

[MARY DEE]
Right!
That's it!
I'm off!
Oh, and by the way...you're about to become a father

[She rushes our into the street]

[Chorus]
Stop
Wait
Hold on
Hold on to life
Stay

[Hospital]

[NURSE]
Do you know who you are
As you lie there sleeping?
Take the time to rest your troubled head
I will watch over you till the moment you awake
Can you hear what I say
As you lie there sleeping?
When misfortunes crowd into your day
And the dark side of life
Has become too much to bear
I will stay by your side
Though we don't yet know if there's something wrong
You were brought in from the street
And a witness said you gave a shout
As you fell down at his feet
We are running tests
And soon the results will be known
But I feel I have to warn you
There may be complications
But we don't yet know if your child is in danger
We shall have to wait and see
In the meantime
There is nothing more for you to do
But sleep

[BOYS]
Ghosts of the past left behind

[MEN'S Chorus (ghosts)]
You're sleeping
Amongst us
We're in your dream

[NURSE]
You're dreaming. try to rest, my child

[MEN'S Chorus (ghosts)]
You called us
We heard you
And we are here

[NURSE]
To save your child you must be still

[MEN'S Chorus (ghosts)]
We're ready to listen
To what you ask

[NURSE]
Go to sleep

[WOMEN'S Chorus (ghosts)]
You're crossing
The water
The tide is strong

[MARY DEE]
No!

[WOMEN'S Chorus (ghosts)]
Your child is drawn to us
Into our throng

[SHANTY]
No!

[FULL Chorus (ghosts)]
This child is
Most welcome
Soon one of us

[MARY DEE]
No, I tell you!
You'll never get through
I'll never let you
No-one is stealing this child
I'm not afraid of Ghosts that the past left behind

[SHANTY]
Let her recover
Then let me love her
Until we run out of time
And in the future
I will promise to be the man
She had in mind

[NURSE]
Be still
Be calm
Your child is safe

[MARY DEE]
Do we live in a world
With an uncertain future
Where a man is unsure of his fate?
Will we come to our senses
Be fair to each other?
Can we turn it around
Before it's too late?
Do I know that we have the answer?
Yes, I know now We are together
So we must bear in mind
That the pages are turning
And the sand will run out of the glass
In the heat of the battle
We will drive out the demons
And we'll carry the day
For we must save the child

[MARY DEE and NURSE]
(Ah)

[MARY DEE and SHANTY]
We have come to our senses
We are part of each other
And we'll carry the day
For we must save the child

[Chorus]
Do you know that you have the answer?

[MARY DEE and SHANTY]
Yes, we know now

[Chorus]
We know now

[MARY DEE and SHANTY]
We know now
We are together

[SHANTY]
And so it was that you were born
Into this world one winter morning
With a childish innocence you smiled at me
And I was born again

[BOY SOLO]
Non nobis solum
Sed toti mundo

[BOYS' CHOIR]
Nati
Mundo nati

[BOY SOLO]
Toti mundo nati

[MEN'S Chorus]
God is good
And He will be our savior
All we need
Is in His power to give us
Let the light that lies within
His heart
Illuminate our being

[FULL Chorus]
God is good
And with this thought to guide us
We will live
In joyful contemplation
Let the love that lives within your heart
Illuminate your being

[PREACHER]
What people want is a family life
The strength of a home and a moat round the castle
Pull up the drawbridge
Staying at home with the family
All people want is a family life
Sometimes they find that it isn't so easy
People can argue
Life can be hard on a family

[BASSES]
Mum's in the kitchen, she won't speak to Dad

[ALTOS]
Uncle's ashamed of the good time he had

[TENORS]
Brothers and sisters are lifting the roof
With the music they play all night

[PREACHER]
But people still want a family life
Nothing replaces the love and affection
Pull up the drawbridge
Tempers are frayed, but it's like that

[ALTOS]
Don't be dismayed if it's like that

[BASSES]
Like that

[PREACHER]
You're not obeyed but you like that -family life

[BOYS and ALTOS]
God is good
In Him we'll live for ever
Satisfied
Inside His grace and glory

[FULL Chorus]
Safe and sound
In His eternal love
We have found salvation

[NURSE]
Dad's In the garden, he won't speak to M

[MARY DEE]
Mother

[NURSE]
Uncle's in bed with a pain in his

[SHANTY]
The Devil is evil

[PREACHER]
And God is good

[MARY DEE]
The Devil is evil

[SHANTY]
With a D

[MARY DEE]
And God is good

[SHANTY]
Without an O

[MARY DEE and NURSE]
God is good without an O

[SHANTY and PREACHER]
0

[MARY DEE and NURSE]
And so we are grateful for harmony
For we will be faithful

[SHANTY and PREACHER]
Eternally

[MARY DEE, NURSE, SHANTY and PREACHER]
(Ah)

[FULL Chorus]
(Ah)
God is good
The universal savior
Trust in Him
To lead us through the darkness
Live in love and when the battle's won

[MARY DEE and NURSE]
Live in peace

[SHANTY and PREACHER]
Live in peace

[FULL Chorus]
Live in peace for ever

[SOLO QUARTET]
Live in peace

ALL Live in peace together

[SHANTY]
So on and on the story goes
From day to day throughout our lives

[MARY DEE]
What can we do
That's how it grows
I am with you

[MARY DEE and SHANTY]
Our love survives

[Verse 1]
After leavin' my apartment
I feel this cold inside me
It howls away all through the market
It calls your name
Hoh oh-oh
Hoh oh-oh

[Verse 2]
On my way to your apartment
I write for fear of silence
You carved a boat to sail my shadow
Now I walk alone
Hoh oh-oh oh
Alright, alri-i-ight
Ooh

[Chorus]
I hit the sidewalk
And this is how it starts
Hide in a raincoat
When things are fallin' apart

[Verse 3]
After leavin' your apartment
I hit the coast by nightfall
So sure to keep you dreamin'
You understood
Oh, I know you understood
Yes sir, it shows I was no good
Ah, ah, ah
Alright, alri-i-ight

[Chorus]
I hit the sidewalk
And this is how it starts
Hide in a raincoat
When things are fallin' apart

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause sooner or later
This is bound to stop
Come on, let's savor
What we're falling for

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
After leavin' your apartment
I hear the coa...

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Yo, yo, forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame, puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away, if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You like to think you're never wrong)
You have to act like you're someone
(You have to act like you're someone)

You want someone to hurt like you
(You want someone to hurt like you)
You want to share what you've been through
You live what you've learned

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You love the things I say I do
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you
You take away, when I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You like to think you're never wrong)
You have to act like you're someone
(You have to act like you're someone)

You want someone to hurt like you
(You want someone to hurt like you)
You want to share what you've been through
You live what you've learned

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Yo, yo, forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame, puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame, puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You like to think you're never wrong)
You have to act like you're someone
(You have to act like you're someone)

You want someone to hurt like you
(You want someone to hurt like you)
You want to share what you've been through

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You like to think you're never wrong)
You have to act like you're someone
(You have to act like you're someone)

You want someone to hurt like you
(You want someone to hurt like you)
You want to share what you've been through
You live what you've learned

[Chali 2na]
Yo, Mike
This is Chali 2na, w’sup, man?
I’m just trying to catch up with you, man
So we can go ahead and get this song on the roll, with a pot-n-a-d
Call me back, peace

[Intro: Stephen Richards & Mike Shinoda]
When I look into your eyes
There's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes
Staring back at me

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I've lied to you, this is the last smile
That I’ll fake for the sake of being with you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
For the sake of being with you
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
En ohw elpoep eht neve
Neve trapa sllaf gnihtyreve

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I've tried, like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

[Bridge: Stephen Richards with Chester Bennington]
Reverse psychology is failing miserably
It's so hard to be left all alone
Telling you is the only chance for me
There's nothing left but to turn and face you

When I look into your eyes
There's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes
Staring back at me, asking why

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Stephen Richards]
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me
Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

[Intro]
Tell 'em again, uh huh!
Word to the world
Word up, New York
Word up, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Uptown, Queens
Make noise!
Staten Island, keep whylin'
Word up (woo!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah NYC y'all

[Verse 1]
Steady bouncing in jeeps on these New York streets
Recognize the elite, what we did with these beats
Yo your town wouldn't eat, if New York didn't speak
Don't front with the heat, make me come with the fleet
New York is complete, all concrete
The center of the world, where all people meet
I'm keeping this style simple, to make ends meet
I could jump out of a window, and land on both feet
New York City is always ruling, reach and teach and always schooling
No I'm not fooling, crowd is not booing
Original MC'ing, that's what I'm doing

[Chorus + Hook]
New York, just so ya don't forget
New York, home of the Yankees and Mets
New York, something you have to see
It's the place to be, it's the place for me
That's.. tell 'em again..uh huh..yeah..that's right..word..word

[Verse 2]
Now you could shout your clique, and shout your town
But it's time we shout New York, hold it down!
You wanna see latinos, yo that's Boogie down
African-Americans, yo that's Uptown
Jamaicans, Haitians that's Brooklyn bound
Run up to Queens, take a good look around
Lower Manhattan all the way out to Staten
New York is the birth of DJ'in and rappin'

[Hook]
That's.. yeah yeah.. tell em again.. word word word.. uh huh.. yo yo yeah

[Verse 3]
Check it!
Gun clap, and cops, cracks and rocks
Road blocks, routine traffic stops
But that raw Hip-Hop it's ova hear
You could check my city grammar, it's cold and clear
What we gave the world, saved the world
Before hip-hop, pop enslaved the world
But we freed ourselves with the help of Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, and Flash did work
This is the reason we respect these people
Cause when they was doing it, Hip-Hop was illegal
Now we all legal, and heads wanna floss
They forgot hip-hop, and all the lives that was lost
You see the way they dress, and the way they talk
They claim they da best, but that's all New York
Imma shout it to the world, the truth is out, NY #1, and we in the house
That's...

[Hook]
These niggas ain't shit, baby, we are
And you might catch me with a hundred xans, tar
And I'm high as fuck, plus I'm shining, star
Baby, we are, baby, we are

[Verse 1]
I'm a coach, I keep a red flag
2012 cat, Big copped the red Jag
And I be in the coochie with Lil' Mikey and Big Smash
And I promise you can't stare at my jewelry, it's like a flash
You square like a graduation cap
And I guess I'm on a Six Flags' ride, cause I'm strapped
And the house is very large, you can spot it on the map
And the racks so very big, so we keep 'em in the knap-
Sack, I am not wack
Please bring it back like I sent you to go get it
But don't come quickly like I sent you 'round the city
And if a nigga play he get beats, Nitti
Ugh

[Bridge 1]
And I've been thinking about a whole lot of money
Which is the opposite of what you thinking, which is a whole lot of nothing
And y'all niggas doing a whole lot of fronting
But when I'm gunning, man, you know I do a whole lot of bunning

[Hook]
These niggas ain't shit, baby, we are
And you might catch me with a hundred xans, tar
And I'm high as fuck, plus I'm shining, star
Baby, we are, baby, we are

[Verse 2]
I'm so better than y'all, I mean all of y'all
Jump up and knock your ass over like a volleyball
Or I'll knock your ass down like a bowling pin
And this is Ace of Spades, that's a bowling pin
Boy, we came to win, and y'all beginning
I left the club, they still swimming, you and your women
And y'all still written, we steady buying, bitch
And I bought a hundred watches, can't waste my time, bitch
Girl, you ain't a dime, bitch
You can't get a dime, bitch
Get off of my line, bitch
But it'd be a crime, bitch
Yup, I will have your mommy crying, bitch
And she be acting like a fan, so I hit her with an iron, bitch

[Bridge 2]
And I've been rapping a whole lot of dummies
No friends selling, but I've been serving a whole lot of dummies
You can call me fan, cause I'm blowing a whole lot of money
And your jewelry is cheesy, you got on a whole lot of sunny

[Hook]
These niggas ain't shit, baby, we are
And you might catch me with a hundred xans, tar
And I'm high as fuck, plus I'm shining, star
Baby, we are, baby, we are

[Verse 3]
I might be crazy, kick the front door in and fuck your old lady
Kidnap your baby
"Bitch, where them racks at?"
By the way shouts out to Rackset
Private jet
I ball hard, and I ball smart
Which means I flood the club, lifeguard
You gon' need a lifeguard, cause I'm at your throat, ho
And you need an extra band, can't rob me solo
I'm smoking indo, I will leave you outdoors
With the dogs, bye, bye, y'all
I shot him up and watched him shrink and run, microcrawl
Then I picked him up and chopped him up, hello, hogs

[Bridge 1]

[Hook]
These niggas ain't shit, baby, we are
And you might catch me with a hundred xans, tar
And I'm high as fuck, plus I'm shining, star
Baby, we are, baby, we are
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh...

So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I think it's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I feel it's still some things you need to know, (things you need to know)

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige (Beyoncé)]
A woman, she needs more than material things
And a woman needs so much more that what a man can say
(A woman, needs you to make love to her, she needs more than sex
A real woman needs a real man that don't talk about it
Be about it
Put that work, and still shows his woman real romance)

[Hook]
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I think it's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I feel it's still some things you need to know, (things you need to know)

[Verse 2: Beyoncé (Mary J. Blige)]
A woman, she likes to talk and work it out
And a woman likes for you to watch her back
Protect her crown
(A woman don't only want your make-up sex
She wants your respect
And a real woman never wanna walk into a room
See another woman knowing information
She don't even know about her man)

[Hook]
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I think it's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I feel it's still some things you need to know, (things you need to know)

[Verse 3: Beyoncé (Mary J. Blige)]
Make your way home at a decent hour every night
(Pick up your phone
Just to say you're still in love from time to time
Remind her that she's still beautiful in your eyes
And ride with your woman
Make her feel that you're always on her side
When she cries, ask her what she's feeling
Let her know you sympathize)

[Bridge: Beyoncé and Mary J. Blige]
Gotta swallow your pride
Got some making up to do, gotta make it right
Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Gotta take you time
I said kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Say it one more time, say it one more time
Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Gotta take your time
Don't want a minute man
We wanna have fun until she finish man
If that's asking to much
You'll never know how to really
Love a woman

[Hook]
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I think it's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I feel it's still some things you need to know, (things you need to know)

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
Ohhh
You think you know how to love a woman?
Ohh no...no

[Hook]
What the fuck is up?

Coming to the microphone, that nigga B.o.B
You know how I be, chiefing got me big
I'm about to show y'all how we -

What the fuck is, what the fuck is, what the fuck is up?
I'm in the DEC
Coming to te microphone, that nigga B.o.B
You know how I be, chiefing got me big
I'm about t show y'all how we rep it from the east

[Verse 1]
I used to pay attention from the sidelines
Now I play a pushing competition to the sideline (sideline)
I get up in your system some side nine
Similar to high niggas kill them with that fine rhyme

[Verse 2]
Now let me introduce myself again (okay)
They call me B - o - Bizzle cause I'm in on that Benz
I end up making money, I ain't end up making friends
So if you end up making 

[?] sorry I can't 

[?]

[Verse 3]
I kick my feet up while I'm sitting in my chair
And please believe I got my middle finger in the air
And haters say they on my level but they ain't here
And they say I ain't fair but I really can't care cause

[Hook]

[Lyrics from Snippet]

The reasons why I can't have you are easy to fix

... Around
Or whatever makes you feel like you the baddest bitch around

I know that your other man, I know that your other man
Got feelings for you,  got feelings for you...

[Verse 1]
Listen to me closely as the story unfolds
This could be the saddest story even been told
I used to want the house with the biggest pool
Reminiscing now I just feel like a fool

[Chorus]
Keep breaking me down, down, down
Keep breaking me down, down, down
Keep breaking me down, down, down
Keep breaking me down, down, down

[Verse 2]
I used to throw the party every New Year's Eve
First one intoxicated, last one to leave
Waking up in places that you would never believe
Give me back the time, you can keep the memories

[Chorus]
Keep breaking me down, down, down
Keep breaking me down, down, down
Keep breaking me down, down, down
Keep breaking me down, down, down

[Bridge]
Every book I've read said that I would meet somebody like you
Whenever I was sorry, so sorry for the things I used to do
A journal full of numbers that I used to go through
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) all behind me now, all because of you

[Chorus]
Keep breaking me down, down, down
Keep breaking me down, down, down
Keep breaking me down, down, down
Keep breaking me down, down, down
You keep breaking me, you keep breaking me down
I don't wanna, wanna go no
Don't wanna go down, down, down

[Verse 4]
Baby, baby see there's a door that you can walk through
Where there used to be a wall
I don't care, it's cool as long as you catch me baby
(Catch me when I fall) If there's ever a fall
Closer to the breakdown, the closer we get

[Hook]
Moonlight is shining bright
And sunlight is going down
So I just feel like
The dark side is rising
The dark side is rising

[Verse]
This my I don't give a fuck side
This my god damnit motherfuckin darkside
This my, this my, this my I don't give a fuck side
This my god damnit motherfuckin darkside, yeah
Says she like my crew
Says she like the way we do
Says she wanna come and rule
Make that bitch just come and go
Scuff scuff on my shoes
Get them panties loose
This my darkside if you livin for the crew

[Hook]
Moonlight is shining bright
And sunlight is going down
So I just feel like
The dark side is rising
The dark side is rising

[Intro]
Just turned twenty, twenty
Like Diane Sawyer

[Verse: 1]
Just turned veinte
Trying to get bigger than a venti
Trying to get the bucks of a star
My latin girl said I need to stack plenty
Jahosh playing prophets trying to get some profit
These dumb things give a nigga a lot of knowledge
Wallet looking thinner than Conan O'brien
But this atom finna blow like I was in science
Look baby I don't do love
Matter fact shawty I don't even do hugs
You ask a nigga why and I say just because
You get too attached and then you blame it on some love
Like I said who you know like me?
Né prolly need a Blake Lively
Né, Né prolly need a new new
See I've been feeling Gucci while they looking Fubu

[Verse: 2]
Never claim you the realest in the room
Cause if you ain't nigga it'll show like
A flower when it blooms
Or a tower when it falls
Or a chick that say she virgin but she always on her back with no drawers
Shawty said I'm too young for her
I told her "Baby I just turned twenty"
Let me hit it
Now I'm done with her
Now I'm done with her
I've been on the go
And she just wants some more
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
I've been on the go
Trying to get it quicker in a nigga Sono
If you ain't with it Shawty I may have to go
But your wah gwaan to a bad man I don't know
I just turned veinte
Feeling bigger than a venti
Trying to get the bucks of a star
My latin girl said I need to stack plenty

[Prod. By Jahosh]

[Intro]
You see every heartbreak breaks when it wants to
And when you break that heart
That heart never wants to
Love again
So she singin'

[Hook]
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
One moment I have you the next you are gone

[Verse 1]
You wonder why I'm so selfish
And why I never reply to your texts
Is it because I'm still attached to my exes
Girl you're fine but you're so damn restless
And she got an ax with a fat ass
She kill a nigga quicker anytime that she can
I wanna to be alone
She wanna be a hoe
You broke my heart in seconds
And now you want it when I'm gone
I tell her like
Baby you the bombest (you the bombest!)
You can get it (you can get it!)
But I don't want it (I don't want it)
So now you singing (now you're singing!)

[Hook]
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
One moment I have you the next you are gone

[Verse 2]
Attention, Attention
That's what every girl and they momma wanna mention
Girl you're so fine, girl you're so fine
But, I'd never tell you that cause I never wanna sweat ya
Pop it with the pop again
And pop it if you want to pop it
Thinking every bop in a nigga
Popular is your only goal
I tell her what I need when I want
And if you really want me shawty
We can get it on
Baby you the bombest (you the bombest!)
You can get it (you can get it!)
But I don't want it (I don't want it)
So now you singing (now you're singing!)

[Hook]
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I crave you

[Outro]
You know you gotta step on that thing to talk to me?
I was just trying to let you know
And she got an ax with a fat ass

[Intro: Skooly & Gucci Mane]
(We got London On Da Track!)
What's hadnin'
It's Guwop in this bitch
Got my nigga Thug with me
I got Dolph with me
Got London On Da Track
Sean in it now
Got Phil in with us, po' up!
Turn up, sideways, Guwop

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm spillin' oil like an oil spill, nigga
And my diamonds match my car wheels, nigga
And I'm flipping like a cartwheel, nigga
Bricksquad, we a cartel nigga
(Ayyyyy)
Fuck talking let the rubber bands get cha
Big dog I let a bunch of runts sick ya, sick ya
Got choppers on the wall like pictures
Put the pistol in ya mouth like dentures
Surveillance cameras at the spot motion sensors
Not just a boss, I'm motherfucking member
See I'm the owner and a motherfucking soldier
And tell your bitch I'll be gone in November
As a matter of fact I came home in September
Tell the truth, January , I remember
And plus my watch February, December
The pig lion in the hood like' Simba
Plus I got nigga that dress in all black just like ninjas
With no nunchucks, nigga just extensions
Some of the best zip
Pimp C niggas like they come from Texas

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
30 days flat, made a hundred off the reefer
Drinking on their Pimp C Texas Margarita
I only smoke the best
Don't give a fuck who got it cheaper
Drinking on that DJ Screw
Texas Margarita
Texas Margarita, Texas Margarita
I put too much syrup in the bottle
Put me in a sleeper
Texas Margarita, Texas Margarita
Driving fast cars
Dranking Texas Margarita

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Drank syrup till I'm dizzy
Ready to die I'm bumping Biggie
Pour 5-0s in one liter
Now my sprite filthy
Drinking on Texas maragrita
And the bitch with me she a molly eater
But I like the lil trick that she do with her tongue
So I got to keep her
Money call my phone, I pour up a cup
And then I gotta leave her
All my hoes stay mad at me
I keep em hot
Guess they got a fever
Looking at my rearview camera
Making sure its my two seater
Just missed a show and went to jail
For a cup of lean
Nigga fuck the people
I ain't tripping my nigga don't take no time to make no bun
Roll one up
Jumping up in the coupe
Pull up in the hood like uh
This Margarita straight mud
You can taste it
What's in that ginger ale
Actavis what it's laced with

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
30 days flat, made a hundred off the reefer
Drinking on their Pimp C Texas Margarita
I only smoke the best
Don't give a fuck who got it cheaper
Drinking on that DJ Screw
Texas Margarita
Texas Margarita, Texas Margarita
I put too much syrup in the bottle
Put me in a sleeper
Texas Margarita, Texas Margarita
Driving fast cars
Dranking Texas Margarita

[Verse 3: Dr. Phil]
Codeine in my styrofoam
DJ Screw what I be on
My temper short but my money long
No girlscout only smoke strong
I call ya bitch when I want dome
Drop her off and get my juug on
I'm gettin money on three phones
Boost, Metro, and the iPhone
When I'm dirty nigga I'm ridin alone
Before I bend a corner put my blinker on
I'ma rape the city if I make it home
Buy an Aston Martin paint it all chrome
Give me one hour, have them Forgi's on
With a Spanish bitch (?)
Versace dress with no panties on
Red bottoms and Chanel cologne

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
30 days flat, made a hundred off the reefer
Drinking on their Pimp C Texas Margarita
I only smoke the best
Don't give a fuck who got it cheaper
Drinking on that DJ Screw
Texas Margarita
Texas Margarita, Texas Margarita
I put too much syrup in the bottle
Put me in a sleeper
Texas Margarita, Texas Margarita
Driving fast cars
Dranking Texas Margarita

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
When I wake up in the mornin' babe
Can't believe my eyes
Sweetest little part of destiny
Oh yeah, 'cause you are now in my life
There ain't no man or prize
Oh noo, can compare to you
Ain't no words to describe the way that I'm feelin'
When I look at you

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I'm just speechless baby
Don't know what to say
I'm just speechless baby
The poet in me has gone away
I'm speechless baby
Don't know what to say
I'm just speechless baby
The poet in me has gone away

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
True love finally finds you babe
Life becomes a way
Previously unimaginable
Oh yeah, listen now what I say
It only happens once if even at all
Feel it deep in your soul
And like a fairytale your story begins yeah
What a sight to behold

[Chorus]
I'm just speechless baby
Don't know what to say
I'm just speechless baby
The poet in me has gone away
I'm speechless baby
Don't know what to say
I'm just speechless baby
The poet in me has gone away

[Verse 3: Eve]
In the mornings when I rise up
Go to the window and I smile with my eyes up
Stare in the clouds like wow look at my luck
Everyday I'm feelin' better 'cause I know I got the best I can be proud of
We can't fall quick
Remember when I used to tell my girls like yo this dude think he so it
Think he so fly
And every time you try to talk to me I'm like yo don't even dare try
I was on my solo groove I ain't want nothin'
I ain't need nothin', man I'm good
Now I'm speechless 'cause I fell for him
The poet in me died 'cause I fell for him

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I used to know all the words to say
I used to write all the poetry
But now you take my breath away

[Produced by Erick Arc Elliott of Flatbush Zombies]

[Verse 1]
Young niggas want hope
Bitch I walk a tight rope off the dope
Ho it's comeback season
Right where a pussy nigga front at, leave 'em
Running through the jungle still I comeback, breathing
I'm a king in my own mind
I be standing in the post when it's go time
Oh my, harness power like I'm Gohan
Fuck a co-sign, I ain't got no time for the program
Hit the Hyperbolic Chamber flow
Super Saiyan when I flame the 'dro
Pussy nigga what you aiming fo?
We gonna put you where the angels go
Watch your back or your halo's broke
Niggas say no more
Inglewood in this bitch getting righteous
Popping Senzu beans till I go unconscious
So much kush make a bitch feel nauseous
Spirit bomb drop it in this shit feel monstrous

[Hook]
SS4 heart kept pumping when the rest said no
Make your best fucking threat at your best set, go
Really wanna rumble with the best, lets go
Nigga SS4, Super Saiyan 4
Really wanna rumble with the best, lets go
Heart kept pumping when the rest said no
Make your best fucking threat nigga SS4

[Verse 2]
Got me feeling like a God or somethin'
Like I'm breaking all the odds or somethin'
See I think they have started somethin'
Been a trip never fall I'ma brawl for the cause, It ain't all for nothin'
From the bottom to the top, fuck all the frontin'
Put all the bullshit behind 'em
Bitch I'm blinding
Glow like the GBE clique, I'm shining
World get fondled, fuck the condom
Bust at any nigga don't duck is dying
Still surviving, fuck the sirens
I ain't got time for the shuck and jiving
Keep your tough fuck lady luck decided
You Hercule niggas can't beat us
Too powered up for the scouter shit to read us
Heavy in the game turn doubters to believers
Bring heat that'll cut the beef in half like Frieza

[Hook]

[Verse]
Dear Lord, forgive me for all my transgressions
I raise hell until it's heaven
True essence, everything to prove, but it's been a movie since dude stepped in
My crew wrecking, we could give a fuck 'bout who's second
Two is not a winner and three nobody remembers
A push it on the table, don't bring your body to dinner
Just trying to get this money, whole touring throughout the Spring
How we cold all summer and sizzle throughout the winter
Goddamnit, I'm a winner
My uncle left a piece behind
A lost nigga, though I'm searching for a piece of mind
I'm taking yours to add on to this piece of mine
I really think ambition should be redefined
How melodic is the physical embodiment
My soul obvious, stay atop the column and body shit
Fearing nothing, concern is moderate
School of hardknocks and this bitch on full scholarship
Fuck it, feel free to hate on me
I just told the fucking world to hold up, wait on me
Understand that it's the same old G
Blaze more tree, burning up such a fire and remain low key
I'm the one, they told me they was waiting for the revolution
And I arrived and on that day they made a resolution
All the worn down hope came to restitution
The game need a saving, and I was blessed to do it
Collecting my respect cause now it's overdoing
I'ma get this motor on the go before my moment's ruined
The old heads say that I'm a golden student
And I just build my troubles into soulful music

[Produced by Treejay]

[Chorus]
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Talkin', y'all wastin' your hatred
Shit, I'm just happy that I made it
I'm just happy that I made it
Yeah, this what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Talkin', y'all wastin' your hatred
Shit, I'm just happy that I made it
I'm just happy that I made it

[Verse]
Comin' live from the 'Burgh like the first time
Know what it is 'fore you even hear the words rhyme
Chosen one, the coldest soul, focus whole, so dauntless
And you know I'm from the PA, PGH
Where all the weed blaze
Where they work three jobs, no free days
Yo TreeJay, look what we made, and where we came from
So let them say somethin'
And let them hate us
And nothin' change up
Forever came up, we made it
Let a motherfucker go say shit
One for the ages, this is one for the ages
It's outrageous, spectacular how I use a vernacular
To rap a word, slap you backwards, shit has to hurt
Hit a home run and come back to first, yeah
Backstage, no passes work
With a light-skin bitch, get her ass to twerk, yeah
This the work of a master person
But it sound like Catholic church, God damn
Who the man with the hot hand?
They go nuts when I drop jams
I shake it up like a pop can
But I'm doin' numbers like a motherfuckin' rock band
Yeah, won't stop till I'm
The motherfuckin' greatest
Yeah, the motherfuckin' greatest
Yeah, the motherfuckin' greatest
Yeah, the motherfuckin' greatest
And I won't be not everybody's favorite
Not everybody's favorite
But I won't stop 'til I'm the motherfuckin' greatest
Yeah, the motherfuckin' greatest (Woo)

[Chorus]
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Talkin', y'all wastin' your hatred
Me? I'm just happy that I made it
Happy that I finally made it
Yeah, this what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Talkin', y'all wastin' your hatred
Me? I'm just happy that I made it
Take you to back the basics, yeah

[Outro]
Here, face this
Alright

[Verse 1]
Aquarius!
There's travel in your future when your tongue
Freezes to the back of a speeding bus
Fill that void in your pathetic life
By playing Whack-A-Mole seventeen hours a day

Pisces!
Try to avoid any Virgos or Leos
With the Ebola virus
You are the true Lord of the Dance
No matter what those idiots at work say

Aries!
The look on your face will be priceless
When you find that forty-pound watermelon in your colon
Trade toothbrushes with an albino dwarf
Then give a hickey to Meryl Streep

Taurus!
You will never find true happiness
What you gonna do, cry about it?
The stars predict tomorrow you'll wake up
Do a bunch of stuff, and then go back to sleep

[Chorus]
That's your horoscope for today
(That's your horoscope for today)
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay
That's your horoscope for today
That's your horoscope for today
(That's your horoscope for today)
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay
That's your horoscope for today

[Verse 2]
Gemini!
Your birthday party will be ruined once again
By your explosive flatulence
Your love life will run into trouble
When your fiance hurls a javelin through your chest

Cancer!
The position of Jupiter says that you should spend
The rest of the week face down in the mud
Try not to shove a roll of duct tape up your nose
While taking your driver's test

Leo!
Now is not a good time to photocopy your butt
And staple it to your boss's face, oh no
Eat a bucket of tuna-flavored pudding
Then wash it down with a gallon of Strawberry Quik
Virgo!
All Virgos are extremely friendly and intelligent
Except for you
Expect a big surprise today
When you wind up with your head impaled upon a stick

[Chorus]
That's your horoscope for today
(That's your horoscope for today)
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay
That's your horoscope for today
That's your horoscope for today
(That's your horoscope for today)
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay
That's your horoscope for today

[Bridge]
Now you may find it inconceivable
Or at the very least a bit unlikely
That the relative position of the planets
And the stars could have a special deep significance
Or meaning that exclusively applies to only you
But let me give you my assurance
That these forecasts and predictions
Are all based on solid, scientific, documented evidence
So you would have to be some kind of moron not to realize
That every single one of them is absolutely true
Where was I?

[Verse 3]
Libra!
A big promotion is just around the corner
For someone much more talented than you
Laughter is the very best medicine
Remember that when your appendix bursts next week

Scorpio!
Get ready for an unexpected trip
When you fall screaming from an open window
Work a little bit harder on improving your low self-esteem
You stupid freak

Sagittarius!
All your friends are laughing behind your back
(Kill them)
Take down all those naked pictures of Ernest Borgnine
You've got hanging in your den

Capricorn!
The stars say that you're an exciting and wonderful person
But you know they're lying
If I were you, I'd lock my doors and windows
And never, never, never, never, never leave my house again

[Chorus]
That's your horoscope for today
(That's your horoscope for today)
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay
That's your horoscope for today
That's your horoscope for today
(That's your horoscope for today)
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay
That's your horoscope for today
That's your horoscope for today
(That's your horoscope for today)
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay
That's your horoscope for today
That's your horoscope for today
(That's your horoscope for today)
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay
That's your horoscope for today

[Eminem]
Good morning children!
My name is Dirty Steve, I'll be your substitute teacher for today
(Clinton Sparks!)

Come with me, don't be so mad, angry little man
Dirty Steve will be here soon, he will hold your hand
Walking through the forest, he will show you porno mags
You can beat his dick while he sucks yours, cuz he's a fag

[Verse 1]
Once in awhile, maybe you will feel the urge
To break international copyright law
By downloading MP3s from file-sharing sites
Like Morpheus, or Grokster, or LimeWire, or Kazaa
But deep in your heart, you know the guilt would drive you mad
And the shame would leave a permanent scar
’Cause you start out stealing songs, then you're robbing liquor stores
And selling crack and running over school kids with your car

[Chorus]
So don't download this song
The record store's where you belong
Go and buy the CD like you know that you should
Oh, don't download this song

[Verse 2]
Oh, you don't want to mess with the R-I-double-A
They'll sue you if you burn that CD-R
It doesn't matter if you're a grandma or a seven-year-old girl
They'll treat you like the evil, hard bitten, criminal scum you are

[Chorus]
So don't download this song
Don't go pirating music all day long
Go and buy the CD like you know that you should
Oh, don't download this song

[Bridge]
Don't take away money
From artists just like me
How else can I afford another solid gold Humvee?
And diamond-studded swimming pools
These things don't grow on trees
So all I ask is everybody please

[Chorus]
Don't download this song (Don't do it, no, no)
Even Lars Ulrich knows it's wrong (You can just ask him)
Go and buy the CD like you know that you should (You really should)
Oh, don't download this song

[Outro]
Don't download this song (Oh, please don't you do it or you)
Might wind up in jail like Tommy Chong (Remember Tommy)
Go and buy the CD (Right now) like you know that you should (Go out and buy it)
Oh, don't download this song
Don't download this song (No, no, no, no, no, no)
Or you'll burn in hell before too long (And you deserve it)
Go and buy the CD (Just buy it) like you know that you should (You cheap bastard)
Where is my heart, girl
Where is my heart
Did you throw it in a blender or throw it beneath a car
Did you give it to a doctor to dissect apart
I'm not joking anymore girl
Where is my heart

Where is my heart, girl
Where is my heart
Did you throw it in a blender or throw it beneath a car
Did you give it to a doctor to dissect apart
I'm not joking anymore girl
Where is my heart

Where are my ears, girl
Where are my ears
Did you go ahead and shave them off when you shaved off my beard
You know that without them my head look kinda weird
I'm not joking anymore girl
Where are my ears
Where is my heart, girl
Where is my heart
Did you throw it in a blender or throw it beneath a car
Did you give it to a doctor to dissect apart
I'm not joking anymore girl
Where is my heart

Where is my tongue, girl
Where is my tongue
Did you go ahead and suck it out when you sucked out my lungs
You know that without it my song can't be sung
I'm not joking anymore girl where is my tongue

Beers, browns, and banjos
Is that all I need
I looked up at the sky and I got down on my knees
Oh lord for Christmas won't you find me a wife
I will play her my banjo and she'll give me a life

Where is my heart, girl
Where is my heart
Did you throw it in a blender or throw it beneath a car
Did you give it to a doctor to dissect apart
I'm not joking anymore girl
Where is my heart

[Verse 1]
Blue Boy, worried 'bout the world's eyes
Worried, every time the sun shines
Worried 'bout his haircut
Calm down, sweetheart, grow up

[Chorus]
Blue Boy
Blue Boy
Blue Boy
Blue Boy

[Verse 2]
Blue Boy, older than the world knows
Honey, that's the way that life goes
No use acting so tough
Calm down, sweetheart, grow up

[Chorus]
Blue Boy
Blue Boy
Blue Boy
Blue Boy

[Outro]
Hey, Tony

[Verse 1]
Goodbye,  weekend
So long, darling
Macky's been a bad, bad boy
And when they're preaching
Be sure to change me
Should rearrange me
Or so they thought

[Chorus]
So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading
His own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life
Well, honey, that's fine just know that you're wasting your time

[Verse 2]
Sort me, place me
Give me a sign
Repeat the mantra
When you're stepping out of line
Give me, a number
Something to be
May help out the country boy
But it won't work out on me

[Solo]

[Chorus]
So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading
His own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life
Well, honey, that's fine just know that you're wasting your time

[Outro]
Ah, Gigi Bungsu

[Chorus]
Why, a pill
Why, a pill
Give me that ecstasy
Ecstasy
Give me that ecstasy
That ecstasy

[Verse]
Who put those flowers
Inside of your hair?
Just give me a moment
I'll be right there
You're glowing, those colors
Those colors, you wear
Run through the world
With no care, if you dare

[Chorus]
Why, a pill
Why, a pill
Give me that ecstasy
Ecstasy
Give me that ecstasy
Ooh, ecstasy
Give me that ecstasy
Ecstasy
Give me that ecstasy
Ooh, ecstasy

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Why, a pill
Why, a pill
Why, a pill
Why, a pill
Give me that ecstasy
Ecstasy
Give me that ecstasy
Ooh, ecstasy
Give me that ecstasy
Ecstasy
Give me that ecstasy
Ooh, ecstasy

Oh my, I'm a don like Omar (Omar)
Speed it up slow ma, throw it back, toma (Haa)
Rock-rock Gators like my Detroit players
You can hate to love us, you can love to hate us (Haa, whoop!)

Do you love me? Do you swear?

'Cause you know how it go and go
When you wanna go and go
Have you seen what's her face? (Who?)
Is her number in your phone?
And your answer's yes and yes
But you still say no and no
Even though I know you know
I know I know you know I know
You know? It sound dumb-de-dumb-dumb
They say what we want's wrong, fuck it
Least know what we want
And it sucks to see you cry
Know a brokenhearted girl could make the whole world drown (Drown)
And even though your makeup smears
Man I'm the one that's been the clown, why the fuck we around?
'Cause girl, you know I got that jaw drop shit (Yeah)
Plus I know your insecurities, that mall cop shit (Oh God)
I give you that screwface shit (Freaky)
Bring the ugly side out, two-faced shit (Woah)
Tryin' all new ways shit (Mmmhmm)
One night turn into a few days shit (I luh you, JLo)

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled]
I didn't see it, but I see it now
Think I love you, and I need you now
Ain't had none like you in a while (This the remix)

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez]
All day, 24 hour
Feeling like I want one when it's crowded
If you wanna hear your name, I shout it
Boy, you the shit, go and take a power shower
And I'm feeling like it's me and you, I don't doubt it
You can drive it how you want, I ain't tryna count mileage

[Intro]
Yeah
It's not official news here, as far as I'm concerned it didn't happen, you shut your mouth
One time
What are you afraid of, because the people might find out?
Two times
This news if not official, you were never under the assumption, it's perfectly clear
Three times
I said it was none of your God damn business
One time, tw-two times two, there's two times two twos, three
Three times, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, um yeah

[Verse 1]
Raps millenniums
Ain't no use tellin' them my plans for the rebellion(No)
The music got me innovator, power no generator
It's the same me, just a couple new developments(It's me)

[Bridge]
They sellin' us our dreams
And we couldn't buy them back if they were sellin' them for free(Cha-ching)
I speak for the diseased and the misunderstood
I left the 'burg for a minute, but it's still all good(Still all good)

[Verse 2]
I push the Beamer and the Benz about to cop the Bentley(Bentley)
Fuck your feelings and your friends you will not correct me(No)
I do this shit correctly, leave a murder scene messy
Dancin' with two lefties screamin' fucking Elvis Presley(Okay)
What do you do when you want to get high
So you call up your connect
Your connect tell you he's dry
It's time to quarantine thinkin' you for sure a fiend
Now your pleasant dreams start to morph into a horror scene(No)
I take morphine and drink chlorine(Uhuh)
Hit the zoo see the lion cage and have an orgy
Drink WD-40, tell a bunch of stories about the make-believe glory(Uuhhhhh)

[Verse 3]
It's that back ally bum fight
Make sure you sittin' up right
Aristocratic pussy ring her bell then she cum twice
I never read the horoscopes
I go to see the oracle
For fortunes, I ignore her though(let's go)
Just a couple words from my mortal soul(Mortal soul)
Time travel, tryin' to get back
But the portal closed(Portal closed)
All-terrain game, bitch, I'm durable(Yeah)
Mister, drifter everythin' is portable(Let's go)
I'm playin' Dominos with the common folk(Hello)
Lose a hundred dollars quickly
Guess that's all she wrote(Hello)
And everybody got their pot of gold(Uhuh)
Even if it's just a loose fifty in the laundry load(God damn)
Start to understand, we are not alone(Nope)
Try to figure out the difference between frogs and toads(Ribbit)
Shit gets real then you got to go(Okay)
It's a rocky road when you walkin' home

[Outro]
Yeah
You walkin' home, I'm walkin' home
Just a couple thoughts as I'm walkin' home
Lookin' at my feet as I'm walkin' home
Lookin' at the street as I'm walkin' home
Thinkin' of my dreams as I'm walkin' home
Be safe when you walkin' home
When you walkin' home, I'm walkin' home

[Intro:]
I know y'all been waiting on the album
Lotta mixtapes
Ya know, lotta thangs
BURR!

[Verse 1]
Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci
Gucci got a warrant, how the fuck I get subpoenaed?
Objection! What's the objection?
Your honor, I'm a genius
13 years old, got my Jordan's in the cleaners
Like Lil Scrappy rockin FILAs
In the club, Sho Nuff like Tela (Gucci!)
Black and white chain in the Libra like a zebra
This is not your everyday ordinary fucking Beemer
This is no part of the seven, it's a moss, it cost a mean one
Got my top back for my grandma, got my beater for Aaliyah
It's me and my money and my diamonds, we a trio
And no disrespect to Ne-Yo but it's Gucci Mane I'm Sosa
And my albino Testarossa bout the color of the ocean
It's Gucci Mane La Flare and my bank account is rollin
Is you rollin?

[Hook]
Pounds came Thursday

Yeah, it's gone in a hurry
Plug showin' love, man, 12 don't discourage me

[Verse 2]
911 emergency, Gucci making currency
Somebody call an ambulance, I think my flow's been burglary

The only thing I'm killing is yo motherfuckin' girl's jaw
Smoking on that fruity dro

But can't fuck you Blood Raw
Damn, I like them kinky flows

[Hook]

[Intro]
Uh-huh... extra cheese
Uh-huh, uh-huh... save a piece for me

[Verse 1]
Pizza party at your house
I went just to check it out
Nineteen extra larges
What a shame
No one came
Just us eatin' all alone
You said, "Take the pizza home"
"No sense lettin' all this go to waste"
So then I faced

[Pre-Chorus]
Pizza all day
And every day
This cheese 'round the clock
Is gettin' me blocked
And I sure don't care
For irregularity
Tell me...

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and make me so constipated?
'Cause right now I'd do anything to just get my bowels evacuated
In the bathroom
I sit and I wait and I strain
And I sweat and I clench and I feel the pain
Oh, should I take laxatives or have my colon irrigated?
No, no, no...

[Verse 2]
I was feelin' pretty down
'Til my girlfriend came around
We're just so alike in every way
I gotta say
In fact, I just thought I might
Pop the question there that night
I was kissing her so tenderly
But woe is me

[Pre-Chorus]
Who would have guessed
Her family crest
I'd suddenly spy
Tattooed on her thigh
And son-of-a-gun
It's just like the one on me
Tell me...

[Chorus]
How was I supposed to know we were both related?
Believe me, if I knew she was my cousin, we never would have dated
What to do now? Should I go ahead and propose
And get hitched and have kids with eleven toes
And move to Alabama where that kind of thing is tolerated?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no

[Verse 3]
I had so much on my mind
I thought maybe I'd unwind
Try out that new roller coaster ride
And the guide

[Pre-Chorus]
Said not to stand
But that's a demand
That I couldn't meet
I got on my feet
And stood up instead
And knocked off my head, you see
Tell me...

[Chorus]
Why'd I have to go and get myself decapitated?
This really is a major inconvenience, oh man, I really hate it
Such a drag, now
Can't eat, I can't breathe, I can't snore
I can't belch or yodel anymore
Can't spit or blow my nose or even read Sports Illustrated
Oh, no
Why'd I have to go and get myself all mutilated? (yeah, yeah)
I gotta tell ya, life without a head kinda makes me irritated
What a bummer
Can't blink, I can't cough, I can't sneeeze
But my neck is enjoyin' a pleasant breeze now
Haven't been the same since my head and I were separated
No, no, no...

[Introduction: DJ Holiday]
Young Thugga Mane LaFlare!

My jeweler froze like the fucking Titanic

Broke up with my homie cause I fucked all of his sisters
Got into a couple shootouts cause he heard I called them hookers
You know we slime life, I'ma get her wet then hook her
You know we slime life, steal racks out her purse, I booked her
Roll her like a swisher
Fuck sis and then dismiss her
Then pulled up in that spider
Auntie outfit look like she was a nurse so I flirt (I flirt)
Then my broadie came outside, treat them with syrup
I'm a A-1 nigga so he take my word (Take my word)
Took my phone pocket, called him and he heard me say "Slurp" and don't burp

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Bought a Phantom just to paint it gray (Skirt!)

[Second Section - "Who ran the Iron Horse"]

[Refrain]
Who ran the iron horse? (Truck drivin' man, do what you can)

Who ran the iron horse? (Out of night-life, it's a gas man)
Who ran the iron horse? (I don't believe I gotta grieve)
Who ran the iron horse? (I'm outta luck)
Who ran the iron horse? (with a buck and a booth)
Who ran the iron horse? (Catchin' on to the truth)
Who ran the iron horse? (In the vast past, the last gasp)

[Intro: Eminem & Royce da 5'9"]
I'm 'bout to, I'm 'bout to scare these kids
I'm 'bout to scare these kids
I'm 'bout to scare these children
Aight, (Yo) my name is (Royce)
My name is, my name is (5'9") Slim Shady, Slim Shady

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Arsonist, blocking a fire hose where the nozzle is
Go to hospitals, steal the blood that tests positive
Take it home, pour it in a cup and drink lots of it
Trying on your mother's clothes, trying to get these bras to fit
When she comes home, I'm waiting in the closet
With a knife, hiding so quiet, she'll probably hear the faucet drip
All my life, I've been a foster kid
So if I die an early death, suicide's gon' be the cause of it

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9]
Who hard? Yo, I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity
Holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil, intelligence level
Is hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist
Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life, when the Black Knight mounted the white horse
Then one get at you, dash you in the back of a Chevrolet
Spittin' shit at you faster than your eardrum could ever play

[Chorus: Eminem & Royce da 5'9"]
'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
We hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either
(Shit, me neither)

[Verse 3: Eminem & Royce da 5'9"]
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle (Ahh! Haha)
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain
(Shit, he's insane!) Nah, I just want to shoot up
And I'm pissed off, 'cause I can't find a decent vein

[Verse 4: Royce da 5'9"]
The disaster with dreads, I'm bad enough to commit suicide
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
'Cause I serve any stranger with money
I fade a hundred, man, until they joint chains
While slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
I got a lot of ego; I got knowledge peeking out of my cerebral now that I got people locked and rock evil
While still on the beat, I hit you in your ribs so hard to think it's just a touch to the floor, while you're still on your feet
I'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees
Somehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me
Destroying the track, un-employing the whack, exploring the facts while my man Eminem is withdrawing from crack

[Interlude: Eminem]
*crying*
I just love him, I just love him...

[Verse 5: Eminem & Royce da 5'9"]
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (Uh-huh)
I'm the one who burned your house down (Oh...)
Well, I'm out now
And this time, I'm comin' back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you with a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe (Yeah)

[Chorus: Royce da 5'9" & Eminem]
You see this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel
(We'll be waiting) See you in Hell
Slim Shady, Royce da 5'9", Wall Street
Yeah, see you in Hell for the sequel
Doc Seuss, yeah
Meets Evil, I'm Bad, yeah

[Verse 1]
I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone and so was I
So I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me

[Chorus]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said, "I don't," she didn't have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I never would've thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me
This girl, she had to be
An angel sent from heaven just for me

[Chorus]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (Look, she's lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said, "I don't," she didn't have no phone (She was lovin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Look who's lovin' me)

[Chorus]
She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me while she was still your wife (She was wantin' me)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (She was lovin' me)
She said that it would never end
Or tried to keep me any way she can (She was wantin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, no
Alright
Oh (I’m in love, love)

[Verse 3]
I didn't know she was already spoken for
'Cause I'm not that kind of man
Swear that I would've never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that I'm holdin' her to blame

[Chorus]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (Holdin' her to blame)
She told me she was all alone
Said, "I don't," she didn't have no phone (Holdin' her to blame)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (Holdin' her to blame)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Holdin' her to blame)

[Chorus]
She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife (Holdin' her to blame)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (Holdin' her to blame)
She said that it would never end
Or tried to keep me any way she can (Holdin' her to blame)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah

[Chorus]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (Look, she's lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said, "I don't," she didn't have no phone (She was lovin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (She's with me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Look who's lovin' me)

[Chorus]
She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me while she was still your wife (She was wantin' me)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (She was lovin' me)
She said that it would never end
Or tried to keep me any way she can (She was wantin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby, love never felt so good
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd die if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me

[Pre-Chorus]
And the night's gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, every time I love you
In and out my life, in out, baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out my life, in out, baby
So baby, yes, love never felt so good

[Verse 2]
Baby, love never felt so fine (So fine)
And I'd die if it's never mine, not like you hold me, hold me

[Pre-Chorus]
And the night's gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it

[Chorus]
‘Cause baby, everytime I love you
It's in and out my life, in out, baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out my life, driving me crazy
Baby, love never felt so good

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Aww baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd die if you're mine all mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Aww baby, love never felt so good (soo good)
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me

[Pre-Chorus]
And the night's gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, every time I love you

[Outro]
Alright, that's fine, that's it…

[Verse 1]
Hello August moon, where are the stars of the night?
You promised me too soon cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said, if you're not well stay in bed
'Cause I've been feelin' down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

[Hook 1]
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do

[Verse 2]
Hello midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of ya 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish and then we'll kiss, our love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

[Hook 2]
And I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

[Bridge]
It seems you don't know, we reached the highest mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together we will fly, we'll dance up in the heavens
I can really feel it when you're near, oh-hoo

[Verse 3]
And the weatherman said, if you're not well stay in bed
'Cause I've been feelin' down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

[Outro]
But I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do (n'doo doo doo, I'll be loving you)
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do (cause you're always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I want to do (n'doo doo doo, loving you)
Loving you, that's what I want to do (always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do (always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I want to do
Loving you, that's what I want to do

[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
If you love somebody
Put a light in the air
From the hood to the stakes
Fry your finger in the air
Flo Rida up in here
Wyclef up in here

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
If I could, I would pull it up and rewind
To the time when it was just me and you
Oh, how we were inseparable
If I could, I'd pull it up and rewind
To the time before you went away
Wish I could go back to yesterday
If I could, I'd pull it up and rewind

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I try sticking to the rivers that I'm used to
But these tears got me searching for an inner tube
Witness my homies, life shorter than my inner lose
Don't wanna drown in my hurt 'cause it's critical
I pop champagne, but still it's a damn pain
Beedee, I love you, my sister died, but it never changed
My last love that we just ditched in my brain
Give up the fortune and the fame to hear you say my name
The ghetto rough while the doff try purple rain
Lord knows I wish death never had a name
Our last breath that it never had a relevate
Wyclef, Flo Rida, here to tell it man
To the left, move, hurt for suffering
I lose myself when I think about my people's slain
If I could I'd rewind this whole thing

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
If I could, I would pull it up and rewind
To the time when it was just me and you
Oh, how we were inseparable
If I could, I'd pull it up and rewind
To the time before you went away
Wish I could go back to yesterday
If I could, I'd pull it up and rewind
So I sit down and I had try
Are you living up in this life?
I know if I could, I'd pull it up and rewind

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
If I could take yesterday and place it in my palms
I anticipate the day like a school prom
Promise tomorrow what you think 'til you lose some
Big Will, I know Heaven got the futon
Face good with the man paid your dues done
Whack your shows in Japan with me getting drunk
We had plans, plans change the new sun
The lord never leave us lonely when you lose one
If I could change the past, my people wouldn't pass
I wish life was TiVo and you could bring it back
I wish it all was remote and how the day be said
I were IP, use it like it's pixel flap
Pull up the hood times, pull up the good times
Every day be forever when I'm puttin' down
Showing off, that's the truth, nah

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
If I could, I would pull it up and rewind
To the time when it was just me and you
Oh, how we were inseparable
If I could, I'd pull it up and rewind
To the time before you went away
Wish I could go back to yesterday
If I could, I'd pull it up and rewind
So I sit down and I had try
Are you living up in this life?
I know if I could, I'd pull it up and rewind

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
If I had the gift, be here, I'd cure your mom from cancer
Take the Breena and stuck em up all with answers
Take the crack feen turn her into the prom queen
Have her graduate summa cum laude
But she so high that she's riding on drug assist
Growing up like the women from the exorcist
Her heart stopped in the ambulance

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
If I could, I would pull it up and rewind
To the time when it was just me and you
Oh, how we were inseparable
If I could, I'd pull it up and rewind
To the time before you went away
Wish I could go back to yesterday
If I could, I'd pull it up and rewind
So I sit down and I had try
Are you living up in this life?
I know if I could, I'd pull it up and rewind

[Chorus: Fergie]

This is wisdom
A wise man once said:
Tomorrow does not equal yesterday!

[Verse 1: apl.de.ap]
Your beauty is like a shining star light
You make my heart skip, you are my highlight
You got that aura, it's so angelic
You take me over, you're so electric
Your smile is sunshine, you give me sunlight
You're what I'm missing, a part of my life
Compared to no one, one in a million
You got me going, you're my ignition

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Can't nobody love me like the way you do?
It's a phenomenon, it's a phenomenon
Can't nobody love me like the way you do?
It's a phenomenon, it's a phenomenon

[Post-Chorus: will.i.am]
You take me to higher grounds
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
You take me to higher grounds
Na na na na na na na na na na na na

[Verse 2: Fergie]
What you say is overrated cause you made it up
You think that I am slow, you didn't know
Oh what you say to me is the bait into the same shit
That you say all them o-o-oh's, them other o-o-oh's
You used to be the kind of the man that would take me as I am
Now you go-oh, Mr. go-oh
No need to stay another day, so I'll be on my way
I'm out the door, out the door, oh-oh

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Can't nobody love me like the way you do?
It's a phenomenon, it's a phenomenon

You take me to higher grounds
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
You take me to higher grounds

[Bridge: Taboo]
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
You're my everything, you're my everything
You're the one for me, you're the one for me
You're my everything, you're my everything

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
This feelings crazy, I can't explain it
It's so amazing, feels like I'm dreaming
This love ain't basic, it's like a spaceship
Out somewhere far, I wanna visit
Like the Taj Mahal, or the great wall
You're a phenomenon, you're a phenomenon
Like the pyramid, or coliseum
You're a phenomenon, you're a phenomenon

Even when you ain't right at times

So much emotions built inside
So baby here I am

Blow your socks off, make sure your g-spot soft
Raw take away the pain
You been mislead, lames buttin' in your lane
I wanna hit it in the worst way, two days
Schemin' on that ass since the first day (you heard mane?)
Yeah, I got a lot in store
Shop on this chauffeur, kings hold the door

Takin' flights, seein' sights
Blowin' Cali in the villa

My body is magnified
In the sun, set me alight
My body and your delights
Burn me up, set me alight

Kiss you while the sun kisses me

[Verse 2]
Let's get to huggin' and kissin'
Don't know the floor from the ceilin'
We cook it up in the kitchen
Nobody hotter than you
You know that I twerk it
And give you somethin' that's worth it
But d-d-daddy that's perfect
This 'yoncé only for you
All that ocean, can't you see it?
Mix up passion with fruit, sangria
BB Cubana, ay que lindo
Ya tu sabes camino como cocino, primo
There's only one thing on my mind
I wanna love you long time
Want you to watch me while I wind
Want you to love me long time
We're just havin' such a good time
Over and over we find
With the flame lickin' at my feet
Kiss you while the sun kisses me

[Chorus]

[Intro]
It's very clear
Ribbit
In it
Get it

[Hook]
James Bong I'm on a mission
Bruce Lee the way I kick it
Tiger Woods the way I hit it
Look how I whip it, how I whip it
Look how I whip it, how I whip it
Look how I whip it, how I whip it
Ah, you niggas finished
Damn, look how I whip it, how I whip it

[Verse]
I'm cooking up, I'm cooking up
I'm in the kitchen
I make it flip, I make it flip
Just like a gymnast
I mix it up, I mix it up
Just like a chemist
You niggas know that I'm the realest
I'm with my squad and we the illest
I'm going hard, I'm 'bout my business
That bitch she on it, yeah she gifted
I'm in her mouth like I'm a dentist
I swear to god I be going hard
You would think part of my job is driving foreign cars
I'll be in it till I win it
Y'all could start it, I'mma finish

[Hook]
James Bong I'm on a mission
Bruce Lee the way I kick it
Tiger Woods the way I hit it
Look how I whip it, how I whip it
Look how I whip it, how I whip it
Look how I whip it, how I whip it
Ah, you niggas finished
Damn, look how I whip it, how I whip it

[Verse 1: Lupe]

Fast black man author
Slower white man warner
I can never leave the hood
I'm a city sticker
Like lower right-hand corner
My city slicker like Billy Crystal
To recall the wielding pistols
More arms than Vishnu
Wrist full, of the crystal ball
I predict through, pistol
Won't miss you (shoot?)
Like the second song on Disc 2
Lift you, 5'8" to 6'2"
To 6 feet below
Its like I'm half way home with 6 streets to go
Never halfway holmes
I'm 6 deep in flow
In the halfway homes since hes been paroled
Because I've been behind those bars
A political prisoner, imprisoned for passing out
Anti-political literature
Tapes full of that revolutionary curricular for you to listen to

[Hook]
Nah
This is for my niggas baby
No doubts, if, ands, or maybes that
This is for my niggas baby
From the bus to six sedans crazy
This is for my niggas baby
No doubts, if, ands, or maybes that
This is for my niggas

[Verse 2: Lupe]
They say he zone out
Just the spirit of Lu
He Malone out
Till he thrown out
With two technical fouls
He middle fingered the crowd
He argue with the reff
But your team blown out
A bonafide player that they wanna comb out
Crone out, stocked, sticked, and stone out
Psychiatrist's couch, straight jacket
Bubble walls, and a foam mouth
I move K packs crazy, pack heat
Lay back like back seats in Maybach Mercedes
A track to say these
So please let the record reflect
Like the bottom of CD's I could never eject
Or go back like Eight-Track
I could never respect if I ever regressed
I don't play that
But still sittin on dubs and pimpin on her
What you trippin on cuz

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lupe]
Since my conception my directions to get connections
If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right
I dodge corrections like
Before I see my arms in ludicrous charms
I will buy the farm
The cowboy boots, roosters, tractor, chicken, and the barn
Hustle north cause esse, he know
Got that double cross like F-A-B-O
But I will touch ya
Send them boys to ice you out like Usher
Understand I musta been here before
In the belly of the beast
I'm sincere for sure
In the stomach of the hundred is ten pills of raw
Ey, I got some dope shit
And I'm focused y'all
So put that lactose to it
Sneak the black toast through it
Let the mac flow to it

[Hook]

M-m-m-m-a
No, no, no, no, no, no
These hoes - they like niggas that spend money, not talk about it
If you ain't gonna get the money then watcha gonna do?
Hey!

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed perico with baking soda
I made a million on that corner
Going Donald Trump numbers on the corner
I made a million on that corner
Graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed perico with baking soda
I made a million on that
I made a million on that
I made a million on that corner

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Young rich nigga, I flex, look at my neck
Look at my bitch, look at my wrist, got these niggas upset
Who you know blow a mill? Don't even think twice, no sweat
And these hoes around me?
You don't fuck, you don't give them no check
Cause ya'll niggas lame as fuck, none of these chumps can hang with us
All these chains getting tangled up
And my clique armed and dangerous, and we'll flame you up
You get smoked mothafucker like angel dust
Start the Rolls Royce with the angel up
All these niggas on angel bruh, but I got stripes like a bengal does
And my wrist look like the flash on
Come that ho and bring that ass on
So I can beat it up like you stole something
Might pop a perk, go mad long like skrrt
Been through your hood in a wraith, niggas is jealous, just look at your face
.357 get put in your place, follow my lead all you niggas is late
Like hold up, hold up, I done made a million on that corner
I bought some coke but couldn't deal with Arizona
Them yellow diamonds looking clearer than Corona
And if they act like they ain't with it

[Hook]
I graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed perico with baking soda
I made a million on that corner
Going Donald Trump numbers on the corner
I made a million on that corner
Graduated from the streets, no diploma
Made a million on that corner
I made a million on that
I made a million on that
I made a million on that corner

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm on the corner gettin' cake
I'm talkin' like it's 88
Givenchy all I really play
Kingpin status when I swerve up on the block
A nigga like you, you wouldn't even get to cop
Get my money dolo, I just need some help to count it
I'm the richest nigga outta Dade-Broward County
Feds know my game, they keep it raw, we all at odds
Repossess my Lambo cause they wanna build a charge
When they got my Chevy, got it runnin' like it's 'sposed to
Hit up on my niggas, let 'em know my shop reopened
We rockin' everything, till I'm right back on the top
Nasdaq hustle bitch, come get your ass some stocks

[Hook]
I graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed perico with baking soda
I made a million on that corner
Going Donald Trump numbers on the corner
I made a million on that corner
Graduated from the streets, no diploma
Made a million on that corner
I made a million on that
I made a million on that
I made a million on that corner

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Ugh, Double M, bang!
MY RANDOM

I miss all the tension
When all this is over
I’m moving to ghana
You sus and you watching me
They used to be brown
Now them contacts is green
Why the fucks u finessing me
I know how many licks
It’ll take me to get
To the center of ecstasy
How come the ecstasy
Only depresses me so
Chemically I don’t have
Any new places to go
Every face looks pale
When the seraton’ gets a lil low
When they lower my coffin
Bet a few bitches jumpin in the hole
Few old ones that I left alone
I never lie cus I don’t remember
No tales cus it’s two heads
Even twelve got a lil forgiveness
Who do you love?

[Verse 1]
Boy is lonely on a burning hot summer night
He's looking for some action, he's looking for a fight
He's looking for a saviour in a city full of fools
Maybe he just needs a good talker to give him a good talking to
Can we talk baby?

[Refrain]
Strip down, strip down
Think I'm going to fall in love tonight

[Elephants and flowers](22119004)

[Verse 2]
Hot sweaty light paints a picture red and gold
On a crowd of naked bodies stripped down to their very souls
How can he find a shy angel in a city so bold (So bold)
He can't even find a place for dance, this is rock and roll

[Refrain]
Strip down, strip down
Elephants and flowers
Is everybody ready? Here we go

[Chorus]
Love the one who is love, (Love)
The one who gives us the power, (Power)
The one who made everything, (What?)
Elephants and flowers (What will he do?)
The one who will listen when all others will not
There will be peace for those who love God a lot

[Refrain]
Elephants and flowers
Strip down
Think I'm going to fall in love tonight

[Bridge]
When I do, there won't be no more (Confusion)
There won't be no more (No tears)
There won't be no more enemies, so that eliminates all the fear
And there won't be no sorrow, (Sorrow)
There won't be no pain, (No pain)
There won't be no ball and no chain

[Refrain]
Strip down, strip down
Elephants and flowers

[Verse 3]
Boy is lonely on a burning hot summer night
He's looking for an angel to hold him until the morning light
Here we go

[Chorus]
Love the one who is love (Love)
The one who gives us the power, (Power)
The one who made everything (Everything)
Elephants and flowers (Yeah)
The one who will listen when all others will not (All others will not)
There will be peace for those who love god a lot

Here we go
Love the one who is love (Love)
The one who gives us the power, (Power)
The one who made everything (What?)
Elephants and flowers (What will he do?)
The one who will listen when all others will not
There will be peace for those who love God a lot

[Intro]
One time for my niggas
One time
Two times for my women
Two times
One time
Said
One time for my niggas
One time
Two times for my women
Two times

[Verse 1:]
Puts on her make up just to make up
For all the feelins that she could never make up
Her little sister asks her
Why you put that all over your face
She tell her shut up worry about yourself instead of me
Puts on a print thong and a tight black dress
Then she heads to the party
Meets up with her boyfriend
They go upstairs
And he turns off the lights
He fucks her then he pass her to his friends on the right
Bout like five niggas
Violatin' his girl
Felt like she was in a dream it couldn't happen to her
Pinned down feelin' so worthless
Her body shatterin' now wonderin' what if
She could get away from this shit
If the Lord could just grant her one wish
She screams and she screams but the niggas just tell her
Shhhh
Sometimes she wanna cry my  nigga
But inside her pride says she just can't my nigga
Sometimes she wanna cry my  nigga
But inside her pride says she just can't my nigga
So she just keep it to herself
And can't get close to nobody else
I know it gets hard to cope with it
And when it all boils down you ain't alone in this

[Verse 2:]
Nah you ain't alone in this
Just a nigga who seems like he's so souless
Sticks to one lied told
Bros over hoes
Never coincides with love anymore
Truth this nigga was a loveable guy
Heartbroken by a women who just fed him lies
Bought her flowers every week
He was sprung out his mind
No he fucks dumb bitches never worry bout they feelin's
Cause he so lost in this lost world
Wants a bad bitch but a good girl
He finds a good one
He treats em like dirt
Then he wonders why he can never fall in first
Went from a young Carlton
To a young Fresh Prince
Doggin' these hoes to the bone
Wonderin' if he can ever commit
You see I'm talkin' bout me
I just can't get close anymore

Sometimes I wanna cry my nigga
But inside my pride says I'm a man my nigga
Sometimes I wanna cry my nigga
But inside my pride says I just can't my nigga
So I just keep it to myself
And can't get close to nobody else
I know it gets hard to cope my nigga
But when it all boils down
You ain't alone my nigga

[Outro]
I can't get close
I can't get close
I can't get close
I can't get close
I can't get close
I can't get close
I can't get close
I can't get close

[Verse 1]
Her names Prudence but that bitch is freaky
Say patience but that girl is needy
Is you livin' for the crew?
Or is you just livin'?
Girl shut up
I'm too damn busy

[Hook]
Tell me she a fan
Tell me that she love the band
Tell me she just wanna fuck
Girl, I know I know I know

Tell me he a fan
Tell me I'm the fuckin' man
Tell me that I'm fuckin' cold
Boy, I know I know I know

I know I'm weak
I know I'm weak
I know it
I know it
I know it
I know it
I know I'm weak
I know I'm weak
I know I'm weak
I know it
I know it
I know it
I know it
I know I'm weak

[Hook]
Tell me she a fan
Tell me that she love the band
Tell me she just wanna fuck
Girl, I know I know I know

Tell me he a fan
Tell me I'm the fuckin' man
Tell me that I'm fuckin' cold
Boy, I know I know I know

I know it I know it
I know it I know it
I know it I know it
I know

[Outro]
Give me love
Give me love
Give me love
Give me give me give me love
Give me love give me
Give me love give me
Give me love give me
Give me love give me

[Verse 1: Aminé]
She 25
25
Went back to school
Cause she lost her job
Takin' 25 credits just to get some leverage
Payin' $2,500 every damn semester
Professors never recognize her
Always skippin' class cause nobody taught her manners
Then she heads home unlike a vagabond
Evicted like her ex's dick is never let her back in
So she head to her friends just to kick it for a bit
Tried to get some brew
Only got 25 cents
But copped a new weave
Shit like 25 inch
Got a 25 waist with them 34 hips
Had dreams but the struggle got to her
Said fuck her damn job
I'mma let niggas maneuver
In and now she got no friends
And now she cryin' on kitchen floor because she so hopeless

[Hook]
Life is never promised
You gotta struggle for your hustle if you really want it
You got dreams, you got dreams, who fuckin' doesn't?
Gotta struggle for your hustle if you really want it

Life is never promised
You gotta struggle for your hustle if you really want it
You got dreams, you got dreams, who fuckin' doesn't?
Gotta struggle for your hustle if you really want it

[Verse 2: Aminé]
He 25
Minus 5
Penalized for his crimes so he did some time
Stressed out, was thinkin' suicide
Copped a 9
Then he broke down and cried
Couldn't do it
Felt like he was stupid
At least 25 angels went and helped them bullets
25s on his 05' Impala
Had bitches jumpin' for him with that goddamn hydraulics
Wizard was that the sizzurp' controlled him
Caught a 25 bitch just for 25 sticks
Got lucky
But he never learned his lesson
Went to the Louis store
Stole like 25 belts and wallets
Plus he had no knowledge
Cops was like 2 to 5 blocks from his house
And tried to get away but the feds just caught him
Tried to get his wallet
But stereotypes got him shot and
He singin'

[Hook]
Life is never promised
You gotta struggle for your hustle if you really want it
You got dreams, you got dreams, who fuckin' doesn't?
Gotta struggle for your hustle if you really want it

Life is never promised
You gotta struggle for your hustle if you really want it
You got dreams, you got dreams, who fuckin' doesn't?
Gotta struggle for your hustle if you really want it

[Verse 3: Tos]
25 to life
25 to life
I got 20 on the paddle
Fuck puttin' up fight
Fuck puttin' up fight
Its the weekend
It's the freakin weekend
I need a freak in the deep end
Past 25 feet in
This past week got me thinkin'
The hardest part about my life is
Trynna write in
16 lines how my life is
Times spent priceless
Still try to bite in
So I want it like ninety
So I wonder like Stevie
What's wrong
What's right
Two chicks
One black one white
But the same at night, oh my
Okay fuck monogamy
Need at least dos
And as long as both need Tos
No problemo they gone get what they want
They gone get this work
Fuck all your feelings
We all living tryin' to make a livin'
Harder for a 5 tryin' make a killin'
Hard day worker just to spend it all sinnin'
Lord willin'
Stop being fearful and careless
Stop being fearless and careful
Lookin' in the mirror like look at you
You a king I should kneel to you
New folks couldn't say no hablo ingles
Nights and nightmares and then the day starts right here
And time probably die here
Can't tell if I'm alive here
Like

[Hook]
Life is never promised
You gotta struggle for your hustle if you really want it
You got dreams, you got dreams, who fuckin' doesn't?
Gotta struggle for your hustle if you really want it

Life is never promised
You gotta struggle for your hustle if you really want it
You got dreams, you got dreams, who fuckin' doesn't?
Gotta struggle for your hustle if you really want it

Life is never promised
You gotta struggle for your hustle if you really want it
You got dreams, you got dreams, who fuckin' doesn't?
Gotta struggle for your hustle if you really want it

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone
I know it's hard away from home
And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin' to your significant other all night long

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Verse 2: Poo Bear]
Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Try to protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing, oh

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Verse 1]
What's up
It's Né
I talk my weight
If you don't know
I'm from west coast
Momma worked more OT
Than them kicks you see on Kobe
Daddy's life is slippin'
Cause he used to smokey smokey
Scholarships are trippin'
Got no mothafuckin' money
Plus I'm always late to class
Oh Lord help me pass
Never did these bitches right
Did these bitches right
I just hope these niggas treat my little sister right
Oh the irony
Oh the irony
Lord forgive me for all of my tendencies

[Hook]
I said I know
Oh yes I know
You put me on Earth for a reason
But can I know
Can I know
What's the reason
Oh what's the reason
My emotions
Got me feelin' like I
Don't know myself
My devotion got me feelin
So damn lonely
My emotions
Got me feelin' like I
Don't know myself
My devotion got me feelin
So alone

[Verse 2]
So many things that I've been thinkin' bout'
The pills, the rent, the checks, my ex and all my fuckin' owns
Oh yes I run it now
I'm trynna figure out what my purpose is
Oh what's my purpose
Purpose
Feelin' mundane on this Monday
Shots to the head got me feelin' insane
I'm rollin through commotion
While I'm soakin' in emotions
The doctor tell me that I need some extra pills of lovin'
So what do I do
I tell my girly bible
And then she just gets her bible
And pray to the Lord for my sins
Then I think about my loses and my wins

[Hook]
I said I know
Oh yes I know
You put me on Earth for a reason
But can I know
Can I know
What's the reason
Oh what's the reason
My emotions
Got me feelin' like I
Don't know myself
My devotion got me feelin
So damn lonely
My emotions
Got me feelin' like I
Don't know myself
My devotion got me feelin
So alone

[Verse 3]
Oh me
Oh my
My emotions
Oh me

Never compromise to survive
I'mma get this shit, either if I die or I'm alive
White rag
White horse
White torch
I'mma end up on your screen, if you like it or you don't
Never compromise to survive
I'mma get this shit, either if I die or I'm alive
White rag
White horse
White torch
I'mma end up on your screen, if you like it or you don't

[Verse 1:]
Loving gets so hard to do
You couldn't know
What my heart's been through
Oh love it gets so hard to do
Its because of my emotions
Loving gets so hard to do
It's because of your emotions
Oh loving you
It gets so hard to do
Loving you
It gets so hard to do
My emotions
Don't know how to cope it
My emotions
Don't know what to do
My emotions
I am my emotions
My emotions

[Verse 1]
I'm from the west
She from the east
Columbiana
Said she like my beats
Said she from the heights
She tell me what she like
I tell her what I want
She said me up tonight
She tired of her man
Does he please her
No way
She said be here in 10
I said okay
So I'm on my way

[Hook]
I'm on my way

Girl I know you're fiendin'
So I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
My poetry
Too potent for pussies to be
I roll it deep
We livin we livin you see
She hit me up
She tell me she need it
She need it
I tell her okay
Give me a minute
Whether a bus or a bike
A scooter or hike
I travel like a mile for the pussy
I run inside of your crib
Take you down like we in spaceship
My wordplay play
But my words okay
A young mothafucka who don't play no games
I'mma talk like I am the shit
But really I don't think these niggas understand
Shawty I know you need me
Oh I said shawty I know you need me
I know your man don't treat you right
So just call me if you need me so

[Hook]
I'm on my way

[Intro]
Okay, okay, look. Check this out:
It's B.o.b, and what y'all listening to is the LIG "Hi! My Name Is Bob" mixtape

[Verse 1]
Well let me tell y'all a story, not too long ago (Uh, huh)
It was the strangest place, I ever seen before (Uh, huh)
I swear I lost my mind, like I had seen a ghost (Uh, huh)
A feeling came over me, and then my body froze (Uh, huh)
And I was terrified, in the middle of the night, middle of the night (Uh, huh)
And I was terrified, in the middle of the night, middle of the night (Uh, huh)
And I was terrified, in the middle of the night, middle of the night (Uh, huh)
I said I was terrified

[Chorus]
And so I kept guessing, maybe it's just a dream
But I ain't quite get it, maybe it's just a dream
And so I kept guessing, maybe it's just a dream, a dream, a dream
Maybe it's just a dream, a dream, a dream

[Verse 2]
Tripping from place to place, witnessing face to face
Where that 

[attainment train?] to praise the day by dingling chains of faith
Tears-less in their gangster ways, triggers go bang and bang
Yes I am feeling the pain, cause 

[?] a change to switch up your database
Maybe you'll 

[wreck?] it some day, but don't be terrified, in the middle of the night, middle of the night (Uh, huh)
You don't have to be terrified, in the middle of the night, middle of the night (Uh, huh)
You don't have to be terrified, in the middle of the night, middle of the night (Uh, huh)
You don't have to be terrified

[Chorus]
And so I kept guessing, maybe it's just a dream
But I ain't quite get it, maybe it's just a dream
And so I kept guessing, maybe it's just a dream, a dream, a dream
Maybe it's just a dream, a dream, a dream

[Hook]
Shawty wanna ride in my spaceship now
Said she likes my whip
And she like my style
Shawty wanna ride in my spaceship now
If she gettin' tired I'mma take that down
Take that down
If she gettin' tired I'mma take that down

[Verse 1]
Senorita called bout like 8 PM
Asked me about my whip and my spaceship
And she said does it go
Rooooom like a jet
I said hella naw girl it go shoooom like a ship
If she like the way I talk
Probably like the way I walk
If she wanna fuck tonight bet I use a rubber
I just want to hit the lights
She just wants to get inside
I'm just tryna give her dick tonight
Charm on my arm
She just love my demeanor
She says
I'm just just gone to the morn
She just twerk it
Twerk it
Twerk it for a don
What's the reason
For your tease on
I just wanna take you to Mars
You know I don't play no games
You know I don't show no shame
If you playin' with me to the left like Beyoncé

[Hook]
Shawty wanna ride in my spaceship now

[Verse 2]
Now shawty
I wanna ride on the milky way
With me
I think I know why she wants to
So she rides upon me
And then she lies to you
She tells me back harder harder
You know I've been looking for the one
You know I just want the above
You don't want what I want
Cause I'm done for whatever
Fly by Mars and we flyin' by Pluto
This that song we play while we foolin'
I take you down
No time for coolin'
Fuck then I pull us up on neutral

[Hook]
Shawty wanna ride in my spaceship now
Said she likes my whip
And she like my style
Shawty wanna ride in my spaceship now
If she gettin' tired I'mma take that down
Take that down
If she gettin' tired I'mma take that down

[Outro]
Take you down

He picked me up in his silver Corolla
Then we got the rest of the crew
And some bitches up to get food
You know us niggas we just too damn loud
The Taco Bell employee had to calm my nigga down
Threw the taco in the trash
Then we mobbed up to the back
Mark started rollin' papers while we checked up for the feds
Refer in the air

I don't even smoke
I was just chillin' with my crew
Next thing I know we gotta rush the fuck up
Cause the bitches in the car yellin' hurry the fuck up

[Hook]
Just another friday night with the homies

It's feelin' like a summer night

Of your house
Fuck these cat and mouse

Maybe get inside your house
It's feelin' like one of those nights
I want you by my side
Why can't you get it right
I'm tired of
All these ups and downs
Come inside my house
Maybe we can work it out

[Verse 1: Aminé]
I'm tired of all these games
I wanna know what I gotta do
Your momma and your brother interupt everytime I try to fuck
Uh oh, time is wastin'
Let me through the back maybe the basement
Legs in the air bout' to hit this kitty cat
And I never really front so I hit it from the back
Then your daddy walks in
And I'm like oh shit
Pull my fuckin' pants up while I ran out that bitch like
Every time I love you
And every time I fuck you
It's like a retrograde
Love never works out anyways

[Hook: Aminé & Che (Rapper)]
It's feelin' like a summer night

A woman who ain't of cooking
And 24/7 I love the way you lookin'
Baby you know I wanna' fuck you but time is so wrong
Shit I really love you but between you and me it gets over short
Like every time I love you
Every time I fuck you
It's like a retrograde
Love never works out anyways

[Hook: Aminé & Che (Rapper)]
It's feelin' like a summer night
Will I get it right
Just waitin' outside
Of your house
Fuck these cat and mouse
Just trynna lift your blouse
Maybe get inside your house
It's feelin' like one of those nights
I want you by my side
Why can't you get it right
I'm tired of
All these ups and downs
Come inside my house
Maybe we can work it out

[Hook]
When I'm sad I wanna
And when I'm mad I wanna
When I'm stressed I wanna
Put the liquor to my face and
Party
Party
Party
Party
Party

[Verse 1]
Usually this isn't me
See the devil creep before my feet
A lot of stress on me right now
So I said fuck it I'll move down
My lifestyle really to busy to enjoy
A lot of people putting pressure on me to be the boy
Wanna ask for shit
Wanna nag for shit
You gotta realize boy
You ain't entitled to shit
Gotta work hard just to play harder
Learned that from my nigga Dre at a dundada
Shots of patron got me so louder
Got 14 bitches man they gettin' devoured
Always on a flight just to head to New York
It's the big city
Where rich means broke
So I grind my ass off
Just to hope for some hope
Gamble with my life just to see what I've wrote

[Hook]
When I'm sad I wanna
And when I'm mad I wanna
When I'm stressed I wanna
Put the liquor to my face and
Party
Party
Party
Party
Party

[Verse 2]
Liquor in my soul now
Bitches on the floor now
Feelin' like I don't care
Hand me another drink now
The pain the pain
All in my veins
Got me feelin' like I am insane
Shawty bust it open for a nigga
So I'm feelin' like I wanna
Get a table for my peacoat
Set it over there so I can get my fuckin' freak on
Party to the mornin'
Forget about that weak pishpause
Maybe get my dick sucked
Tonight I'm feelin' like the opposite of Oliver Tate
Tonight I'm feelin' like the opposite of Oliver Tate

[Hook]
When I'm sad I wanna
And when I'm mad I wanna
When I'm stressed I wanna
Put the liquor to my face and
Party
Party
Party
Party
Party

[Hook]
I've been searchin for you baby
Do you want to get to know me

Grabbed your hand and we danced all night baby

[Verse 1]

Do you want to love anymore
Baby I just want to dance some more
My one two step
Somethin' you can't get
Got me like oh we
Girl you oh so set
My P.Y.T
Never D.I.E
Oh so seductive by your L-O-V-E
Whenever you need me just call
When ever you wanna funk I'll be like
Salt to my pepper
The bitter to my sweet
The one that I rememeber
The girl of my dreams
Its one of these nights to get this song with you
And I'm lovin every moment that I dance with you

[Hook]
I've been searchin for you baby
Do you want to get to know me

Grabbed your hand and we danced all night baby
And I'm lovin it
And I'm lovin it

And I'm lovin it
And I'm lovin it

[Verse 2]
I'm a bad boy
She a bad girl
I wanna know
If I can get one dance with you
All night till the mornin' inside
Now you're yearnin' for me
Cause I'm certain you love me
Look I'm broke as a joke
But I just want to know
Can we live till the end and we can just go
Shawty please don't go
Shawty please don't
Salt to my pepper
The bitter to my sweet
The one that I rememeber
The girl of my dreams
Its one of these nights to get this song with you
And I'm lovin every moment that I dance with you

[Hook]
I've been searchin for you baby
Do you want to get to know me
Saw you from across the room baby
Grabbed your hand and we danced all night baby
And I'm lovin it
And I'm lovin it
And I'm lovin it

[Outro]
Don't

[Verse 1: Robin Kim]
You took me swimming drunk in band
Beneath the milky way we slept
Your folks don't have to know that we've got whiskey breath

[Hook]
And I'm staring at your eyes like
I'm thinkin' I knew you from my past life
And I'm staring at your eyes like
And girl you light me up like a night light

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Told me you love me today
Beneath the river where my heart lays
My mother riddled me that wisemen make mistakes

[Hook]
And I'm staring at your eyes like
I'm thinkin' I knew you from my past life
And I'm staring at your eyes like
And girl you light me up like a night light

[Verse 3:]
How deep is the ocean
I don't care at all
Six miles if you count em'

[Hook]
And I'm staring at your eyes like
I'm thinkin' I knew you from my past life
And I'm staring at your eyes like
And girl you light me up like a night light

[Verse 4: Robin Kim]
You taught me how to smoke all wrong
I saw a ghost from church years past
My parents still don't know I was scared to death

[Verse 5: Aminé]
Unholy thoughts parading in mind
I see you grin which makes me smile
When will you realize that
One day you'll be mine

[Verse 6:]
Floating around our backs turn red
We lick our rainbow covered cones
Then we zipped up to sleep in our respective beds

[Outro]
Ask me how deep the ocean is
Why should I?
Come on just ask me
Why?
Because I know the answer
Oh do you?
Yeah I do
How deep is the ocean?
I'm not gonna say
I'm brokenhearted
The ocean is six miles deep
Good

[Verse 1]
She say I'm not worthy
She think I'm too thirsty
So I leave her alone
Now she said she really want me
Look I don't know know games
Look I don't show no shame
Bitch I don't want to love
All a nigga want to do it cut
Oh she light skinned
Shawty kinda bouji
But I like them tits
Wait and that ass ridiculous
For her but that don't mean shit
Boy what the fuck you mean
Never let a woman come between
Friendships and that business what the fuck you think
Fuck foreplay
Girl this ain't what the fuck I play for
I'm trynna get straight to it
If you you ain't with that I'll find someone who is
One time for my niggas
Two times for my niggas
And if she 

[?] all night
Tell her light these niggas

[Hook]
Can I cut right now
Can I cut right now
Can I cut right now
Can I cut
Can I cut right now

[Verse 2]
Bitch I'm back now
Bitches want to know who that is
I put the smack down
Like a nigga Stone Cold Steve Austin
Too much on her mind
So we fuckin' all the time
Call me Papi Aminé
I'm breakin' your bitches
And makin' a threeway
She a freak in disguise
So guess what
I throw her legs to the sky
She just want that dick
Call me Mr. Né when you want that shit
I don't know your name
I don't show now shame
Bitch I don't want to love
All a nigga wanna do is cut
Feel on the tits
While she givin me neck
I'm just breakin' her neck when her back on the wall
Act like I'm frontin' whenever we cuttin'
Cause use just want lovin and maybe a call
Shout out to baby that ass is so crazy
I'm just tryin' to come just excuse on my lateness
Bitches I love em
But always keep frontin'
So I made a song for your girl and your lover

[Hook]
Can I cut right now
Can I cut right now
Can I cut right now
Can I cut
Can I cut right now
So many people get caught up in trying to remake their first album and it's impossible for me to make another College Dropout, but I could make the best Graduation and best 808's that I could make. And that's how you, I think, keep advancing as an artist. So few, you know, Hip Hop artists have ever advanced: their songs on their seventh, eight album sound exactly like the songs of their first album. More than a artist, I'm a real person and real people grow and I wanna just sing my growth

[Chorus]
I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my lights
But my sight is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
But how'd you'd get there
Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell

[Verse 1]
I got my life and it's my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So good night, I'm headed out the door..
After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
And that you know
That you know

[Bridge]
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know

[Verse 2]
Okay, I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gon' do mine
You do you and I'm just gon' be fine
Okay, I got you out my mind
And the night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well, now you know

[Bridge 2]
Tell everybody, everybody that you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know
Tell everybody, everybody that you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know
That you know, ohhh

[Intro]
Drop it, drop it

[Verse 1]
'Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'd turn my life to Stephen King's
Up late night like she on parole
Checking everything like I'm on parole
I told her it's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You need to stop it now
Drop it, drop it

[Verse 2]
Just looking at your history
You're like the girl from Misery
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her it’s some things she don't need to know
She never let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You need to stop it now
Drop it, drop it

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want no Robocop
You move is like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop
Somebody please make her stop
Make her stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, s-stop
Somebody make her stop, stop, stop, stop stop, stop, stop, s-stop
And we won’t stop

[Interlude]
I’d like to welcome everybody to VH1 storytellers
I go by the name of – Kanye, West
You could’ve been anywhere in the world this evening, but you wouldn’t be as happy as you are right now
No, you wouldn’t be as happy as you are right now
We’re gonna run through some of the new songs and some of the old songs
And tell you where the whole thing went wrong, and tell you were the whole thing went wrong that forced me to write these songs
For my love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love

[Bridge]
That spoiled little LA girl
You just an LA girl
That spoiled little LA girl
You just an LA girl
Oh you're kidding me
You must be joking
Or you are smoking
Oh oh you're kidding me
Oh you're kidding me
Haha that was a good one
Your first good one in a while
Your first good one in a while
You need to stop it now
Go ahead and stop it now
You need to stop it now

[Interlude]
You know, I really like that part of the album
When I said
That was a good one, your first good one in a while
‘Cause I love Tenacious D and I listen to them all the time
And I feel that was the closest I got to like a real Jack Black moment
And there was a lot more that I said, I said
We got to the movies and we laugh at different jokes
It went on and on and on and on and on
But I just narrowed it down to:

[Bridge]
Spoiled little LA girl, you just an LA girl
Spoiled little LA girl, you just an LA girl
Spoiled little LA girl, man I love these LA girls
These LA girls, man I love these LA girls

[Chorus]
Okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now

[Outro]
Cause I don't want no Robocop
You move is like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop?
Somebody please make her stop
Make her stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, s-stop

[Eminem]
I fucking hate you, I can't stand you
I'll rip your titties off, and them, I'll hand you
You're ugly, you won't hug me, you're dumb, you're stupid
I'm fat, lazy and crazy, you think I'm Shady?
I am Shady, you stupid bitch
Take your silicone implants, now you gotta Slim chance of
Fuckin' with me ever again
I got your silicone, you can't fuck with me
But I'm still alone, in my cell, mad as hell
Might as well give you some more shit to sell
Fuck!

[Intro]
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like "love to start"
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you, Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these ****  got me
I hate these **** more than a Nazi

[Chorus: Dwele & Connie Mitchell]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know?
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)
What do I know? Know
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)

[Verse 2]
I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doin' my thang
I know I was foul, baby
Ayy, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Frontin', though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar

[Chorus: Dwele & Connie Mitchell]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know?
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)
What do I know? Know
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
But what do you know?
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)
What do you know? Know
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)

You know, I’m ‘sposed to talk about what some of these songs mean
And some of the stuff is so personal to me
And some of the things I’ve been through is so real
In the form that I’m ‘sposed to break down certain things
And this is one of the first times, because I feel like I’m placed in front of the audience right now
And uhm, certain things are just hard for me to talk about
And I’m sorry VH1 for that
But it uhm, certain things are too serious

And I stand before you, just a human being trying to improve under the microscope
Just the star of the Truman show
As every day I take as calculated
Every time I put on my shoes
Under the flashing lights
Just got an email today
A new book coming out
Doctor Adams: the Truth about Donda West
What the media doesn’t want you to know

And you know, now that my momma passed
Would she really want me to put myself in a situation where I go to jail?
FOR KILLING ‘EM

Under the flashing lights
And the public perception
Where I feel like I’m always in defense of myself
And I realize that I’ve made some mistakes, but I grow from them
It’s like I’m fighting to be me, but I have to leave the fight
‘Cause it helps everyone else be who they wanna be

That’s a story for your ass…

[Hook]
She talk to me
Oh she talk to me now
She talk to me
Oh she talk to me
Oh she talk to me now
She talk to me now
She talk to me now now
She walk to me now
She walk to me now now
And now you wanna' be
Where I wanna' be
Funny how Adam always wanna trust
And now you wanna be
Where I wanna be
And now your on your knees
Oh the irony
Oh the irony
Oh the irony
I said oh the irony
I said oh the irony

[Verse 1]
I gave you all my love
You told me that
I couldn't fuck
Now you want me to yearn
Ain't it funny how the tables turn
Love is just a pity game
Somethin' I don't like to play
I hit a few or two
Maybe you can calculate
Now you in my room
On your knees
On my daddy long
Baby I'm a nigga
And a nigga gone do what he wants
Either your momma love me even your cousins too
But you went and dropped me for some other dude
You know me
Me no way
And when you on your knees
This is what I say

[Hook]
She talk to me
Oh she talk to me now
She talk to me
Oh she talk to me
Oh she talk to me now
She talk to me now
She talk to me now now
She walk to me now
She walk to me now now
And now you wanna' be
Where I wanna' be
Funny how Adam always wanna trust
And now you wanna be
Where I wanna be
And now your on your knees
Oh the irony
Oh the irony
Oh the irony
I said oh the irony
I said oh the irony

[Verse 2]
You like my style
You like my song
You say Né you the fuckin' bomb
The fact is
You too plastic
And I don't wanna love nobody average
Mr. Bombastic
Mr. Fantastic
Mrs. I done tried to love you but you too selfish
I cut you right
Like I never left
That's probably why I'm gettin this shit off my chest

[Hook]
She talk to me
Oh she talk to me now
She talk to me
Oh she talk to me
Oh she talk to me now
She talk to me now
She talk to me now now
She walk to me now
She walk to me now now
And now you wanna' be
Where I wanna' be
Funny how Adam always wanna trust
And now you wanna be
Where I wanna be
And now your on your knees
Oh the irony
Oh the irony
Oh the irony
I said oh the irony
I said oh the irony

[Verse 1]
It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

[Chorus]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing

[Verse 2]
I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved

[Chorus]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing

[Verse 3]
I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave up, never gave in
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

[Chorus]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing

So amazing, so amazing, so amazing

No matter what, you’ll never take that from me
My reign is as far…
Bring it back down though

It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
Never take that from me
No take it back down, take it back, keep going

It feels like you're on trial sometimes
And in a relationship, you can also be on trial
And be convicted with no jury

And this song was sort of like that moment where someone tells you ain't, you ain’t - you gotta say I am - an emancipation, if you will
Cause you can't take that from me
My self-esteem

So whether it something in your own home, or a situation like mine
Where you're under the microscope of the media

Never let them take that from you
I never let them, let them take that from me

You have to be amazing sometimes
I and I know I do not always state popular opinion

Amazing, Michael Jackson, amazing
Michael Phelps, amazing
OJ Simpson, amazing
Is he not?!
What he did when he did what he did, was he not amazing though?

I think I saw in a movie - I get my quotes from movies cause I don't read
Or from like, go figure, real life or something
Like live real live, talk to real people, get information, ask people, questions
And it was something about, you either die a superhero or you live to become the villain
I'M CHILLIN'
I'm chillin'

So many times they try to make me out to be the villain
I don't understand what I did
I apologize for acting like a bitch at award-shows
It's an award-show, didn't kill anyone
But yet and still I apologize for my ungraciousness

I was a spoiled little Chicago-boy, who got all these awards as he came in the door and people clapped and sang his praises
And he soaked it all up and believed his own hype
To the point where he could not lose
And if anyone didn't pick him, they could not choose
As he swooves with the who's-who's and broke all the rules
And even lost his cool
Hey, nothing new
Now they don't like you, hey they don't like you
Look at what you've done boy, trying to be the number one boy

And I'm thirty-one years now and I've leaned from my mistakes

Just play pianos...

Super-hero music, pain

This hardcore, so hardcore
That's why I sing:

I'm a monster, I'm maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave up, never gave in
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing

[Verse 1]
Look at all the choices, the choices in this world
World spreading no freedom, freedom for the boys and the girls
But the boys and the girls they don’t know, what love is like
Love is like appreciation mixed in a double cup of Sprite

[Pre-Chorus]
So can we go?
No left or right
You go your way
And I'll go mine

[Chorus x2]
Cause this is my time
And I won’t waste it
Thinking 'bout what you gotta say
Cause I'm here to stay

[Verse 2]
Look at all the places, places that I've been
It doesn't come easy, you gotta have strength
And when it goes down and it’s all said and done
You gotta stand up so there’s no need to run

[Pre-Chorus]
And now that I've made it
I won’t look back no
Sacrifice what meant the most to me
The most to me, yes I did

[Chorus x2]

[Outro]
Look at all the people standing outside
So dedicated
Your love doesn't go unrecognised
Your love doesn't go unrecognised
Let's have some fun now
Get up and touch it
Get up and touch the sky, come on 

[7x]

[Bridge]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Before the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Testify
I'm up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

[Verse 1 - Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got them hits to pop
The doors was closed, I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: "Dawg, in due time!"
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg! You where I am!"
A hip-hop legend, I think I died
In a accident, cause this must be heaven

[Bridge]

[Hook]
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh(Top of the world baby)
(Top top of the world)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh(Top of the world baby)
(On top of the world)

[Verse 2 - Kanye West]
Back when Gucci was the hits to rock
Back when Slick Rick had the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns
Like "Man - these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm going on an airplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

[Bridge]

Now say: I'm, I'm sky high

Feels good to be home, feels good to be home

Are y'all happy you came to VH1 Storytellers?

Get up and touch the sky, come on

I am so disappointed, that I cannot see me perform
Except for on playback
My greatest pain in live, is that I'll never see me perform
So you are welcome to know a pleasure, that I will never have

Come on 

[20x]

This song is what inspired 808's and Heartbreak more than anything
Because we used do this at the end of the tour every night
And I would do it for – how many of you saw the Glow In The Dark tour in the room tonight?
Thank you so much, for coming to the tour

So y’all remember at the end of the show I would do this song
And I would say some inspirational words and I would sing
And I had the opportunity to just kind of do it and play it off
But I discovered that I love to sing
So much and to my thing and harmonize and just go up and down and just fuck around
I really feel like a vessel
And I open my mouth and God will let beautiful words flow through
That’s why I realized that he chose me and he has a path for me
Because half the things that come out, I can’t be responsible for
And I guess he just wants me to say more and more and more and never be insecure and always be sure, be sure
And he will give me the strength I need to endure, for sure
As I tour and bring the pure
So much more, more, for sure
For your entertainment, education and relation
To take away your hesitation and segregation

In a country full of immigrants, where no one really was born here, but separated here
It’s a beautiful thing that in a country that was so divided by the concept of black and white
We now have a black and white president

And this is what the future is to me
The juxtaposition: two things that you think don’t go together

When a black, super-Hip-Hop-dressed dude gets on an elevator and there’s an old lady with Chanel and she grabs her purse
I’ll give you a cliché example
What would happen if they actually talk to each other?
What would she learn? What would he learn?

When the rich man hopping out the Lincoln Town Car, passes by the homeless person
And they actually talk to each other
What would he learn? What would he learn?

If a black man, that came from Chicago and was taught to stand so far away from gay people, ‘cause you do not want to be accused of being gay
Was to talk to a gay person
What would he learn? What did I learn?

I learned that people in Chicago was wrong
And I’ve been an asshole all along
A lot of things that you learn are wrong
So don’t be an asshole too long, too long, too long
You can’t be an asshole too long
You can’t be an asshole too long

‘Cause the more you know, the more you grow, the more responsibility you have show what you know
And give everything that you got to give, baby that’s the reason God let me live through the accident without practicing
Okay, got to bring this up and bring it back again
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Alright 

[7x]
No publishing Outkast, please
Alright 

[5x]
Shout out to three G’s
One of the few dressed quite as fresh as me

[Verse 1]
Why would she make calls out the blue?
Now I'm awake, sleepless in June

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, unless you will

[Verse 2]
Mrs. So Fly crash-lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, you will, one day you will

[Verse 3]
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool then lose control

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Say aye aye aye
Don't say you will, I pray you will, I pray you will

[Verse 4]
I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don’t say you will, unless you will, I pray you will

[Instrumental Break]

[Extended Chorus]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don’t say you will
Hey hey hey hey…
Don't say you will
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t say

[Outro/Monologue]
Keep the music on

This is a
This song was written for
A special moment in my life
Someone so special, that I love forever

And you know like, when you break up with somebody
And you have those times where you wanna see ‘em again
And you’re trying to make plans on a Friday night, in New York City
And you clear your whole schedule for this person, even though you’re not together no more

‘Cause there’s nothing better than, someone you know and love
Even if you know you can’t love them no more
You can’t love them no more

Today, take presidents over anybody you dating or going out with or just hooking up with
And she knows who she is
To have someone so special in your life, that you’re inspired by them
I ask myself, as I date
What am I looking for?
The requirement of this position is inspirement
The requirement is inspirement
And I am higher in
But also firing
Also firing, firing
I wanted to express that story better, it didn’t come out as good as I wanted
Wasn’t as poignant as I wanted to make it for my favorite story and for my ode to my loves
Or I make the life
I was very rich
Already

But if I think back to when I was making the College Dropout, thinking was this what I expected?
I mean, I didn’t expect the losses and you expect everything to work out well
But I expected real life
And then I suffered the worst pains to help me to grow
So those experiences, I never ask to take them away from me
Because they’re all in God’s plan and help make me the man I am today
And help make me more of a soldier and a vessel
Because if I hadn’t suffered those losses, I might be scared or too scared to fight the war on traditional thinking
I'm about to go crazy
I'm about to go crazy
We boutta go crazy
Go crazy

[Intro]
Better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmomma
Ain't the only girl callin me "baby"
And if you feelin me now
Then put yo' hands up in the sky, let me hear you say
Heyy, heyy, like we always do at this time

[Hook]
I go for mine, I gots to shine
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
I, gotta go for mine, I gots to shine
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
Imma get on the TV momma and I'mma
Yo, I'mma put shit down
(Ayy) ayyy (ayy) ayyy
(Ayy) ayyy (ayy) 

[I'm good]

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the good life, where homies who sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living spree
Man, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A. it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y. summertime Chi
Ahhhhh! Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk,I pop the hood - Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look - sorry!

[Bridge]
Yo it's gots to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks - Lawry's
50 told me go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate, watch the money pile up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Welcome to the good life! Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
Cause they got mo' (ass than the models)
The good life, so keep it comin' with the bottles
Cause she feel booze like she bombed at Apollo
The good life, it feel like Philly
It feel like D.C. it feel like D.C
It feel like V.A. or the Bay or Yay
Ayy!
Homey tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood?
Like I'm new in the hood
The only thing I wish, I wish a nigga would
He probably think he could
But, but, I don't think he should
50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen Snakes on a Plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin money's not everything not havin it is
I was splurgin on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas
I always had a passion for flashin
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined
The good life
Everybody wants the good life
Welcome to the good life
Let me hear you say:
Heyy, heyy, ooooh I'm GOOD!
Better than the life I lived
When I though that I was gonna go crazy

[Hook x3]

[Intro]
How could you be so?

[Chorus]
(In the night I hear them talk)
The coldest story ever told
(Somewhere far along this road)
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
(Heartless)

[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me yo
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayyo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayyo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna give me back and you gonna show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend
Well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

[Chorus]
In the night (I hear em talk)
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
Hey, heartless
How could you be so heartless?

[Verse 2]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak, so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon’ see
You'll never find nobody, never find nobody better than me

[Chorus]
In the night I hear em talk (Nobody better than me)
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
Hey, heartless
How could you be so heartless?

[Bridge 1]
Talk, and talk, and talk, and talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know about me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gon’ keep hating me
And we just gon’ be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon’ take off tonight into the night

[Chorus]
In the night I hear them talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

[Bridge 2]
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so?
How could you be so?

[Chorus]
In the night I hear them talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so, a woman so…

[Verse 3]
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no Y.S.L. that they could sell
To take my mind out of this hell
Or my heart out of this jail
There are no clothes that I could buy
That could turn, back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could turn back, a piece of real life
Real life, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like?
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like?
To live a real life
I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy
People say, you keep it too real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy

[Verse 4]
With a woman so heartless
So heartless
Is it my fault that I make you heartless?
Maybe I made you heartless, but regardless
That don’t give you the reason to act retarded
Yeah we fall, but you started
You started
No, no, no, nobody knows
Nobody knows

[Verse 5]
Did it have to go that far?
Did we have to take it that far?
You say things some time that you just can’t take back
Take back, take back
You’re gonna hit me one day, so take that, so take that
And that’s something you just can’t take back
Take back, take back
Never do nothing you can’t take back, take back

[Bridge 3]
Does this hurtful comment have a receipt?
Does this staggering piece of truth
That was never told, have an expiration date?
Or can I take that back?
Take that back

[Verse 6]
And I guess it’s in the nighttime, I hear ‘em talk, talk
The coldest story ever told, the coldest story ever told
The coldest story ever told, the coldest story ever told
Ever told, never told
When I say the coldest story I mean the voices in my head
When I lay down in my bed, the voices in my head
When another woman is beside me in my bed

[Chorus]
In the night I hear ‘em talk
Coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Did I make you be heartless?
Did I make you be heartless?

[Verse 7]
50, look at me now
Singing on the ground
With my pink shirt on
Does this look gay to you?
Well, I don’t know what else to say to you
Look at me now
I’m on the ground
And my heart can still not be found
‘Cause I’ve looked all around
And my heart will never be found
I looked all around
And my heart’s nowhere to be found
Where is my heart right now?

[Bridge 4]
With a woman so heartless
How could you be so?
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so?

[Chorus]
In the night I hear ‘em talk
Coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
I lost my soul
To somebody so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, "No, no, no, n-nooo!"
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Hook]
So keep your love lockdown - your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown - your love lockdown
You keep your love lockdown - your love lockdown
You keep your love lockdown - you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep my-self, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, we can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I’m bout to go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

[Hook]

So keep your love locked down, so keep your love lockdown
So keep your love locked down, so keep your love lockdown

Is anybody in the house right now in love right now?
In love right now, well keep your love lockdown
If anybody in the house right now is in love right now
Try your best to keep your love lockdown
Keep your love lockdown
Keep it on
Is it better to have loved and lost, than to never have loved at all?

This brings us to the end of my VH1 Storyteller
Thank you for
Being my shrink today and the stage as my couch
Thank you for allowing me to get some things off my chest and out of my mind
The ghosts out of my head so they will not haunt me at night
And just for this moment as I hear clap and hear you scream, just for this moment
I feel alright

My pain shall be your pleasure, my torment and tragedy

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?
Where’s the finish line?
Are we at the finish line?
Running for the finish line
Running for the finish line
Are we at the finish line?
Are we at the finish line?
Are we at the finish line?
Are we at the finish line?
You run for the finish line
You run for the finish line
I’m not ready to fi-finish life
But I’m on the finish line
So I run from the finish line
I run from the finish line
‘Cause I’m not ready to finish life
I gotta run from the finish life
So keep your love lockdown, so keep your love
You keep your love
We’re low…

Not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, "No, no, no, no, no, noo
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret cold
So everybody else don’t have to know

So keep your love lockdown
You keep your love lockdown 

[3x]

So keep your love lockdown 

[3x]
You keep your love lockdown and you lose

Is anybody in the house right now that’s in love right now?
You gotta keep your love locked down, you gotta keep your love
Promise me, promise me, promise me, promise me
Please, please, promise me
Please, promise me, please
That you will keep your love lockdown
Just try to keep your love lockdown

You don’t want to make the music
I’m forced to make right now
I know it sounds good and all
But I would rather have my love lockdown
That number one hit don’t mean shit
If it’s nobody to celebrate with
To celebrate with, to levitate with

You gotta keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
You lose

You can not handle it all by yourself, no, no, no, no, no, no
It's not yours, this battle is not yours
It's the Lord's not yours

This battle is not yours, the Lord is the only one who can fight it
He wants to use you as His vessel so be open to Him
It's not yours, no, it's not yours
It's the Lord's, not yours

The battle is not your's
It's the Lord's
Hallelujah, yeah

[Skit: JAY-Z]
People look at you strange, sayin' you changed

And what happens most of the time people change
People change around you because
They startin' treatin' you different because of your success

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
We The Best Music

DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Shit ain't been the same since I came through in that hot shit
They gon' talk about you 'til you ain't got shit
Still gon' talk about you when you got shit
All eyes on Meek, I'm on my Pac shit
Y'all rap niggas on some pop shit
I've been duckin' paparazzi with a pop bitch
Glock .30 in the cockpit
Sippin' dirty, conversatin' with the pilot
Nigga, you ain't seen it, I've been fuckin' up arenas
I'm with double M, the genius
We the motherfuckin' meanest
And the cleanest in a long time
You pussy niggas hatin' on me picked the wrong time
Long line for a limp mink draggin', new bandwagon
Blood drippin' on me lookin' like a nigga stabbed him
I be on the money, bakin' soda in the cabinet
Pyrex, tryna whip a Rollie, makin' magic
Laughin' at you fuck niggas gettin' madder
If I feel threatened, I'ma go and get a ladder
And climb up your chest, nigga
Motherfuck your vest, nigga
Motherfuck your couch, I'm with Khaled, the best, nigga

[Chorus: French Montana]
Ever since a nigga hit the top (uh)

They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, nah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Bullet in the head, they wanna see my shirt red
Live by the code, it's the only way to play it
Benz or the Rolls, Mulsanne overrated
Half these niggas told, cut a deal, they'd take it
Promise to never fold and the bonds still sacred
Had to shake a couple niggas, everybody won't make it
God is the greatest as I'm prayin' in the latest (Woo)
X600 as I swerve, Little Haiti (Woo)
Ou paka bat m'wen, sak pase!
I'm bustin' out the sunroof, nigga, ¡andalé!
My money always comin', no, I'm never on pause
They bring it straight to your door if you a mothafuckin' boss
Let's ride

[Chorus: French Montana]
Ever since a nigga hit the top (uh) (Maybach Music)
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box (oh)
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Hol' up, you ain't got love for me, my nigga?
Ever meet another nigga like me, my nigga?
Are you sure? A nigga flip this shit like Jarl Borg
A nigga did this shit, this hardcore
If you say it, guess it's true though, kudos, I mean but who knows?
Salute to all the real niggas out there findin' the loopholes
Fuck all these fuck niggas, hate when niggas come up, igh!
Hopped off the plane, hit the helicopter (igh!)
Tell these crabs in the barrel we eatin' hella lobster (igh!)
Got hella options, like a college team
Hit these bootleg niggas with the Heisman
Fuck the NCAA, nigga!
Let a young nigga get paid, nigga!
Niggas talkin' down on the crown
Watch them niggas you 'round got you wound
Haters wanna ball, let me tighten up my draw string
Wrong sport, boy, you know you soft as a lacrosse team
RRRAAAAHHH!

[Chorus: French Montana]
Ever since a nigga hit the top (uh)
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box (oh)
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
They don't love you no more, hey
Jewels gotta cop, coupes gotta drop
Shit startin' to change, so you startin' to change, nah

They don't love you no more, nah

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
You don't love me no more?!
All the shit I done for you
You don't love me no more?!

[Verse 1]
She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
She got both feet on the ground and she's burning it down
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
She got her head in the clouds and she's not backing down

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

[Verse 2]
Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try, but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We got our feet on the ground and we're burning it down
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Got our head in the clouds and we're not coming down

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire (Fire, fire)

They fly on

But one last time

[Chorus]
Tell me you love me

Heading out for higher plains

Looking for adventure
Rocinante at the reigns
Until the windmills answer

[Chorus]
You'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely ever again
You'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely again
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

For examining my brain
Said he's not too clever
When the world, when the world just seems
A little bit too cruel
Going to leave it better
Going to make one better, yeah!

[Chorus]
So tell that princess
Tell that princess "hide down the drain"
Tell that princess she'll never be lonely again
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

[Verse 3]

Where the people sing
"Ole ole ole ole ole ole"
"Ole ole ole ole, Coldplay Coldplay"
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

Love, I hope we get old
I hope we can find a way of seeing it all
Love, I hope we can be
I hope I can find a way of letting you see
That I'm so easy to please, so easy

Love, I hope we grow old
I hope we can find a way of seeing it all

(Yeah, real shit nigga)
Gangsta shit, get your game up, boy, for real

[Verse 1: Raw Dizzy]
The clock is ticking, the cops is sitting
Waiting on me to pop the ribbon so I can get locked in prison
But I forgive 'em, they don't know I got the bishop
Giving me a future face, they cannot prevent it
Sky's the limit, I travel but I tries to pivot
Look in my eyes and combine the spirit, time'll end it
If it's not a couple of Gs, it's dimes and pennies
If I don't break a knuckle or knee, my shine is finished
I'm climbing in it, but I could fall down the chimney
A hound is in me, so don't come around or near me
You clowns is really fucking up, ya bound to get it
I sit a barrel on ya tongue so round and pretty
Fought my ticket, now I'ma skip town and kick it
Dress code: just some khaki brown lil' Dickies
Got them pounds and chickens stuffed in coffee grounds and fishes, nigga

[Hook: Capo]

Fucking with them gangstas, I guarantee
Shit gon' get real gangsta, my nigga
And you gon' back down, and you gon' back down

Fucking with them gangstas, I guarantee
Shit gon' get real gangsta, my nigga
And you gon' back down, and you gon' back down

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, fresh off the block, that's Apple and Eagle Street
I go through there every week even if it's just to speak

He's probably with Rodney, or probably with Roney
I go by Trill Rill cause he be up in the morning
See, that's that penitentiary shit and he been out for a minute
But I'm up!
Birdman keep asking me to stick
22s on the Rolls and I keep telling him no, but
If he keep playing then I'ma have to show him
And come through this bitch on 24s
Like what up?!
These hoes keep asking me to marry 'em
Knowing that my ex-wife'll bury 'em
So bitch, shut up!
I'm blowing on that berry like Marion
You knowing what the fuck a nigga carrying
Get bald head like a Aryan
I think a nigga bout to buy a Marriott
Now all my hoes, put up!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Raw Dizzy]
Check, lights off, mask on, creep silent
Move light, walk, step, talk, squeak, holla (I hear 'em)
Pull a tool, nigga sweet like peach cobbler
Shoot twice, don't check, let them people find him
I'm the screw face to this rap game
Weezy put me on, new face with the same name

[Lil Wayne]
Oh yes I did, get 'em, kid, if I ask ya
Just bring me the bastard with his head unfastened
Faster than a panther goes the lead from the clapper
Round up ya boys, get this round of applause

[Raw Dizzy]
They say I'm two faced, look, nigga, I ain't changed
Cause if I feel played, I'ma let the iron rain
Rrrang, bang bang with my gang, mane

[Hook : Akon]
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin

[Verse 1 : BIG]
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newport's cause I'm due in court
For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
(you betta have your gat in hand cause man)

[Hook : Akon]
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin

[Verse 2 : 2Pac]
Our lifestyles be close captioned
Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
In the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture or the
Repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious

[Hook : Akon]
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin

[Verse 3 : Akon]
Gun shots every night in the (ghetto)
Crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto)
Every day is a fight in the (ghetto)
(oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto)
Got kids to feed in the (ghetto)
Selling coke and weed in the (ghetto)
Every day somebody bleed in the (ghetto)
(oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto)

[Verse 4 : BIG]
I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, Who's next?
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead

[Hook 2 : Akon]
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin
Cause thats the life when your
Living in the (ghetto) oh
Eating in the (ghetto) or
Sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto)
Thats the life when ur
Living in the (ghetto)oh
Eating in the (ghetto) or
Sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)

[Outro : BIG (talking)]
It's a funny thing, I kinda realized how powerful 2pac and I was. You kno wha I'm saying cuz Pac is a strong dude yo. I kno him. We two individual people, we waged a coastal beef. But even tho we were going through our drama I would never wish death on nobody cuz there ain't no comin back

[Verse 1]
I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around a faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

[Verse 2]
I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go
And drive around a faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

[Chorus]
I think I want to change my altitude
I think I want to change my oxygen
I think I want to change my air
My atmosphere
I wanna recharge

[Verse 3]
I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around my faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

[Chorus]
I think I need to change my attitude
I think I want to change my oxygen
I think I want to change my air
My atmosphere
I wanna recharge

[Outro]
Bigger and better
Bigger and better
Bigger and better
Bigger and better
Bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go

[Intro]
Can I speak on how I feel y'all?
Let my heart do the talking
Listen up princess

[Verse 1]
I wake up in the morning, take a knee and thank God
Then go to the mirror, look myself in the eyes
Today I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Yesterday I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Neither the day before that, nor before that
I just remember the moments, call me Kodak
And know that I do miss ya
But it's your denial that I must hold against ya
Since you been gone
I have been all alone
But alone is steroids, 'cause it made me strong
Girl, hair gone in the wind
You cheated on God's son, baby girl, that's a sin
But I forgive you
But I can't give you
Another chance, ma, you're in my rearview
And I put that ring on your finger, I was all in
But now it's just a symbol of what could've been
Goddamn

[Hook 1]
And now I'm by myself, but
(I like it)
Damn, she left me all by myself, but
(I like it)

[Verse 2]
Yo
I love my niggas, no homo
I swear I hope they all get cheese, like Digiorno
And something 'bout the Hot Boys that you don't know
I got a lot of love for 'em that I don't show
And B.G. been my nigga since the front do'
I hope Chopper City Records blow, fo sho'
And me and Juvey never really got along
But you still would let your nigga
Come get on your hottest song
Damn, I fuck with ya for that
I fuck with ya Lil Wack
And me and Skip go back
When you see a real nigga you gotta tip your hat
And since I'm a real nigga, I do just that
I had my own lawyer working on Turk's case
After I heard him dissing me on the mixtape
'Cause he's locked up and I'm free
He got a lot more to worry about than me
I ain't trippin'

[Hook 2]
Y'all niggas left me by myself, but I can't front
(I like it)
And so, now I became the President
Of the spot y'all left me at
A lot has changed, but, I can't front
(I like it)

[Verse 1]
Stuck in a corner
Like monkeys in cages
That don't have a number
And fight one another
Try to recover

[Verse 2]
Climb up a ladder
Look up and you see birds
Blind as each other
How long can we suffer?
We're as blind as each other

[Chorus]
On the cloud that you're sitting
There's one born every minute
So much to discover
I've become a believer

[Verse 3]
Sisters and brothers
Who fight one another
Will mourn and deceive us
Will find us and keep us
Take us or leave us

[Verse 4]
How soon is now?
Only how long is never?
I'm nothing but normal
We're something together
Come on and stick together

[Chorus]
On the cloud that you're sitting
There's one born every minute
So much to discover
I've become a believer

[Outro: Simon Pegg]
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 1]
My song is love
My song is love, unknown
And it goes up
You don't have to be alone
My heavy heart
Looks like it's made of stone
But it's so hard to see, clearly
You don't have to be on your own 

[x2]

[Chorus]
And I'm not going to take it back
Oh I'm not going to say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm not singing on my own

[Verse 2]
That bitter breathe
That bitter breathe has blown
Left me on fire, for you, clearly
Taken everything and gone
It’s taken everything I own

[Chorus]
But I'm not going to take it back
I’m not going to say I don’t mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

[Verse 3]
I'm not going to stand and wait
Not going to leave it until it's much too late
On a platform I'm going to stand and say
Oh I'm nothing on my own
Till that bitter breathe has blown
My song is love, Is love unknown
And I’ve got to get that message home

[Verse 1]
As far as I can see
All time and circuitry is wrong

As far as poetry
Sit down and sing to me a song

[Chorus]
'Cause all I want in this world
All I want in this world
Is for you to come home

A spell a rebel yell
A spell

[Verse 2]
Soldier come home to me
You've been away from me so long

[Chorus]
And all I want in this world
All I want and deserve
Is for you to come home

[Outro x 2]
A spell a rebel yell
A spell a rebel yell
A spell a rebel yell
A spell a rebel yell

Oh, oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
Brothers and sisters unite
It's the time of your lives
It's the time of your lives
Breakdown, breakdown
Gotta spread love around
Gotta spread it around

[Verse 2]
Brothers and sisters feel fine
It's the time of your lives
It's the time of your lives
There's no sound, no sound
Like this feeling you found
Like this feeling you found
But just stay down

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes you'll feel
So stay down
Sometimes you feel

[Post-Chorus]
And it's me they're looking for
And it's me, I will never survive
But we'll be around so long

[Verse 1]
Brothers and sisters unite
It's the time of your lives
It's the time of your lives
Breakdown, breakdown
Got to spread love around
Got to spread it around
But just stay down

[Chorus]
And sometimes you feel
So stay 'round
And sometimes you feel

[Post-Chorus]
And it's me they're looking for
And it's me, I will never survive
But we'll be around some long

[Outro]
And it's gonna be alright
And it's gonna be alright
And it's gonna be alright

[Verse 1]
When you're sitting on a beach in a car with the paint dried up
Well, you're going to give a cause when the rain washed up
Well being just there with the gypsy talking to my friend
But you'll never get with it if you don't get respect
Oh well you'll never get with it if you just want respect

[Chorus]
But sometimes the money's going to run out
And you'll be standing on the corner with a belly full of doubt
Sometimes somebody's going to bring you down
And you'll be standing on your own with a bucket for a crown

[Verse 2]
Well me and the boys were standing thinking we were hip
I don't wanna be the captain of a sinking ship
Well me and the boys in a town where the Mormon go
Listening to a session by Noel Gallagher
I was listening to a session by Noel Gallagher

[Chorus]
They said sometimes your money's going to run out
And you'll be standing on a corner with a belly full of doubt
Oh someday somebody's going to bring you down
And you'll be standing on a corner with a bucket for a crown
Oh you'll be standing on a corner, just waiting on a corner
Standing on a corner with a bucket for a crown

[Verse 1]
If you're lost and feel alone
Circumnavigate the globe
All you ever have to hope for two
And the way you seem to float
Circumnavigate in hope
And they seem to lose control
With you

[Chorus]
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Everyone of us is hurt
And everyone of us is scarred
Everyone of us is scared
Not you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes closed
Your head hurts
Your eyes feel so low

[Chorus]
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Everyone of us is scared
Everyone of us is hurt
Everyone of us has hope
All for you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you

[Verse 1]
Baby, it's been a long time coming
Such a long, long time
And I can't stop running
Such a long, long time
Can you hear my heart beating?
Can you hear that sound?
'Cause I can't help thinking
And I won't stop now

[Chorus]
And then I looked up at the sun
And I could see
Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me
And then I looked up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes on everyone
On everyone

[Verse 2]
Baby, when your wheels stop turning
And you feel let down
And it seems like troubles
Have come all around
I can hear your heart beating
I can hear that sound
But I can't help thinking
And I won't look now

[Chorus]
And then I looked up at the sun
And I could see
Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me
And then I looked up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes on everyone
On everyone

[Outro]
On everyone
On everyone
On everyone
On everyone

[Verse]
Darling, those tired eyes
Go with me all the time
And in the dead of night
Tell me you will be mine
Where do you go to, pretty babe?
Where do you go to when the night wins away?
Ask me so sweetly, what do I do?
And who do I sing for
Well honey I sing about you
You
One, two, three: Will

[Verse 1]
I ran away from you
That's all I ever do
And though I started here
I ran away from you
I'm going to come on in
And see it through

[Verse 2]
I ran away from you
That's all I ever do
And when I heard you call to
Come back to me
And though I should stay
I don't have the stomach to

[Chorus]
Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool to mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do
I have your love on call
And yet my belly is so full
There might be nothing left to do
So I ran away from you

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna come on in
My eyes were closed
I can feel it near
The sides so close
I'm gonna come on out
And burn the sky

[Verse 4]
A star arose in my own cage
I stuck in line
And in a cage
Just a single star
I sing for

[Chorus]
Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool to mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do
I have your love on call
And yet my belly is so full
And I did not know what to do
And so I ran away from you

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Somewhere up above the stars
The wreckage of a universe floats past
Somewhere up above my heart
A tiny little seed is sown, a government is overthrown
Who knows when we'll be coming home at last

[Chorus]
And I heard it on the radio that one day we'll be living in the stars
And I heard it on a TV show that somewhere up above and in my heart
They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to Mars
We won't see the earth again
And the seconds just remain unchanged

[Verse 2]
8 to 9, 9 to 10
We are meeting for the first time
We might never meet again, you and me
We are meeting for the first time can't you see
7 6 5 4 3
We are meeting for the first time
Singing this space symphony

[Shortened Chorus]
They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to Mars
Past the satellites and stars, they're moving us to Mars

[Hook]
Murder coming to get us
Yeah coming to get us and away we hide
Murder, see it all around us
See it all around us
And away we hide
Murder coming to get us
They're coming to get us
And away we hide
Away we hide

[Verse 1]
Tie me to a tree
Tie my hands above my head
Sing a song to me
Sing a song like what you said

[Chorus]
And they're going to murder me
They're going to take me down
Even before I sleep
I cry murder

[Verse 2]
Come spit at us
Come and throw your weight around
Come and fight with us
Try and knock us to the ground

[Chorus]
'Cause they're gonna murder me
They're going to take me down
Even before I sleep
I scream murder
Murder

[Bridge]
Oh now, what can it possibly gain?
Oh, what can it possibly gain?
Oh now, what can it possibly gain?
Oh yeah, what can it possibly gain?
Cry murder, murder
I cry murder

[Hook]
Murder I'm coming to get us
I'm coming to get us
And away we hide
Murder, see it all around us
See it all around us
And away we hide
Murder coming to get us
It's coming to get us
And away we hide
Murder, see it all around you
See it all around you
And away we hide

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep
I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me
But I wake up
Yes I wake up smiling

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel, oh, the charge is surprising
Surprisingly good to be moving around
So I wake up
Yes I wake up smiling

[Refrain]
So what? I feel fine
I'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life
I'm alright, I feel good
So I'll go, and I'll try to stop moving

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep
But I've got to get going, so much that I'm wanting to do
But I wake up smiling

[Chorus]
And this could be my last chance
Of saving my innocence
And this could be my last chance
No more keeping my feet on the ground

[Verse 4]
Sometimes I feel, oh, the charge is surprising
Surprisingly good to be moving around
And I move
I wake up smiling

[Refrain]
So what? I feel fine
I feel OK, I've seen the lighter side of life
I'm alright, I feel good
So I'll go, well it's time to stop moving

[Chorus]
And this could be my last chance
Of saving my innocence
And this could be my last chance
So no more keeping my feet on the ground

[Outro]
I'm not gonna keep on
I'm not gonna keep on the
I'm not gonna keep on
I'm not gonna keep on the ground

[Verse 1]
The cardboard head I see
Has found its way to me
It's old and it's old and it's old
Making me cry
I sleep but I will not move
I'm too scared to leave my room
But I won't be defeated
Oh no

[Chorus]
What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear you say to me, "It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear and the things from which you can't escape"

[Verse 2]
Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait in line
Some numbers are better than others
Oh no

[Chorus]
What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear you say to me, "It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear and the things which you cannot explain"

[Bridge]
And it's making me cry love
And it's making me cry
And I'm slipping away love
And I'm slipping away

[Outro]
It's only superstition, only your imagination
It's only superstition, only superstition

[Verse 1]
Poor me, I'm floating out to sea
An opportunity that went by
Poor you, oh what you going to do
No what you going to do, you just cry
Oh, you always come undone
Try into the sun, you don't know why
Poor you, I know what you going to do
Come on love I'll see it through, I don't know why

[Chorus]
I hear you come nearer, I hear you but I don't understand
I hear you come nearer, I hear you but I don't understand

[Verse 2]
Poor me, now float me out to sea
Oh no just let it be, come on try
Poor you, oh what you going to do
Oh what you gonna do, you just cry

[Chorus]
I hear you come nearer, I hear you but I don't understand
I hear you come nearer, I hear you but I don't understand
I don't understand
I don't understand
Oooh, ahhhh, ahhhh

[Verse 1]
So I waited for you
What wouldn't I do?
And I'm covered, it's true
I'm covered in you
If I ever want proof
I find it in you
Yeah I honestly do
In you I find proof

[Chorus]
Light and dark
A bright spark
Light and dark
And then, light

[Verse 2]
So I waited all day
What wouldn't I say?
And are there things in your way?
Things happen that way
Oh
And if I ever want proof
Then I find it in you
Oh
Yeah I honestly do
In you I find proof

[Chorus]
Light and dark
A bright spark
Light and dark
And then, light
Light 

[x4]

[Verse 1]
Climb up your mountain
Nineteen and counting
You have got seven
I have got one
Blinded and hurting
This I'm deserving
I've got my secrets
You've only got the Sleeping Sun

[Verse 2]
When you've got a secret
Then you've got to keep it
When you have a question
Answers will come
Running and hiding
Taking dividing
You've got your secrets
I've only got the Sleeping Sun

[Chorus]
The Sleeping Sun
Singing
Oooh um
Ohhhh oh
Ahhh ahh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

[Verse 3]
And you as I saw
Were a piece in a jigsaw
Run up the divide and
Tip of the tongue
Run round the houses
North and the south is
You've got your answers
We have both got the Sleeping Sun

[Chorus]
The Sleeping Sun
Singing
Oooh um
Ohhhh oh
Ahhh ahh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

[Verse 1]
I went digging for gold
I went down to the valley
Over by the mountain
Where the prospector had been told
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold
I went digging for gold
I went down with my brother
A bucket and a shovel
And a book about the color of coal
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold

[Chorus]
There's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line
Saying "what's the use of metal if the metal don't shine?"
She said "Bring me back a ring because I really want one"
Now I've been digging so long that I never seen the sun

[Verse 2]
I went digging for gold
I went down to the valley
Over by the mountain
Where the prospector had been told
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold

[Chorus]
There's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line
Saying "what's the use of metal if the metal don't shine?"
She said "Bring me back a ring cause I really want one"
Now I've been digging so long that I never seen the sun 

[x2]
(Again, last time)
Now I've been digging so long that I never seen the sun

[Verse 1]
X and Y
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
That and this
We're part of a bigger plan
Don't know what it is
Don't know what it is

[Verse 2]
You and me
The land, sun, trees, the sky, the stars, the sea
365 degrees
I am a puzzle, you're the missing piece
Hang on a minute, just a minute, please
I'll come
And everything under the sun
And everything under the sun

[Chorus 1]
What is this feeling that I can't explain?
And why am I never gonna sleep again?
What is this thing I've never seen before?
A little boy lost in a breaking storm
Pilots, up and away they fly
To write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life that comes
And everything under the sun

[Verse 3]
X is Y
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
365 degrees
All of the surface and the underneath
Searching your mellow and outsings your key, ah
And everything under the sun
And everything under the sun

[Chorus 2]
What is this feeling that I can't explain?
And why am I never gonna sleep again?
What is this thing I've never seen before?
A little boy lost in a breaking storm
Pilots, up and away they fly
To write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life that comes
And everything under the sun

[Outro]
And you don't know that you've been born
Can't see the calm until the storm
Can't tell your right side from your wrong
Can't see the wave you're riding on

[Intro: Jeremih]
She say “pay something, I’ll shake something”
You right – I’ll pay something, now shake something
Then she roll and I throw it (get paid, get paid)
Shake something, shake something…

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Shorty want me to blow my money
I say “baby, blow my mind”
Say she workin’ for a new watch
Baby girl, it’s your time
Damn, she got me throwin’ money
Even callin’ on me from overseas
I feel like Reggie Miller
‘Cause now I’m gettin’ these hoes in threes
Wish I had more time to play
But them vaginas is on the way
Ooh… girl…
Break it down, break it down…
Yeah, I started off with ones
Now I’m throwing these hundreds
(Throwing these hundreds)
The way she’s sliding down that pole
She just thirst for more money

[Hook: R. Kelly]
The way she work it on the pole
Got me throwin’ my money, throwin’ my money
They way she twerk it on the pole
Got me throwin’ my money, throwin’ my money
The way she pop it on the pole
Got me throwin’ my money, throwin’ my money
The way she slide down on the pole
Got me throwin’ my money, throwin’ my money

[Verse 2: R.Kelly]
I ain’t got no plans tonight
Get somewhere, you can help me get my head right
And I love your swag, cause it’s just like mine
Siamese twins me and you, we two of a kind
Strip club is our playground
She playing on her monkey bar
Up and down like a roller coaster
Call that ass a theme park
Way she handle her business
From the sky she make it drop
My money no limit, tonight I’m about to go astronaut
Never ride solo, Mr. Franklin always with me
She’d been around the pole so many times she should be dizzy
Rolex that’s real crime, these niggas exaggerating
Her ass can hold a glass, that’s no exaggeration

[Hook: R. Kelly]

[Verse 3: Twista]
Pop that booty, let me watch it girl
Drop it, I’ll not knock it
Better yet I’mma reach into my pocket girl
Watch it girl she sluggin’
Come over here cause I see what you do
Tippin off the plenty booze
How you be attracted to plenty dudes
With the Jimmy Choo shoes you in
What you doing takes some talent
So I gotta say that I’m enjoying what I witness
My money flow is endless
Lookin’ at her work that pole like gymnast
Climbin’ up to the top
Turn it upside down then open up her legs
Lookin’ sexy all the way to the bottom
I’m throwin’ dollars ’cause it look like she finna hit her head
Now she twerlin’ around it, then do a split right in front of it
Ready to go back up when she look at how thick the money get
She do it caterpillar, ballerina, diamond toes, aerial and vert
Full rockin’ it vertical, so fixed, fan kick
Pro pounds, windmills, stacks, spin in reverse

[Hook]

[Outro: Jeremih]
She say “pay something, I’ll shake something”
You right – I’ll pay something, now shake something
Then she roll and I throw it (get paid, get paid)
Shake something, shake something…

[Part I: Prospekt's March]

Smoke is rising from the houses
People burying their dead
I ask somebody what the time is
But time doesn't matter to them yet

People talking without speaking
Trying to take what they can get
I ask you if you remember
Prospekt, how could I forget?

Drums, here it comes
Don't you wish that life could be as simple
As fish swimming round in a barrel?
When you've got the gun
Oh when I run, here it comes
We're just two little figures in a soup bowl
Trying to get behind a kind of control
But I wasn't one
Now here I lie on my own in a separate sky
And here I lie on my own in a separate sky
I don't wanna die on my own here tonight
But here I lie on my own in a separate sky

[Part II: Poppyfields]

[Instrumental]
Oh, oh, oh, eh yeah

Hey girl your getting close

Hey turn you with the fame
Throwin money round

But you girl I'm willing you can stop the wife from spending in a minute in a tide time skirt
And I've never seen a girl so bad
Her body was swag, and tide time shirt

Half bright lights

[Chorus - Rum]
I'm tired of this bullshit
All these lies, all theses fakers, all these actors
I'm offended by these ring-tone rappers
We tired of that bullshit
Getting over, make it worse for the next
Then try to brainwash my people with that, yeah
(We tired of that bullshit)
I-I-I'm bringing real rap back
I'm bringing real rap back
I-I-I'm bringing real rap back
For the Chevy's and Cadillac's
I-I'm bringing real rap back
I'm bringing real rap back
I-I-I'm bringing real rap back
For the Chevy's and Cadillac's

[Verse 1 - Rum]
I'm officially affiliated, ho's love it and niggas hate it
We the best, we the greatest, book a show, signing papers
S-S-S-Signing like old times, don't even need a whip
Homes for the more valuable, my son tell me I'm the shit
Shawty ain't going down, they let dummy pick and choose
Pass to the oh and boo, she down for that switcheroo
Might-might-might-might catch a switch or two
Still the same old red
Chill with them youngins, but got my game from the old heads
Trynna then yall niggas, killed you in college bro
Show's on Myspace, it ain't hard to find it bro
I'm bringing real rap back, for the Chevy's and Cadillac's
Blue red every color and the G's with neeks

[Chorus - Rum]
I'm tired of this bullshit
All these lies, all theses fakers, all these actors

[Verse 2 - Rum]
Look, I ain't hatin', I keep it real, I see what they don't see
Radio ain't the same, they play what they wanna play
All 'bout a budget now, fake is the new real
Lie about who you kill, and get you a record deal
Them folks take a chance with it, give ya advance with it
Promote you like hell man, let you make a lil' dance with it
You good for about a year, then you strugglin' to stay alive
The whole world forgot about ya, back to 9-to-5
Put it down all the time, put on my real jeans
Got 'em big, 45, can't wear no lil' skinny jeans
No women tendencies, plus I can really spit
These niggas is really bitches, go 'head, tuck your dick

[Chorus - Rum]
I'm tired of this bullshit
All these lies, all theses fakers, all these actors
I'm offended by these ring-tone rappers

I-I-I'm bring real rap back
For the Chevy's and Cadillac's

[Verse 3 - Rum]
I'm offended by all means, everybody rap now
I can't even blame 'em though, the drug game locked down
Determined to be the next, care less 'bout a record sale
Will dummies succeed or fail? Shit, only time'll tell
Glad to be out the sale, glad to be out the hood
Glad I ain't got a lot, I do what you others should
Boy, you're a fucking jerk, loosen up on your shirt
Nigga scramming out this bitch
And you feeling 'bout all this work?
I know nigga's mad at me, expose these clowns though
Niggas just claim shit, don't even know what it stand fo'
You pussies ain't trained to go
Keep bragging 'bout hood dough
Your nuts don't hang low, boy he's a man-ho

[Chorus - Rum]
I'm tired of this bullshit
All these lies, all theses fakers, all these actors
I'm offended by these ring-tone rappers
We tired of that bullshit
Getting over, make it worse for the next
Then try to brainwash my people with that, yeah
(We tired of that bullshit)
I-I-I'm bring real rap back

I'm bringing real rap back
I-I-I'm bring real rap back
For the Chevy's and Cadillac's

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
In life, there's people that hustle
In life, there's people that grind
And there's We The Best music who make History
History is something that cannot be forgotten
I've been through everyone black, I have seen an overcome in the evilest hate ever that man can as ever wicknesses
They told me "no", and I told 'em "yes"
I have helped so many, and some have fogotten
I have been challenged, and I always win
I have been to wars, and came out with no scares
I have been tested, and I always passed
This sound contains my pain, my blessings, the stars on this album is my voice
The drums on this album is my heart beating
People feel victory is just a win, Victory is a strugglee, a journey of life
Victory is accomplishment, Victory is a survival
When you're on the way to tap, they cheer for you
When you reach the top on the noun, they want you to die
I speak through my music, I'm so hood, we takin' over, I'm out here grindin', I go hard, I am the streets
You can't stop what is destined to win
When they say Khaled, they say Warrior, Loyal, the chosen one
It's always the way that caused you that don't wanna see your grind
I tell 'em watch me now and learn
I stil find a way to forgive
The more I hate, the more I love
Only Allah can judge me
Welcome to my Victory

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]

We eat wheat niggas up like corn on the cob
You a hustla, naw don't quit ya day job!

[Verse 3: Blood Raw]
Errbody claim reson errbody kno the game

But on the real shit

[Chorus]
Gangsta shit gangsta shit the way I do my thang gansta shit

Truck hijackings, big guns up in my jacket
And I don't give a fuck about rappin' (Watch out now)
Listen,

Mob boss holdin' meetings inside the sauna
Had my man sweep for the bugs and informants
Turned myself in with a bail, I got a warrant (Watch out now)
Niggas wanna rap about bricks but never put a gram on the strip (Damn)
But SP the Ghost is enormous
If you nice like me, put your bricks up (Put it up)
I'll beat you and turn my Benz truck to a pick-up (Watch out now)

You'll be M.I.A. but not like Khaled

[Chorus: Akon & Fat Joe]

I know you seen the movie, dawg: the world is ours
Set our own salary, see me serving powder
I see sick shit, so I'm kinda sick myself
I go shopping, the sick shit I get for self (Watch out now)
I need a million dollar watch that can call a helicopter
No ice in it, I'm just into helicopters
Hunnid shots, no Glocks were holding on the stock
Back-against-the-wall brawl, balls like 2Pac (Watch out now)
Look me in my eyes, you will see no disguise
What make the dick rise: keys taped to her thighs
To my murder mamis: supreme team, GS's rims on it
Yeah, them things (Watch out now)
Dade County, 305, we all that
I could drop it in the pot and bring it all back
I could whip it, whip it, whip it to get the motherfucka rock
I could whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it in Mac Ross

[Chorus: Akon]
Hustle if you wanna, whatever you feel
Move that marijuana, from fast in the hill
Strapped on the corner, loaded with dumdums
Trafficking's normal where I come from
But Five-O steady peepin' around the corner (Hey)
Steady peepin' around the corner (Oh-oh)
Steady peepin' around the corner (Hey)
Steady peepin' around the corner

Bitch nigga I will do ya, with 9 millimeter ruger
I'm hell on earth now that's what they told me
Hotter than the flames in hell, so hell could'nt hold me
No man control me
Follow no one, I'm a leader
I'm Homeboy, Bitch I'm off the mothafuckin meter
Right now or tomorrow I'm a see ya when I see ya
Cock back and make me pop the lid off the Pringles
C'mon, once I step outside of my zone
Bullets fly jus like that star wars attack of the clones
Listen up got some shit that'll part your hair round here
We from Georgia, it's the spot

[Chorus: Lil Scrappy]
You can be as fuckin real as you want
And hard as you will
But you will never be nothin like me
You can rock with the 12's in the trunk
Get so drunk

You can go and fuck with a ho
A pocket full of dough
But you will never be nothin like me
Yea yea you wanna act hard
I can tell in your eyes you will never be nothin like me

Use to ride through the city, in hollywood benz

Liftin' up the lambo do's, go and give yo chick a hug
Paint wetter than the suds in ya kitchen cuz
Larger than a dove, and it don't feel like O.J. Simpsons glove
Reincarnate Picaso out of the grave
And still couldn't compete with the way my ride is sprayed
Rims stayin' on the run like a runaway slave
The top is chop-chop, like a summer day fade
Vallet be slippin' slidin' when they standin' by this caddy
My paint wet (yup) watch it do the trick daddy
Me and E got fly rides, if you want it then get at me
If it fit then I don't want em they suppose to fit barely
I made straight As in spanish Khaled they must have forgot though
(How many cars Koopa?) Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Add another cuatro, I got another drop so
I'm buildin' a garage on top of the one I got (oh)
Tell the maker of the Chevy that I'm ridin' silly (silly)
Turn it up, heavy bass'll make it pop a wheelie
I know my cheese is at stake but I'm not from Philly
Jackers watchin', plottin', so Chamilly went and cop a milly

[Chorus: Slim Thug]
Candy paint drip look clean then a mug

Tryin to talk to 'em...

And the lights go out, all you hear is silence
I'll be that voice
(Give it to DJ Khaled for doin it
Y'all the big dog, Pitbull, Terror Squadians - YESSS!!)
Dade County, it's our time
The movement's here forever
And I won't stop 'til I see them devils
And I won't stop 'til I defeat the devils (nigga!)
They all told me that I would fail
They all told me that I would lose
But I'm right here, and I won't lose
Can't NOBODY stop me! I'm somebody
My brother Dre told you to BE somebody
Carol City know what I'm talkin about

Dead man gon' feel us the way I'm feelin this Phillie
No really we the best (we the best) and I'm the boss
Do I still hustle? Yes... I'm Ricky Ross
Started with the dirt now I'm travellin the world
In a new silver spurt buyin pieces of the Earth
Low mileage; don't need some
No smilin; I'm easin!
Rollin on that thang thang, when I lane change
Haters lookin at me crazy, boy I'ma bang bang
M-I-A yo, we the same gang
C.C. to Down South, e'rybody slang 'caine
Don't see another way, if you do show it to me
Got good green? Green-ass nigga, blow it with me
Cop me a drop, paint mine real pretty

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
I rep my city like a G's supposed ta

A candy car strutta that be sittin' on butta
Comin' straight up out the gutta with the cordaless cutta
Man, what is that? The Chinese choppa that likens Mr. Studda
What a fucked up predicament (Damn), a scary scenario
Automatics in ya face have you preparin' ya burial (hol up)
They tracin' tha weapon after you scratch off the serial
Leaves you up like cereal, there it is and there we go (there we go)
Some bad Didos ridin' off in tha wind and
Nigga we got all ya soft in ya hands so don't pretend
Like this ain't what it was (was) or we ain't what you say (say)
I'll make a high cappa or court fraud light in tha day (day)
Cause in the middle of the street in height of tha traffic
Watch what you say when we meet cause they know might get yo ass kicked (huh)
End up in a pickle like a Vlasic, UGK nigga
We cost like a foreign but get respect like a classic muthafucka

Shoppers splergin, caked up cause my pockets swoll
I'm callin plays, pullin broads, I just think and roll
I'm from that lone star, tippin dime dat candy car
Get it shined on 59, lean and tuck I'll cut some more
Hoes wanna who we are, fathers wanna know what we get
Hatas wanna talk down a knot, but they just mad cause they ain't hot
They ain't got the cash that I got, they don't know what my hood 'bout
They don't know about trunks that pop on Lambo's that blaze tha chop
Countin cash and stackin not, South victory back to Scott
Crawlin like big crocodile, I'm diamond smile and Johnny watch
I'm with my partner, box, you and you and not with 'cho
Rick boy, yeah that's fo' sho', breakin em off, you already know
Drive slow like Kanye West, and Branyan Wayans, and Manny Mesh
A swishahouse chain on my chest, I keep it fresh, We are the best

My Album coming tell em pussies they staying asleep
It's G-U-T-T-A, I serve 'em as raw as the beef

That means greatness as Biggie and Pac deceased

Khaled mix 96er, but even back then though you had haters

Dammit been paying dues, now it's my time to blow
Even when 50 come through
He don't roll no less than 50 zoes!
Cause they will push your shit back, way back to trues and vows
My dog Noseshaker, come through the block on something clean
Sounding like an earthquake, he is what these dope boys dream
Hit a lick, flip a brick, snatch a Brinks truck
That's them Miami boys don't get it mixed up

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
I'm Mr. 305, I'm a part of Miami's Heat
I grew up in all types of neighborhoods, I am Miami's street
Low key and stay quiet, that's how these chicos in Miami eat
I love it when these boys come from out of town
And think Miamis sweet
All of them down looking for pussy, trying to Miami skeet
That's when they run up in they hotel room
And give them a Miami treat
When the choppers start a raining, it's hard to stop a Miami leak
That's what they get for thinking Miamis just Miami Beach

[Chorus: Casely (Pitbull)]
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like

You're backs won't last with checks you can't cash

[Outro: Pitbull]
Hah, You know how this ain't a neighborhood right?
Don't let your mouth write a check your ass can't cash Ha ha ha
If the moneys on the wood, it's all good
But if the moneys out of sight it going to be a fight
And the last thing you want is a fight with the 305, ha ha ha

[Verse 1]
Fresh on the scene, I just let the swag talk
Watch, I pull up in that foreign just to piss 'em off
Had to whisper to my dog, I say we here to ball
Chain ring, wrist bling, I'ma piss 'em off
Okay, more bottles of Rosay
Hermes on her waist, complimented by that oche
Looking kinda fly Mr. Hood what them hoes say?
Pissing n*ggas off by the bezel on the watch face
On that nick Shorty, this just how the boss play
Phantom with the two tone, left it with the valet
You know how I'm ridin', catch me couping on a Sunday
B*tch I am the sh*t. We clear? Blu-Ray

[Hook]
Check the swag - yea, it's on
Gettin' cash, the bank roll
I get it fast, never slow
Piss 'em off just to let them haters know
Let 'em know you will never meet a n*gga this fly, I ain't lying
Got the top off the wip
You ain't ridin', you ain't ridin'
If the watch under 40
You ain't shinnin', you ain't shinnin'
Piss 'em off, you n*ggas all talk, ain't buying it

[Verse 2]
Old man, ten grand, bought the whole mall
Heard they hatin' so I did it just to piss 'em off
Chilling with a bad b*tch Mrs. WhatchaCall
Put her in a red bottom just to piss 'em off
Good lord, you know what the wrist cost
Bid the pretty penny probably triple what your rent cost
Yea a n*gga shine it, like cutting on a chandelier
Hop in about that Porsche, why of course that be the Panamera
Louis, Gucci, Findi or Versace be my day a apparel
That sh*t that you're talkin', it's nice — Christmas carols
I ain't wit the bullsh*t, i do this for real though
Kick it with a player, talking game when the field goal
Swimming in some money, f*ck around and do a backstroke
You know how I like it baby, you just keep your back low
Main I'm a dog, my whips are retarded
Swag out of space, you couldn't match it with a martian
Whatcha talkin' n*gga?

[Hook]
Bottom of a rocket hot as tamale, ganja lit
Squad legit, armored whips
Roll call, state your name, sweatshirt
See 'em flex tweeted, vexed, seeded
Engaging my ex-demons
Evading arrest, speeding straight into the next precinct
I'm making a mess, leave it, I can't breathe
Floating off the best product, get money and dress awful
I'm holding a press conference, address nonsense
Nigga, slanging wood like a deck sponsor
Now piss off bitch, no off switch
Been hard since, since Pippen been pimping
Let's go and fix the exposure so you can picture me rolling
And dump the clips on a poser
Or slangin' bricks in a holster that hold the 5th is emotional
And it cry and it's sobbing now and it's raining all over you
I guess the chickens just came home to roost
Pigs fly every day, couple 100 on the hay sack
Blunted in the way back, fuck you and your lame tats
What I want, I take that what I want, I take that
What I want, I take that, talk and get them grapes smashed

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, motherfucker
What? What?

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I'm eating shawarma, doing drawings of Chewbacca
Bumping Flocka, fuck the drama
Marijuana been as calming as the fucking Dalai Lama
Your style common as a little league sponsor from retarded kids' fathers
I'm at meetings shaking hands and adding commas to my net worth
Talk about my money, please, some feelings might just get hurt
This the same effect, and less words
Chilling with this asshole, calls himself Sweatshirt (That's me, it's ya boy)
This might be some of my best work (Indeed)
I let these bitches dive in, head first
Applying pressure when I put together letters
I'm a king, I'm a myth, beat a bitch down with my scepter
These hidden treasures feeling better than a million sweaters in Alaska
Your raps are corny as Nebraska
Lacksa-daisical bars, my throwaways will trash ya
High as NASA on acetone, acid foam
Talking trash like John McEnroe
You a little bitch, that's what the fucking Cabbage Patch is for (That's what is for)
Watch me smack a ho, turn around and catapult
Up above my castle's moat, right into my fucking throne (Throne)
They like, "damn, Mac, what the fuck you on? (The fuck you on?)"

[Chorus]
Drugs, thugs, killers, goons, saints, evil, wise, fools, highs, lows, bitches, hoes

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Hell's chariot creeping
Her exposure's indecent
Roll is similar to bakers' dough, a bun in the oven
Karma couldn't make her save it though
Just playing my music, you see I speak to her endangered soul
God's son, dick in the dirt because the manger broke
Bitch, I really go bumping tonight
Whether wrong or right, we rushing them right
You know it's never been much for a fight
But I don't really wanna be that nigga
I black out, and you don't really wanna see that, nigga
I mapped out my plan the best that I could to get rich, and put on for the rest of my hood
You know it make us think revenge when the recipe cook
Shoot the leader in the head, leave the rest of 'em shook
"I rap better than most these rap veterans"
Words so real that they had to be said again
Speak sedatives, set a date and we can set it off
Pray I never let that weapon off

[Chorus]
Drugs, thugs, killers, goons, saints, evil, wise, fools, highs, lows, bitches, hoes

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
Sober for a sec, but I'm done, so I write easier
That weapon make a peppermint out of that white tee
If you coming, then godspeed you, you sonning me
Don't speak to me crooked, I'm stunting
Look at me Ma, it's no handouts
Sweaty want the dumb cash, I'm done with the bus riding
She made the mistake for thinking he gave a fuck 'bout her
Tell him duck down or get drug out the back door
Flow got the mouth doing duties like the Task Force
Doobie and a passport, standing where the path forks
Quick to grab your bitch's wrist and get the shit I ask for
Wang trashy as bitches in smooth garments, we switching through lanes
Handling business on my side of the line where they ain't having it
You know that sweet talk is cheap
Niggas ain't talking, that's regardless what the docket read
Stop and stare, it's really him
Fresh from out the piggy pen
If I die tonight, then tell my mom I was a pretty bitch
City burning

[Chorus]
Drugs, thugs, killers, goons, saints, evil, wise, fools, highs, lows, bitches, hoes

[Intro: Vado]
We da, we da
Da best
Sping of ours

[Verse 1: Vado]
Yo!
Most hated, incorporated with wealth
Underrated, I felt had to operate it with help
Separated myself in these decorated to bail
Got educated and dealt with places safe than the melt
God gift as a kid, blockin up all previous
Like who's not scared of chain too on that park bench
Watch keep shit and shapon sick
You stick to conscience, hit the corner, take over walkmens
Like G money and that Wrangler
Showin this new drug that I had, niggas it's danger
Spittin Basquiat, I'm a painter
Every hard verse, great off work, you can hang up
No need to read the book when the author's here
Everywhere I look feds parkin here
Empty out the clip in yo partner's beard
Why'd he get a shave? Anesthesia and the partners chill

[Chorus: Vado]
Yo I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)
See me slickin' those off the black ghost (wussup)
I be fuckin' hoes in the black ghost (hah!)
Getting high, UFO in the black ghost
Yo, I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)
See me slickin' those off the black ghost (wassup)
I be fuckin' hoes in the black ghost (hah!)
Getting high, UFO in the black ghost

[Verse 2: Vado]
All my niggas can wait 'cause soon all my niggas be straight
And all my niggas will wait, then what
All my niggas is safe
Banana clips with the K so that all my niggas be safe
The quick to pitch every day, you don't know my niggas be late
Wait, Frank Noola when I'm last tappin' her
Dom's all up in his face like the smack ballad
Was in the lake but move water like the back paddle
They try to name the place so all deserve to mack at you
B4 the C4
Was drug trafficking, travelling, make em detour
Painting preachers, coliseum, listen we need more
Grantin wishes, drippin 6's, preachers off D4
We da best, I don't see the rest
And I'ma be the best so I don't need the rest
Need a short stopper, not without a G to catch
My niggas drove high faster than a G a pack

[Chorus: Vado]
Yo I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)
See me slickin' those off the black ghost (wussup)
I be fuckin' hoes in the black ghost (hah!)
Getting high, UFO in the black ghost
Yo, I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)
See me slickin' those off the black ghost (wassup)
I be fuckin' hoes in the black ghost (hah!)
Getting high, UFO in the black ghost

[Outro: Vado]
I'm gone

[Verse]
Bottom of a rocket, hot as tamale
Ganja lit, squad legit, armor whips
Roll call, state your name
Sweatshirt, see him flex, tweet it
Next seated, and gave him my ex demons
Invading the rest, speedin' straight into the next precinct
I'm makin' a mess, leave it
I can't breathe
Floatin' off the best product
Get money, and dress awful
I'm holding a press conference, address nonsense
Nigga slanging wood like a deck sponsor
Now piss off bitch (bitch)
No off switch (switch)
Been hard since (since)
Since pimpin' been pimpin'
Let's go and fix the exposures
So you can picture me rollin' and dumpin' clips on a poser
A slangin' bricks in the holster
That hold the 5th is emotional
And they cryin' and sobbing, but now it is raining all over you
I guess the chickens just came home to roost
Pigs fly every day
Couple hundred on the hay sack
Blunted in the way back
Fuck you and your lame tats
What I want I take that (what I want I take that)
What I want I take that
Talk and get them grapes smashed

[Piano intro]

[Verse 1]
A flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love

[Verse 2]
And I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on

[Verse 3]
A flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned and rise
Following 'em up

[Verse 4]
Still, I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next you know, they're gone
They fly on
Fly on
Oh ohhhh

[Bridge]
So fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I can fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on

[Ambient outro]
Don't ever let go
Don't ever let go
Don't ever let go
Don't ever let go

[Verse 1]
Got a tattoo that said "together thru life"
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
And you wonder when you wake up, will it be alright? Ooooh ooh
Feels like there's something broken inside

[Chorus 1]
All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
Whenever you go
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

[Verse 2]
Got a tattoo and the pain's alright, oooh oooh
Just wanted a way of keeping you inside (Ooooh ooh)

[Chorus 2]
All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
In your fire below
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

[Bridge/Outro]
I see the road begin to climb
I see your stars begin to shine
I see your colors
And I'm dying of thirst
All I know is that I love you so
So much that it hurts (Oh yeah yeah yeah)
So much that it hurts
So much that it hurts

[Kanye West]
We should’ve never ever let Michael Jordan play for the Wizards
We should’ve never ever let Michael Jordan play for the Wizards
We should’ve never ever let MJ play for the Wizards
Why did that happen?
Why did that happen?
We should’ve never ever let MJ play for the Wizards
We couldn’t stop — we would stop — MJ playing for the Wizards
Why did that happen?
Six championships
The best years of our life
Playing through the flu
Every single night
I believed I could fly
And I wanted to be just like Mike
I believed I could fly
And I wanted to be just like Mike
We should’ve never ever let MJ play for the Wizards
Why did that happen?
Does anybody here know why that happened?
When a player
When a player wants to become an owner
When a player
When a player that’s done more for the league than the league could’ve done for him
When a player that made the NBA wants to become an owner of the team that he brought so much glory to, a team he brought so much story to
A team that has his statue in the front of the motherfucking building
But do you know what the owners of that team told MJ?
You’re just a player, homeboy
You can’t get no pay
You can’t own shit
They told Michael Jordan he couldn't own shit!
We should’ve never ever let MJ play for the Wizards
We should’ve never ever let MJ play for the Wizards
Now y’all know why MJ went to play for the Wizards
Because this very team wouldn’t let him be an owner
I’m talking about one of the most important people in our civilization
One of the most influential people in our civilization
They tried to marginalize
And in order to make his point he had to put on a motherfucking Wizards jersey
To let y’all know “Oh yes I am gonna be an owner just like Magic Johnson”
We should’ve never let MJ ever play for the Wizards
Never never never never let him go
Because til I die MJ represents the Bulls
So tonight I’m about to put my 23 on
So tonight I gotta put my 23 on

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, rip, rip rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I'll been rockin' with the team 'til Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me

I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is "sayonara, nigga"
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 3: Drake]
Had to get it poppin' off the rip
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
"Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt"
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat, believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone

[Outro: Drake]

Take me in your fast car, Mercedes
Kissing on your neck while you drive, he, he
Doesn't care, I'm always on my Blackberry
All the time, all the time, buyin' into every lie

[Verse 1]
I'm a flashy little lush, but he thinks I'm really fine
Notorious and wild, takes me where I'm gonna shine
Where the bad boys roll hard, dressin' like James Dean
And the vixen starlets feels so good to be

[Chorus]
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free

[Verse 2]
Baby, we are chancers on the scene
Glamour in the gutters, only so RT
Sick graffiti artists and tabloid queen
Mix it up, mix it up
Every 'do you've ever seen

[Verse 3]
We're acting really tough
Like the world belongs to us
Cause it does, yeah, it must
What we do creates the buzz
Where the bad boys blow smoke
Just like they're James Dean
And the it girls blow kisses
Just like Marilyn

[Chorus]
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free

[Bridge]
Run for our lives
Break outta the chains
So cuttin' edge
Create our own games
DJs, rock stars, posers we are
The new politicians
The celebrity editions
And it's so pornographic, then it's tragic
Nothing magic makes us free
To be what we wanna be, wanna be

[Chorus - Variation]
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free
We're gonna get free, oh

By the end of the night, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face

And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon' hear me say

I get the chills whenever I see your face and you in the place, girl
Feel like I'm in a movie, baby

Like waterfalls, your hair falls down to your waist
Can I get a taste, girl?
No need to creep, 'cause baby, I ain't ashamed
Of calling your name, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face

Put on my heart, you don't need a ring
And I promise
Our time away won't change my love

[Chorus]
There goes my baby
(Oooh, girl, look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do

Loving everything you do
Oooh, girl, look at you

[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
See I know a little bit something good
Always comes out of a little bit something bad
And I wasn't looking for someone new 'til you came down
Giving me the best that I've had

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you're on my skin
Body-to-body, working me out (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Yeah you, you play to win
Rocking me steady, round after round

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were my first, baby
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish you were my first love (First love)
'Cause if you were my first, baby
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I

[Verse 2]
Mistakes, I don't worry 'bout them no more
It ain't nothing, 'cause you got me up on Cloud 9
So good, knowing I could just keep it real, t-shirt and jeans
See you making me feel so fly

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you're on my skin
Body-to-body, working me out (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Yeah you, you play to win
Rocking me steady, round after round

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were my first, baby
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish you were my first love (First love)
'Cause if you were my first, baby
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh (Oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Bridge]
You made me wanna ride again
'Cause I, I wanna hear you say my name, 'cause I
You made me wanna ride again, 'cause I, I, I, I, I
You made me wanna ride again, 'cause I
I wanna hear you say my name, 'cause I
You made me wanna ride again, 'cause I, I, I, I, I

'Cause if you were my first, baby (My first love)
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh-oh-oh-oh

'Cause if you were my first, baby
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love (Oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish you were my first love (I wish you were my first love)
'Cause if you were my first, baby
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
You fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around get smoked
Nigga, you fuck around get smoked

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, niggas know the rules in my hood
If you touch me you get murked
We ain't with that back and forth, it ain't no rap, we hittin' first
G-5, we be at LIV by Sunday when you in the church
Momma stressin', sellin' dinner platers
Tryna get your casket and get ya hearse
Last nigga that slid on us got dropped on it, he told on us
Every nigga you see with me got ice on 'em, bank rolls on us
Naw nigga, no 1 on 1's, we don't fight fair, we just roll on 'em
V-S stones and Cuban links, all that ice wear with that gold on 'em
We ain't swingin' no flag, nigga
We ain't need no pass, nigga
Glock 40 with a 30 clip and a laser on it, play tag with us
Everybody wanna talk bricks
'Til them feds swoop in and grab niggas
Dream Chasers got into somethin'
We don't ever blink 'cause we trash niggas
I don't know if y'all heard 'bout what my homie do with that 30 out
Deen Buck still in the cut and the state fittin' to let Ernie out
I ain't even gotta say nothin'
'Bout that other homie that you heard about
'Cause if he heard about that you run your mouth
He come to your house and start swervin' out
Catch me N-Y-C, out Shadyville, I'm in the tank
Only time it's Manhattan when I'm in the booth or I'm in the bank
Summertime in La Marina with Dominicans goin' in the paint
Pullin' up, screamin', "Eh, Dimelo'?"
Catch you in Brooklyn, get pita-rolled, pussy!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
You fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around get smoked
Nigga, you fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around get smoked
(Yeah! Ayy, Meek, whattup? Bang! Oh, man in Chiraq)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Niggas say me and Sosa beefin'
But we both eatin', but only one keepin'
Told Law he take 15 years
Every crime we did we gon Keep It Secret
Can't tweet Teyana, corporate nigga lookin'
So what I’m on I gotta keep it secret
That face no Stevie no Mimi, I promise Teyana that I won't leak it
Gripped the 30, just cashed out
If you caught strippin' then you assed out
I'm the same nigga my city asked about
While you in the cut steady buyin' clout
Fuck the judge, let 9 out, hairpin trigger, let 9 out
Four birds in the trap like four wings at Harold’s
With fries covered in mild sauce
Everytime a nigga rap beef, get clapped up in a couple weeks
IG comments and a couple tweets
Location on, we can go and meet
Headshot, I'm outta town, I'm in Killadelphia with my nigga Meek
Pop a wheelie in N-Y-C, I got the 30 on with my nigga Flee
Heard Tyga sneak dissin' on me, tell them thot bitches I'm not right
Tyga only got one name, but that nigga ain't got one stripe
He backpack, so easy to get the nigga shit snatched
Ask Mally Mall to get his shit back
In Chiraq, don't come here
You ain't from here? Don't come here
'Cause shorty snipin', bag on him if he don't like this
No Young Chop, that .40 bangs just like him
30 punch like Tyson
Back to the rap flow, hot shit
Fuck I gotta rap for, got bricks
Every city I go, got sticks
Pockets Wells Fargo, no bricks
Say I'm on top now, no shit
You can never say I wife shit
I don't even like shit, I just pipe shit, one night shit
L.A. with killas and thuggers
New York SlowBucks, them my brothers
A-T-L with Migos and Young Thugger
We gon' shoot shit up in public
And they gotta urge to take
Chiraq, look at the murder rate
500 dead bodies, better go and get money 'fore you be on first 48

[Verse 3: Shy Glizzy]
You wear red bottoms and Phillip Lim
Everybody tryna get a hold of him
Bad bitches they be in Benz
I knock ‘em down like bowling pins
Feds snatch me, I don’t know them
Real nigga on 4nem
Young Jefe, the new Soulja Slim
Hangin’ out the tank with Slow and them
Come take a trip to D.C.
Hear a lot of Me and see GG
I’m the big dog, I’m ringin’ off
Like Mambo Sauce on a 3 piece
“Glizzy, why you ain’t D.C.?"
Who said I ain’t D.C.?
Fuck ya bitch to my CD
She let me record her like Mimi
A nigga playin’, it’s lights out
Ooh, shine got me iced out
Stay low 'cause the mice out
You only get fly when the Mikes out
Can't wait 'til it get nice out
Tell Chino bring the bikes out
Got 50 guns in my trap house
You better off fuckin’ with the White House
I’m the realest youngin' in the fuckin’ world
I got plenty money, I got plenty girls
Got a villa for the week, got fifteen freaks
And they all wanna go for a fuckin’ swirl
Had her come to us with the marble pearls
Glock 23, treat her like my girl
357, that bitch just twirl
Make him catch our shit like Fitzgerald

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
You fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around get smoked
Nigga, you fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around get smoked

[Cody B. Ware]
This is that post apoc, post Pac
Punks on the block
Supposed to be close
But I swear right now
They close to be not
Put the gold in the pot
Put em on, bring em on
Nigga hope that they drop
But I bomb on them all
On with their the bongs
They be hopin' I pop
You open the knot
You openly admittin' you not
You openly be spittin' shit you don't be givin' a lot
You all be givers givin' these women the rings and the style
I'm Michael Tyson, Bison, relivin' the villainous plot
My vision of rock, my vision is caught
Killer cobra, N'est-ce pas
Feel us a who, feel'a real is enough
I'm callin' your bluff
I'll slaughter all your borders you trust
They won't be carryin' your orders automatically dust
I'm automatically rush, plus grammatically tough
Trust the elephant tusk, trunk, and go for the top
Punk, who want it?
I'm guaranteed to get it and flaunt it
I'm playin' Buckley as my intro and I exit on ballin'

[Mike Shinoda]
Skin to bone / steel to rust
Ash to ashes / dust to dust
Will tomorrow have it's way
With the promises we made
Skin to bone / steel to rust…

[Ryu]
You can't stop it, all you can do it watch it while it's happenin'
Like a tragic accident, rappers go and get your coffin
Skin to bone, the high raw biff of this rap shit
My legacy set in stone, fo' sho' no asterisk
Concept immaculate, start to finish
I'm Lil Wayne's dentist, looking at platinum plaques I'm gettin'
It's not an accident you flew off the roof
You said you was fly, so I just wanna see if it's true
I got the juice like GQ, but I wish it was Grey Goose
Let it mix with my prescriptions and I turn into Keith Moon
A T two, Terminator, Demigod, Jesus
Fort Minor: We Major, let's take it to phase two
The mission isn't finished yet, I been on the internet
Hearin' fans talk and maybe we should consider it

[Chester Bennington & Shinoda]
Ah
Skin to bone and steel to rust
Ah . . Yeah
Skin to bone and steel to rust

[Shinoda]
I'm on some taxidermy rap shit, talk about some raw game
You're nothing but a trophy mounted on my door frame
I spit that propane, light you with a slow flame
And watch you burn until there's nothin' but a gold chain
Yeah you'll be some crispy critters
You'll wish you with us
You'll wish what we did, you did it
You can't, you kiddin? I don't have a shoe you fit in
You're as soft as a motherfuckin' newborn kitten
I'm an animal, tearing flesh into bone
Randomly rippin' everything gone
Unless they forget what then let it be known
I'll bury every competitor, every predator
Anyone ever forget it, you'll regret it forever
Never been nothing short of a legend, you peasants will learn
I'll stay standin' in the front like I'm forgetting my turn
For these matchstick rappers, this is meeting adjourned
I ain't even gotta match them, I'm just letting them burn!

[Chorus]
Hard to follow my dreams workin' this 9 to 5
People keep tellin' me my check is on the way
So sun up to sundown, I'm grindin', tryin to make it by
Prayin' for my shift to come and take away the pain
That day is finally here
That day is finally here
That day is finally here
New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain
New wrist, knew that, knew this, finally here
That day is finally here
That day is finally here
New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain
New wrist, knew that, knew this

[Verse 1]
No, no I won't settle for nothing less than the air that I breathe
I-I-I know it's a struggle, but who the hell g'on do it for me?
Who the hell g'on do it free?
If I don't get up and bust my ass, that's my motto
I can't put my faith in the lotto
Luck don't stay nowhere near where I go
Unless you ride that muthafucka
And you be lucky enough to get away, in the grave
What can I do, what can I say, I tried to get paid
But I got grazed, the bullet went through
But I ain't get paid
Now what do I appreciate? My J-O-B
Hey boss, I'm comin' in late

[Chorus]
Hard to follow my dreams workin' this 9 to 5
People keep tellin' me my check is on the way
So sun up to sundown, I'm grindin', tryin to make it by
Prayin' for my shift to come and take away the pain
That day is finally here
That day is finally here
That day is finally here
New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain
New wrist, knew that, knew this, finally here
That day is finally here
That day is finally here
New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain
New wrist, knew that, knew this

[Verse 2]
Lil' cousin got it right?
And bike without no frame, ride the same rides without no brain?
Life ain't life, without no shame
If I make it out the hood, damn right I'm gon' change
My cell phone number
But the area code still gon' be 305 tho
My friends, who was my friends just like my kin?
Walked e'm in model?
But please wipe your feet on the rug
You can keep your shoes on, it's all love
Boy, let me stop, I'm dreamin' too much, now who the hell
'Gon give up a million bucks
Nobody but God, right now I could use me one of them black cards
I'm scarred, I fell apart, I came here with stars, its hard huh?

[Chorus]
Hard to follow my dreams workin' this 9 to 5
People keep tellin' me my check is on the way
So sun up to sundown, I'm grindin', tryin to make it by
Prayin' for my shift to come and take away the pain
That day is finally here
That day is finally here
That day is finally here
New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain
New wrist, knew that, knew this, finally here
That day is finally here
That day is finally here
New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain
New wrist, knew that, knew this

[Verse 3]
F-F-F-Findin me
That day I been tryin' to reach, that pay I been dyin' to see
Boy them folk wouldn't lie to me
I thought money ain't grow on trees
Depends on the roots, how you plant that seed
They quit, you can't see no leaves
Hold up, I need my Versace's
Grace covers of magazines, my mother she proud of me
Myself, I, the one who the haters thought wasn't gon' be shit
Big yachts, every day I get seasick, I was broke, the prefix
My book say "Why y'all gave that nigga some cash?"
I wrote a song about it, wanna hear it? here it goes

[Chorus]
Hard to follow my dreams workin' this 9 to 5
People keep tellin' me my check is on the way
So sun up to sundown, I'm grindin', tryin to make it by
Prayin' for my shift to come and take away the pain
That day is finally here
That day is finally here
That day is finally here
New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain
New wrist, knew that, knew this, finally here
That day is finally here
That day is finally here
New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain
New wrist, knew that, knew this

[Intro]
How's life?
Great, everybody's going through something
They gotta get over it
You can't go around
Let's just enjoy the time

[Verse 1]
The night is young
You know we've just begun
Let's have some fun
Until the moon turns to the sun
Look out, the DJ's got this party jumping
It's easy to let loose when you sipping something
Relax, it's what you deserve
There's no need to be reserved

[Chorus]
Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night, can you stay up?
Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night, can you stay up?
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for

[Verse 2]
Telling you can't control what you can't have
You're here to enjoy yourself
Put time in the back of your mind
Spin what's left of it on the floor
Have another round and just enjoy this party
Put your fear aside, go head and grab somebody
Ain't no limit, no such thing as too much
And if you cause a line in the V.I
I'm waiting on you to show me

[Chorus]
Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night, can you stay up?
Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night, can you stay up?
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for

[Verse 3]
If you find yourself not knowing what to do, just lift you hands up high and improvise
And don't you worry about what they think of you, all you can do is just live your life
Now is the time
Now is the time
So come and show me what you're all about, right here, right now
Yeah, it's the perfect time and place

[Chorus]
Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night, can you stay up?
Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night, can you stay up?
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for

[Verse 1: Usher]
Walking with my head down
Counting every step
Hoping that the next one
Brings me closer to the man I was
'Cause I was way better
Maybe it's because
We were together

[Chorus: Usher]
I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone, remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life, I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow, I ran right into
You (looking for myself)
You (I, I-I, I-I-I)
You (looking for myself)
And somehow, I ran right into you

[Verse 2: Usher]
Escaping on the tightrope
Trying not to fall
If I don't keep my balance
I know I will lose it all
I should have known better
And it's all my fault
That we're not together

[Chorus: Usher]
I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone, remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life, I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow, I ran right into
You (looking for myself)
You (I, I-I, I-I-I)
You (looking for myself)
And somehow, I ran right into you

[Bridge: Usher]
I was on a journey
Trying to figure out who I really was
Then I realized that
When you're not here
Half of me is gone
So in order for me to find me
I had to find you
You know? (you...)
And I got a funny feeling that (you...)
You won't know who you are
And unless you find me (you...)
It's like...
You look in the mirror (you...)
And you see the person that you truly love

[Chorus: Usher]
I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone, remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life, I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow, I ran right into
You (looking for myself)
You (I, I-I, I-I-I)
You (looking for myself)
And somehow, I ran right into you
You (looking for myself)
You (I, I-I, I-I-I)
You (looking for myself)
And somehow, I ran right into you

[Verse 1]
Re-introduction to a feeling I don't wanna know
Yeah, I've been running, but it caught me somehow
The rule was never fall in love, I did it anyway
You make my heartbeat keep pumping
Why the hell you turn it up so loud?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear a thief
It's just you and me together
Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

[Chorus]
Here we are, we are, we are
And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

[Verse 2]
I went in all the way, I thought I could get in and out
She said, "Relax, you gonna be here for a while"
But I threw caution to the wind and did it anyway
And the truth is, I'm learning to love it and I ain't gonna turn it down

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear a thief
Once the music sets you over
Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are

[Chorus]
Here we are, we are, we are
And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

[Bridge]
Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

[Chorus]
And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

[Verse 1]
Who else really trying to mess with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G though
Treating Birmingham just like my Hollywood shows
I'm trying to tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
I live fast die young, never take it slow
Tell your girl to tell a friend that it's time to go
And tell me today's weather
I know they say they good, but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really it's whatever
I am murdering and this is so amusing
If they're a sight to see then I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me, someone hit the snooze then
And keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking
These London street lamps got a real glow
Dizzy playing driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he a hater, baby, he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lying to the kids like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to Saint Vincent, Saint Marry
But I ain't playing high school games
Pullin McLarence through a McDonalds drive through lane
I'm to fly, I keep it hip hop like Afu-Ra
Baby girl on that Mclaren
You gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords
I do it better than the best could
You know what it is, Drake and Tim Westwood

[Verse 1]
Honey, you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get, you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before

[Pre-Chorus]
I know flowers go from rain
But how can love grow from pain (Pain, pain, pain, pain)

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar (Ain't that peculiar)
A peculiar-ality (Ain't that peculiar)
Ain't that peculiar, baby (Ain't that peculiar)
Peculiar as can be (Ain't that peculiar)

[Verse 2]
Oh, you tell me lies that should be obvious to me
But I'm so much in love with you baby, 'til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all your lies seem true

[Pre-Chorus]
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger (Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar, baby (Ain't that peculiar)
Peculiar as can be (Ain't that peculiar)
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity, hey, hey (Ain't that peculiar)

[Bridge]
Ah-ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Hey hey (Hey hey)
Ah-ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Hey hey (Hey hey)
Ah-ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Ooh

[Verse 3]
I cried so much just like a child that's lost a toy
Maybe baby, you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child, my tears don't help me to get my way

[Pre-Chorus]
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears? (Tears, tears, tears, tears)

[Chorus]
Now ain't that peculiar baby? (Ain't that peculiar)
Peculiar-arity (Ain't that peculiar)
Ain't it peculiar, honey? (Ain't that peculiar)
Peculiar as can be (Ain't that peculiar)

Said I don't understand it, baby (Ain't that peculiar)
It's so strange sometimes (Ain't that peculiar)
Ain't it peculiar, darling? (Ain't that peculiar)
Oh, baby (Ain't that peculiar)
Talk about strange (Ain't that peculiar)
Ain't it funny? (Ain't that peculiar)

[Verse 1]
Well, I'd be doggone if I wouldn't work all day
And I'd be doggone if I wouldn't bring you my pay
But if I ever caught you running around
Blowing my money all over this town

[Chorus]
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, Hey! I'd be long gone
Then I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone

[Verse 2]
Now hey, hey, hey!
I'll be doggone if you ain't a pretty thing
And I'll be doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring
And if we live to be a hundred years old
If you ever let that spring turn cold

[Chorus]
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey hey hey! I'd be long gone
Oh I wouldn't be doggone, baby
I'd be long gone

[Bridge]
Now did you hear me?
Well now what I say, oh, believe me
Well, every woman should try to be
Whatever her man wants her to be
And I don't want much, all I want from you
Is for you to be true to me

[Verse 3]
I'll be doggone if love ain't a man's best friend
Oh, baby, And I'll be doggone if you ain't the loving end
Though I know you make me feel like nobody could
If I ever found out that you're no good

[Chorus]
Then I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone
Well I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone

[Outro]
I wouldn't be doggone
Gone catch me a train
No baby, I wouldn't be

[Verse 1]
On our way, so it seems
Bloomin' flowers waltz before me
Rollin' numbers, passin' time
Got to get outside the city
In the morning, all will see
Just how crazy young love can be
On our own, away again
Don't get down, my darling

[Chorus]
I'm gonna tangle my face hair, I'm gonna tickle your daughter
Three o'clock in the morning, they all cry to me
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels and your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window, I'm on your street

[Verse 2]
Miles away, so unclear
Almost lost it in Montana
Let's pull over, have us choke
I love to watch you when you're dancing
I wonder if they ever dreamed
They would get just what we gave them
All wrapped up in being nineteen
Chasing stars that are falling

[Chorus]
I'm gonna tangle my face hair, gonna tickle your daughter
Three o'clock in the morning, they all cry to me
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels and your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window 'cause that's where I'll be

[Post-Chorus]
C'mon, Caleb!
Ow!

[Solo]

[Bridge]
And when that train heads home
They're gonna be so gone, gone
You ain't never gonna see me no more
Gone, gone, you ain't nothin' to me
And when they shine them streets
They'll only find our song

[Chorus]
I'm gonna tangle my face hair, I goin' tickle your daughter
Three o'clock in the morning, they all cry to me
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels and your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window 'cause that's where I'll be
I'm gonna tangle my face hair, goin' tickle your daughter
Three o'clock in the morning, they all cry to me
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels and your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window 'cause that's where I'll be

[Post-Chorus]
C'mon, Caleb, Caleb, Caleb, Caleb, Caleb!

[Outro]
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your—
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me

[Verse 1]
It's your life
Don't you let them tell you when to bat your eyes
You're the only one who's going to sacrifice
Makes no difference if you're right or wrong
Take that ride
But I want your little sister by your side
Maybe little later we can all collide
Do our living like a rolling stone

[Refrain]
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted

[Chorus]
An innocent smile
Ah, runnin' free
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be

[Verse 2]
Show your face
Living in the shadows like you got no name
'Nough to make a little girly go insane
Be my guest to let it out tonight
It's ok
I know all about the little games you play
Shaking your apple right in my face
Only when you know that I'ma begging for a bite

[Refrain]
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted

[Chorus]
An innocent smile
Ah, runnin' free
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be

[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is–

[Bridge]
I'm gonna get your mama, I'm gonna get your pa
I'm gonna tell everybody, just a what I saw
So won't you show your face (Show your face)
Your little apple shake (Show your face)
I know the love you gave (Show your face)
I know the love you take (Show your face)

[Chorus]
An innocent smile
Ah, runnin' free
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be
An innocent smile
Ah, runnin' free
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be

[Verse 1]
Blistered, cracked and bleedin'
Cold, no one should know
Rain falls down a freezin'
And stickin' like a snow
Lingerin' Suspicions
Screamin' in my head
Lies all mixed up with omissions
Oh, welcome home again

[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late for apologies, they're fallin' at my feet

[Chorus]
"This is just the way of the world," Joe said
I had to put a bullet into his head
And then lit up a cigarette
Decided to call his fat friend Fred
Well, he said, "Fred, I just killed a man"
I caught him layin' with my girlfriend
And now, they're both dead
People can be so cold when they're dead

[Verse 2]
Callin' all the neighbors
Time to make amends
Whiskey floods the table
Oh, good friends 'til the end

[Pre-Chorus]
And they're making silly faces and it's tastin' bittersweet

[Chorus]
"This is just the way of the world," Joe said
I had to put a bullet into his head
And then lit up a cigarette
Decided to call his fat friend Fred
Well, he said, "Fred, I just killed a man"
I caught him layin' with my girlfriend
And now, they're both dead
People can be so cold when they're dead

[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late for apologies, they're fallin' at my feet

[Chorus]
"This is just the way of the world," Joe said
I had to put a bullet into his head
And then lit up a cigarette
Decided to call his fat friend Fred
Well, he said, "Fred, I just killed a man"
I caught him layin' with my girlfriend
And now, they're both dead
People can be so cold when they're dead
"This is just the way of the world," Joe said
I had to put a bullet into his head
And then lit up a cigarette
Decided to call his fat friend Fred
Well, he said, "Fred, I just killed a man"
I caught him layin' with my girlfriend
And now, they're both dead
People can be so cold when they're dead

[Verse 1]
Dirty belly of a secret town
Cheap trick hookers are hanging out
At the bar near the Greyhound station
And the bare-chested boys are going down
On everything that their momma believes
Pack of smokes and a little bump of cocaine
Help you feel not so strange

[Chorus]
Said old Pa, "She don't get off
Unless somebody's standing near
And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line
She's all tied to a chair"
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten

[Verse 2]
All the bubbas got their heads in a nod
They don't know what they love or deserve to get
Chances are that that worm in his lap
Doesn't even know which fish that he'd like to bite tonight
Oh, tonight, tonight, tonight, oh maybe tonight

[Chorus]
Said old Pa, "She don't get off
Unless somebody's standing near
And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line
She's all tied to a chair"
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten

[Bridge]
Cops are on the call
Weeding out the freaks
Fingers in the dirt
He's spitting out his teeth
Spitting out his teeth

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Comes home on call, isn't that the peace
Fingers in the dirt, and he's spitting out his teeth

[Chorus]
Said old Pa, "She don't get off
Unless somebody's standing near
And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line
As she's all tied to a chair"
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten

[Outro]
Oscillating on the
Oscillating on
Oscillating on
Oscillating on

[Verse 1]
Little Mona Lisa layin' by my side
"Crimson and Clover" pullin' overtime
I feel too close to be losin' touch
By giving in, what am I givin' up
Am I losing way too much?

[Chorus]
But, hey! California Waitin'
Every little thing has gotta be just right
But say! While you're tryin' to save me
Can I get back my lonely life?

[Verse 2]
I'm goin' so fast and I can't slow down
It's hard to get up when you're spinnin' 'round an' 'round
I'd give you the news but nothing's changed
I'd sing you a song but they blew it away
All wrapped up in this stupid ass game

[Chorus]
But, hey! California Waitin'
Every little thing has gotta be just right
But say! While you're tryin' to save me
Can I get back my lonely life?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Ah, hey, California Waitin'
Every little thing has gotta be just right
But say, while you're tryna save me
Can I get back my lonely life?
But, hey! California Waitin'
Every little thing has gotta be just right
But say! While you're tryin' to save me
Can I get back my lonely life?

[Outro]
Can I get back my lonely life?
Can I get back, can I get back?
Can I get back my lonely life?
Can I get back, can I get back?
Can I get back my lonely life?
Can I get back, can I get back?
Can I get back my lonely life?

[Chorus]
Spiral staircase going down
Paint your body red and brown
On our knees, we'll feast on a sex show
Spiral staircase! Spiral staircase!

[Verse 1]
Greasy haircuts, a German-Chinese girl
Going to keep y'all busy, tugging at my curl
You better get your ass together, you better walk, walk, walk
By walking we cannot run
They all came to party and there's four to every stall
Gets frustrating just pissing on this wall
Seems like there's another story banging
Around every step you fake

[Chorus]
Spiral staircase going down
Paint your body red and brown
On our knees, we'll feast on a sex show
Spiral staircase! Spiral staircase!

[Verse 2]
They all came to party and there's four to every stall
Gets frustrating just pissing on this wall
Seems like there's another story banging
Around every step you fake

Spiral staircase going down
Paint your body red and brown
On our knees, we'll feast on a sex show
Spiral staircase! Spiral staircase!
Spiral staircase going down
Paint your body red and brown
On our knees, we'll feast on a sex show
Spiral staircase! Spiral staircase!

[Outro]
No babe, hey babe
Babe don't leave

[?] it, I want it
Don't you fuck my head

[Verse 1]
Dusty in your eyes, dirty from change
Lips of your kisses are sticking like tape
Woke you at sunrise, cold as a grave
I cut you some flowers, now don't be afraid
Now don't be afraid

[Chorus]
I'm lookin' for somethin'
To sink in my teeth without any cryin'
But I can't find no place or nothin'
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine

[Verse 2]
Home by the river, tall grassy fields
Under a Willow oak, well for to kneel
Dusty O Dusty, decision night
You'll be so pretty, all laced up in white
All laced up in white

[Chorus]
I'm lookin' for somethin'
To sink in my teeth without any cryin'
But I can't find no place or nothin'
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine
I'm lookin' for somethin'
To sink in my teeth without any cryin'
But I can't find no place or nothin'
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm lookin' for somethin'
To sink in my teeth without any cryin'
But I can't find no place or nothin'
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine

[Outro]
Where thrills are cheap and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap and love's divine

[Verse 1]
My darlin', you look lovely
I come to lay you down
Uncover your head and submit to me
We'll make a joyful sound
I don't care if you're by yourself
Or you're all alone when you need my help
Keep that smile on your pretty face
Because you don't have much I can't take away

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you worry, baby, you won't feel a thing
Close your eyes, Holy Roller Novocaine

[Chorus]
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
I know, I know
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back

[Verse 2]
You'll be hearin' me comin'
But I can't come inside
I'll be out back in my white Cadillac
Won't you join me for a ride
We'll go up to the mountain top
Where I'll show all the goods I got
Don't look back, keep your eyes ahead
This could be the night that the moon goes red

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you worry baby, you won't feel a thing
Close your eyes, Holy Roller Novocaine

[Chorus]
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
I know, I know
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back

[Bridge]
All the world is moanin'
And baby, so am I
I'm just giving you warnin'
And I ain't tellin' you why

[Chorus]
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
I know, I know
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
I know
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
I know, I know
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
I know, I know

[Verse 1]
Everybody wants to be a showman, yeah, they always got another one
Everybody thinks they got a genius, everybody got me on the run
Sometimes I think they come here just so you can say that you can
And I can't get alone in my bathroom, I need to give myself a hand
Y'all cuh-cuh-cuh-creepin', creepin' underneath my skin
Fuck you and your flashbulbs, snappin' my picture again
You drank all my whiskey, you stole all my smoke
And you're crowded all around me like I got nowhere to go

[Chorus]
Eyes are gonna roll back, I'm here to kill
Time for you to go, I'm-a-goin' to spill
It isn't you fast train
I'll be the king runnin' near the wheel
I ain't lookin' to make no deals here, no

[Verse 2]
You keep sticking to me like a prickly porcupine
You're getting your information from the grocery checkout line
Are you through confessing of your little girl obsession
Because I was only messing and I had a little time

[Chorus]
Eyes are goin' to roll back, I'm here to kill
Time for you to go, I'm-a-going to spill
It isn't you fast train
I'll be the king runnin' near the wheel
I ain't lookin' to make no deals here, no

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Eyes are gonna roll back, I'm here to kill
Time for you to go, I'm-a-goin' to spill
It isn't you fast train
I'll be the king running near the wheel
I ain't lookin' to make no deals here, no
Eyes are gonna roll back, I'm here to kill
Time for you to go, I'm-a-goin' to spill
It isn't you fast train
I'll be the king runnin' near the wheel
I ain't lookin' to make no deals here, no

[Verse 1]
Walking like you're stuck in velvet snow
Walking like you're stuck in velvet snow
Start in on your story and or go
Oh walking like you're stuck in velvet snow

Going cause you're sweating on our floor
Going cause you're sweating on our floor
Dancin' like you'll never dance no more
Oh going cause you're sweating on our floor

[Chorus]
Then you go and when you go
You get to goin' way to fast and not so slow
Turn out the lights cause they're coming up bright
And then you go

[Verse 2]
Hope that smoke ain't getting to you're face
Hope that smoke ain't getting to you're face
Showing off you're Sunday shaved and lacy
Hope that smoke ain't getting to you're face

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
Little Jo she warned me not to call you
Stoked that you were carrying some bad news
Leave it up to me and I'll just drown you
Out into the city that you came from

[Intro]
Slow night so long, she's frenching out the flavour
She's seventeen but I done went and plum forgot it
No tears are gone they're pooling on the table
No tears are gone they're leaving their mark behind

[Verse]
So far so good, she's absolutely wasted
She's hanging up and changing her story around
I just don't know where these ladies come from
I just don't know where they can be found
She's opened up just like she really knows me
I hate her face but enjoy the company
I'll take you home, or back to Oklahoma
You're not so nice, but sex sells so cheap

[Outro]
Rise and shine all you gold-digging mothers
Are you too good to tango with the poor, poor boys

[Verse 1]
He saw the purity, a shaven and a moaning
And standing on a pigeon toe, in his disarray
Stay dear, no picture pose
He's coming round to meet you
And screaming like a battle cry, it's more if I stay

[Chorus]
Me and you're cold, driving in the snow
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl, king of the rodeo, let the good times roll
Let the good times roll

[Verse 2]
How dare you come to me like Withnail for a favor?
Hold on, not my fairy tale you're trying to start
Take off your overcoat, you're staying for the weekend
And swaying like a smokey grey, a drink in the park

[Chorus]
Me and you're cold, driving in the snow
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl, king of the rodeo, let the good times roll
Let the good times roll

[Outro]
Good time to roll on

[Verse]
Pistol of fire
Pistol of fire
Pistol of fire
Shattered the frame
Go hug your sister
Go love your sister
Go hug your sister
One in the same

[Chorus]
Ah, where is it you want to take me?
Ah, where is it you want to go?
Ah, wrapping up the morning's coming
Ah, come home before the rooster crows

[Bridge]
I feel the water
Out in the cool grass
Down in the meadow
Under the tree
It's going to tickle
You're going to giggle
It's going to tickle
Tickle for free

[Chorus]
Ah, where is it you want to take me?
Ah, where is it you want to go?
Ah, wrapping up the morning's coming
Ah, home before the rooster crows

[Intro]
Just like the girlies back at corner stone
Wash my bugle boy a watching my throne

[Verse]
Sweet mutilation of a sold to nothing man
Lord have mercy shake is falling through your hand

[Chorus]
Razz the kid

[Outro]
Because you love me I'm the chosen one
These are the days to not be having no fun
I listen back to what you told me before
Just tell me where to come, I'll knock down the door

[Outro]x5

[Intro]
Toss me a breath, when you hold me down
Hot like a razor on my face
Something's growing that don't help me now
Paging the doctor just in case

[Verse 1]
Low and behold, things are killing me
Silly expectation of a dream
Girls are gonna love the way I toss my hair
Boys are gonna hate the way I seem

[Chorus]

[x3]
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old, blues

Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old

[Verse 2]
Peach Christmas lights spitting German ling
Feels like a fast or homeless sleep
At least there's a record that I love to play
Dreaming about a place I'll never see

[Chorus]

[x4]

[Outro]
Betty, Betty, Annie is praying
Baby with a man like lung
Smell her crying fighting back a fever
Mad as hell give up

[Chorus]

[x6]

[Verse 1]
Strain living with a name they get the best of me
But I don't walk away
No complaint I got much to gain so they keep testing me
And I keep feeding their face
They could go off and hit the road and what would I care
Hell I ain't going nowhere
I got the reigns and courage I was made of
And they've got fake love

[Chorus]
So I know I must show it's my show
I must go with my soul
Not my hand where I stand
It's my role, it's my soul

[Verse 2]
Pearls and necklaces and girls and all the pretty things
I ain't seeking to have
It's safe to say if I don't get this out of me I might quite easily
End up dead or just mad
Cross my t's and try to dot my i's
But that's just blinding me and I ain't living that way
I roll my sleeves to make a better man of me or I might easily
Just give up on this show

[Chorus]
It's my show
I must go with my soul
Not my hand where I stand
It's my role, it's my soul

I must show it's my show
I must go with my soul
Not my hand where I stand
It's my role, it's my soul

I must show it's my show

[Intro]
It's raining an old yellow
And it’s carving a path
So now we’re on our way

[Verse 1]
It’s taking us some journeys
While we wipe away frowns in the most crowded place
Say why you never call me man you never seem to call now that I’m OK
I’ll beat you in the end and every time you turn around here comes the coming of age

[Chorus]
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party

[Verse 2]
I cock and load my mergers when you question my mood
Because you haven't got no taste
You talking bout my baby I could flip you upside down
And I could mop this place
Say why you never sorry no you never seen my calling right in front your face
I smoke you in the end and don’t you ever turn around because it’s that coming of age

[Chorus]
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party

[Chorus]
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party

Oh
Oh

[Chorus]
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party

[Chorus]
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party

[Chorus]
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party

[Chorus]
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party

[Verse 1]
And I want to say "here's to me, go and change the world"
And I want to play until they are kicking down the door
And I'll be alright as long as I ain't seen at all
And I'm holding tight to that night we had a ball
We had a ball

Here's to the kids out there smoking in the streets
They're way too young but I'm way too old to preach
They know it all but they still ain't seen the truth
Just play my song and I'll show it all to you

[Chorus]
Either way you caught me whilst a lying
You caught me whilst a lying
You caught me with my pants down

[Verse 2]
My pawpaw's slave had to go and fight the war
He beat them all, then he took them all to court
My pawpaw called and he said, "Do you remember me?"
Now he's working awful hard in his factory

[Chorus]
Either way you caught me whilst a lying
You caught me whilst a lying
You caught me with my pants down

[Outro]
We ain't even been to the ocean
We been running barefoot the stream
We've been running barefoot through the stream
We ain't even been to the ocean

[Verse 1]
Our time as we go
We know our times will change
I talk to Jesus
Jesus says I'm okay
Pushing and jumping
Jumping the mountain range
Burning up railroad
Railroad from Hell to Maine

[Chorus]
While she says she's on her own
I'll be pacing on the phone
Taking numbers, taking names
Awful sick and tired of the game

[Verse 2]
She comes from nothing
Hoping for a taste of fame
She's got a birthmark
A birthmark the shape of Maine

[Chorus]
While she says she's on her own
I'll be pacing on the phone
Taking numbers, taking names
Awful sick and tired of the game

[Verse 3]
And it's cold and it's cold and it's cold when you're near
Cold when you're near any bottle
Cold and it's cold and it's cold when you're near
Cold when you're near any bottle

[Outro]
Our time as we go
We know our times will change
I talk to Jesus, Jesus, every day
(Our time as we go)

[Chorus 1]
Well I got
What she wants
Ah her nose
A tied knot
I got one mile to go
On down the road
On down the road

[Chorus 1]
Well she got
What I want
And she knows
What I'm not
And I got one mile to go
On down the road
On down the road

[Chorus 2]
She sang
Whooooooo
Whooooooo
Whooooooo
Whooooooo

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Whooooooo
Whooooooo
Whooooooo
Whooooooo
Whooooooo
Whooooooo
Whooooooo

[Chorus]
She look so cool in her new Camaro
It's black as coal and it goes boy, go go go
I brought my fight next to her Camaro
And when I fire on a smile then she blows, she blows

[Verse]
I'm making eyes through my sharp sunglasses
She's such a brat now I'm packing her cigarettes
I guess I'll take off these great sunglasses
It makes her look me in the eye before she's taken away
So cool in her new Camaro
It's black as coal and it goes boy, go go go
She looks so cool in that new Camaro
So black as coal and it goes, no it go go go

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Degrade me, my purpose
Bury me beneath the surface

[Verse 1]
I'm scratching, I'm clawing
Trying hard to make them pay
Can't stand me, beside me
Kid you not, your kiss sure killed me
The cold of my barrel
Never sees the light of day

[Chorus]
Call me, call me, you could only hurt the story
Call me, call me, I'll be there to shine a light

[Verse 2]
The smell on the speakers
Sweaty ballroom dancing fever
They gather in numbers
Ever for a closer view
The cease fire the weaker
Hair so red I couldn't keep her
The dogs hound the neighbor's
Everything was blown away

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Machine, machines, point me to the nearest party
You'll see, you'll see, baby it's the only way

[Chorus]
Call me, call me, you could only
Call me, call me, I'll be there

[Outro]
Machines, machines, point me to the nearest party

[Verse 1 - Kings of Leon]
Come on out and dance
If you get the chance
We're going to spit on the rivals
All I want to know
Is how far you want to go
Fighting for survival
Underneath the stars
Where we parked the cars
Ain't showing signs of stopping
Pretty little girls
Naked to their curls
Ready to lay in a coffin

[Chorus - Kings of Leon]
If you want to go
I'm going to go
I've got a fire burning
Go on take my hand
When we see the band
Baby's going to be a big one, oh yeah
Baby's going to be a big one

[Verse 2 - Kings of Leon]
When we see the lights
And we hear the fights
It's going to be a stunner
I've got something here
If you give me one more beer
I'm going to call the runner
I don't want to say
What I have to say
Babe, I'm a kicking off now

[Chorus - Kings of Leon]
If you want to go
I'm going to go
I'm going back down South now 

[x2]
If you want to go
I'm going back down South now
Come on take my hand
I'm going back down South now
When we see the lights
And we hear the fights
I'm going back down South now
All I want to know
Is how far you want to go
I'm going back down South now, oh yeah
I'm going back down South now

[Verse 1]
Got an attitude
Thinking that he's always right
Blowing smoke rings
Making me want to fight
And then I look back
At all things I've ever done
And then I look up
Seeing that he's on the run 

[x2]

[Verse 2]
It's a big thing
Everything your heart desires
And now I have to
Try and outdo the fight
I caught a big break
When playing in the role
I saw you laughing
Even though you know it's so 

[x2]
Even when you're on the run
Even though you know it's so

[Outro]

[repeat until fade]
Seeing that he's on the run
Even though you know it's so

[Verse]
I got razor sharp mind that wants to cut you down
A little place in mind maybe I could bed you down
Pony up, we got a ways to go
Set me up my friend, I'm running low
Oh, if you take my hand I'm going to get you out to here
The crash of bottles breaking and the swinging chandelier
In a rain of bullets and blood and snow
I saw the midnight coming and I watched her go
In a rain of bullets and blood and snow
I saw the midnight come and I watched her go

[Outro]
Yeah, I watched her go
I watched her
I watched her go

[Verse 1]
I got a friend
Shows me all the good times
Tells me I look better
Chews me up and spits me out
And then walks my ass home
And sings a song
When I'm gone, gone, go on
That little friend
Shoots me up and downtown
When I can't get me drunk enough
To pick me out the pieces
Of a place I call home

[Chorus]
To sing a song
Until I'm gone, gone, go on
No
Go on 

[x3]

[Verse 2]
I've got a friend
Helps me to get up again
Showers me in boozes
Tells me I got a big old dick
And she wants my ass home

[Chorus]
To sing a song
Until I'm gone, gone, go on
You know, son
Go on, 

[x5] on

[Verse 1]
Hang your weary head you seem defeated
Like the little girl you've been with cheated
And in the conversation had to go too far
Now your dropped off drunk in the back of your heart

[Chorus]
So dry your lily eyes don't be so cruel
Using all you know it's meant for fools

[Verse 2]
See you're smoking up in the parking lot
Shake your little butt, show them what you got

[?] Hot and the men all want and the chase is on 

[?]
Now your flag is flying in the dark and cold

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
It's in a celebration
There's something in the air
A little celebration
There's something in the air

[Verse 3]
Are you all giving up? Don't want to know now
And everybody sees everybody in your town
Oh, and the small town girl she went and got a bar
She going to shake it off she gonna give them what she's got

[Chorus]

[Outro]
This is a celebration
There's something in the air
A little celebration
There's something in the air
This is a celebration
There's something in the air
A little celebration
There's something in the air

[Verse 1]
How many souls will it take
How many necks will you break
I say, how many bones can I waste
In that little old shape
I say, hey, I'm sold from afar
But you don't try me
Showed you my car
But I don't drive

[Chorus]
Let me get away
On a holiday
We could, tire the ones we know
Going to tie right on
I say, hey, I'm sold from afar
But you don't try me
Showed you my car
But I don't drive

[Verse 2]
Tell the idiot yeah
Running down my back
We could, see the devils in town
Smoke 'til the sun goes down
I say, hey, I'm sold from afar
But you don't try me
I showed you my car
But I don't drive
I said, hey, I'm taken it back
Like you don't know
You blow me away
When you don't try

[Chorus]
Let me get away
On a holiday
We could, tire the ones we know
Going to tie right on
I say, hey, I'm sold from afar
But you don't try me
Showed you my car
But I don't drive

[Verse 1]
Come on down and dance
If you get the chance
We're going to steal on arrival
All I want to know
Is how far you want to go
Fighting for survival
Underneath the stars
Where we parked the cars
Ain't showing signs of stopping
Pretty little girls
Naked to their curves
Ready to let the car run
If you want to go
I'm going to go
I got a fire burning
Come on take my hand
Hope you see your man
Baby's going to be a weird one 

[x2]
If you see the lights
And we hear the fights
It's going to be a stunner
I've got something here
If you give me one more beer
I'm going to call a runner
I don't want to say
What I have to say
If I'm a-kicking off now

[Chorus]
If you want to go
I'm going to go
I'm going back down southbound 

[x3]
If you want to go
I'm going back down southbound

[Verse 2]
Go on take my hand
I'm going back down southbound
Wait until you see the light
And we hear those fights

[Chorus]
I'm going back down southbound
I don't want to know
How far you want to go
I'm going back down southbound 

[x5]
Oh, yeah
I'm going back down southbound

[Verse 1]
In your little white wicker chair
Unsuspicious nobody cares for you
You're so fucked up again
You laugh at nothing in the pouring rain
Try to tell yourself you're not insane
You fool, I hate you sometimes

[Chorus]
Hey, you know it ain't coincidental that you're lost in place
It's dripping off your face, and you're losing your precious mind

[Verse 2]
Send me a postcard if you get that far
You got a couple pennies in your rusty jar
The truth you've been gone for awhile
It's hard looking at you when you look that way
With your one night stands and your sleep all days
Ooh, you're such a slut sometimes

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You're losing your mind

[Verse 1]
Nineteen-seventy something, nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I cold hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2:19, that's when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
The doctor looked and said, "He's going to be a bad boy"

[Hook]
As we proceed to give you what you need
Get live motherfuckers. Get live motherfuckers!!

[Verse 2]
Now I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team:
Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearing the coach scream ain't lifetime dream!
I mean I want to blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail

[Hook]
Know some Hoover niggas thats down to ride
For a homicide, when its drama time
Niggas thinkin' that they MC's
Can't get touched, well its hammer time
Who the fuck is Lil Durk
I dust you like ash and purp
Your flow wack, my flow crack
Got marble floors, your floors crack
Got rap shit...

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
A fire needs a space to burn
A breath to build a glow
I've heard it said a thousand times
But now I know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
That you don't know what you've got
Oh, you don't know what you've got
No, you don't know what you've got
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I thought I kept you safe and sound
I thought I made you strong
But something made me realize
That I was wrong
'Cause finding what you've got sometimes
Means finding it alone
And I can finally see your light
When I let go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
'Cause you don't know what you've got
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
'Cause you don't know what you've got
Oh, you don't know what you've got
No, you don't know what you've got
It's your battle to be fought
No, you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus 1]
Goin' to the beach this weekend

Makin' sure the fun never ends
We're goin' to the beach this weekend

[Verse 2]
One suitcase
Makeup and a camera
Few bucks for Pepsi and a pizza
Lips locked
And water tube toe rings
Take a ride in a ragtopedo
And cruise the coastline, listenin' to the Eagles
And turn it up, so everyone can hear us sing

[Chorus 2]
We're goin' to the beach this weekend
Me and some of my best girlfriends

Can't get touched, well its hammer time
Who the fuck is Lil Durk?

Got marble floors, your floors crack

You're a real one, I owe you
Shot at them niggas when you heard the news

I’ll put you under the earth now it’s a garden on your tombstone
You shit stain teenagers, barely teething on hundos
I'll hold you like the slave you are, all my whips mayo
You from Illinois? I'll bring the noise
You ain't platinum? Don’t talk to me. Grammy nominated? Don't talk to me
20 Million? Don’t talk to me
It's levels to this shit boy, you basement? Don't talk to me
You want the fame? I'll take your name and that weak bitch you fall asleep with!

[Verse 2: Game]
Ain't got no time for this rap shit, Blood Money, Cash Money
Ain't got no time for this rap shit, Cash Money, Blood Money
Ain't got no time for this rap shit, rap money, drug money
I'm straight nigga, straightjacket!
Yo Trel let a nigga hit him with a ratchet
Big U let a nigga get some matches
I'ma torch the building this La Familia
Pull up and spin a nigga backwards
Light it up, smoke a nigga like a Backwood

Coming through with my dogs (grrrrrr)

Ridin' through the Chi, ain't ever seen Oprah
Hit a 300 with my little nigga Sosa
Brown paper bag, sippin' on a Four Loko
Nigga get love, I ain't talkin' 'bout The Notebook
Niggas got killers out here, west side, they feel us out here
Like Weasel Sims and Chicago, realest out here
Old man and the capitol hill is out here

[Hook]
I'mma turn it it for the dopeboys ridin' in the trap

Boy, what you need then I can get it if I ain’t got it

Get a nigga killed for a band, yo
Pay anything to be done in the streets, I done it
Swear to God from the West to the East side I run it
You better watch how you talkin’ to me now, Sonny
I’m a Bankhead nigga, but the East ride for me
You violate when you see me, get a demonstration in 3-D
My motivation hit different states
And that ten piece is like hot wings, nigga
Keep it real, you not me, nigga
If it wasn't for jail would have shot these niggas
If they disrespectin’ on top we kill ‘em
I'mma watch that, duck like like dark wing nigga
Still in the trap when you see me
With my burner tucked in my monster truck
The money you get like crumbs to us
And nigga, you ain't even thinkin' rich, I'm enough
With a matchin' chain, my formula
Get cocaine and buy everything, like “Yeah”

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Never will I be the one
Who ever go broke or don’t carry a gun
Play me for no joke, nigga, I’m not the one
Fuck that shit that you done, we riding ‘til dawn
Run up to him and do him, make sure that he done
New AK with a scope in case he may run
I bet he not far, on top of my car
If I got my tripod I won’t have to try hard to kill him
You hooker better pay me or you out through dealin'
Them niggas whippin' with you and the broad you drillin'
When it come to bankroll we the mob nigga
Okay, I got something for you, nigga
I’mma catch me a case, I’m so ratchet
Get the fuck out my face, 'bout four ratchets
Got bad bitches in mad cities
We hit the stage and throw 40 at it
I stay on gold, nigga, know me
I green light a whole nigga slit lowkey
My attitude does scare with some goatee
I do a drive-by listening to Doe B
My knob bro' (broke), no remo' (remorse)
I’m up there, stuck there, I rolled it for him
From the coast of Mona to the coast of Ole
Better know that

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Do you wanna see a G
Do you wanna see a G
Do you really wanna see a G in pain
Quite condemning me for being me
As long as you know me, I've been the same way
And I doubt it ever change babe
Do not compare me to no rapper, man them niggas lame
Like a moth to a flame I'm attracted to the drama
From a choppa to a llama
You're like a lighter to the sun
Your little fire won't survive in an inferno
You should listen, you would learn more
The more you say, the more you do
Don't help your ego, make it burn more
And as it burn down, I'm by a water hole
I say "fuck it, let it burn" tho
Fuck it
Sense it's really what you want
Them bitches got you thinkin' you too tough to get me what I want tho

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you, but I want you
(T.I.) You can have it all, but the pride come before the fall
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to, but I love you
(T.I) It's how you want it, it seem different than you thought

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
Tell me whatcha say now, tell me whatcha say
You said that you would come again
You said that we would remain friends but
You know that I do not depend on
Nothing or no one
So why would you show up, so uninvited
Then, Just change my mind like that

[Bridge]
Please don't take this personal
But you ain't shit
And you weren't special
Til I made you so
You better act like you know
That Iv'e been through worse than you
I just can't keep runnin' way

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jhene Aiko]
Everybody's like, he's no item
Please don't like him
He don't wife em
He one nights em
I never listen, no
I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
And tell you the truth, wish we never did it
Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
God damn baby, my mind's blown
I be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And yea I know what you did
But baby I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind, and shit
If this is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Say my pride is just, well maybe Imma just
Go spend 4 mil on a crib, not a jet
All the kids wanna where they lil brother's at
Goddamn, I didn't even tell my mother yet
But if all else fails, hold my G code
I stay right here, for years
Yeah, I know I was clownin'
I know you wasn't just gonna take that thing and down it
Yeah, be the first to say it, I was dead wrong
But if it isn't worth shooting me in the head don't
Take it to social media to try me
Putting folk all in our BI all on IG
Nah, I don't believe it, I don't wanna see it
Maybe I wake up tomorrow it'll be deleted
You out the country in bikinis on beaches
While I'm in the studio doing features
Like

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
In the Way
Funny how everything changed
(T.I) Ain't it funny, ain't it, ain't it, ain't funny
Once you got all that you wanted
(T.I) Yeah, you got it all now, huh
Nothing was ever the same
(T.I.) Just like you wanted, it's all yours, fly away, go

[Outro: Jhene Aiko & T.I.]
And no
I don't need you
I don't need you

(T.I.) Ya'll know what I mean
(T.I.) Couldn't handle the hot water man but
(T.I.) Made every thing around me fall down man, when the smoke clears I'll be right here
I don't mean to, but i love you
(T.I.) Where will you be?
So dark, so dark
(Dark)
So dark, so dark
(Dark)

Inside lookin' out my window
I don't see nothin' but rain
Sun up in the sky just-a-shinin'
(Just-a-shinin')
Still I'm lost in my shadow of pain
(Mm, hmm)

Like an innocent man that's on death row
I don't understand what made you go
And wanna leave me, baby
Leave me in the dark
Can you tell me, tell me?

You took my sex and my money
(Money)
Took all my self-esteem, yes you did
You had the nerve to think it was funny
(Funny)
I never knew a bitch so mean, yes sir
You absolutely drove a man to tears
All I really know is that you sincerely
Wanna hurt me, baby
Oh, yes you do
You wanna hurt me in the dark

Sunshine, somebody make
The sun shine, dark cloud, somebody
Take this dark cloud away
Just as sure as Noah built the ark
(That's how sure)
That's how sure I am you broke my heart

How could you, baby, leave me in the dark?
Baby, it's so dark , so dark, so dark
(Dark)

Feel like the sun ain't never
Gonna shine, you left me in the dark
So dark, so dark
(Dark)

I don't know, I don't know why
We ever had to part
Baby, can't see a damn thing
Out my window, it's so dark
So dark, so dark
(Dark)
Sometimes I want to curse
The ground you walk on
Even when I know that
Everything you feel, I feel it to

I wanna curse you, baby
Ooh, you left me in the dark
And now I want to curse you, baby
(I wanna curse you, baby)

For leavin' me alone, alone, alone
(You left me in the dark)
Oh, yes you did
And now all I wanna say is
In the dark
Ow, you left me, ow, you left me

It's like being on death row
(In the dark)
I don't understand why you had to go
I don't understand why you
(Hurt me in the dark)

Don't understand why you
(Hurt me in the dark)
Don't understand why you hurt me
Hurt me, hurt me, hurt me here
Just leave me
(In the dark, in the dark)
So dark, so dark
(Dark, in the dark)
So dark, so dark
(Dark, in the dark

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Really, really, really, baby
I'm stacking chips, chips
Hundred thousand dollars on a coupe
The way I pulled up on 'em, they really could sue
I might just make the news
The way a nigga doubting, how the hell these niggas robbing and get killed for riding?
How the hell these niggas cappin' and gettin' killed when clapping?
Baby girl, I want that camel-toe just like Aladdin
(Baby girl, I want that camel-toe just like Aladdin)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I wanna see it, I really wan' be it
Her head dumber than a spare Pyrex on a kiosk
Yeah, a hundred bands in that one lick
Snake life, don't tread, left that bitch for dead
Drag yourself to the back row, whole row's a party
Thugga-Thugga ran it up from the back page
Nigga, I don't use pistols but I'm having lead
I can shut down the street like a fuckin' raid
All my pints are double sealed up for fuckin' real
Count a million doing deals with no fuckin' deal
I done took over my city, still love it still
Pussy wet-wet, I'ma dive in like a pool

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Really, really, really, baby
I'm stacking chips, chips
Hundred thousand dollars on a coupe
The way I pulled up on 'em, they really could sue
I might just make the news
The way a nigga doubting, how the hell these niggas robbing and get killed for riding?
How the hell these niggas cappin' and gettin' killed when clapping?
Baby girl, I want that camel-toe just like Aladdin
(Baby girl, I want that camel-toe just like Aladdin)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Camel-toe, camel-toe, baby girl, bring me the camel-toe
We not the same, I'm a animal, please put me where the piranhas go
Five thousand dollar for my shoes, I'm standing on couches, no manners though
We too turnt up, we drinking out the cantaloupe riding on banana boats
Jumped into bed with this bitch and I put my fingers where the panties go
Sucked my cucumber then nut in her mouth
Now she looking sour like I'm in it though
Panoramic, just might pull up on Young Thugga like here you go bro
I got more snow than the cold, expensive toe rings on my toes
YSL, YSL, YSL, YSL, YSL, YSL
Let 'em out of jail, let 'em out of jail, please let 'em out of jail
If you don't, Thugga gonna call up Lil Hell
Lord knows I ain't trying to go back to jail

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Really, really, really, baby
I'm stacking chips, chips
Hundred thousand dollars on a coupe
The way I pulled up on 'em, they really could sue
I might just make the news
The way a nigga doubting, how the hell these niggas robbing and get killed for riding?
How the hell these niggas cappin' and gettin' killed when clapping?
Baby girl, I want that camel-toe just like Aladdin
(Baby girl, I want that camel-toe just like Aladdin)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington]
Like shining oil this night is dripping down
Night is dripping down
Glistening
And I’m trying not to think what I’m leaving now
Cause I'm leaving now
It’s time you let me go
Let me go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
'Till then carry on
And miss me when I'm gone
Oh don't let anyone give you away
Just carry on
And miss me when I'm gone
Oh don't let anyone take my place
Take my place

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
This tear between us is getting thinner now
Getting thinner now
Bittersweet
And ‘cross that horizon this sun is setting now
Slowly setting now
It’s time to let me go
Let me go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
'Till then carry on
And miss me when I'm gone
Oh don't let anyone give you away
Just carry on
And miss me when I'm gone
Oh don't let anyone take my place
Take my place

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, variation]
Just carry on
And miss me when I'm gone
Oh don't let anyone give you away
Just carry on
And miss me when I'm gone
Oh don't let anyone take my place
Take my place

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Tell them I couldn’t help myself
And tell them I was alone
Tell them I was the only one
And there’s nothing that can stop me from going home
Tell them I couldn’t help myself
And tell them I was alone
Oh tell them I was the only one
And there’s nothing that can stop me
From going home!
From going home!
I'm going home!
I'm going home!

Oh tell them I was the only one
And there’s nothing that can stop me
From going home!

Flow chilly, smokin on a dro Philly
Car pretty, whole city down with it
Flow chilly, smokin on a dro Philly
Car pretty, whole city down with it
Flow chilly, smokin on a dro Philly
Car pretty, whole city down with it
Mo' millis, competition oh really?
So silly, to think that you could flow with me
Pink diamonds, blue, yellow, black diamonds
White diamonds, can't find noone to outshine me
Hood nigga, hood hoes dream nigga
Mob figga, and bring 'bout twenty triggers
Trapped out, whose stash house is racked out
Stacked up, I lost my count I blacked out
X-ed out, dro-ed up and leaned out
The Rolls out, don't give a fuck I cashed out
Zone 6, yeah bitch I'm on my own dick
I run shit, this my hood and I talk shit
Hey bitch, you gotta slang like 10 bricks
Hit 10 licks, to stand next to Brick Squad, bitch
Bling bling, jeweled up like a young king
So clean, and the flow'll make a ho cream
Red beam pointed at you, better not scream
I stack green, my whole team by all means
Still drankin', smokin' weed that always stankin'
Suicide doors on the Rolls and the Lincoln
Brick Squad, brick boys reach stars
All black cars, all black trucks with black bars
Red laces, red bracelet, fed cases
New places, ain't tryna see no new faces
Hood livin', drug dealin', thug women
Fuck prison, we lean sippin' still sippin'
It's my world, I fucked her once she's my girl
Now yo girl, you bought all types of white pearls
Still talkin', diamond necklace moonwalkin'
Hood flossin', pull up and I'ma ruin Austin
No fakes, off days are lunch breaks
Blunt break, then hit the booth in one take
I'm like Mike, the greatest I need five mics
And five dykes, to sit next to me fight night
You heard right, double back sell the bird twice
I'm so chiste', might lower it to third price
I'm on goal, you want the ball like T.O
But can't blow, cuz you ain't got no cash flow
Tatted up, hand count ain't fast enough
Add it up, four mil in hundreds stash it up
Pool game, twenty thousand dollars rack 'em up
You too lame, too much game to pass it up
Gucci
Hook:x2
First you save a couple rubber bands (Yeah!)
Then you bring em back to Gucci Mane (Yeah!)
You know somebody, Shawty you the man (Yeah!)
Imma show you how to stack 100 grand (Yeah!)

Verse 1:
10 years old with a 8-ball jacket
9th grade Mack 9 got a 357
Before I bought my first 50, man I stole a Mack 11
Had to break in partner's house, First mission was successful
Every dollar to my name in my Crease Guess Jeans
Starter jacket, starter shirt, Try to take it, get murked
After school, whatever, yeah, awful lot I'm rollin'
All you gotta do is keep your next door neighbor smokin'
I'm poppin' pills and drinking off, Man I'm losing focus
Salt like a bag boy, cus I stack the groceries
Yeah I make it rain, but I feel like its promotion
Bitches tellin' other bitches 10,000 on Thursday
42 is worthy, Zone 6 is ervy
I could front ya shawty but I feel you don't deserve it
Hook:x2
First you save a couple rubber bands (Yeah!)

You know somebody, Shawty you the man (Yeah!)
Imma show you how to stack 100 grand (Yeah!)

Verse 2:
Before it pop, before it dock, Get it hot then make it spin
Splash it with the H2O, Hate to say I told ya so
Two hundred forty-seven thousand, Can I owe you 4?
Long as Gucci owe ya dog, then you're truly never broke
Heavy cus I'm smoking, but I be with hoes that never smoke
Don't won't none in their lungs, but they take some in their throat
My price look like I own the boat, Damn look like I'm on the boat
Like actually I went to South America and bought this coat
Got the money? Where's the dope? Meet me at the Texaco
Backseat of my Chevy, laughing tired, Thought you'd never go
Here's the money, Where's the coke? Meet me at the Amoco
Backseat of my Bentley, Tired of laughing, Thought you'd never go

Hook:x2
First you save a couple rubber bands (Yeah!)
Then you bring em back to Gucci Mane (Yeah!)
You know somebody, Shawty you the man (Yeah!)
Imma show you how to stack 100 grand (Yeah!)

Pull up in your hoody, no coat
Shoot you in the hoodie, no coat
Pull that .45, no Colt
Slit a nigga throat, watch him sink no boat
No, I'm not a spoke, get you killed, no spoke
Oops, I meant speaking, I'm slimy like deacons

I'm the man, yes I am, I'm the man with the plans
Yes ma'am, I'm the man on the beach

YSL on my feet, cheetah spots on my belt
All this money on me, a nigga might need help
Plus I'm the illest and realest young nigga you seen
I take off and pull up on Thugger (Woo)

There's a place I'd like to go somewhere out west
It's not specific, and the pictures show it best
I know there's trees, I know there's sand, I know there's grass
I know it's somewhere in the past

And there's a girl out there who's looking for it too
She's not sure when she'll go or exactly what she'll do
If I am doomed am I the first one or the last?
Am I just someone from the past?

[Chorus 1]
No one has to hear
The sound of people laughing at their fears
And the ocean
And sun are always there
To make you happy if you're feeling scared
Of the darkness

[Verse 2]
If I ever saw a ghost, it'd change the way I think
I wouldn't gasp for air if ever I did sink
I wouldn't struggle, I'd just let it all out fast
And then start living in the past

[Chorus]
No one has to hear
If we hold the hand that raised the hand
The sound of people laughing at their fears
And everyone can feel the hand
And the ocean
And nothing's gonna change
And sun are always there
It could be the time we're living in
To make you happy if you're feeling scared
We'll never feel so safe again
Of the darkness
But love always remains

No one has to hear
If we hold the hand that raised the hand
The sound of people laughing at their fears
And everyone can feel the hand
And the ocean
And nothing's gonna change
And sun are always there
It could be the time we're living in
To make you happy if you're feeling scared
We'll never feel so safe again
Of the darkness

[Bridge]
Love always remains
Love always remains
Love always remains
Love always remains
Love always remains
Love always remains
No one has to hear
The sound of people laughing at their fears
And the ocean
Love always remains
And sun are always there
To make you happy if you're feeling scared
Of the darkness
Love always remains
No one has to hear
The sound of people laughing at their fears
And the ocean
Love always remains
And sun are always there
To make you happy if you're feeling scared
Of the darkness
Love always remains
No one has to hear
The sound of people laughing at their fears
And the ocean

[Chorus]
No one has to hear
If we hold the hand that raised the hand
The sound of people laughing at their fears
And everyone can feel the hand
And the ocean
And nothing's gonna change
And sun are always there
It could be the time we're living in
To make you happy if you're feeling scared
We'll never feel so safe again
Of the darkness
But love always remains

No one has to hear
The sound of people laughing at their fears
And the ocean
And sun are always there
To make you happy if you're feeling scared
Of the darkness

[Verse]
And God said
Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place
And let the dry land appear: and it was so
And God called the dry land Earth;
And the gathering together of the waters called he Seas:
And God saw that it was good
And from the crew of Apollo 8
We close with good night
Good luck, a Merry Christmas
And God bless all of you -
All of you on the good Earth

[Verse 1]
All of these voices
On my TV
They got nothing to say
We are all are people
Some of us free
Some of us got it made
What's the connection
Some of us seek?
Some of us fall in love
But when I need it
You bring me things
Always knew that you were

[Chorus]
Hot love drama, it rips you apart
Cool down love, too hot from the start
Hot love drama, it rips you apart
Cool down love, too hot from the start
Too hot from the start

[Verse 2]
When I was younger
Life was all magic
Everything fell in place
But I still worry
Worry for hours
Imagining the life we're in
When I'm asleep

[Bridge]
But you came and you saw
And you spoke and I conquered most fears
But not all
And you stop but I falter
I love her I don't
And you think that I'm foolish
Stop the kids stop the love
That leads to

[Chorus]
Hot love drama, it rips you apart
Cool down love, too hot from the start
Hot love drama, it rips you apart
Cool down love, too hot from the start

[Middle 8]
Too hot from the start
Too hot from the start

[Chorus]
Hot love drama, it rips you apart
Cool down love, too hot from the start
Hot love drama, it rips you apart
Cool down love, too hot from the start
Too hot from the start
Too hot from the start
Oooooh

[Verse 1]
Changing lanes on a Saturday
Break it, break it, did you hear about the fire
It's such a tragedy, lives lost mothers crying
No time to react, it's getting down to the wire

[Pre-Chorus]
But when the wheels stop turning you're in trouble
Head for the rubble and close your eyes

[Chorus]
Standing on the interstate
I can see you coming from a mile away
But if you've got some money to burn
You can do the talking and I'll wait my turn
People say it's suicide
But nothing for nothing is a way of life, yeah
People say it's suicide

[Verse 2]
Watching it rain on a Saturday (Saturday)
Break it, break it, did you hear about the ship
It's a such tragedy, lives lost fallen heroes
So close to the end of a successful trip

[Pre-Chorus]
But when the wheels stop turning you're in trouble
Head for the rubble and close your eyes

[Chorus]
Standing on the interstate
I can see you coming from a mile away
But if you've got some money to burn
You can do talking and I'll wait my turn
People say it's suicide
But nothing for nothing is a way of life, yeah
People say it's suicide

Standing on the interstate
I can see you coming from a mile away
But if you've got some money to burn
You can do talking and I'll wait my turn
People say it's suicide
But nothing for nothing is a way of life, yeah
People say it's suicide

[Outro]
Oooooh, oooooh

She had a four wing dinosaur
That she has to draw
She pays attention to the image that she saw, yeah
A pencil to the paper
A pluser and subtractor
And she makes a fine feather microraptor

She has a four wing dinosaur

And she makes a fine feather microraptor

[Verse 1]
You were a child
Crawling on your knees toward it
Making momma so proud
But your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughing
You pick the insects off plants
No time to think of consequences

[Chorus]
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted

[Verse 2]
The water is warm
But it's sending me shivers
A baby is born
Crying out for attention
The memories fade
Like looking through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made
And not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
I guess not

[Chorus]
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus]
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees

Hello dirt
Goodbye innocence
Catch me a drop of dew
Goodbye hope
Hello elegance
You've got a lot to prove
Sunshine beach
You've got sandy toes
Race to the perfect beach
I owe you
Thanks a lot
Thanks for everything
You are weasel shit

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my god!
What have we done?
I killed your mama
You better run
You better skip
On out of here
Build you some place
Go and disappear

[Chorus]
Fucking weasel you lost your touch
Skinny as hell but it's not enough
Life is a mine shaft of love
But don't dig too deep
Fucking weasel you lost your touch
Skinny as hell but it's not enough
Life is a mine shaft of love
But don't dig too deep

Fucking weasel you lost your touch (Oh my god, what have we done)
Skinny as hell but it's not enough (I killed your mama, you better run)
Life is a mine shaft of love (You better skip, on out of here)
But don't dig too deep (Build you some place, go and disappear)

Fucking weasel you lost your touch (Oh my god, what have we done)
Skinny as hell but it's not enough (I killed your mama, you better run)

Don't dig too deep

[Verse 1]
Oh my God, I'm being born
This is what the future holds
One step in the right direction
Mother's milk keep me from infection

See me dance in my little boots
I wasn't born to follow the rules
I never learned what a bottle was
Now I'm sucking on it just because

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want to take a chance
I feel for you, I feel for you
But as it stands, as it stands

[Chorus]
Life that feels gone bad
Is hopeless from the start
Dreams that never end
Begin to fall apart
All my joys and pains
Will never equal love
It's because, just because

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey take a look at me now
Don't you wanna know about me now
Little baby is your worst fucking nightmare
Applesauce thrown outta my highchair

You can't stop cause you're not allowed to
You can't stop cause I told you not you
You can't stop cause I just won't budge
You can't stop baby just because

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want to take a chance
I feel for you, I feel for you
But as it stands, as it stands

[Chorus]
Life that feels gone bad
Is hopeless from the start
Dreams that never end
Begin to fall apart
All my joys and pains
Will never equal love
It's because, just because

Life that feels gone bad
Is hopeless from the start
Dreams that never end
Begin to fall apart
All my joys and pains
Will never equal love
It's because, just because
Just because
Just because
MGMT, 4 letters, 5 minds, 6th sense
Second Sight? Rock and Roll is 50 years old, but we are still speaking in tongues
What would Aristotle make of Wop Bop A Loo Bop?
A Zen mantra for our Bam Boo times?
"Expect the unexpected" I heard, as any fools knows, usually impossible
9 months, the pregnant portion of a year
Spent in their company, hasn't led me to deceive I know MGMT any better than anyone else
No tomes from me or type-tapping critics will reveal that
A 5 part puzzle beyond Rubik proportions for you to Twist & Shout to
Never mix stripes and spots we're told, ha
It's actually a beautiful clash
Hell, here comes the Paisley & Polka-dot too
What are you going to do about it?
Love it, of course!
CONGRATULATIONS, their second long player is something precious
A Gift. To Lovers. To Others. For Sisters. For Brothers. To live to. To love to. To look at. To listen through
Nine songs. Some Short, some long
A shy-eyed journey through the dichotomy of their lives through their souls
Sunday Bacon for the Monday Generation

IT'S WORKING
Love? Or Confusion? Reality? Contusion? Subterranea or Sub-fusion. The Quest begins
SONG FOR DAN TREACY
A Man. A Mystery? A Saint? A Sod? Were we all made for this life? Some give, some receive. But Dan Treacy smiles

FLASH DELIRIUM
The Natives go all Dance-hall Stomp as something strange in the water forces a Flash time Strobo-cop emanation of the will Delusion Extrusion

SIBERIAN BREAKS
A Pop Surf Opera, after the storm the loss of Ego
Breakers on the Beach. Hanging Ten with the Hodads. Distraction
Then Sandy Smiles as the Sun Squints its way. A new day. Cleansed. Ready. Surf's up! Piss or pass the Pot

SOMEONE'S MISSING
But Who? And Why? Just a thought? A feeling? Or a moment of doubt lying in wait?
To refilling the gateway. The door. Consciousness. A lines

I FOUND A WHISTLE
Hope. Reassurance. The bogey-man Triumph of the Plastic surf totem. The motion of Notions. Spells & potions

BRIAN ENO
A smile sent out. A wink and & chuckle. The Mystery of time
The Air Traffic controller of sound and space and subterfuge

LADY DADA'S NIGHTMARE
The Mind falters. Questioning. Looking for answers
Lock-loop images stray into fluorescing cotton candy crimes. Impervious
Then, the Release. A Primal Scream for the How Generation
More DaDa than GaGa. More Drinking than Thinking. Less Arty than Party. Time takes a rain-check
CONGRATULATIONS
The Half-arsed Hugs of routine celebrations. Realisations. Random Aging
A World in tatters? Glitter that matters? The hollow victory. And then Sleep
Dre:
Watts, Compton! What, cracker!

F. Gary Gray:
And South Central, don’t trip.

Tyrese:
Hold on, hold on, the homie is drunk off of Heinekens 

[Room laughs] That nigga said, “South Central, mothafucka!” F Gary, that nigga said, “South Central, mothafucka!”

Another level. Billionaire boys club for real, homie. Fix ya face. Fix ya face.

Dre:
You know that. You know that!

Tyrese:
Oh, shit. The Forbes list just changed. It came out like two weeks ago, they need to update the Forbes list. Shit just changed.

Dre:
In a big way. Understand that. The first billionaire in hip hop, right here from the motherfuckin’ West Coast. Believe it.

Tyrese:
OH SHIT!

[Begins C-walking]

Fuck y’all niggas talking about! Nigga what! What y'all niggas talking 'bout!

[Verse]
The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
Through a meadow land toward a closing door
A door marked "nevermore" that wasn't there before

[Chorus]

[x2]
The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you

[Verse 1:]
Everyday nothing seems to change
Everywhere I go I keep seeing the same old things
I can't take it no more
I would leave this town
But I ain't got no where else to go

Wake up in the morning to more bad news
Sometimes I feel like I was born to lose
It's driving me out of my mind

Gonna catch the next train
And move on down the line

[Hook:]
I'll be ready
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I'll be ready
I'll be ready when my train pulls in

[Verse 2: Gary Clark Jr.]
Walking down the street you might wanna cross a smiling face
But they'll stab you in the back as soon as you turn, walk away
Oh Lord, it's bringing me down
If things don't change around here
Ain't no use in my hanging 'round

[Hook:]

[Verse]
8701
Man it's been a long time coming
But I never forgot about you
I'm here
Yeah, we've traveled the world
Seen a lot of places, so many faces
We had a good time - we've grown together
Who would've thought we'd stay down this long, heh?
This is my chance to share my world with you
And I know you're gonna like it
Are you ready?

[Verse 1: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
Every time I look up
I see it in your face, you wanna hook up with me(You know you wanna hook up, stop playing
Instead of acting like you supposed to
You cop an attitude like you're too good for me
And you know good and damn well that

[Chorus: Usher]
If I wanted, I could take you from your man (please believe it)
With my eyes closed, I could have you eating out the palm of my hand
And all your little girlfriends, too
(No you can't, you're a playa, I don't want you)
Yes I can, and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby

[Verse 2 Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
Ain't nobody trying to clown you
But you're too damn old to play high school games with me
You know that, too damn old
Yes, you do
'Cause even when I'm not around you
I hear from my friends you be asking 'bout me
"What's up with him?" That's what you be saying

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
I don't really care
How long you've been together with your man
It's just a matter of time
Before I make you mine
I wanna make it clear
So there's no misunderstandings
That I get, what I want
When I want

[Chorus: Usher]
If I wanted, I could take you from your man (please believe it)
With my eyes closed, I could have you eating out the palm of my hand
And all your little girlfriends, too
(No you can't, you're a playa, I don't want you)
Yes I can, and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby
If I wanted, I could take you from your man (please believe it)
With my eyes closed, I could have you eating out the palm of my hand
And all your little girlfriends, too
(No you can't, you're a playa, I don't want you)
Yes I can, and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby

[Bridge: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
That I get, what I want
When I want
If I wanted to
If I wanted to
I'd have you doing whatever I want you to, you know?
Right now, I'm just not really doing that
But if I wanted to, anything
I'm saying
You and your girls, I could have them too
Listen to me
It's crazy, listen

[Chorus: Usher]
If I wanted, I could take you from your man (please believe it)
With my eyes closed, I could have you eating out the palm of my hand
And all your little girlfriends, too
(No you can't, you're a playa, I don't want you)
Yes I can, and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby
If I wanted, I could take you from your man (please believe it)
With my eyes closed, I could have you eating out the palm of my hand
And all your little girlfriends, too
(No you can't, you're a playa, I don't want you)
Yes I can, and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby

[Intro]
Love, such a lonely place
Nobody wants to be alone
To have the world, but no one to share it with

[Verse]
I am so alone
I can't stand this feeling of being without you
Yes, I'll do
Whatever it takes to prove I truly love you
Don't let me go
Let's stay together
Forever and ever
Can't sleep without you by my side
Help me

[Intro]
"What's up, this is Charlie Wilson a.k.a. Uncle Charlie
I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2008, still fighting it
I'm a winner, not a loser, I'm gon' win the battle
That's right, I'm cancer free"
"What's up, this is Greg Porn and I beat kidney cancer, true story"
"Hello, my name's Michael, I'm a cancer survivor four years in remission"
"My name's Bernadette and I beat stage 1 triple negative breast cancer"
"I'm Angela, I'm 50 years old
And I've been through 9 surgeries in 3 years
Fuck you cancer, you may have taken my breasts and uterus
But you can never take my heart"
"My name's Ann Marie, and I'm living with stage 4 lung cancer"
"My name's Kourtney and I beat thyroid cancer"

[Bunch of mashed up talking about beating cancer]
"Hi, this is Kathy Phillips and I beat the living shit out of breast cancer
Cancer definitely picked the wrong bitch to mess with
Fuck you cancer! Woo-hoo! I'm a survivor baby! Yeah!"
"Hey my name is Charles Porter, I had stage 4 Hodgkin's Lymphoma
I went through a year of strenuous chemo then I had a bone marrow transplant
Where they gave me salvage chemo, and five days twice a day
Full body radiation to basically bring my immune system down to nothing
And uh, so literally died to stay alive, umm
Come April, I'll be in my third year of remission
And it was a team effort, all the friends and family I had came together
And uhh, I had to keep that mental strong
But umm, we got through it
Uhh, some fallen soldiers went as I fought
Uhh, but they'll always be heroes, peace!"

[Hook: Chef Tone]
If I had a dollar for every time they counted me out
And my back was up against the wall
I could have died but I came out fighting, fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting, fighting

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, uh
With a breast full of lumps, man she ain't no punk
Say she gonna ride on it like a chopper in a trunk
Pink ribbon woman, she gon' live forever
Even though the doctor say she only get a month
Said it's my life and you only get it once
These flowers smell too damn good to be living in the funk
So I finna get it in and I finna get it crunk
And I finna get the living, ah-ah-ah
Eyes on remission from the jump
Breast cancer can't hold me back
That's the answer when they told me that
It can knock me down but I'm gonna be back
Strong, down for whatever
Exceptional and I don't know how to quit
And I never said never you can have that hair
Cause real talk bitch, I think I look better
Let's do it (do it), fighter, with everything inside her
Reportin' live from Death Row, drop the charges, be a lifer
Cell phones and your lighters, need you to put them up higher
So many candles on her birthday cake, might set that thing on fire, hey

[Hook: Chef Tone]
If I had a dollar for every time they counted me out
And my back was up against the wall

Could have died but I came out fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting, fighting

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, seven years old with stage four
This what champions were made for
Only so much fundraisers paid for
So I guess the rest is just all on me
That will to live against what's out here
Killin kids, well kiss my ass
It ain't killin' me, got things to paint
I got places to go, I got things to see
Wanna see my momma grow up, hold up, hold up
Wanna see my daddy grow up, hold up, hold up
I'm baldheaded and bravehearted, I'm small
But I'm a hundred feet tall, try to stop me, biopsy after biopsy
Chemo, but I'm a king though
I shake everything off me, lymphoma can't hold me back
It can knock me down but I'm gon' be back
Throw some SpongeBob in my Hot Wheels track
I'm a made man, made wishes
I ain't scared, I ain't flinching
Sorry momma but I gotta say it
But where I'm from they don't make bitches
Let's do it

[Hook: Chef Tone]
If I had a dollar for every time they counted me out
And my back was up against the wall
I could have died but I came out fighting, fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting, fighting

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, feel it
Went undiagnosed then untreated
When they finally found it, told him
Too far along and he couldn't beat it
But he couldn't see it, miss me with that dead talk
Miss me, my legs walk
And my heart beats and my wife witness
So fuck cancer, my life with me
And if I died, it die with me
Let's do it, fighter, with everything inside ya
Reportin' live from Death Row, drop the charges, be a lifer
Cellphones and your lighters, need you to put them up higher
So many candles on that birthday cake, we might set the thing on fire, yeah

We might set that thing on fire, yeah
Yeah we might set that thing on fire, yeah

Could have died but I came out fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting, fighting

[Verse]
The most beautiful sound I've ever heard
Maria, oh, Maria
All of the beautiful sounds of the world in a single word
Maria, I love you, Maria
Maria
Maria
I've just met a girl named Maria
And suddenly I've found
How wonderful a sound can be
Maria
I've just kissed a girl named Maria
And suddenly I've found
How wonderful a sound can be

[Chorus] 

[x2]
Maria
Say it loud and there's music playing
Say it soft and it's almost like praying
Maria
I'll never stop saying
Maria
Maria, beautiful, wonderful
Maria, sweet Maria
Maria
Maria

[Chorus]
Say, you'd never give away your heart again
I'll be knocking till you let me in
I know you told me you'd rather be lonely, you don't even know me
That's why I no longer want to be a stranger

[Verse 1]
Sorry you put your trust in others and they let you down
And all the the secrets and unknown evidence now in the open that you found
Cried yourself to sleep so many nights, said you'd never again
I'm not the one you hold it against, baby, it's not my blame

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you independent as hell
And doing it by yourself
But what you gon' do when the night time get cold?
I know you told me you'd rather be lonely
You don't even know me
I ain't moving out the way for nothing
I'm stubborn

[Chorus]
'Cause you say you'd never give away your heart again
I'll be knocking till you let me in
I want the title of your closest friend, baby
I no longer want to be a stranger
Tell me
What I gotta do (what I gotta do)
What I gotta do
What I gotta do (anything I gotta do)
What I gotta do, what I gotta do (tell me)
What I gotta do

[Verse 2]
You're stuck inside, no matter how hard you try to forget
Don't you wish there was a button we can reset and make it easy
But you can't take back the decision that you made to love
I know it's one that you regret and not too proud of
Because you keep telling me

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you independent as hell
And doing it by yourself
But what you gon' do when the night time get cold?
I know you told me you'd rather be lonely
You don't even know me
I ain't moving out the way for nothing
I'm stubborn

[Chorus]
'Cause you say you'd never give away your heart again
I'll be knocking till you let me in
I want the title of your closest friend, baby
I no longer want to be a stranger
Baby, tell me
What I gotta do, what I gotta do
What I gotta do (what I gotta, baby, tell me)
What I gotta do, what I gotta do
What I gotta do

[Bridge]
I remember the break-up
And the condition that my heart was in
But I would never surrender, no, no
I gotta be stronger, there's nothing time can't heal
Girl, I know your scarred
All I ask is a chance to come in and do my part
It's nothing but fear and you been holding on since
Too under pressure and I see you sinking in

[Chorus]
Say, you'd never give away your heart again
I'll be knocking till you let me in
I know you told me you'd rather be lonely, you don't even know me
That's why I no longer want to be a stranger
What I gotta do (what I gotta do)
What I gotta do, what I gotta do
What I gotta do, what I gotta do
What I gotta do

[Chorus]
Baby, I can come by and pick you up

Oh babe, I know what you like
And I would make love to you forever and ever

[Outro]
Usher...
You gonna wanna tell everybody 'bout how I got you all
Coming when I call, you know I'll break you off
And if these walls could talk, they would tell everybody
'Bout how I put it down, you know I shut you down
Got you up off the ground, yes, I can't be wasted
And if I let you on my spaceship, you'll have to let me taste it
Hop on it, I'ma give you a ride
'Cause we gonna make love all through the night

[Intro]
You on the internet and shit and uh... these motherfuckers be posting videos of songs like: "Uh, oh, uh, this the motherfucking blame it on the throne freestyle". Nigga, that wasn't a fuckin' freestyle, nigga, you pre-wrote that shit and just spitted it on a fucking camera. I don't really get why these motherfucking rappers just like... they, they don't wanna freestyle no more, it's like, you ain't got no more niggas that can really fucking spit of the top of the dome. So this nigga Left Brain gave a fucking beat, alright, i really liked this shit, I'll just fucking freestyle on it and this nigga fucking Hodgy Beats, i don't know why the fuck he's in here but he just gonna fucking nail it. So uuuhhh...

[Verse 1]
Yo, (yo), yo, (yeah), yo, (yo)
Your bitch pretty, she pretty
And now she's screaming, now i fill her up with semen
All she see is sea man
Now you hear her voice, no pro-choice
No odd pro-abortion on this boat
Bitch calm down, down
Krusty The Clown will make you laugh
Laugh, finger in your ass
Now you like "woah, hold up
Mister, I don't know your name"
Bitch, shut the fuck up, you're on a train
Just to death chop your body up and put it in the freezer
Bleed her
Before i kill her, fuck her just to please her
No condom, I just might disease her
And if that fucking happen, fuck it
She'll be dead, chopped up in my motherfucking freezer
You can fuckin' get the vanilla, Manelly Lisa
Alisa, here you wanna sample, nigga, try it
Kinda like a printer, nigga fire, I'm the dentist
Niggas looking at me
Hair nappy, here's a brush
But she don't wanna rush
Cuz if I fucking bust, quick
She's gonna be pissed
But then I pull out, fuck, I can't have blue balls
So bitch start sucking my dick
And then she fucking lick
I bust up on her face, now she looking like Michael, Jackson
Jackson, now I sound like Toni Braxton
Deep voice, motherfucker
Fuck, I had her sucking on my wrapped lollipop
Like it's a sucker, motherfucker
(Bitch)

[Verse 2]
Back for round two, i found you
You tryna run, but i found blue
Yellows over there
And the motherfucking field where
The niggas wear colored pants, jerking, pop pills
I'm on the other side
Where all the niggas ride, the niggas skate
But we take indy bitches with high GPAs up on a date
Where niggas smoke blunts and sniff coke
Where the motherfucking freestyles are never wrote
Or written, i'm livin'
Nigga shittin' while i'm pissin'
On they face, mace
Here you call the cops
Here's my phone, i'll catch your case
But i got a good lawyer so my fucking record erase
Just like a fucking pencil, I mental
Left Brain laced this instrumental, with some shit that’s so illegal, that
He gon have to go and fly over seas like an eagle
In the Winta, Decemba, Imba, Limpa
Kick him in the leg now he limpa, IMPA
Niggas rollin round, Nipsey Hussle in the Impala
Lookin at me while I style on ya
Oh, you mad cause I’m styling on you?
Plus the call is on me?
4-5in on em
Gnolly tricks on ya bitch, girl-boy lookin clean cause
You already know my hat green, and that shit staying Supreme
Uh
You can’t fuck with it, you little H-B
You hate me, A-C, L-B, H-B
C-V, Super 3 and Bran’doom DeShay
With my Nigga Domo the Gene’says, you
Hate on the O-F, that’s the best letter in the world
And I’m better better, than your better girl
She the best I’ve ever had. I--*cough cough*
Asthma- *cough* Fuck it, I’m coughin
This the re’free- *cough cough* oh shit

I said, This the re-freestyle
No written
I spit all my shit from the dome
Home like a motherfucker nigga leavin his college, for good
In the Hood
I’m from Ladera, not from Anglewood
Hawthorne couple times, go the city where I be
Even up in Hollywood, you could find me
I’m not a fucking cliche
E-Shay, E, A, ohhh fuck it i’m over it
I got work tomorrow
Left Brain let me get a beat to borrow
Just so I could spit the shit quick
Bitches with some big lips, yeah she got some big lips
A nice small tongue, for this over-sized big dick
Size 12 in the Shoe, 32 in the jeans
Skinny as fuck motherfucking t-shirt a 2X, yes
And you could ask anybody here that’s daily
Bitches feel me, fucking iPods wanna play me
Ask me why I cuss so much
Fuck, shit, cunt and dick
Now shut the fuck up bitch
Eat a fucking dick in a blanket
I be on that stank shit
Fuck everybody here
What the fuck I look like thankin'?
Ohh shit, the beat ended, fuck

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Born the daughter of a comedian
Middle of the eighties
Someone turn that awful mouth-breathing down, or else
Sally Hatchet lives in a hole in the ground
The longer it keeps raining, the more she has to struggle
To maintain a wonderful time, oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Go on and laugh it up without me
I've got smoke in my lungs
And a past life in the trunk, oh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Pretty rattled by the way that she
Empties a few clips out
Do I have a choice now?
Point that thing away from me, lady, oh

[Verse]
It's been a blue holiday since you've been gone
Oh darling, won't you hurry, hurry home
It's been a blue, a blue holiday, and I'm all alone
My dear, I need your love to keep, to keep me warm

[Bridge]
I cry when I hear the chapel bells ring
And sometimes I cry all through the night
Won't you please come home
And make my, make my holiday right

[Outro]
It's been a blue, oh, yes it has, it's been a blue holiday
And I'm all alone
My dear, I need your love, your love to keep me, keep me warm
It's been a blue, yeah
Oh, been blue since you, since you've been gone, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Shoulda died already (Faces)
I shoulda died already, shit (Faces)
Yeah

[Verse]
I shoulda died already
(Faces) Came in, I was high already
E'rybody trippin' that my mind ain't steady
(Faces) For my sin, shoulda been crucified already, rah!
Why the fuck you need me? (Faces)
Don't you know how to fly already?
Try and tell you that it ain't real (Faces)
Tell 'em, "Find that yeti"
(A-ooh!) Oh (Faces)
Motherfucker (I'm that yeti!)
And it all could end right now (Faces)
I never been so ready
(Faces) All my homies philosophers
(Damn right!) (Yes) Yeah

And I don't need nobody (Yes,) I would love somebody, though
Don't you ever get it fucked up (Faces)
(Fuck yeah) Everybody wanna be God
Besides God, he wanna be like us (Faces)
We ain't never sleep too much
Beat that pussy up, she gonna need that trust
(Faces) Never see me in the street too much
But on the inside, I'm outside
All the time (Faces
Faces, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Try and stay away from electric shock (Faces)
That electric shock (Faces)
I'm outside

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Snowflakes keep fallin' on my expired debit cards
Don't know why I'm still awake, I gotta be up at ten tomorrow
Missiles in my repertoire, I'd say I'm pretty regular
I never leave my house, I don't know why I got an extra car (Skrt)
My pool-house studio is covered up with pencil marks
And every day, it's full of jokers like a deck of cards (Hahaha)
Swear I'm so lonely, there's horns on my dome piece (Dome piece)
But I'm not the devil, I'm a motherfuckin' minotaur
Oh my God, look at how upset you are
'Cause we out here winnin', brought my dogs from out the reservoir (Hoo!)
And I'ma let 'em bark, before you ready, my set will start
We forgot our roots before and trust me, things, they fell apart
Wash myself with acid, it's because I got a denim heart
My conscience so weak, I need to split it up in seven parts (Okay)
Revis brought me out to Cali for the first time
Went to Amar'e's party, took tequila shots with Kevin Hart (Ah)
But Kevin don't remember that
I saw him at the VMAs, told a joke, he never laughed (Um)
The rap diablo, "free your mind" my motto
And we all gon' be good if TreeJay ever hit the lotto (We mu'fuckin' rich!)
So arigato, shit, you know I'm world-famous
And R. Kelly been told me that I'm the world's greatest (You're the world’s greatest!)
But still to fall in love is like a orgasm
'Cause you never gonna know if your girl fake it
I'm always faded, gettin' shaded in the basement
I just bought a cello, now all I do is play it (Play it)
Thank God that I made it (Made it), ask Q where Dave is (Where is he?)
He'll probably tell you that he rollin' midnights out in Vegas (Seven midnights!)
Me? I'm in my spaceship, my face is so complacent
Wear a suit to cash a check, we goin' to the banquet (Ching)
And Jimmy got the burner (Bow) but he don't wanna murder
And ClockWork is somewhere out in Sweden speaking Danish like
Hi Sven (Goddamn) isn't this your language?
That man must be a alien, I really can't explain it
Shit, it's just a little cocaine sniff *Snorts*
But the lines longer than parades is (Ah), yeah
I think it's time to give me all your praises (Praises)
So I can get this money and give all the homies raises (Raises)
My life is on these words, this is my affidavit (Wow)
And if you want a legal battle, send your ass to David (That's my lawyer)
Um, I'm half-man, half-amazin'
Probably half-God, but that don't fit my calculations (Don't make no sense)
I know the planet Earth is 'bout to explode
Kinda hope that no one save it, we only grow from anguish

[Chorus: Schoolboy Q & Mac Miller]
Yeah (Miller Mac) Miller Mac
Haha, yeah, these are my friends (Miller Mac)
Miller Mac, Mac Miller, Mac, Mac (Miller Mac)
Mac, Mac, Mac, Miller Mac (Miller, Miller, Miller, Miller)

Yeah, haha (Miller Mac) Miller Mac
I see you Mac, these are my friends (Miller, Miller, Miller, Miller)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
There's snowflakes fallin' on my debit card
Swear I'm not alive, I couldn't tell you if we ever are
In this game of thrones, it is known I got them 4G LTE connection bars
No control, fuck Ken' Lamar (Fuck you, Kendrick!)
I don't vote, I never registered (Nah)
But I'm a magnet for them zeros, call me Edward Sharpe (Woo!)
I wake up feelin' dead, I need a fresher start
So me and Q put people on the label we don't remember (Ah, okay)
Smiled as I saw Jerm nerdin' out with Josh Berg
Talkin' analog gear and drinkin' Arnold Palmer (Those are good)
In the other room, watchin' C-Span with E. Dan
Layin' down a baseline, doin' drums with his free hand (How the hell does he do that?!)
When I was in first grade, I wished to be Puerto Rican
My mom took me to a barbershop to get some cornrows
I walked in, ready for them Sprewell braids
But the lady said my hair was too short though (Aw), damn
I always thought my moms was the illest for that shit (Yah)
Drivin' through the hood, she did not have a reaction (Skrt)
With a six-year-old, she kept the doors unlocked
And drove by the 5-0 like "Fuck those cops!"
Goddamn, it just don't stop (Nah)
I know my father probably wish that I would just smoke pot
My grandma probably slap me for the drugs I got (Boy!)
I'm a crackhead but I bought her diamonds, we love rocks
A'ight

[Chorus: Schoolboy Q & Mac Miller]
Yeah (Miller Mac) Miller Mac
Haha, yeah, these are my friends (Miller Mac)
Miller Mac, Mac Miller, Mac, Mac (Miller Mac)

Yeah, haha (Miller Mac) Miller Mac
I see you Mac, these are my friends (Miller, Miller, Miller, Miller)

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I've had the same outfit for six days straight (Gross)
And still all these bitches will get in position
'Cause I got their pussies all drippin' in paint (Woo)
Somehow, I'm makin' this music, it's just to relate to
(Damn, you're drownin'!) And I got the life raft, ain't gonna save you
Look at my reflection (Woah), I broke the mirror
It's only for protection (Okay), shit keep gettin' weirder (Weirder)
And I can't see a thing but (Woah) things never been clearer (Yeah)
Call the Mothman, it's Richard Gere (It's Richard motherfuckin' Gere!)
Yeah, this is our year
Let's get fucked up and get the fuck up outta here (Be gone)
I've kicked it with the aliens, a different stratosphere (E.T., phone home)
They lookin' down like, "We come in peace" (Oh, me too)
Yeah, I told Will and Bill they need to kick the habit (Put it down)
We on the same trip, we just got different baggage (That trip was brown)
Parks spilled the grape juice on all of Dylan's dad's shit (Grape juice!)
We were just some motherfuckin' kids (Woo)

[Chorus: Schoolboy Q & Mac Miller]
Yeah (Miller Mac) Miller Mac
Haha, yeah, these are my friends (Miller Mac)

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, no fucks when I go nuts
Give no fucks when I go nuts
'Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa
Yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I give no fucks when I go nuts
'Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa, dead
Woke up from a coma
Poured up with a soda, smoked, went back to bed
Never thought I'd be such a loner
I tell my bitch that I fuckin' own her
My neighbor's daughter just got a dog
I'ma run it over, I'm a fuckin' soldier
So cold, bruh, fuck pneumonia
All my bitches got love for Sosa
I just wanna fuck Rosa Acosta
Then disappear in Southern California
Strung out 'til the night, I'm chillin'
Everybody worried that the lights might kill 'em
Uh, feel ya sight slippin'
Long lines of those white women
I'm with the homies, bump Counting Crows
Just went through a half ounce of coke
Blood pourin' all out my nose
Don't tell my mom I got a drug problem
I'm fuckin' high-ly publicized
When the sun go down, I come alive
'Cause the guns go off in the summertime
The guns go off in the summertime, blaow

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
This another motherfuckin' rap song
Broke and crazy, rich and famous doesn't last long
Spent all my cash on a broken dream
Went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean
All-all-all I got's this mansion and this potpourri
But don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Don't-don't-don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Woah

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I blow a spliff before the ink dries on the paper
And lately, I don't like shit, I been inside on the daily
Gettin' wasted as the time that I'm spendin' high and sedated
I'm puttin' five in his face, because we don't buy into bullshit
As soon as it's flashin' lights then it's kush to hide in the bushes
I do this shit out of spite 'cause there's niggas that overlooked me
Forever, I'm more content with dark and stormier weather
Flip the fuckin' cross on your rosary, we supposed to be better
But here's a toast to your efforts
And don't approach me with nothin' that isn't money or breakfast
I'm close to chokin' a pussy, pussy
Sweaty man, you best had bet your bottom dollar on him
With a couple niggas, weighin' sess like it's a lot of options
Fifteen on me for soda and swishers
And who's the shit, a bag of chips and a colon decleanser?
I'm over bitches tryna act like I owe 'em a picture
Rather introduce these hoes to Vince who could show you a pistol
Listen, S.T. was the older initials
Bend rap game tighter than boa constrictors
Rollin' stone like a boulder ravin', I'm so impatient and goin' dumb
As disclosin' my fuckin' home location to total strangers
No love in my heart for coppers, blood from my lungs on the sink
Cashin' out off the garments, the artist, fuck what you think
The sky'll turn black and the carrions could pick
At my flesh when I rest, tell 'em bury me adrift

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
This another motherfuckin' rap song
Broke and crazy, rich and famous doesn't last long
Spent all my cash on a broken dream
Went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean
All-all-all I got's this mansion and this potpourri
But don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Don't-don't-don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Woah

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
It's the official drug user, Soulo
It's Ab-Soul, jack, listen, yo!

[Segue]

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
A little louder
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
And if by chance this is my grand finale
Bury me in Allegheny County, it's the
The most hated, so faded that I'm bow-legged
Don't bathe, gross gang, smell like old Lo Mein, shit
The flow dangerous, make you wanna do the wave
Throw your bitch right off your lap and start a standing ovation
The most strangest, master of the ceremonies
A fifth of Stoli then it’s only Cher and Moby karaoke
My bitch a shooter, call her Annie Oakley
Get you for a pair of Kobe's, just got out on probation
And no famous friends for me, just old faces
I only go places wasted like I'm Joe Namath
Not a king, I'm no David, music, I'm a crackhead
No hobbies and recreation, don't even know my address
Self-medicate, self-education
Rick Rubin showed me transcendental meditation

[Chorus]
Let us have a grand finale
The world will be just fine without me
The clown got a smile on his face
Slow it down, we goin' out with a bang
Are you ready for the fireworks?
It was a silent night 'til the fireworks

[Verse 2]
Yeah, okay, I
I fear nothin' on this odyssey of dark roads
God lives in my dog's soul, the devil in his dog bowl
We are the prophets, Jesus was a poor sport
He booted Nostradamus, turned water into wine
But he loved the gin and tonic, had skeletons in his closet
Even God will one day be forgotten
And recently I been feelin', I been feelin' like
It'd be really nice to get to sit with Mickey Weiss
Shoot the shit 'bout life, he'd be pissed I'm sniffin' white
Never got to see me grow up, how long it take to live a life?
I'm a bit surprised that I'm even still alive
Mixin' uppers and downers practically suicide
My old Jewish mind, REMember music, you'll be fine
And I make my own beats now, if you behind
Hallucination's how I use my mind
Who am I?

[Chorus]
Let us have a grand finale
The world will be just fine without me
The clown got a smile on his face
Slow it down, we goin' out with a bang
Are you ready for the fireworks?
It was a silent night 'til the fireworks

[Intro: Earl Sweatshirt]
Yeah, mane, you know I'm smokin' at the beginnin' of the song, man, like a damn... rapper
Ah, man, man, it's crazy bein' so rich, man, damn

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
In '09, we were still on the bus, nigga
Before Nak was deluxe, when I didn't have a brush
When there still wasn't hoes tryna fuck with me
'Fore I cleaned up a bit like it's company comin'
I ain't know we was on the cusp of the money
Tryna get a few bucks under custody
And my twin brothers was all Syd brothers
So my kin gully and my skin toughened
Thick lens coverin' my eyes now
They ain't bright, nigga, I'm just high now
And if this a different way to clear my mind out
I need to find out, I'm doin' fine now
And I don't look as stupid when I talk now
And everybody at the show look astounded
Posted up drowsy
In the cut so much that it's pus round me
Catch him in the daytime or dusk hours
Smokin' out the pound, houndin' mutts out it
If your tucks lousy then you can't sit with us (Nah)
Can't call it harsh livin' when the margin between you and all these fuck niggas is about as large as it gets
And you workin', givin' arm and a leg
Say he workin' but he just talkin' 'cause he ain't workin'
Like a long-distance bitch
Who you know that's out that's harder than this?
Chargin' niggas like a Tomlinson win, nigga
Slight frown on the brow on the brim, color brown
Runnin' wild on the route that was picked
When the clouds were enshrouded
I'm out with my face in the shallow end, drownin' again

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I could drown you with a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul

[Verse 2: Da$H]
Drugs got me feelin' like Vigo Carpathian
Just look at the state he's in, yo, yo
The most critically acclaimed, slang contortionist
That ain't suckin' corporate dick
Said it with my balls in grip
Other hand got a cork to hit
All this Ralph be the sportsmanship
Walked in and said I needed all the chips
As well as the one on my shoulder
Feel like my heart got pneumonia, blunt laced, covered in odor
Cops still lockin' niggas up for quotas
Brain still numb from the shit in the soda, so
A generation lost
Facin' a Paul Allen in vacant loft
Warrants bein' filed for the cases fought
And them drugs get obtained by debatin' cost
You ain't Superman when that cape is off
Just Clark, nigga, sittin' in his high-rise
Tryna see the bright side of life
And a nigga just keep comin' back with a dark picture
It's like hard liquor, and see people are books
So you judge a ma'fucka by the first page
And a bitch by the back cover
The crime is long-sleeved, so the tats covered
Real ones, I'm the last brother, when they see me on stage
They said my shit was so insane, it was like Cobain did his last number
Motherfucker

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I could drown you with a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul (Yeah)
Shallow soul (Um), shallow soul (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Yeah, well
Isn't he dizzy off the ups and downs?
He got a lil' Whitney, put it in a blunt for now (Smoke)
Shit was s'posed to get me high
Why the fuck I wanna die now? (Damn,) and I'm
Strung out on this dusty couch
In a big white ugly house, I tell the bitch, "Slow down
(Down) Stop runnin' your mouth
You holdin' my money, just shut up and count," my (Woo) (Count my)
Right nostril hasn't worked in a week
Plus the plug got work, like he servin' for a sheik
Me, I'm swervin' in a Jeep
Burnin' weed, doin' circles in the street (Skrrt,) yellin'
"Play my shit or wake the baby up!" (Wake up)
I get her faded, put it back in her labia
All my life I've been afraid of powder
All my life I've been afraid of power, where did all that go?
The wrong decision always call my phone (Okay)
Last supper I was fuckin' with the Corleones (Uh-huh)
I need somethin' stronger than a cortisone
That can save me from the war I know
Shout out to Soulo (Soul!), and rest in peace Alori Joh
The devil on the other side of this glory hole (Woah)
Any time, any place, you can bet I'ma eat
'Cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
Woah, look at all these new faces
I see, I see, I see
They comin' on a plane but they're leavin' their suitcases
Been a criminal before scales were digital
Used to put the weed in the sole of my blue Asics (Woah) (

[?])
Hate myself, fuck the strangers (Woo)
But the raps are just way too flagrant, so
Here I go (Here I go)
Throwin' up a prayer, it's a Hail Mary
(Woah, where it's at) I've never been religious
But I feel like the scripture's got it all there
It's not just gypsies and fairies (Fairies,) this could be my last breath
(Last breath) I'ma take my time
(Wait a second, please)
'Cause I'ma go out the same way I came in:
Right by the pussy with nothin' on my mind

[Outro: Mac Miller]
You are standing in a shallow soul
You are speaking with a shallow soul
Shallow soul
I could drown you with a shallow soul
Will you wash your sins with me?
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinking from a shallow soul
It will set us free
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are standing in a shallow soul

[Segue]

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, um
Uh
Ladies and gentlemen
Yeah
Whew, that drip
Yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Writin' on writer's block, haven't slept in days
They wanna put me in the psycho watch, everyone's afraid
Of what I do inside my studio, worried I'ma lose control
They rufflin' my feathers and they shufflin' the Yu-Gi-Oh!
Execution flow, at your neck like new cologne
Uno, dos, bitch, I'm in your head like Freddy Krueger though
My brain fried, always chasin' the same high
I'm too fucked up to function, do nothin' but waste time
Woke up annihilated, lyin' on the pavement
Covered in items I regurgitated under a fire escape
And I know that it's Friday, 'cause every Friday they have a parade
In-front of city hall, hear 'em celebrate, they havin' a ball
My pupils dilated, highly dehydrated, I'm lost inside a giant matrix
Isolate myself from eyes I find contagious
Jump above the comedown
I'm strung out, noddin' off inside the dugout

[Chorus]
Don't be scared, just come with me, yeah
Feels so good to feel this free
What are you afraid of? Tell me what you made of
What are you afraid of? It's just a little angel dust
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da, la-da-da (Just a little angel dust)
La-da-da-da (Yeah,) la-da-da-da (Yeah)
La-da-da-da, ayy (It's just a little angel dust)

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I'm playin' hot potato on a Winnebago
The chips are stale, they taste okay though when they dipped in queso
And what's an angel with a missin' halo?
She would drop outta school to take a trip to DayGlow
Found a twenty layin' by the sewer rats
You know little Stuart hasn't been in any movies lately
He's spent his paychecks on cocaine and latex
His agent workin' hard to try and book him a commercial
What I do should not concern you, do this 'til I turn blue
Not Eric Sermon, I'm more Merlin, curses turn 'em into bird food
Hurry to make the first move, I'm walkin' like Herschel
And now we at the end of verse two, oh

[Chorus]
Don't be scared, just come with me, yeah
Feels so good to feel this free
What are you afraid of? (Woo!) Tell me what you made of (Yeah)
What are you afraid of? It's just a little angel dust
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Yeah)
La-da-da-da, la-da-da (Said it's just a little angel dust)
La-da-da-da, la-da-da-da
La-da-da-da, ayy (It's just a little angel dust)

[Outro]
Don't fuck with the angel dust
Don't fuck with the angel dust
Please don't fuck with the angel dust
Oh
Please don't fuck with the angel dust!

[Segue]
Aw, shit

[Intro]
The good times can be a trap
Oh, yeah? Ha-ha-ha
Oh, hell no (Yeah, yeah)
Not here (Stück scheiße!)
Check myself into rehab (Yeah)
Yeah
Um... I might die before I detox
(You piece of shit)
Now that's a bar
I'ma save that one for a little bit (You piece of shit)
But let me come in with—with somethin' else, you feel me?
(Yeah, yeah; here we go)

[Verse 1]
It's Air Jordan on my flip-flops (Woo)
And kill me now if I did it all for hip-hop (K-ch, blaow)
I might die before I detox
This ain't high school, no little Asian I can cheat off (Mimimimimimimimi)
We keep chiefin' while police watch (Woo)
Loss in vibration, sirens blowin' up the weed spot (Ha, yeah)
The Heisman hopefuls all growin' up to be cops
Chasin' after gangsters but they never find the G-spot (Oh)
I'm recordin' like I'll die tomorrow (Die)
At the rate I'm gettin' high, it'll be hard for me to find tomorrow (Find)
But I just pray that I'll survive tomorrow (Oh my God)
As she cries in sorrow (Oh my God)
She just needs some time to borrow, she'll be smilin' by tomorrow
Everything will be so fine tomorrow (Yeah)
Put the white away, we can do some lines tomorrow
Come say hi to Morrow (Hello)

[Interlude]
Well, I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Well, I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Here I am
Oh... I know you see me
Here I am
Yeah... and I'll be damned if this ain't some shit but here I am!

[Verse 2]
I'm the only suicidal motherfucker wit' a smile on (Ching)
Let’s hold hands and sing the Bible, that’s a violent psalm
The high-strung, eyes-low, ride along
Everybody grab a fuckin' number, this a dieathon (Mimimimimi)
(Kill me) Oh, I'm the bomb (Hell yeah)
Literally back away, I'm the bomb (Ka-plow!)
Let me get my lion on (Growl)
Yeah, okay
Eighty-five grand get you a heavy-ass wrist (Bling)
They ain't killin', they just yellin', that's it (Ah!)
A deadly combination with that ecstasy sniff (Uh)
On the phone, probably yellin' at Rich (Come on, man)
Say, double the money (Double the money), please, double the money (Double the money)
Triple the problems, double the money
They was all laughin', wasn't that funny? (Hahahaha)
I started fuckin' with drugs and now I'm a junkie
The U-S of A, I fuck with my country (

[?])
But Uncle Sam could never teach me how to Dougie (Oh, oh)
I'm thinkin' 'til my brain pops
Spittin' is a cakewalk (Woah)
I'm just a rapper, guess I'm stickin' to my day job (Woo)
Wiz gettin' faded, come and kick it at a bakeshop
Everything is A-1, steak sauce (Hahaha)

[Outro]
(Oh, thank God)
Goddamnit (Thank God)
Thank God
Here I am and I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Here I am and I'll be damned if this ain't some shit

[Interlude]
Straight up, I just wanna say one time, after two years at this ma'fuckin' crib: fuck all y'all ma'fuckers livin' all over this ma'fucker. Try kick me out—that goes for you, Mrs Watson. Wit'cha little ass kids always fuckin' cryin'. You got your little chihuahua. Fuck you and your motherfuckin' mama, bitch. I'm out here, suck my motherfuckin' dick!

Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's how it's goin' down, one time for that
Okay, okay, yeah

[Verse 1]
(Oh my Lord) He's on drugs again
My neighbors yellin', I don't give a fuck again
And I swear to God if the cops come again
I'ma open up this door, get to rumblin'
Start bussin', bussin', bussin', bussin'
My dick, your mouth, no discussion, yeah
It's all happenin'; I must be imaginin'
Take a hit; time travelin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn up the motherfuckin' volume
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) 'Til the speakers bust like the condom
And you a freak, why you hidin' in a costume?
That disguise make your body look awful

[Chorus 1]
Let me see them nipples, baby
Ooh (What's happenin', man?)
Don't give it all up, just a little, baby
Ooh (What's happenin' here?)
I'm just tryna free your mind
(Free your, free your mind)
'Cause all you see is dollar signs
(

[?] blinded by the streets)

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Line-crosser, real-life flyin' saucer
Nothin' straight 'bout her but her posture
Young prodi-gy, I'ma eat lobster
Pull Spanish bitches but I speak nada
And she got a need to roll the weed all up
You ain't got a chance when it's me on ya (Shit)
I'm a ma'fuckin' legend, girl
Leave that pussy killed (Kilt,) bitches out in Edinboro

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn up the motherfuckin' volume
'Til the speakers bust like the condom
And you a freak, why you hidin' in a costume?
That disguise make your body look awful

[Chorus 2]
Leave that pussy crippled, baby
Ooh (What's happenin', man? Haha)
Let me slide right down the middle, baby (Yeah)
Ooh, where the fuck my Thumbalina?
Has anybody seen her?
(Faces)
She blinded by the streets

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh

[Interlude]
'Bout to start my own motherfuckin' committee and it's gon' be me and Josh, and it's gon' be with ma'fuckin' bitches with their ma'fuckin' ass and titties. I don't give a fuck. Shit.

[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
Man, I think I'm Eric Andre
Man, I think I'm Louis C.K
Man, I think so therefore I am, man, It's 8AM
Man, my mind is an emporium of cute naked hoes
My brother one of the only ones I can confide in
It ain't no water in the pool, go 'head and dive in (Dive in)
I toot my horn, I blow my bugle, I recycle
I say "free beluga whales" on YouTube, what do you do?

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Okay
The pussy like trouble 'cause I'm in it often
A drug habit like Philip Hoffman will probably put me in a coffin
But down the slope in my toboggan
Three day delirium, gettin' weirder than Austin
Now it's seven in the morning, this rapper life is so boring
Still at it, the drug absorbent, endorphin addict, yeah
The evil follow me, I got a devil magnet
I know a bitch who'll let you fuck her for Coachella passes

[Verse 3: Sir Michael Rocks]
Oh, so pompous, the ambiance
You remind me of the lobby of the Mondrian
I saw you meditatin', get your Gandhi on
If she got that stank puss, then I won't be long

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
Never lose your mind 'cause insanity is brutal
Life is just like college, all you have's your noodle
Mirror mirror on the wall, I'm staring at a dead man
Me and Mikey go back like Bron-Bron's headbands
The white American, hiding from the Aryan

[Verse 5: Sir Michael Rocks]
New Tibetan Mastiff, and he hate it when you stare at 'im
Jump in, the jacuzzi on (Yeah,) say I fuck witchu the long way
I love you more than Kanye love Kanye (And I'm a)

[Verse 6: Mac Miller]
Slave to the W, I don't hang with losers
I'm in the suburbs doin' drive-by's on Razor scooters
It's my first try, swear I got a third eye
It's work time, I sell the coke to students out in Irvine

[Verse 7: Sir Michael Rocks]
Ehh, coming off the high, listening to Jamiroquai
Why we go through hell when we tryna get to paradise?
It's like we ain't scared of death but we scared of life
It's like we shootin' for the stars but we scared of heights

[Verse 8: Mac Miller]
I'm in-doors, pair of gym shorts, with the Sith Lord
We might go bowling later, maybe play Connect 4
Get high, fuck her with the Tech Deck
Callin’ local middle schools and send in some death threats

[Interlude: Sir Michael Rocks]
Hey look
When I tell you this, I mean this seriously, from the bottom of my heart
I need the briefcase in 15 minutes
Or everybody's finished

[Verse 9: Mac Miller]
I love my powder white, prefer my bitches black
I'm gettin' lit with Da$h, you don't see us in the back
No longer little Mac, a briefcase with a million cash
Oh, yeah

[Outro: Mac Miller & Sir Michael Rocks (Both)]
Let me off at the top
Let me off at the top
Let me off at the top
Let me off at the top
Let me off at the top
Let me off at the top
Let me off at the top
Let me off at the top
Let me off at the top
We can keep ridin' for now
Let me off at the top
The road keeps windin' around
Let me off at the top
Oh, I'm high as the clouds
Let me off at the top
Hey motherfucker shut your motherfuckin' mouth!
Yeah

Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been rappin' since the apparition
G-g-g-god was gonna kill me and I'm glad he didn't
Might have made a bad decision
He just left me with an ocean and a bad religion
While Mary Magdalene laughin', smokin' a pack of Winstons
Up on a church hill, acid trippin' with older men
As they tell her stories, she's seducin' 'em
But she only usin' 'em
My studio is filled with spirits
And every single lyric dedicated to my dearest friends
Yeah, and lord knows that we hate the questions
So back and forth, exchange faces over wine, playin' table tennis at dinner
I end up so bitter when I lose
Defeat hurts, I got scissors in my shoes

[Chorus]
And I'm dancin'
Never got the steps right
Loose, I never slept tight
But I'ma keep dancin'
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I did a cannonball off the deep end, my boat was comin' to America
Pouch of fairy dust and a little poodle terrier
A silver Derringer, smile for the camera (Take a picture)
Split your line up like James Farrior
I've always been a cowboy, they need me like the cancer cure
Weed loud as crowd noise, we just let the amber burn
Wiffle ball's a child's toy, ain't fuckin' with amateurs
I'm Ken Griffey on the Mariners
Okay, I'm way beyond the boundaries, outside of parameters
The rap chancellor, jacket made of camel fur
And Clockwork got every single answer 'cept time
I've experienced every feelin' except fine
I'm line dancin' again

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
Take your time, when talkin' to a nigga I don't waste none
Knock you off your feet and then I flee before the jakes come
Sick of hearin' cases from these niggas who ain't face none
But I'ma be the nigga that they feelin' when the day come
Thirsty for the pay, young niggas led astray
Stray bullet hit my brother in his ma'fuckin' face
What's fate when a person don't deserve what he get?
Shootin' reckless at the father, almost murdered the kid
Or is it karma for the shit that both the parents had did?
Ain't embarrassed, where I'm livin' we get merit for kills
From a family of niggas that was veteran skilled
Voted heartless 'cause my momma made me part of the guild
Deals made, sellin' thrills paid the bills at the crib
Drag him down by the river, he'll be missin' for years
And them funerals was usual, ain't sheddin' no tears
Knew the fallen had it better off than most of us did
'Cause shit, Heaven knows, Heaven's gates prolly closed
And these hoes in a race for the gold
We was raised on that fork in the road
No food on our plate, just the meals that we stole

[Interlude: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, yeah
Yeah, um

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I spit that prayer hand emoji, that shit that injured Kobe
The holiest of holy, Nick Nolte in some Oakley's
That's a flex though, cover up the issues that I kept close
Sober, I can't deal, I'm in the corner with my head low
Runnin' from my shadow, never ending chase
Ease the pain and the battle that's within me
Sniff the same shit that got Whitney, the high heel depression
My temple feel the metal comin' out the Smith & Wesson, bang
Say a prayer, leave my brains on a tile floor
My bitch hate me, always tell me I should smile more
Off them drugs that hit you in your spinal cord
This the shit I need to keep the climate warm
Wish I could get high, space migration
Pretend I could just fly to great vibrations
The magazines need a quote
When I'm gone, sorry, I don't leave a note, yo

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Woah-oh-oh
Yeah
And this pain, and this pain
And this pain, and this pain
Mixed up with this rain, this rain
This rain, this rain, woah-woah-woah-oh-oh
Yeah
Oh-woah-oh, yeah
Yeah, 9th Wonder

Bum-ba-da-bum-bum (Yeah)

Okay

[Verse 1]
There's a birthday party happenin' upstairs (Where?)
And it's all for me, who the fuck cares? (Fuck it)
They won't notice if I never go and show my face (Face)
They just lookin' for a reason they can celebrate (That's okay)
I hate to waste the vanilla cake that they made for me (Tasty)
I tell the same stories, they pretend they never heard 'em (Boring)
I'll just stay down here inside the studio (Uh-huh)
Doin' blow and paraphrasin' The Crucible (Witch)
If you fuckin' with the God, that's a funeral (Kill 'em)
Lose your soul, I'm witcha longer than your student loans (Woah)
Who got the ecstasy pills? I need a few to roll (Raw)
I'm a real drug addict, homie, you should know
Somebody please tell Jimmy to put the pistol down (Stop, man! Please, please, please, please!)
He's serious this time, he's gonna kill me now (Bapapapapam! Ah!)
He'll regret it when I hit the ground (What did I do?)
For now, everybody gather round

[Chorus]
It's happy birthday (Woo)
It's a birthday party (Yeah)
Yeah, happy birthday (Sing me a motherfuckin' song)
It's your birthday party (Sing me a motherfuckin' song)
Yeah, happy birthday (Yeah)
It's your birthday party (Come on)
Happy birthday (Come on, come on)
Yeah, happy birthday (Come on, come on)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, okay
Happy birthday (Thanks)
How the fuck you feel? (Good)
Do you ever sit and wonder what is real? (Huh?)
Do you ever reach to touch her but there's nothin' there? (There)
Do you tell her that you love her but she doesn't care? (Care)
Does she tell you that you hurt her and you're unaware? (No)
Did you hear about a heaven, now you runnin' there? (Go)
Do you think about the fantasy and make-believe? (Okay)
Do you cover up your eyes, you can't wait to see? (Look)
Lately, I've been havin' strange dreams (Uh-huh)
Paranoid they hate me, everybody think I'm crazy
Baby, can you take me somewhere where the sky blue? (Uh-huh)
You can lead the way, I promise I'll be right behind you (Let's go, let's go, let's go)
I do see myself as iconic (Yah)
Gettin' high my downfall, it's kinda ironic
Like a condom, they on it (Woah)
Got 'em in my pocket (Woah)
No time to worry, hurry up and light the candles
Everybody

[Chorus]
Happy birthday (Woo)
It's a birthday party (Sing me a motherfuckin' song)
Yeah, happy birthday (Sing me a motherfuckin' song)
It's your birthday party (Everybody sing along)
Yeah, happy birthday (Sing me a motherfuckin' song)
It's your birthday party (Everybody sing along, come on)
Happy birthday (Come on)
Yeah, happy birthday, uh (Come on, come on, come on, come on)

[Outro]
Woo!
Happy birthday
To you
Happy birthday
To you
Happy birthday
To you
To you
Woo-hoo

[Intro: LaWanda Page & Mac Miller]
Ah! Ah! Fuck me good, baby
You better than any man before
Ah! Ah! Fuck me good, baby
You better than any man before
Yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
My bitch can tell that I'm addicted to pussy, she lookin' past it
The smile that she fakin' is tragic, hate lookin' at it
That magic I try to grasp it, she's had it with the dramatics
Fantasize of love, so classic
Attracted to what she got up in her attic, can we mind fuck?
Do I lie when I look inside her eyes? Hush, don't say a word
I know I make you hurt, sorry is my favorite word
I don't deserve your trust, but can we make it work?
I hate to end the story, can we wait until the morning to decide on it?
Spend this time pretendin' it was that first summer
We was pure lovers
She was used to bein' hurt, I took that curse from her
Sometimes I wonder what it's all for, you wish that I would call more
You're sick of seein' condoms in my sock drawer
Love turns to war so quickly, I envisioned us married and fifty
Couple of kids that we drop off at little league
I'm addicted to you, you only want the best, I need to listen to you
I'm fuckin' other girls, wishin' it's you (Yeah)
Fuck the bullshit, we in love
I'm a mess, but can you clean me up?

[Chorus 1]
Girl, I'm the worst, yeah
I know that I'm the worst, yeah
But you're somethin' I can't lose, let me just tell you the truth
That'd be a first, yeah
Girl, I'm the worst, yeah
I know that I'm the worst
Don't know what I gotta do, just love you so much
That it hurts

[Verse 2]
Yeah, um
And I see you fallin' victim to the thirst
All the sins you committed, you could prolly use a couple minutes in church
But, for what it's worth, I think you're perfect
There's an angel hidin' underneath your surface
Yeah, the woman of my dreams, I'm lookin' at her sleep
The pussy right in front of me, I shouldn't be so weak
What did I do to deserve a love like this?
You see her shinin'? That's my sunlight, bitch
I'm sick of fightin', that smile is so invitin'
I see you every time I'm writin'
I'm losin' to all my vices, they kickin' my ass
I hold on to this feelin', I wish it would last
Don't wanna lose you for some evil I did in the past
You knew I fucked that bitch and you didn't react?
Girl, it's me and you, how simple is that?
You gave me all your love, now I'm givin' it back
But I know that

[Chorus 2]
Girl, you the worst, yeah
You know that you the worst
But I'm somethin' you can't lose, if you just told me the truth
That'd be a first, but
Girl, you the worst, yeah
You know that you the worst
Every time you say you sorry, everything you do just feel
Like it's rehearsed

[Segue]

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, um
Who put the spiders in my applesauce?
Took the pins out my hand grenade?
Somebody said that I deserve to die
I looked him in the eye, said, "The devil's not circumcised"
Who put spiders in my applesauce?
Took the pins out my hand grenade?
Somebody tell me I deserve to die
I looked him in the eye and said, "The devil not circumcised"

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
So play me a song on the guitar (Guitar)
Got a rainforest in my cigar (Cigar)
There's knots in my yo-yo string
Put a crown on my stallion, I'm the Polo king
I fell in love with a go-go dancer, she a single mom
The underdog, like to play the game with Diddy Kong
She the god type, throw that bitch a Klondike
Everything is alright, see it's written in the Psalms
I told her I get rich off my little songs
Gave her a million reasons that she should come along
Immediately, she dropped her shit
But everywhere I go, they told me, "Watch yo' bitch"
(Goddamn) I guess I got another one
Good vibrations, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch
I put the gourmet flavors inside the honey blunt
Got my head underwater but I ain't comin' up
Fuck air, my bitch ass is like a plump pear
And she ain't pretty or ugly, I say she just fair
Man, this life is unfair

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Okay, I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nuttin' to lose
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?
I said, I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nuttin' to do
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?
Stuntin' in a Uber

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Yeah, bitch
I'm stuntin' in a Uber
Yeah, bitch
I'm stuntin' in a Uber

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I'm readin' old Playboy magazines
Somethin' from the '50s when the journalism had its peak
You play the background, you just a member of the faculty
I'm actually out here decision makin'
Had to get my shit together, I was missin' payments
I just pray to God that my lady isn't famous
She threw the gown on and we hit the banquet
She got her own story; just let the bitch explain it

[Verse 3: Mike Jones]
Mac, I think the girl that you speakin' 'bout
Was, in fact, the same chick, late-night, creepin' out
Sneakin' out, my homie knew her, told me keep an eye
Found out she was twerkin', found out she wasn't workin'
The whole game switched when my man hit
Got me rollin' in a circle, top-down, blowin' purple
Seen the parkin' lot, I'm 'bout to crawl up like a turtle (I said)
Seen the parkin' lot, I'm 'bout to crawl up like a turtle
Swang, switchin' lane to lane, still tippin'
Trunk up, top down, call it parkin' lot pimpin' (Mike Jones)
Switchin' lane to lane, still tippin'
Trunk up, top down, call it parkin' lot pimpin' (Mac)

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Okay, I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nuttin' to lose
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?
I said, I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nuttin' to do
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?
Stuntin' in a Uber

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Yeah, bitch
I'm stuntin' in a Uber
Yeah, bitch
I'm stuntin' in a Uber

[Segue]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, can you turn up my headphones?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This music go with my funeral, yeah, yeah
Music go with my funeral, a-hem, yeah, I said

[Verse 1]
Said I was raised inside this gritty city, ridin' through, you probably miss me
My bicycle fell, I hit the road, the mailman almost hit me
All these sins were more than shitty, I just pray the Lord forgive me
Doin' drugs is just a war with boredom but they sure to get me
My side-bitch is sort of pretty, but she got enormous titties
Know I'm worth a fortune, she just want a brand new Porsche or Bentley
Had a few abortions, unfortunately, I forced them
Lord knows I'll turn a child to an orphan when I'm tourin'
I'm more than what I think of myself, I really have to be
Sit at home and drink by myself, my thoughts harassin' me
Actually, as a matter of fact, she ain't gettin' back to me
A shame that my tragedy my masterpiece, yeah
Trapped inside these dreams of mine
Just tryna get some peace of mind, yeah
I've been trapped inside these dreams of mine
So you'll never get a piece of mind

[Chorus]
This the last (Last) day (Day)
Of my life (Of my life, of my life, of my life)
Party like it's the last (Last) day (Day)
Of your life (Of your life, of your life, of your life)
This the motherfuckin' last (Last) day (Day)
Of my life (Of my life, of my life, of my life)
Party like it's the last (Last) day (Day)
Of your life (Of your life), yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
See, we swallowed in this web of lies, never try to exercise
You used to be a fantasy but now I guess it's televised
I heard the legends never die, oh, this lonely hell of mine
There never was a better time to better myself
Forever I melt and float away like waves in the ocean
Starin' inside of Heaven's eyes, the gates will never open
I'm smokin' on this field of hope, waitin' 'til my deal gets closed
I keep gettin' hotter but all I seem to feel is cold
Twenty-two don't feel so old, but I think I'm eighty-two
You mean to tell me God took seven days and all he made was you?
I'm out here with the kangaroos, makin' danger, break the rules
Celebrate my date of birth with acid, get the days confused
Happiness I take from you, searchin' for the naked truth
I'm not awake, I'm in a lake, I'll swim away with you
Bitch, check out the butterfly
If you the truth, then what the fuck am I?
Yeah

[Chorus]
This the last (Last) day (Day)
Of my life (Of my life, of my life, of my life)
Party like it's the last (Last) day (Day)
Of your life (Of your life, of your life, of your life)
This the motherfuckin' last (Last) day (Day)
Of my life (Of my life, of my life, of my life)
Party like it's the last (Last) day (Day)
Of your life (Of your life), yeah

[Outro]
Said, where are you goin'?
Where are you headed?
Where are you goin'?
Can I come? Can I come?

[Verse 1]
Yeah
And I can't feel my legs, I'm a paraplegic
Lord, I want a fair one with my demons
Karen Meyers became married to Jesus
Born dead, they had to dig up my fetus
And now the devil want to tear me to pieces
I'm a diagnosed insomniac
An astronaut who blastin' off into the star galactic
On top of Saturn, fox-trottin' with velociraptors
The dino-aliens invaded Earth, so they could feed on hypochondriacs
Prepared for the rapture, closet hillbilly
Threw the spinners on the tractor, I listen to Uncle Kracker, but
That's white America for you, we all that matters
I'm walkin' backwards, shadowboxin' with karate masters
It's more to rap, we sell the royal crack at Castle Rock
A bad apple like an unemployed Macintosh
We lost Jobs, now they brainwashed with dot com
It's only so long until we surrender the free world to Hong Kong

[Chorus]
And sinners stay still, but the merry go round
And round
It all just keeps spinnin'
Gotta keep swimmin' (Keep swimmin'), yeah (Keep swimmin')
Eat, drink and let the merry go round
Eat, drink and let the merry go round
Eat, drink and let the merry go round
Eat, drink and let the merry go round (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I got a double-sided silver dollar
Larry Fish here from midget league, beginner slaughter
I'm not drownin', I'm wadin' in the water
Killin' off these monsters ever since I was a Sabra
I got horses on my PJ's
Shout to Spitta, jet life, I fit the Porsches on the PJ's
On stage, sendin' dark forces to my DJ
The birdies on tour like PGA, Davis Love III
Pittsburgh warrior, bullets in my cornea
In exelsis Deo, ayo, this is Gloria
(Ave) Av—(Maria)—Ave Maria
I'm gettin' bread, yeast rise on Easter, money is God (God)
Black bitches with jungle fever, I love to be on
You on the B-Team, I fuck with Solange
All my life they said I doesn't belong
So I'm chillin', growin' drugs on my lawn

[Chorus]
Sinners stay still, but the merry go round
And round
It all just keeps spinnin'
Gotta keep swimmin' (Keep swimmin'), yeah (Keep swimmin')
Eat, drink and let the merry go round (Go round)
Eat, drink and let the merry go round (Go round)
Eat, drink and let the merry go round (Go round)
Eat, drink and let the merry go round (Go r—)

[Outro]
Yeah
What? What? What?
Have you found a way out?
Have you found a way out? Yeah
A vacation in Slovakia, celebratin' Mardi Gras
Eatin' baklava and lobster claw at the Ramada
With a Mafia of immigrants
Finna take 'em on a pilgrimage
Have you found a way out?

[Segue 1: Timothy Leary & Interviewer]
"Have I answered the question, 'Who am I'?"
"Mm-hmm"
"Well, I confront it all the time. We're teaching people how to use their head. The, uh... point is, that in order to use your h-head, you have to go out of your mind. You have to go out of all of the, uh, static symbolic ways in which you think."

[Verse 1]
If it was colors and shapes, the imaginary
'Stead of all of this weight that we have to carry
Would you be able to breathe?
And if you could just find where that comfort resides
No distraction or movement that fucks wit' your mind
Would you let them see?
While beneath the ocean, I met with the captain
Who sank to the floor on his ship
All of his passengers escaped to safety
But he was not done with his trip
He looked up and smiled, asked me, "How do you do?''
I told him, "I'm losin' my grip"
He told me, ''Son, if you want to hold onto yourself
Then let yourself slip''

[Chorus]
Fall, ooh-ooh-ooh
Fall, oh
Fall
Oh, it feels good to fall
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
These puzzles are so hard to make into pictures
Of something that they'll understand
They could open their eyes, still be blind to the beauty
But march on the heart of this land, oh-oh
Why don't you turn around and go home?
They invade your minds and then fill them with nonsense
These things that a man doesn't need
Take out the love and the passion and hope
And they fill it with nothing but greed
While floating through galaxies, they said I couldn't
I noticed how sad one can get
'Cause the ignorant mind is so peaceful, I find
I can't understand nothin' no more

[Chorus]
If I jump, let me fall (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh
If I jump, let me fall, oh
Fall
Oh, it feels good to fall
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Segue 2]

[Intro: Bill Murray]
They've got the best equipment that money can buy. Hell, every team they're sending over here has their own personal masseuse. Not masseur, masseuse. But, it doesn't matter! Do you know that every mohawk competitor has electrocardiogram, blood and urine tests, every forty-eight hours to see if there's any change in his physical condition? Do you know that they use the most sophisticated training methods from the Soviet Union, East and West Germany and the newest Olympic power, Trinidad & Tobago? But it doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! I tell you it just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! Even if we win... if we win, ha! Even if we win! Even if we play so far over our heads that our noses bleed for a week to ten days, even if God in Heaven above comes down and points his hand at our side of the field, even if every man, woman, and child held hands together and prayed for us to win, it just wouldn't matter!

[Verse]
Yeah
Yeah
Um, um
Jumpin' out the Camino
Just left the gas station, smell like Hot Cheetos
Recordin' soft-core on her Tivo
Ma, the meatloaf!
Re-smoke, got a vegan bitch in the Peace Corp
All she ever do is ask me what I eat meat for—
Hold up, pause. Always over the quota
Boss, wake up in polo, sleep in Lacoste
Travel across the world, but that didn't phase me
Couple people that I know that happen to play me
Once they start to realize that I'm actually crazy
Shit, I'm actually crazy... um, and
Q's phone gettin' blown up by Lyor Cohen
Christian Dior, nothin' I'm ownin'
Go to Hawaii, fuck with Samoans
Get faded and sleep in the oceans
Keep it in motion
I'm rollin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm rollin'
Keep it in motion
I'm rollin', yeah
And your bitch wearin' elbow pads
Sell her pussy over Melrose Ave
I've been to hell and back tryna get attached to my better half
Never that, the smile's so gone, so bring the coke on
I'm higher than Voltron, with a bunch of gold on
Caucasians still love me like my name was Michael Bolton
Hold on, do you fuckin' dirty like the soap gone
Froze on, it's bone chillin', colder than the Pope's secrets
Older than Capone's demons, comin' from a place where there was no Jesus
Walkin' bo-hemoth, I increase the feces
'Cause shit real, fly into your windshield and get killed
Buggin' out, had it all, I'm nothin' now
I just gave it away
Fuck a label, Cain and Abel, put a name to a face
Um, yeah
I bust your speakers with some bullshit rap
I'm on drugs, all my new shit wack
Remember that
I ain't shit but a fraud
But everyone I know ain't nothin' to a god
But everyone I know ain't nothin' to God

[Outro]

[Produced by Larry Fisherman]

[Verse 1]
Yeah, welcome to the dark side of my bizarre mind
I'm trapped inside of this amusement park ride
There's an atom bomb inside my hard drive
I'm holdin' the apocalypse (Apocalypse)
Let's take a ride and get lost in this metropolis (Metropolis)
Just realized that I'm an idiot
Wearin' my disguise, my real face is fuckin' hideous
My pretty bitch watchin' Insidious with her pussy out (Pussy out)
Aw, sookie-sookie now (Sookie-sookie now)
Rapper terrorist, rarer than good parents is
Puttin' hard drugs inside of all your baby's carriages
Arrogance, throwin' cherry bombs where the sheriff lives (Sheriff lives)
Just because that shit's hilarious (Shit's hilarious)
And I inherited the thirst for self-destruction and I'm scared of it
I wanna be buried with a novel and a chariot (And a chariot)
I'm a bigger illusion than good marriages (Marriages)
Or what it means to be American
Woah

[Chorus]
I took acid in San Francisco
Stripped butt-naked, caused a panic at the disco
Fell for the bimbo who was dancin' at the strip show
I gotta stop thinkin' with my dick-hole (Ya)
I took acid in San Francisco
Stripped butt-naked, caused a panic at the disco
Fell for the bimbo who was dancin' at the strip show
A genius still thinkin' with his dick bone

[Verse 2]
Out in Wichita, Kansas, smokin' meth with all the locals (All the locals)
Askin' them to teach me how to yodel
Suppose I'll die alone from an overdose of some sort
In a motel while some whore I’m fuckin’ runnin' to the drug store
I hacked into the motherboard, argued on a public forum
Uploaded a virus to the network, then unplugged the cord (Unplugged the cord)
The laws are not important
If you scared, lock your door then (Door then)
Okay, uh, I always feel like a foreigner
Morphin' into some sort of sorcerer (Sorcerer)
I'm Yuri's brother if it's Lord of War
What would I be normal for?
I'm goin' door-to-door shootin' pornos with a good script (Good script)

[Chorus]
I took acid in San Francisco
Stripped butt-naked, caused a panic at the disco
Fell for the bimbo who was dancin' at the strip show
I gotta stop thinkin' with my dick-hole (Ya)
I took acid in San Francisco
Stripped butt-naked, caused a panic at the disco
Fell for the bimbo who was dancin' at the strip show
A genius still thinkin' with his dick bone
Oh, shame
Is it difficult?
If you got something to say
Say it to my face
Don’t be a little bitch and put up a front
Did you really think you could fuck with the evilest rap girl in the whole planet
And get away with it?
Oh, shame
No it doesn’t work like that
What a little delusional asshole
You’re so fucking stupid
I see right through you
I can see you scared
And a scared man is not a pretty sight
Oh, shame
Run little scaredy cat
Run

[Verse 1]
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do
I'm half crazy all for the loving of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
And I cannot afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet on the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
We will go tandem as man and wife
Peddling the way down the road of life
When the roads dark we can all despise
There are bright lights in the dazzling eyes

[Outro]
Daisy, Daisy Bell
(Daisy, Daisy, Daisy Bell)

[Verse]
Oh, smokestack lightning, shining just like gold
Why can't you hear me crying? Ooh
Oh, stop your train, let a hobo ride
Why can't you hear me crying? Ooh
Oh, fare you well, I never see you no more
Why can't you hear me crying? Ooooo
Oh, stop your train, let a poor boy ride, calling yes I do
Let a poor boy ride, let his foot step on
Oh, who've been you baby, since I've been gone

[Verse 1]
When I think of Johnny
I remember the spring
I remember his laughter
And the way he would sing

[Chorus]
Oh, how I loved Johnny
With my heart I loved Johnny
Oh, how I loved Johnny
But he never knew

[Verse 2]
I prayed that he’d travel
Through the winter’s wild storm
And he’d kiss me and hold me
So close and so warm

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
He left with leaves falling
Falling dead to the ground
And no more will I ever
Hear his sweet laugh, laughing sound

[Outro]
Oh, how I loved Johnny 

[x3]
But he never, ever knew
He never knew
Never knew
Never

Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up

[Verse 1]
Hi, I want to come and make peace with you
But they won't let me
No, they won't let me through
I don't mind if they a-arrest me
'Cause I'm wearing my Versace
Why can't we just put on a smile and a buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz?
We all might be sick
Whether it's at first or after a few drinks
We're gonna unite, don't think

[Pre-Chorus]
Prepare, I descend from the East
I'm from Jakarta-a-a
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the West
My name is Lady Gaga
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the East
I'm from Jakarta-a-a
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the West
My name is Lady Gaga
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya

[Chorus]
Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby smoke it up 'til we're high
(Now Jump)

[Drop]
In a way, exhausting
We're problem solving
Drink 'til she's attractive
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
Talking 'bout diplomatic
I brought my plastic
Making that peace attractive
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS

[Verse 1]
Late night, hangin' on the corner (Gangsta, Gangsta, Gangsta)
East Long Beach, California
Daytonas when I run up on ya
Real dog, bitch, tryna catch a boner
I get what I get, I'm a goner
And smoke more dope than a stoner
I sip what I sip when I sip
Don't flip when I trip on a bitch, 'cause I'm on one
Haul ass for the cash...
Snoop Dogg came back for your ass
Grass and trees, ass up, bitch, on your knees
Do what I please
I break the bitch slow
Take her, make her get more
Even if she never sold her pussy hole before
It's a slow process
Rub my fingers up your dress
Hold these nuts, it's a test
Hide this package in your breasts
Don't say no, always say yes
You are my, my best
Oh yeah, what it do?
That's why I wrote this song for you

[Hook]
All my bitches, all my hoes
Fly ones, tight ones, and even the white ones
All my bitches, all my hoes
Gang intervention, in your position
All my bitches, all my hoes
Don't say shit, bitch, keep it on the low
All my bitches, all my hoes
For the Dogg, protocol, you know

[Verse 2]
I won't get caught, I refuse
A nigga just chose, so I choose you
Really not tryna confuse you, or abuse you, or misuse you
It's back to the bed frame
Real P.I., all in your head game
I said it slow - woo-op, boo-op, now let it go
I got the bitch that makes the most cash
I got the bitch that's got the most ass
She's a lawyer with a visa
So I blaze my trees up
And she'll help my keep my Gs up
And that's what it do
That's why I wrote this song for you

[Interlude: Suga Free]

[Hook]

[Intro]
Yeah I wanna give a dedication to this record right here, To my favorite girl, I mean you mean so much to me. You're special...I mean when I'm feelin' low, you get me high. I love you, I love you Boo, it's real

[Verse 1]
Despite I gotta wife, you the girl of my life
I gotta hit u in the mornin', afternoon and night
I like when you stimulate, all of my feelin's
I like when you light up the scene, when I'm chillin'
If a nigga hold you too long, I'll kill 'em
To you my deepest thoughts I reveala
If you runnin', I loosen the tips then i reseal em
I love you, you love me, ain't no puzzle
And my boo know too, so you know I got you covered
Everytime I hit you girl, it feels like know other
I had to take a deep breathe and reminisce
Heaven must be like this

[Chorus]
You the, only, one that I could ever kill fo, I gotta get more
You the, only, one that I could ever live fo, It's you I adore
You the, only, one that I could ever kill fo, I gotta get more
You the, only, one that I could ever live fo, It's you I adore

[Verse 2]
I sit alone in my four corner room playin' dreamcast
Hittin' you up inside of steamed glass
It's not your face or your soft act
It's the way you make me feel, and thats way real
Alotta fools talk about you but they don't even know
They ain't hittin' you, they hittin' your kinfolk pretend-o
She smoke suckas out, they pull their duckets out
But she don't have what you worth, dig what I'm talkin bout?
I met you at my uncle Rick James house, he told me you turned me out
And ever since that first hit I can't take you out my mouth
And when I do a press conference, you right with me
When I'm on stage, you right with me
I'll be there for you, cause you be there for me
I care for you, I really hope you care for me

[Chorus]
You the, only, one that I could ever kill fo, I gotta get more
You the, only, one that I could ever live fo, It's you I adore
You the, only, one that I could ever kill fo, I gotta get more
You the, only, one that I could ever live fo, It's you I adore

You the, only, one that I could ever kill fo, I gotta get more
You the, only, one that I could ever live fo, It's you I adore
You the, only, one that I could ever kill fo, I gotta get more
You the, only, one that I could ever live fo, It's you I adore

[Verse 3]
I carefully flip back the sheets and put you in the middle
Like bread to me, and grab the heat, and put it right to your lips
And blaze you up, now a nigga really feelin' ya shit
Sit in my seat, and try to put a rhyme to this beat

Sunshine that's your new thang, cause you do thangs, yea yea

You the, only, one that I could ever kill fo, I gotta get more

They show me love in every hood and every city I go

Gotta pull the shades back and tell her "Hello"

Trying to see what’s up now (uhh)
Thicker than a snicker, shawty bring it my way

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
Word on the street, I’mma kill this

Finger in her booty hole
Watch how that thing go up and down
I ain't even know if it was real, but it clapped the K.O.D way
Just got out, I stay on hard, girl, I could do this all day
Earthquake, earthquake, earthquake, earthquake
Now shake it like you thirsty
So I remixed and her homegirl
And wished ‘em happy birthday
Money real long and the weed lit (smell that?)
All I really want is a freak chick
So jump in this drop top, make it pop lock
Cause it's G shit on the remix, Boosie

[Hook: T-Pain]
I ain’t even know they made a remix to it (remix to it)
Baby, let me see you do it (do it)
Stacks so big can’t see nothing through it (through it)

Thicker than a snicker, shawty bring it my way
Word on the streets, I’mma kill this (kill this)

Trying to see what’s up now (uhh)
Thicker than a snicker, shawty bring it my way

[Verse 4: T-Pain]
Still doing what I do best
Shots fired when I spit hot fire
Got a pussy nigga running wearing two vests (two vests)
I’m not lying, you can go on, stop trying
And they hate it when I love it, love it when I fall
Tell your girl to come and she gon’ love the way I ball
Put a hundred on it, later she’ll be giving me a call
Cause she done told my lady she don’t fuck with you at all, nah
I throw a stack in the air
I don’t give a fuck, nigga, I’mma make it right back
I get it crackin’ in here
Give me fifty feet, nigga, you don't know me like that
I’m way too faded (I’m way too faded)
And I’m way too raw (And I’m way too raw)
So baby you gonna take it up down - or nah?

[Hook: T-Pain]
I ain’t even know they made a remix to it (remix to it)
Baby, let me see you do it (do it)
Stacks so big can’t see nothing through it (through it)
Money gonna flow like fluid
Booty going up, down
Girl, this ain’t nothing, I can do this all day
Trying to see what’s up now
Thicker than a snicker, shawty bring it my way
Word on the streets, I’mma kill this (kill this)

If I could turn the page
In time, then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
Close my, close my, close my eyes
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

[Chorus: Christine McVie, Stevie Nicks, Lindsay Buckingham]
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

[Verse 2: Christine McVie]
Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand
There's a reason why
Close your, close your, close your eyes
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart
Let's give it a try
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

[Chorus: Christine McVie, Stevie Nicks, Lindsay Buckingham]
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

Oh, no, no, you can't disguise

This motherfucking D’usse got me sweating and shit...
Word to God
Hov, fuck with ya boy
C5

[Verse 1]
Okay nigga, I got 'em, point 'em out and I got 'em
Let 'em get a lil buzz, then we robbing for pollen
We ain't killing no minors, you niggas still in the minors
And your bitch, we gonna blind her, can't pick us out of the lineup
I swear lord knows I'ma murk one of these niggas
Shoot you in your earth, and get earthworms on me, nigga
I been did my time, I'm getting better with time
But real niggas don't whine, we'll burn down your vineyard
I been balling since cornrows, still ducking the narcos
My little niggas in war mode, you spark it up, we charcoal
Got a bad bitch with long hair that have bad days when the mall closed
I'm a big dog, big doghouse, make ashtrays out of dog bowls, yeah
Blessings on top of sins, resting with topless twins
Picture me broke but forgot to take the top off the lens
In the restaurant, I’m with Slim, wrestling with lobster limbs
Talking  about some M's, it's sounding like gospel hymns
Yes, lord

[Interlude]
We on that D'usse, me and my nigga Euro
Tina turn up in this bitch
We got Lauren in this bitch
Serena Pink in this bitch, better known as Pinky
Steph in this bitch
Yah dig?

[Verse 2]
Hollygrove nigga, rest in peace, Lil Kevin
Rest in peace, Lil Beezy, rest in peace, Big Sausage
The world is mine, I am selfish
I am a shark, fuck them shellfish
Everybody in the building, well I left that bitch like Elvis
Nigga, please
Pops treated mom like Billie Jean
Like hot sauce, I put it on everything
I'ma give that fucking woman everything, everything
Here we go, bitch I'm cool, Coolio
She say "Tune, do me slow"
How many fish did Hootie blow?
I don't know, fuck who knows?
I got a redbone with two golds
And she snort too much of that Michael Jackson
That bitch gonna need a new nose
I ain't got time for you hoes
Shit I only have two goals
And that is "Get Money, Get Money"
Now I'm riding 'round the city with the top off the Maybach
Looking for a motherfucking spot we can skate at
Elvis left the building and I take these hoes to Graceland
And I got more bounce, to the 28 grams
I ain't stunting these niggas
Eyes look Chinese, Wayne-chung to these niggas
Wayne-chung bitch!
More than one bitch
This for my niggas, we shall overcome, bitch
From New Orleans, niggas dying over dumb shit
You know we give the pastor hell, make the nun strip
Yeah I might have them bricks, call me Brick Cannon
Nina on my lap, what you want from Santa?
I might get money, fuck bitches
Kill niggas and smoke weed
I'm married to this real shit
And I'm a wife beater, no sleeves
Do it for my hood
That 44 ain't no good
You better bring that chopper
Cause we gonna have them choppers
Yeah I do it for my hood
That 45 ain't no good
You better bring the chopper
Cause we gonna have them choppers, nigga
We gonna have them choppers
We gonna have them choppers
You better bring the chopper
Cause we gonna have them choppers, yeah

You better bring the chopper
Cause we gonna have them choppers, nigga
Mula!

[Outro]
My nigga Hood in this bitch
Still on that D'usse
Shout out my nigga Lil Twist, my lil brother
He just passed out in the club the other night off that D'usse
Threw up on the owner
Owner talkin' about he wanted his money back
He wanted half of the money back
Twist took all the money and left
That's some Young Money shit
Soo Woo to the B gang
Rest in peace Cedar Frogg
As a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5th, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family

[Verse]
Out on the lonely hillside in a cabin low and small
Lived the sweetest rose of color my Rosie McFall
Her eyes were bright and shining and her voice was sweet to me
Knew that I would always love her and I hoped that she loved me

My eyes turned to me, my darlin' and this is what she said:
You know that i would always love you when you and I are wed
Then God way up in heaven one day for her did call
I lost my bride, oh how  loved her, my Rosie McFall

I searched this wide world over through cities great and small
But I never found another like my rosie mcfall

[Rapping: Meek Mill, Verse 1]
Uh, go hard for that paper so I can get what I want
Stood in the back, I couldn't fit in the front
Now I pull in the back, my whip sit in the front
With no roof on that bitch, I let it flip in the trunk
Like it's gymnastics, I know magic
Caught with the bastards, early gymnastics
I never had a master but I done mastered
The art of getting money in a timely fashion

[Talking: Omelly]
You know we still...remain real nigga, you know, niggas be playin'
You gotta see 'em, you gotta see me man
When you see me you keep the same energy that you had
You know what I'm saying?
I got blood all over me, you know, when, when you niggas pop shit
Just know that y'll gotta see us, We not gunna tweet you niggas or nothin'
You have to see us. You see what I'm saying?
I mean that's a nigga jaw right there today. You gotta see us
And it could have got worse but, you know, these niggas be pussies
You don't even got to take it there. It's just how I be feelin' , I don't know
Shoot, just keep the same energy
Whenever you say something about any Dreamchaser, nigga, just keep the same energy when you see us and man
Anybody, we ain't got no picks over here. Dreams worth more than money

[Rapping: Meek Mill, Verse 2]
Uh, gimme some levels, turn it up
Uh, they sayin' that I talk too much money
But maybe cause I saw too much money
I can't chase around no broads with no regard to touch money
So if it ain't about no paper, get them all the fuck from me
Young dummies, uh, realest, richest nigga in my town
Yeah, if you ain't come with your pistol then get from 'round here
Cause I'm the ref. with the whistle, you out of bounds here
And this time on my Sky-dweller say “The crowns near"
Cause it's crowns there, you hear broke niggas talkin' that never sound fair
Be tryna broker and bargain something that's not there
I'm barely sleeping, having million dollar nightmares
I'm right c'here, finna kill 'em, kill 'em all, they shi-shi-shivering
I think they mad I put on my hood, fuckin' Zimmermans
Racist when they tie me down with cases
Cause my hand got dealed all aces, and I make their yearly savings
On the days end, that I stayed in, First year I came in, Pop stars got came in

[Talking: Meek] (laughing)
Hold up, hold up, I don't know I said first year I came in, they got came in

[Rapping: Meek, Verse 3]
Basic bitches can't sit with us
And none of these niggas ain't really rich as us
We swore that that money’ll never get to us
We swore that these bitches'll never get to us
But now I'm feeling like I'm made for this shit
And loyalty go to the grave for this shit
And where the feeling you can't pay for this shit
All my niggas pay for this shit
Cause we already rich and you know I'm the shit
Got fifty niggas with me, they got Rollies on they wrist
Uh, I want everything my niggas want except for the hoes they fuckin'
Roll that window down and nigga we get to bustin'
Who that right there? Turn around they fuss if 

[?] truckin'
It don't matter, you know how we rockin', we thuggin'
Uh, living this life, getting it right
That shit y'll niggas talk about we did it twice
G-5 eggs in back this the life
Look at my man's wrist there, you see it's bright
Uh, rollie on wrist, ice on neck
21st and Berks, this the whole set
My nigga Dean, he was catchin' wreck
Bending corners on niggas, 50 in the Tec
We got 30 in the Macs, 80 in the Myags..

[Talking: Meek Mills]
(laughing) I can’t...I need like a basic beat

[Rapping: Meek, Verse 4]

[?] thinking how I got here
Locin’ low and tosin’ pussy you was not there
Holdin’ never foldin’, we was on the top tier
Shackled to our ankles, it was like a nightmare
You ever wash out your drawers the same water you shit
Doing your push-ups right on the floor where you piss
Cellies with niggas that went to war with the strip
You gotta rumble with ‘em nighttime down to the mornin’ and shit
I’m trying to tell them...(laughing) they can’t get no more of that right there
(laughing) they can’t get no more of that
I seen a nigga get murdered for a half a bird
Headshot, cat licked his brains off the curb
Before I had this paper always had an urge
To ball in ‘em sixes on them like, Julius served
I moved to the ‘burbs, but I’m still in the hood
And I ain’t gotta rock a vest ‘cause really I’m good
And I should shout out my connects, like really I should
Like Death Row and 9’5, Meek Milly I Suge
But I’m cocky as Pac, ice hockey the watch
Green Mercedes, brown butter be broccoli the drop
‘Cause them winters was cold, the beef from broccoli was hot
We was sellin’ them O’s, still getting watch from the cops
Federal papers, indictments, nothing was righteous
Praying that Papi don’t grow up to be just like us
Praying them people don’t judge us and try to life us
I did it for all my niggas, we ballin’ no they don’t like us
And they wanna kill us, if they could one of the realest
But they can’t find us on a wood watching the Clippers like a Kingpin
(Huh? Yeah) But for this rapping swear to God I just wanted to be a Kingpin

[Talking: Takbar]
At the bottom of the joint put some “Motivational uses only” man
No hatin’ man we wanna see the whole Philly win
Ya'm sayin? Like we wanna see when we out of town
A bunch of niggas from Philly holdin’ it down too man
What part of Philly you from man? Put on it for the whole city man, everybody
Turn up, Put down the guns and pick up some money
(I’mma keep mines and keep the money, yeah you know what I mean)
(I ain’t mad at nothin’ tho)

[Rapping: Meek Mill, verse 5]
Man, you ready?
I think the D.A wanna murder me
As they swore me in I spelled my name nervously
Feeled like I committed perjury
‘Cause this time they talkin’ ‘bout in here, it ain’t me
And next time I bring my son to court so he can see
How they wanna murder his Daddy, I murder the Caddy
When I’m on the roads to the riches no words for the Navi’
Should I make a left or right,? ‘Cause nothing was never right
We’s infatuated with bustin’ guns and sellin’ white
I remember Snupe’s momma called me from the scene
No life in his body, blood on his jeans
Couldn’t believe it, one of the youngest in my regime
Got murdered and I’m feelin’ like it’s ‘cause of me
Was it the fame that I brought to him? Huh?
Or the name that I brought to him?
Man a nigga put a fling, put a torch to ‘em
And I put that on my son, I tried to talk to ‘em
And tell ‘em stay away from murder
R.I.P to my Lil nigga Snupe
Yeah that’s how we rockin’, we rockin’ our Lil Snupe for life nigga
You know how we doin’ it
I said, I said they even killed my homies, they murdered Lil’ Snupe
He was only 18, only one that was a coupe
If you get a job they laugh at you, kill something they salute
That’s the only shit they see, that’s the only shit they do murder
Black clouds, black people, black roses
Young mothers teaching daughters how to bust it open
Babies having babies and them babies having babies man
This shit is lookin’ crazy even birthday was a maybe
Mommy playing daddy role, ‘cause he behind a fence
And she told them he in school ‘cause them kids they in suspense
Man these clouds look grey from this view behind the tent
Good girls that selling pussy, she was due behind the rent
And these kids need shelter, don’t nobody help her
And who am I to judge her, tears of a single mother
And the only thing that scare her, ain’t nobody hear her
So them tears turn black when the touch the mascara
Why I treat my last meal like I treat my last prayer
Very thankful, ‘cause I done had shackles on my ankles
Shackles on my wrist too, I swear that shit was painful
The reflection of your eyes through that picture
I could paint you, like Basquiat, feel a soul from the fascia
Some recite the songs, the religious say the fire hot
And I don’t want to go to hell, but it’s hell on Earth
If I can't pay God with this money, then tell me what it’s worth

[Talking: Meek] Let me get down to these bitches..UHN!

[Rapping: Meek, Verse 6]
I say, I say, Said she want a boss just to sweep her off her feet
Hit her with the D and I can’t keep her off the meat
Keep her off of me and we don’t get to hardly speakin’
We be creepin’ all in weekends, I’m talkin’ freakin’ all in weeks
But I know you still think about when i fucked you
And when I came through with your best friend, crushed you
All white 

[?] no tint, know I touched you
Tried to give my man some, he ain’t wanna bust you
‘Cause loyalty is royalty, hoes ain’t loyal
You are what you are and I had love for you
Heard you with a baller, hopin’ he enjoy you
Hopin’ he like buying  Louis Vuitton just to spoil you
‘Cause you was like a bill with a drill to my pocket
All these hundred dollar bills in my pocket
I could build my own bad bitch ‘cause i got it
Let you meet my new girl she looks like a Goddess
She could give you gottens and she gon’ give you problems
When she don’t even try to, blame it on your momma, bitch
Or blame it on jail, ‘cause you thought you was poppin'
With your little followers (ha)
She thought she was poppin’ with her little bit of followers, ha
I said my girl fuck a nigga with some money
What I do? Tell her break ‘em, And if a nigga fuck my bitch for free
What I do? Let ‘em take her (You can have that bitch)
‘Cause I got so much money, What I do? I could build ‘em, I could make ‘em
Tummy tucks and ass shots, what we doin’? Flying bitches to Jamaica
Dreamchaser, nigga!
Talk to ‘em!

[Talking: Omelly]
Real niggas back in style man, Guns and butter man, D.C

[Rapping: Omelly]
Uh, Uh, It’s Osama, Twin Llama, from the D.C. camp
Heard you like to run your mouth, you the people’s champ?
All that shit gon’ get your t-shirt damp
A tag on your toe, pussy nigga that’s the D.C. stamp
Carry two’s, with my jewels, you niggas thinkin’ jackpot
Well walk up on me, you gon’ hear that Mac pop (blap!)
(With the ladder in the stashbox) (oh)
(Black Talon that’ll knock down a Sasquatch)

[Rapping: Meek, Verse 7]
Let me talk to these bitches, I said
I said, you was who you was when you got here
And you are who you are, who you not here
Breaking news, shit I think we got a thot here
State to state yeah the ho out here
Talkin’  ‘bout Greystone she be like "I’m there"
Live on Sunday, Tiny and T.I. there (laughing)
I said, I said, Velvet on Sunday (unintelligible)
I said, what I said? I said ATL Saturday tweeting at T.I there

Seen a flyer on Instagram that LeBron there
He ain’t even show up, she ain’t make her mind there
Stevie J on the mic, Meek Milly P my here
That ain’t in the building got Omelly, Coon and Tak here
Now you in my VIP, bitch how you got here?
I took a G-5 here, you had a buddy pass that’s not fair
How the fuck you beat me here? I seen you in Atlanta
I went to Live, you got there ‘fore me and we came in a motherfuckin’ G-5 bitch
(She had a buddy pass, how she get here?)

[Verse 1]
So far away from where it’s happening
You think you found a place of peace
Just to find that it’s happening everywhere
It’s happening here there and everywhere
(Haaaahaha)

[Verse 2]
Please don’t touch that with the vision
And ya need to learn to respect every man religion
No one said or says that’s fair all the day
Live and live a life I love to today
(Ohhmyeboo, ehh)

[Verse 3]
Lift my spliff and take a draw
Someone say I’m breaking the law
They make everything to try to arrest ya
But they’re with the sandman can molest ya

[Chorus]
Some some villa fits them well all the day
Live the best life we love well all the day
Oh take me, please mercy
I don’t know whats happening
(Uhhhhhuhhhhhhhuhhhhhhuhhhh)

[Outro]
In the valley of our aunts, hear them sing whooo

I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody
For my owwnnn
I'm so lonely

[Bridge]
Yo, this one here
Goes out to all my players out there, man
Ya know, that got that one good girl, dog
That's always been there, man
Like, took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more and decides to leave

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin, for her I was feenin
So I had to take a little ride
Back tracking on these few years
Trynna figure out what I do to make it go bad
Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin' and I'm so

[Hook]
Lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl
I'm so lonely

[Verse 2]
Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right out of my life
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side
What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right cause
Without you in my life girl I'm so

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Been all about the world ain't never met a girl
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasing you
Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one on the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Never thought that I'd be alone (be alone)
I didn't think you'd be gone this long (gone so long)
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playing girl and come on home (come on home)
Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out (work it out, baby)
I never wished I'd ever hurt my baby
And it's drivin me crazy cause I'm so

[Hook]

[Outro]
So lonely, (lonely)
So lonely, (so lonely)
Mr. Lonely, (lonely)
So lonely, (so lonely)
So lonely, (lonely)
So lonely, (so lonely)
So lonely
Mr. Lonely

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Yeahhhhhhh, it's Gucci!
Birds, go!
Birds, it's Dirty, Birds
It's Gucci

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm an East Atlanta rider
You gon' fuck around and get ya whole clique tied up
My brain fried; I'm on the skull of the Impala
I'm high on kush, it's 'bout my money mixed with power
So keep it brief
Nigga, two hundred thousand in the fleece
Pistols, two hundred twenty on the dash
System, I pull off it look like a flash
Picture, cheeeeeese!
I got the 24's, those 74 for 2's
When you was on the stage, Gucci was on the news
But bitch don't pity me, I look like Mr. T
I pimp like Soulja Slim, but I think I'm Eazy-E
It's Gucci

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Patty cake, patty cake, I hop around with pancakes
I touched down with hash browns and serve 'em with the pancakes
Patty cake, patty cake, I hop around with pancakes
Got flapjacks, hash browns and syrup in my crack space
Patty cake, patty cake, I hop around with pancakes
I touched down with hash browns and serve 'em with the pancakes
Patty cake, patty cake, I serve you niggas pancakes
Flapjacks, hash browns and syrup in my crack space
It's Gucci

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm the young nigga all the old head love dawg (FLOCKA!)

Banned in 45 states cause I'm too real
Waka Flocka like a Gucci album, I'm hard to kill
I don't think they fuckin with me whether I'm locked dead or in jail
I'm from Clayon County, Riverdale so I'm supposed to give 'em hell
I'm aware the grass got snakes, I'm aware they gon' hate
You too late, I'll be damned you take this dinner off our plate
Dirty Birds, Dirty Birds, twenty-one gun salute and got killed

Mob up off that run day, SK's, AK's
Throwaways I let that triple up like {?} triple beam we crackin

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 3: 8Ball]
Gucci Mane, Waka Flocka and ya boy big Ball
Hard from the start; I ain't never been no fuckin lame
Here I go with Waka Flocka, here I go with Gucci Mane
One of a kind - that Memphis 10 runnin through my bloodstream
Ghetto superstar - man them hood bitches love me
Cup full of that ol' purple drank, pullin on some of that stanky dank
Pocket full of Benny Frank and bitch, what the fuck you thank?
45 hollowheads in my stout, yellow purt{?}
I hope one of these ol' bitch bitch-ass niggas don't cross that line and get hurt
Money what we came to get, money what we represent
You ain't talkin 'bout shit if you ain't talkin 'bout gettin it
Hard hustle never fold, forever I will be cold
Forever I will be big Ball, mouth full of gold

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I killed off all the competion
Didn't get no recognition
Im steady shippin', flippin', whippin'
Cookin' caine in the kitchen
I got a couple pistol charges
But gone keep me a ratchet
I smoke two ounces everyday
I got a real bad habbit
I got to keep a teller with me
Just to count all the cabbage
Dope houses in Sunvally
Grow houses in Cali
And they say life is a bitch
But your bitch just met me
Went to sleep rich
But I woke up wealthy
I can't hang with broke niggas
Naw, thats my pet peeve
I make her go to work late
I make her get off early
I never snooze, keep a tool
Thats just how I move
On Instagram with your bitch
Damn, ain't life cruel

[Hook]
Yall niggas pull up to the club

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]

Get money, keepin' it pushin'
Thats what I strive for
Hercules purp so strong
I paid the high for it
Fugazy stories you tellin'
Man why you lie for
If he ain't runnin' out with the work
They why you high for
Playin' games with Gucci Mane
Dun' got you tied up
Five dollars of kerosene
And now you fried up
You Took that dick with no vasaline
Why the hell you sign that
I know that you regret that decision
But can't rewind that
You gave the money, didn't get the work
You took a blind plee
East Atlanta Zone 6 Morland
That's where you find me

[Hook]
Yall niggas pull up to the club
But I land on it
She got a ass so big

Or blame it on the dro

On and on
You're told which side you're on
You're forced you're thrown
To become the scythe to cut the corn
And all your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they go
All your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they're thrown
Into the fire

Ten below
Call comes in on the radio
Over you go
And red now, all the rivers flow
The poppies grow

All your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they're blown
All your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Ride into the sunset
And they're taken home
Open fire
Open fire
Open fire
Open fire
Open fire
Just ride and fire

[Verse 1]
He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be a preacher, when your soul is damned
He could be a lawyer on a witness stand
But he'll never love you like I can, can
He could be a stranger you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy of a one night stand
He could have your humour, but I don't understand
'Cause he'll never love you like I can, can, can

[Chorus]
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can

[Verse 3]
A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again
He’ll never love you like I can, can, can

[Chorus]
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can, can

[Bridge]
We both have demons that we can't stand
I love your demons, like devils can
If you're self-seeking, an honest man
Then stop deceiving, Lord please

[Chorus]
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

[Produced by Zane Lowe]

[Verse 1]
It was a Monday night when you told me it was over babe
And by the Friday night, I knew that I would be okay
Don't say it was a good thing
Don't say it was the right thing to do
Don't say it was the best thing for the both of us
When I'm the one playing the fool

[Chorus]
What do you want from me when I just want a restart?
You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
And the truth is I'm better on my own
And I don't want to live in the past
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart

[Verse 2]
You've been lighting up my phone
Worried that I'll be alone tonight
Want to make sure that I'm fine
But baby you're not on my mind no more
I know it was the best thing for the both of us
Cause you're the one who looks like the fool

[Chorus]
What do you want from me when I just want a restart?
You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
And the truth is I'm better on my own
And I don't want to live in the past
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart
What do you want from me when I just want a restart?
You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
And the truth is I'm better on my own
And I don't want to live in the past
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart
Hmmmm

[Intro: Mac Miller & B.DuBB]
Yeah, listen to The Ill Spoken, yeah
Yo, yo, let me get this real quick
Alright, Mac (So come around)
Yeah, uh (Let's go), look

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I focus, on bein' the dopest, to hold a mic (What?)
I'm cleverly ending enemies lives with words that I recite (Haha)
There'll never be anyone better than me
Contenders tendin' to be settin' the scene
The rookie but still the best on the team
See these cats like sex in a dream (Woo)
Y'all spit the good but ain't nothin' is real
I'ma cut off all your fingers, spit you somethin' to feel
'Cause you ain't touchin' the real
I'm spittin' ideal, it's surreal
Yeah, welcome to the City of Steel (City of Steel)
Where you can find me kickin' back
Pirate hat, twisted back
Pen and pad, on my lap
I'm sippin' on a Pabst
I'm a menace to society, Dennis would admire me
Burnin' through more rubbers than a tire be
See, I speak figuratives
Spittin' with metaphors and irony
Variety of ivory to ease my anxiety
The young masta pass the rules (Yeah), they don't apply to me
The game got me messed up and taken what's inside of me (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: B.DuBB]
And I'ma take it from there, never playin' it fair
Got the throne up in my way until I'm makin' it there
And as far as I'm concerned
Shit is vacant, so I'm breakin' the chair
On the grind is how I'm makin' it, chyeah
Thinkin' about how much cake that I can make in a year
Few grams I'm movin' grams, not a day I can spare
Hear the jam as I play in my ear
Pssh, it's hot like fevers
Hustle hard, sellin' pot to feeders
Dippin' all across the block, cops holla if you seen us
Me and EZ Mac come back like we was Jesus
We stayed skeed and my trees is the greenest
I keep a buck sixty in my jeans, I'm a genius
So heed this when we puttin' it down
We speak ill, reekin' hell, leave you shook from the sound
I stand tall with my foot in the ground
So if you doubt me, come and see what I'm about (Yeah)
Come into my town

[Chorus: B.DuBB]
So come around, come around
Come around, come around
Into the underground
Come around, come around
We so sick, we got that hunger sound
Come around, come around
Come around
So bet it's goin' down
Come around (Yeah)
'Cause we breakin' all sets and we takin' the crown (Yeah, look, look)

[Verse 3: B.DuBB]
I spit with authenticity
You can't get within the width of me
Surround me by the definition victory
You think you lava, then my line-up that some shit to see
Speedy flow, it's sick, I need to get some antihistamines
The mista mean, the mista please
I know you pissed at me
I'm beatin' up competers and dismissin' you a mystery
Leavin' haters history
I'm hurtin' you cowards
Heard him out, word of mouth is I'm a person of power
The TV said I couldn't curse, I spit a verse and devour
We Ill Spoken, spill minds, rhymes, it's still potent
Battle us in real time, try, you'll feel broken
They quotin' what we fire, my lines is still smokin'
For real folks, you better reckon the flow
'Cause, yo, I'm comin' through your section and I'm checkin' the pros
You better know, the mecca we the best in the show (Yeah)
'Cause the record explode the second I'm lettin' it go

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
Check it, respect the method
Man, I wreck it
I said it
With an eccentric sentence
The apprentice, will not stop spittin' 'til I'm breathless
You ain't feelin' me, feel free to use the exits
To other MC's that know me to preach
Gonna spend my history to eat every lyric you willingly speak
You still gettin' beat in each and every battle you havin' with me
The champion, you bringin' to feat
The fat lady singing the C
Ain't nothin' change, I'm a do what the game never does
With clever stuff, I'm the rapper that there never was and never will be
The kid with that ill speech, not quittin' less you kill me
Nah, I'll probably still be
Spittin' from the grave, my flow mindless
And no need of a brain
Simple and plain
The kid will remain best in the game
Hittin' your chest with flames
Remember the name
Or we came, I'm at your second game

[Chorus: B.DuBB]
So come around, come around
Come around, come around
Into the underground
Come around, come around
We so sick, we got that hunger sound
Come around, come around
Come around
So bet it's goin' down
Come around
'Cause we breakin' all sets and we takin' the crown

[Verse]
Kick a hypest lyric every time I run up on a track
You know I'm not wack, you have to step back
'Cause if you don't, I'll prove that I'm the mac
Every time I kick a lyric tune it to two-ninety-five
Yo', do you find me live?
If you don't then that's all right, 'cause I'll just grab the microphone
And I just got to get so hype when I speak in a hyper tone
There's so many styles I might get thrown, and here's a place where I like to roam
And all the girls that I like to bone
Have the big butts, no they don't, 'cause I don't like that nigga shit
I'm just here to make a bigger hit
When I be kickin' the hypest dopest rhymes
Just say that Eminem is the best MC in of all times
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Frankie, didn't I tell you
You've got the world
In the palm of your hand
Frankie, didn't I tell you they're running
At your command

[Pre-Chorus]
You know the tricks
As if they're your invention
It wasn't your intention
Frankie to fall in the trap you made

[Chorus]
Oh oh, it's a crying shame, mmm
You left a trail of destruction
Heartbreaker, you know now
They really did care 'cause it's your first affair

[Verse 2]
Frankie, didn't I tell you that the lion
Would come in for the kill
Frankie, didn't I say he had power
Over your sweet skill

[Pre-Chorus]
So where is the laughter?
You spat right in their faces
Didn't I tell you Frankie
That you might run out of races

[Chorus]
Oh oh, it's a crying shame, mmm
You couldn't win the game
Heartbreaker this time (This time)
It's your first affair

[Bridge]
Frankie, Frankie's first affair
(It's your turn to cry, heartbreaker)
Frankie, Frankie's first affair
It's your turn to cry

[Chorus]
It's a crying shame
Heartbreaker
You know now they really did care
'Cause it's your first affair

[Outro]
Frankie, Frankie's first affair
Frankie, Frankie's first affair
Wha da an dee da do, wha da an dee da do
(It's your turn to cry, it's your turn to cry) wha da an dee da do
Wha da an dee da do, heartbreaker
(It's your turn to cry, it's your turn to cry)
Don't you realize they really, really, really did care
The party's over
Now you discover
It's your turn to cry
And don't you realize
Ooh ooh, it's the toughest thing, yes it is, yes it is
The party's over, it's your turn to cry
Wha da an dee da do, wha da an dee da do
Mmm mmm
Wha da an dee da do, wha da an dee da do
It's your first affair

[Verse 1]
Those fingers in my hair
That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft
And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do
Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

[Chorus]
When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what your leading me to
It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you
When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what your leading me to
It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you

[Outro]
There's no nicer witch than you

[Verse 1]
Maybe I’m just a ghost
Disappear when anybody’s close
Go through you when you try to hold
Try to hold me near

[Verse 2]
Maybe I’m just a ghost
Emptier than anybody knows
Maybe I’m on the ropes
Or I’m not even here
Yeah

[Chorus 1]
Every time I try to walk through walls
More walls appear
What's the point in feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point in trying to raise your voice
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

[Verse 3]
Maybe I'm a ghost
Just a whisper in a puff of smoke
A secret that nobody knows
No one will ever hear

[Verse 4]
Oh, maybe I'm a ghost
Specter of the wrong curse
A thorn without a rose
Something people fear
Yeah

[Chorus 2]
And every time I thought I walked through walls
It’s all becoming clear
What's the point in feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point in saying "Rescue me!"
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

[Chorus 3]
And every time I thought I walked through walls
It’s all becoming clear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear...

[Verse 1]
I know what you're thinking
But I'm not your property
No matter what you say
No matter what you say

[Chorus]
Move along, there's nothing left to see
Just a body, nothing left to see

[Verse 2]
A couple more for breakfast
A little more for tea
Just to take the edge off
Just to take the edge off

[Chorus]
Move along, there's nothing left to see
Just a body, blood pouring down the street
Move along, there's nothing left to see
Just a body, nothing left to see

[Outro]
Move along

[Verse 1]
Get yourself together, let the light pour in
Pour yourself a hot bath, pour yourself a drink
Nothing's gonna happen without warning

[Chorus 1]
Down is the new up
What is up, buttercup?
Down is the new up, is the new up

[Bridge]
Won't you be my girl? Won't you be my girl?

[Verse 2]
Your services are not required
Your future's bleak, you're so last week
Ladies and gentlemen, without a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
I shall now amputate, I shall now contort

[Chorus 2]
Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flop?
Down is the new up, down is the new up
Down is the new up, is the new up

[Bridge]
You crawled off and left us, you crawled off and left us
You crawled off and left us
You bastard
You bastard

[Outro]
You're on candid camera
The chink in your armour
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town
Shake your pockets out
Pass it on, pass it down
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town

[Chorus 1]
Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon

[Chorus 2]
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

[Chorus 1]
Somewhere there's music
It's where you are
Somewhere there's heaven
How near, how far

[Chorus 3]
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 3]

[Verse 1]
Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine

[Chorus]
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, my darling and so is love

[Verse 2]
Your words don't mean what they used to me
They were once inspired, now they're just routine

[Chorus]
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, my darling and so is love

[Bridge]
I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci with tears in my eyes
You look the same
You're a lot the same
But my heart says "No, no, you're not the same"

[Outro]
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
So is love, the masquerade is over
So is love

[Verse 1]
My Funny Valentine
Sweet comic valentine -
You make me smile, with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Un-photagraphable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

[Chorus]
Is your figure, less than greek
Is your mouth, a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

[Verse 2]
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me -
Stay little Valentine, stay
Each Day is Valentine's Day

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't baby don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me -
Stay little Valentine, stay
Each Day is Valentine's Day

[Chorus]
Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There is nothing in life but you

[Verse]
I never regret the years that I'm giving
They're easy to give when you're in love
I'm happy to do whatever I do for you
For you maybe I'm a fool
But it's fun
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
Darling, its grand
They just don't understand

[Chorus]

[Verse]
How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?
How far would I travel to be where you are
How far is the journey from here to a star?

[Outro]
And if I left you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean? how high is the sky?

[Verse 1]
When the only sound on the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belong to a lonesome cop
I open shop
When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town
That her smile becomes a smirk
I go to work

[Chorus 1]
Love for sale
Appetizing, young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled
Love that's only slighty soiled
Love for sale

[Verse 2]
Who will buy?
Who will like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price
For a trip to paradise?
Love for sale

[Chorus 2]
Let the poets pipe of love
In their childish way
I know every type of love
Better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
I've been through the mill of love
Old love. New love
Every love, but true love

[Chorus 3]
Love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
If you want to buy my wares
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Outro]
Love for sale

[Verse]
Always and forever
Each moment with you
Is just like a dream to me
That somehow came true
And I know tomorrow
Will still be the same
Because we got a life of love that
Won't ever change
Everyday love me
Your won special way
Melt all my heart
With a smile
Take time to tell me
You really care
And we'll share tomorrow
Together always forever love you
I'll always love you forever

[Outro]
Ever ever ever
Baby

[Intro]
Let your conscience be your guide
Let your conscience be your guide, oh baby

[Verse 1]
If you want to leave me, go on girl
Go on and leave, oh leave me
But oh darling, oh darling, oh yeah
Let your conscience be your guide

[Chorus]
You know I've never done you wrong
I've always stuck right by your side, oh baby
You only had to call my name and oh baby
If you could feel, oh, feel the same
Oh darling, my darling, oh yeah
Let your conscience be your guide

[Verse 2]
If only you could remember just hard I tried
Please, oh please, don't forget
I've given you the best years of my life

[Chorus]
You know I've never, never, no, no, no, never done you wrong
I've always stuck right by your side, oh baby
You only had to call my name
Oh, oooh girl, if could feel the same
Oh darling, my darling, oh yeah
Let your conscience be your guide

[Verse]
You don't know what love is
Until you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had to lose
You don't know what love is
You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost
You don't know what love is

[Chorus 1]
Do you know how lost I've been
At the thought of reminiscing
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

[Chorus 2]
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that cannot live, yet never dies
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that cannot live, yet never dies
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
You don't know, you don't know 

[3x]
What love Is

[Chorus]
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I try to put my arms around you
All because I want to hold you tight
(To hold you tight)
But every time I reach for you, baby
And try to kiss you, you're just jumping out of sight
(Out of sight)
Oh, I've got news for you
Baby, that I've made plans for two
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you

[Verse 2]
With other girls I've wanted
I've made it just a moment
With you I'll share each day
(I'll stay by your side)
Now I know you've heard about me
Bad things about me, baby, please let me explain
(Don't you listen to that jive)
Oh, I have kissed a few
I tell you, a few have kissed me too
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you

[Outro]
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
You are my pride and joy
And I just love you, little darling
Like a baby boy loves his toy

[Verse]
I could have left and said I told you so
(Told you so)
I could have told the whole wide world and leave you sad and blue
(Sad and blue)
Said I could have left and said it's good for you, yeah now
But I know when it hurt you
Don't you know it hurt me too
(Hurt me too)
I could have said that you had it coming to you
(Coming to you)
When you walked out and turned your back on me
(Back on me)
I played it, baby, all along, please, please baby, don't go
'Cause I knew he would hurt you
Don't you know it hurt me too
(Hurt me too)
He said he had you dancing on a string
As far as love goes, you were just another fling
Oh, I may be a fool to love you the way I do
(Way I do)
Don't you realize even fools have feeling too
So baby, come on back
And let me dry the tears from your eyes

[Bridge]
'Cause I would never hurt you
(I will never hurt you)
No, no I'd never hurt you
(I will never hurt you)
'Cause baby when he hurt you
Don't you know it hurt me too
(Hurt me too)

[Outro]
It hurts me so bad
(Hurt me too)
I'd never desert you
(Hurt me too)

[Verse 1]
I wrapped you inside of my coat
When they came to firebomb the house
I didn't feel pain, 'cause no one can touch me
Now that I'm held in your spell

[Chorus]
Beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust

[Verse 2]
Sell me a car that goes
Sell me a house that stands
I never cared before
I never cared before
I never cared before
Before, before, before

[Chorus]
Beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust
Beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust

[Outro]
I stood in front of her face
When the first bullet was shot

[Chorus: Paloma Ford]
I don't know what these niggas speakin' off
I don't know what these niggas trippin' on
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
Don't say my name unless you suicidal
Don't get to close unless you suicidal
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Money won't ease us
Man niggas even hated on Jesus
Living life on the road on the chase for the money
Cause the hoes won't please us
Yeezus told us there's blood on the leaves
Ain't no love in the streets
Let her run into me and she wanted to meet
Now she fuck with a G
Got your bitch not wanting to speak
Hold up, y'all mahfuckers tried to shit on us
Chain all lit all up
Porsche with the horse like get on up
And my bitch got that shit on her
Rock Balmain cause I'm ballin'
I put red bottoms on red models
And no more red bottles
Straight Belarie nigga every bottles
Ricky Rozay we in here
Double M G we've been here
Straight from the north side
Right by the project how did I get here
Sippin' on lean with a bad ass bitch
From the Hills, probably live there
And get money like me
And the pussy so wet I need swimwear
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

[Chorus: Paloma Ford]
I don't know what these niggas speakin' off
I don't know what these niggas trippin' on
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
Don't say my name unless you suicidal
Don't get to close unless you suicidal
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Suicide doors, riding around with a suicide whore
There's no love in the streets and this blood on my sneaks got suicide on them
Going everywhere you are not going
Doing everything you are not doing
And I've been out to get it and you mention my niggas that's suicide on them
Right back to the money my nigga no we don't play
Say my name and that's D.O.A
And all these chains is saying we okay
And we drink Champagne, eat Frito Lays
At lunchtime, do it for the ghetto one time
I don't even know how to tell time, look at our time
Cause the watch say bust down and the whole band is drumline
Me and my nigga, Rozay that's my nigga
D-Boy, that's my hitter
You ain't doing wrong, as long as you don't touch my hitter
South finger fuck my trigger, smoking on strong
None of y'all can fuck with us
None of y'all gossip, Jigga
Give me my throne, and you ain't gonna like my picture
Leave a comment, fuck nigga
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

[Chorus: Paloma Ford]
I don't know what these niggas speakin' off
I don't know what these niggas trippin' on
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
Don't say my name unless you suicidal
Don't get to close unless you suicidal
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal

[Bridge: Paloma Ford]
You must be suicidal
When we pull up, watch the suicide doors
I've been too deep, make 'em call the 5-0
If he surprised, I know that gun go
BLAT, BLAT, BLAT, BLAT
This kush got me so on
Man I'm so on
We ridin' 'round, we gettin' money
Don't act like you don't know
Don't touch my niggas
I suggest you don't
Boy if you do, you must be suicidal

[Chorus: Paloma Ford]
I don't know what these niggas speakin' off
I don't know what these niggas trippin' on
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
Don't say my name unless you suicidal
Don't get to close unless you suicidal
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal

[Verse 1]
I was made to love her
Been working at it
Half of my life
I’ve been an addict

[Pre-Chorus]
And she’s been good to me
Far as I can tell she’s happy
Livin’ with her Macky

[Chorus]
So please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay
Please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay

[Verse 2]
And where would I be
Feeling lonely
Separated from my one and only

[Pre-Chorus]
And what’s there left to say
Far as I can tell that day
Could be on its way

[Chorus]
So please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay
Please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay

[scat singing]

[Chorus 1]
Kiss!

[x5]
All night long

[Chorus 2]
Gee it's cosy in the park tonight
When you cuddle up & hold me tight
Stars above, they seem to know
We're putting on a late late show
Hear the pretty music in the trees
See the flowers dancing in the breeze
Old Man Moon begins to glow
He's joining in the late late show

[Chorus 3]
Birds should be dreaming
Stars chirping a song
And wild fireflies gleaming

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 4]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 4]

[Outro]
It started at the late late show, Marvin
It started at the late late show
Then you kissed me & you held me so tight, Marvin
It's mellow, baby, ow! It started at the late late show

[Intro]
League of Starz, League of Starz, League of Starz...
Goddammit Dupri

[Verse 1]
Ahh, good evening, kidnap you for the weekend, something to please me
Pardon how I drive, swerving, drinking Hennessy frequently
Yea, dim your lighters, these niggas ain't half as decent
No respect, and they gonna need it, walk into a giant breathin', I'm hot
Been at the top, niggas just hide in my spot
Don't want me to pop but my shit steamin' like a smoke shop (Shop)
Love in hearts, I lost 'cause niggas done died, then girls fall off
Gossippin' 'bout me, that's just Molotov
Stuntin' on niggas like man, he fresh
A big timer, sick rhymer, headliner
Lock pick, I'm gone find ya
Never met a bitch, that resemble Madonna
But this blonde bitch beggin' to kick it but I don't need no drama
Got one baby mama, I'm tryin' to live honest
Only time can tell, what's timeless, Rolex in diamonds
When I die that casket better cost a 100 thou
Shut the fuck up, let me spend it, living for right now

[Hook]
'Til the day I die
I told my girl to ride, big girl don't cry
Floating at the top, can't get no higher
Thought mama told you not to play with fire
Play with fire
We don't die
Run into the jungle, tryna stay alive
Truth to yourself, never been no liar
Thought mama told you not to play with fire
Play with fire

[Verse 2]
Drop a Biggie, no Pun intended
Stop pretending you fucking women's lives up
Classy nigga, perfect attendance
5 Percenters running they own shit but they ain't sprinters
Got the Chevelle, yellow paint I call it Kobe finish (Yea)
Low pros swerve the curve, you fucking nerds
Nine milli, Chef Boyardee, boy don't get swerved
Don't remember half of yesterday, my whole life's a blur
Killers that'll ride for me and they don't say a fuckin' word
Words, splurging urgently, I got the fucking urge
Ultimately too adult for you, someone pass the hors d'oeuvres
Buying low tops, only time me and you prolly converse
Getting overlapped, or leaving your peers behind, what's worse?

[Bridge]
'Til the day I die
Prayin' over my shoulder, protect me my God
I know times is hard but can't get no harder
Need some motivation if I'm gonna get farther
Just keep going harder

[Hook]
'Til the day I die
I told my girl to ride, big girl don't cry
Floating at the top, can't get no higher
Thought mama told you not to play with fire
Play with fire
We don't die
Run into the jungle, tryna stay alive
Truth to yourself, never been no liar
Thought mama told you not to play with fire
Play with fire

[Interlude]
Aahh, mmm
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh oh na-na-na, na
Oh oh na-na-na, na

[Verse 3]
No privacy this time of week, trying to fulfill the prophecy
Ducking as the tires screech, somebody die right next to me
The block'll see, most of them not in my favor, they just favour me
Light up your house, that was Christmas Eve
Dump you out over water, call it overseas
With some foreign bitches that don't got ID's
Vacation, Jamaica, that was a good time for me
Life of luxury, teach my kids royalty
Yea

[Hook]
'Til the day I die
I told my girl to ride, big girl don't cry
Floating at the top, can't get no higher
Thought mama told you not to play with fire
Play with fire
We don't die
Run into the jungle, tryna stay alive
Truth to yourself, never been no liar
Thought mama told you not to play with fire
Play with fire

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Put your money down, I could buck a hard 4
You playin' with it, I'ma send 'em through your car door
My watch flooded, shit sick, got Parvo
I'm doin' it for black and yellow, free Hardo
The head honcho, nigga, no Tonto, nigga
I'm quick to put some bricks in a Bronco, nigga
Niggas talk shit, well, I don't respond to no nigga
No murder, no dough, no convo, nigga

[Chorus: T.I.]
If it ain't about the money
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga, I ain't gettin' up

[Verse 3: T.I.]
If you ever took a loss, better bring that back
Catch up witcha, betcha he gon' blow your brains 'bout that

[Verse 1]
In time she'll see that her and me
Were meant to be, together
And time will pass, it may go fast
But we'll still be together
And where I go she's at my side, half of my life, together
It's easy love, fits like a glove from up above, together

[Chorus]
Together
Together

[Verse 2]
I've had my share, it's just not fair
That we should be together
But if it's fine, that I've done my time
Let's walk the line together
And when she's low, I'll always know
We'll always go together
It's easy love, fits like a glove from up above, together

[Chorus]
Together
Together
Together
Together

[Outro Dialogue]
Mac: Kiki. Kiki? Hey. Time for bed. You're sleeping! Let's go. Ready?
Kiki: I have a bruise there
Mac: Yeah, you got a little indentation from the glasses that you fell asleep with on your face. I love you

[Verse]
After the lights go down low, baby you know
There'll be no reason for teasing me so
And when the dancing is through & folks will be through
I'll be sitting with no one but you
And I'll be needing you so
After the lights go down low

[Chorus]

[x2]
I want to hold you & squeeze you as tight as I can
I'd like to kiss you & please you & make you understand
And when you thrill me, you fill me with love so divine
Together we can have a real good time
After the lights go down low, baby you know
There'll be no reason for teasing me so
And when we cuddle up near without any fear
Because I got something sweet I want you to hear
And I'll be needing you so
After the lights go down low

[Verse]
I'll be around no matter how you treat me now
I'll be around from now on
Your, baby, your latest love can never last
And when it's past, I want to say I'll be around when he's gone

[Chorus]

[x2]
Goodbye, goodbye again
And if you find a love like mine
Just now and then drop a line
Let me know you're feeling fine
And when things go wrong
Perhaps you'll see you're meant for me
So, I'll be around when he's gone

[Verse 1: Jake]
I cannot tell what you claim to see
That your heart is black, and mine is so green
Jealousy is men, someday you'll see
Oh you know, you know, you know

[Verse 2: Jake]
You cry out, Eliza
You scream and you moan
You're sick of this joyride
You want to find home
Adulthood has found you scared and alone
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk

[Refrain: Jake]
Art school girl with ignorant bliss
Peace, weed, cocaine
And mushrooms
And shit
Will bring peace on earth, someday you'll see it
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
They're just pictures trapped inside of your head
They're just pictures trapped inside of your head
They're just pictures trapped inside of your head
They're just pictures trapped inside of your head

Save a little grace for...
Save a little, save a little
Save a little grace for...
Save a little, save a little
Save a little grace for...
Save a little, save a little
Save a little grace for...
Save a little, save a little
Save a little grace for...
Save a little, save a little
Save a little grace for...
Save a little, save a little
Save a little grace for...
Save a little, save a little
Save a little grace for...
Save a little, save a little

[Refrain: Jake]
Art school girl with ignorant bliss
Peace, weed, cocaine, and mushrooms, and shit
Will bring peace on earth, someday you'll see it
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk

[Verse]
Treat me sweet & gentle when you say good night
Squeeze me, please don't tease me
I get sentimental whenever you hold me tight
So squeeze me, but please don't tease me

[Chorus]

[x2]
Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues each day
Counting the nights waiting for you
I want you to know
I never knew I'd love you so
Please say you love me too
When I get this feeling, I'm in ecstasy
Squeeze me, please don't tease me
Squeeze me, don't tease me
Mmh squeeze me, baby don't you tease me

[Verse]
You've changed
That sparkle in your eyes has gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart, you've changed
You've changed
Your kisses are now so blase
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand you've changed

[Pre-Chorus]
You've forgotten the word I love you
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realise you ever cared

[Chorus]
You've changed
You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me that we're through
It's all over now, you've changed

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to be so fancy free
But really lonesome as could be
Till one lucky day you came my way, Marvin
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you

[Chorus 1]
I used to think there'd never be
A girl who'd ever care for me
But what do you know? You made it so
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you

[Chorus 2]
When you kissed me I felt the seasons change
From winter to spring
Ooh when you kissed me, I lost my reason
Because I heard the birds sing; I felt like a king
Now I have to rub my eyes
Each time I try to realize
That your love is mine, ain't it just fine?
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
I never knew, baby, no no
I never knew, Marvin, what love was, yeah
I'm crying out, baby, yeah yeah
We're going to take it slow, let it go right now, yeah

[Verse]
I wonder my darling
Where are you again tonight?
Are you holding someone else real tight?
Baby, I wonder
My heart, my heart is aching
I believe that I'm a fool to let it go on breaking
Maybe I wake up and find now that I'm mistaken
Oh, but right now I wonder

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been through lover's lane
And I'm living life just the same
I've been traveling nowhere faced
And what I want to know, what I want to know is will it last?

[Chorus]
Oh, oh I wonder, I wonder my darling
Will you think of me? Will you think of me again tonight?
Or are you holding someone else real tight?
Oh yeah he-he baby I wonder

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Although I, although I may be a million miles away
Baby, baby, I wonder

[Verse]
Because of you there's a song in my heart
Because of you my romance had its start
Because of you the sun will shine
The moon and stars will say you're mine
Forever, and never to part

[Chorus]

[x2]
I only live for your love and your kiss
It's paradise to be near you like this
Because of you, my life is now worthwhile
And I can smile because of you

[Verse]
I don't know why I love you like I do
I don't why, I just do
I don't know why you thrill me like you do
I don't know why, you just do

[Pre-Chorus]
You never seem to want my romancing
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing

[Chorus]
I don't know why I love you like I do
I don't know why, I just do

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse]
I've grown accustomed to her face
She almost makes my day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune that
She whistles night and noon
Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups, her downs

[Chorus]

[x2]
They're second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely, I could always be that way again
And yet
I've grown accustomed to her look
Accustomed to her voice
Accustomed to her face

[Verse]
When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

[Chorus]
What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone

[Verse 1]
I could write a million letters
Quote from every poem I've ever read
Sing each love song that I've ever heard to you
But there's one thing I'd do better
If I had a voice instead
And the part of me that holds my love for you
If my heart could sing
I'd sing a song that all the world could feel
One that each word a thought would bring

[Chorus]
If my heart could sing, sing

[Verse 2]
I'd sing of love to tell my story
Of how love brought me you
And like a bell, I'd toll and ring

[Chorus]
If my heart could sing, sing

[Verse 3]
There are things I'd like to tell you
Things I'd felt along the way
But my lips can't speak the magic words
That my heart alone can say
Oh, I'd prove to you I'll always love you
Girl, I will, until the end of time
I'll make each day eternal spring

[Chorus]
If my heart could sing, sing

[Bridge]
There are things that I'd like to tell you
Like how I'll never, ever forget you

[Chorus]
If my heart could sing, sing

[Intro]
Together, together

[Verse]
We'd stroll the lane together
Laugh at the rain, oh you know, together
Sang love's refrain together
And we'd both pretend it would never end
When we cried, you know we cried together
Cast love aside together
You're gone from me
But in my memory
We'll always be together
Together, together
And we'd both pretend it would never end
You stole the sunshine, oh you know
We're going to be together
And our hearts, our hearts that won together
Oh you've gone from me
But in my memory

[Bridge]
We'll always, always be
We'll always, always be
We'll always be, always be together

[Outro]
We're going to be together
Oh you know we, we just got to be together

[Intro]
Say we'll never part

[Verse 1]
I love you
For sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart

[Chorus]
I love you
And you're were long meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part

[Verse 2]
I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling, I'm never lonely
Whenever you're in sight

[Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[x2]
Do I want you? Do I want you?
Oh my, baby do I?
Yeah, yeah, yeah baby, you can bet your life I do

[Chorus 2]
I want to tell you one thing right here
I'm so glad that I'm the one who found you
That's why I'm always hanging, hanging, hanging around you

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Do I love you? Oh my, do I love you?
Baby, woo oh my
Hey baby, you can bet your life
Hey baby, yeah, you can bet your life I do
Baby, you can bet your life
You bet your life I do

[Chorus 1]
St. Louis woman, with your diamond rings
St. Louis man, you just don't mean a thing

[Verse]
You came a long way from St. Louis
You climbed the ladder of success
I've seen the town and country cars
That were parked out in front of your fancy address
You came a long way from St. Louis
You broke a lot of hearts between
I've seen a gang of gloomy girls
Who were doing alright until you came on the scene

[Chorus 2]
You blew in from the Middle West
And certainly impressed the population hereabouts
Now listen, I got news for you, I'm from Missouri too
So naturally I got my doubts
You got them dropping by the wayside
A feeling I ain't going to know
You came a long way from St. Louis
And you still got a long way to go

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus]
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

[Verse]
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting a grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children
Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole

[Pre-Chorus]
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Chorus 1]
The party's over
It's time to call it a day

[Verse]
They've burst your pretty balloon
And taken the moon away
It's time to wind up the masquerade
Just make your mind up the piper must be paid
The party's over
The candles flicker and dim
You danced and dreamed through the night
It seemed to be right just being with him

[Chorus 2]
Now you must wake up, all dreams must end
Take off your makeup, the party's over
It's all over, my friend

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
It's all over, my friend

[Verse 1]
I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I
Several stories high

[Chorus]
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

[Verse 2]
Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And oh! The towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear
People stop and star
They don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth
That I would rather be
Let the time go by
I won't care if I

[Outro]

[Verse]
What kind of fool am I, who never fell in love?
It seems that I'm the only one that I have been thinking of
What kind of man is this, an empty shell?
A lonely cell in which an empty heart must dwell!
What kind of lips are these, that lied with every kiss?
That whispered empty words of love that left me alone like this?

[Chorus]

[x2]
Why can't I fall in love like any other man?
And maybe then I'll know what kind of fool I am

[Verse]
This is my kind of town
Chicago is my kind of town
Chicago is my kind of people too
People who smile at you and
Each time I roam
Chicago is calling me home
Chicago is why I just grin like a clown
It's my kind of town
My kind of town
Chicago is my kind of town
Chicago is my kind of raz-ma-taz
And it has all that jazz and
Each time I leave
Chicago is tugging my sleeve
Chicago is a Wrigley Building
Chicago is the Union Stockyard

[Outro]
Chicago is one town that won't let you down
It's my kind of town

[Chorus]
This is the life
Here's where the living is
This is the life
Baby, you're there
This is the life
You've waited long enough
Boy, you've arrived
Breathe in that air
Modern perfume
Silver and candlelight
Children, make way
I'm here to stay
Nothing but plans
That's how it's going to be
This is the life for me

This is the life
Here's where the living is
This is the life
Baby, you're there
This is the life
You've waited long enough
Boy, you've arrived
Breathe in that air
Modern perfume
Silver and candlelight
Children, make way
I'm here to stay
Nothing but plans
That's how it's going to be
This is the life for me

[Chorus 1]
Hello Dolly!
This is Marvin, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong

[Verse 1]
You're looking swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowing, you're still crowing, you're still going strong

[Chorus 2]
I feel that room swaying
While the band's playing
One of your old favorite songs from way back when

[Verse 2]
So take her wrap, fellas
Find her an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
So golly gee, fellas
Have a little faith in me, fellas
Dolly'll never go away
Fellas, she'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away again

[Intro]
Sinner, hear what I'm saying
Sinner, you've been swinging, not praying

[Chorus]
One day of praying and six nights of fun
The odds against going to heaven, six-to-one

[Verse 1]
You walk on the wild side, the Devil is waiting
He's waiting to take your hand

[Pre-Chorus]
You walk on the wild side, you're walking with Satan
Away from the Promised Land

[Chorus]
One day of praying and six nights of fun
The odds against going to heaven, six-to-one

[Verse 2]
You better cross over
You better walk humble or you're going to stumble
And Satan is waiting to take your hand

[Pre-Chorus]
You walk on the wild side, you're walking with Satan
Away from the Promised Land

[Chorus]
One day of praying and six nights of fun
The odds against going to heaven, six-to-one

[Chorus 1]
Maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely

[Verse 1]
Just suppose I could love you from the very start, maybe
Heaven knows I could show you with an open heart, baby
You're the one that I've been waiting for
In this loneliness forever more

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I know you're the one for me

[Verse 2]
Can it be that you're needing me as I need you, honey?
(promise me)
Promise me if we part and I never knew, funny
Deep inside my heart I hope and pray
That someday you'll come to me and say

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Love is strong and I'm betting that it will come my way, gladly
If I'm wrong and mistaken, then I'll have to pay, sadly
No other love could ever be the same
If we fail, there's just yourself to blame

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
You are so wonderful
That being near you is all I'm living for
You show me more kindness in little ways
Than I've ever known in all my days
Tell me we'll stay together
Let me love you forever

[Chorus 1]
'Cause you're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

[From now on, backing vocals: "Wonderful one"]
In you there is a rare quality
Your love, baby, it means the world
For me you're always concerned
And you ask nothing, baby, in return

[Chorus 2]
You're really more than I deserve
From my heart I mean these words
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

[Chorus 3]
Oh you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one
Sweetheart, you're a wonderful one
My darling, you're a wonderful one
Ooo you're a wonderful one
Ooo you're a wonderful one
Mmm hmm you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one

[Chorus 2]
You're really more than I deserve
From my heart I mean these words
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down
But your love, you're always around
Words of confidence you speak to me
Baby, and you place a tender kiss on my cheek
It makes my burden a little bit lighter
It makes my life a little bit brighter

[Chorus 1]
'Cause you're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

[Chorus 3]
Oh you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one
Sweetheart, you're a wonderful one
My darling, you're a wonderful one
Ooo you're a wonderful one
Ooo you're a wonderful one
Mmm hmm you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Yes baby, ooh-ooh-ooh
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Ooh baby

[Verse 1]
I needed the shelter of someone's arms
And there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to stop (Stop) and thank you, baby
I just want to stop (Stop) and thank you, baby

[Chorus]
Hey now
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Yes, it is

[Verse 2]
Close my eyes at night
And wonder where would I be without you in my life
Everything was just a bore
All the things I did, seems I've done 'em before
But you brightened up all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to stop (Stop) and thank you, baby
I want to stop (Stop) and thank you, baby

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, yes, it is
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Yes, it is baby

[Bridge]
You were better to me than I've been to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop (Stop) and thank you, baby
I just want to stop (Stop) and thank you, baby

[Outro]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Tell the truth, baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Well, it's like sugar in my soul
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, yes it is, baby

[Verse 1]
Now you're moving on up, pretty baby
You're leaving me behind
Everybody seems to love you
Oh, you're doing just fine, fine, fine
But take away your good looks
And all your fancy clothes

[Chorus]
Why don't you just
(Try it baby) Try it baby
(Try it baby) Try it baby
(Try it baby) Try it baby
(Try it baby) Try it baby

You'll see
Nobody loves you but me (Nobody but me)
Nobody loves you but me (Nobody but me)

[Verse 2]
Now you tell me that you're so busy, pretty baby
You ain't got much time
Oh, how well I remember
When all your time was mine, mine, mine
Well move on back 'cross the track, baby
Where you came from

[Chorus]
Why don't you just
(Try it baby) Try it baby
(Try it baby) Try it baby
(Try it baby) Try it baby
(Try it baby) Try it baby

You'll see
Nobody loves you but me (Nobody but me)
Nobody loves you but me (Nobody but me)

[Verse 3]
I really want to hold you, pretty baby
In my arms again
But I can't get close to you
For all your loving friends, friends, friends
But take your name from the bright lights, baby (Take it from the lights)
And tell me that you are all through (Tell 'em you are through)

[Chorus]
Come on and
(Try it) Try it honey
(Try it) Oh, try it baby
(Try it) Try it sweetheart
(Try it) Try it baby
You'll see
That nobody loves you but me (Nobody but me)
I just want you to
(Try it) Try it baby
(Try it) Try it baby
(Try it) Try it sweetheart
(Try it) Try it, honey
You'll see
That nobody loves you but me (Nobody but me)

[Outro]
I want you to
(Try it) If you think I'm lying
(Try it) If you don't believe me
(Try it) Think I'm jivin'
(Try it) Mmhmm

[Chorus]
Baby don't you do it, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe
Don't you break my heart

[Verse 1]
Cause I sacrifice to make you happy
Get nothing for myself
Now you wanna leave me
For the love of someone else
My pride is all gone, whether right or wrong
I believe, baby, you'd better keep on keeping on

[Chorus]
Baby don't you do it, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe
Don't you break my heart

[Verse 2]
My biggest mistake was loving you too much
And letting you know
Cause now you've got me where you want me
And you're gonna let me go
My heart was made glad when you strolled, you see
Heartaches and misery you've been causing me

[Chorus]
Baby don't you do it, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe
Don't you break my heart

[Outro]
Go down to the river and there I'll be
I'm gonna jump in, baby, if you don't see by me
Open up your eyes; can't you see I love you?
Open up your heart; can't you see I need you?
I'm no good without you, can't go on without you
Life's no good without you, what'm I gonna do without you?
Baby don't do it, don't you break my heart
Don't you do it, baby, don't you break my heart
What'm I gonna do without you?
Got to go on, baby
Baby don't you do it

[Verse]
Me and my lonely room
Snapping my fingers, pacing the floor
I sulk in my lonely room as I lay my weary head
Down then in comes you're vision you're vision once
Again I cry in my pillow baby

[Outro]

[lyrics repeat and fade]
Pacing the floor no were to go as I stroll through the streets
Dragging my weary head down then in comes you're vision you're vision once
Again
Then he goes boo hoo

[Verse 1]
Darling, forever, forever
You can break my heart
Forever, if you want to
I'll play the part of a fool
Just to be with you forever

[Chorus]
Forever, darling, forever
You can taunt me
Take my love for granted
But I'll always be just a fool
Just to be with you forever

[Verse 2]
I'll be your slave
For the rest of my days
Love you more in so many ways
Just to be with you thrills me through and through

[Chorus]
Forever, darling, forever
You can taunt me
Take my love for granted
But I'll always be just a fool
Just to be with you forever

[Outro]
Forever, forever, I'll love you so

[Chorus]
Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry, but
I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
Can't stand it, but
I still love you

[Post-Chorus]
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love

[Verse 1]
Ayo
They could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doin' wasn't tasteful
Even though you out here lookin' so ungrateful
I'ma keep it movin', be classy and graceful
I told 'em it's no friends in the game, you ain't learn that yet
All the bridges you came over, don't burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earn that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible
That they love you when, really, they no different from all your rivals
But I still don't wish death on 'em, I just reflect on 'em

[Chorus]
Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry, but
I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
Can't stand it, but
I still love you

[Post-Chorus]
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love

[Verse 2]
Yo
People'll love you and support you when it's beneficial
I'ma forgive, I won't forget, but I'ma dead the issue
Soon as you outta niggas lives is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good, now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish wit' you
Bu-bu-but I sped off in the Benzy
I see the envy when I'm causin' a frenzy (Kyuh)
So I pop pills for 'em (Rrrah)
Cop cribs in the hills on 'em

[Chorus]
Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry, but
I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
Can't stand it, but
I still love you

[Post-Chorus]
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love

[Bridge]
I get high off
Your memory
I get high off
Your memory
I get high off
Your memory
In due time
We'll be fine
In due time

[Post-Chorus]
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love

[Verse 1]
It's so hard loving you
But I don't wanna let you go

[Chorus 1]
Little darling I need you (Little darling I need you)
Little darling I love you (Little darling I love you)
Little darling I want you (Little darling I want you)
Little darling I've got to have you (Little darling I've got to have you)

[Verse 2]
And if it means giving up my life
I'm going to give it up (give it up) give it up
There's always one who loves more than the other
But I don't mind, I don't mind

[Chorus 2]
I'm willing to pay the price
Have your love at any sacrifice

[Chorus 1]
Little darling I need you (Little darling I need you)
Little darling I love you (Little darling I love you)
Little darling I want you (Little darling I want you)
Little darling I've got to have you (Little darling I've got to have you)

[Verse 3]
I know there's two or three in your life
You like as well as me
So if I have to be your #1 fool
Before you care, care about me

[Chorus 2]
I'm willing to pay the price
Be your #1 fool, make that sacrifice

[Verse 4]
Ooo hoo, only my finger knows how many tears I've cried, baby
Only my heart knows the awful hurt I feel inside, baby
My life is so lonely, waiting for you to love me only

[Chorus 2]
I'm willing to pay the price
Be your #1 fool, at any sacrifice

[Chorus 1]
Little darling I need you (Little darling I need you)
Little darling I love you (Little darling I love you)
Little darling I want you (Little darling I want you)
Little darling I've got to have you (Little darling I've got to have you)

[Verse 1]
Oo, you say you're feeling bad cause
The least thing makes you cry
Sounds like a real bad case
Of a girl who needs a guy
I think I know the perfect jewel
One you ought to try
Take a heart that's full of love
On this you can rely

[Chorus]
If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
And if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
And if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
I think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine

[Verse 2]
I may not be a doctor who can cure your ills
Goodbye to all those different drugs and hard-swallowed pills
My remedy is older than the tale of Jack and Jill
My prescription is the kind you love to have refilled

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, medicine won't cure you
Just leave you at the most
The relief is only temporary
Pretty soon will go
But love can last a lifetime
When two hearts are close
Take as much as you want to
There is no overdose

[Verse 1]
One more heartache, I can't take it
My heart is carrying such a heavy load
One more ache would break it
Just like the camel with the heavy back
One last straw was added, I said it broke the camel's back

[Chorus]
Ah (Ah, ah, ah)
Ah (Ah, ah, ah)
I can't take it (One more heartache)
I can't stand it (One more heartache)

[Verse 2]
One more heartache, it would turn me right around
First you build my hopes up high and then you let me down
Like the house you built from toothpicks stacked upon the kitchen table
One last toothpick tore it down; the foundation was not able

[Chorus]
Ah (Ah, ah, ah)
Ah (Ah, ah, ah)
I can't stand it (One more heartache)
And I can't take it (One more heartache)

[Bridge]
No, no, no, baby
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(One more heartache)
(One more heartache)

[Verse 3]
Ooh baby, one more heartache would just be too much load
I'm fed up with the heartaches; one more and I'll explode
Like the toy balloon that's filled with as much air as it can take
One more puff of air and that balloon has got to break

[Chorus]
Ah (Ah, ah, ah)
Ah (Ah, ah, ah)
I can't take it (One more heartache)
I can't stand it (One more heartache)

[Outro]
No, honey (One more heartache)
Not another (One more heartache)
And not another (One more heartache)
Oh oh (One more heartache)
Oh, baby (One more heartache)
Couldn't take another one (One more heartache)
Not another heartache, honey (One more heartache)

[Verse 1]
In the evening
When the sun goes down
Oh...you'll find me
Hanging round
Cause the nightlife
Ain't no good life
But it's my life....oh...yes it is
Many people just like you and me
Are dreaming about....how things used to be

[Chorus]
But the nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life

[Verse 2]
Listen to the blues
They're playing
Listen to the blues
To what's saying
Hie...yeah
Home,it's just another place
Oh...from that world of broken dreams

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Sometimes it's sad
Then again it's happy..oh..mm sometimes

[Chorus]
You've been a long time coming
But darling, welcome home
You've been a long time coming
But darling, welcome home

[Verse 1]
So many nights, I've called your name
Not knowing if I'd see you again
You've been a long time coming
But, oh, baby, welcome home

[Verse 2]
Feel, feel kinda, kinda, kinda good right now
Feel so good baby, hey
You've been a long, real long time coming
But darling, welcome home

[Chorus]
You've been a long, long, long time coming
Oh baby, welcome home

[Verse 3]
So many nights, I sit looking at the wall
Hoping and praying for your call
You've been a long, long time coming
But oh baby, welcome home

[Verse 2]
Feel kinda good, so good right now
Feel so good baby, hey, hey
Hmm hmm
Feels so good having you home, baby
Yeah, yeah, ooh
Don't ever leave me
Oh, don't hurt me, baby

[Chorus]
I'm going to hold on (hold on) hold on (hold on
To your unchanging love
I'm going to hold on (hold on) hold on (hold on
To your unchanging love
I need you baby, baby I need you right now

[Verse 1]
Darling, there comes a time in everybody's life
They may learn as I've learned
That being loved is more important than painting the town
Only noon and night
Cause my life may have bright lights
But I've learned in time they go dim
But your love and tender arms, I can always come home to them

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I used to have more friends than I could count
But now all of my so-called friends are gone
Cause I've lost everything in my bank account
Darling, I'm tired of running 'round
So in your arms I'm gonna settle down
Cause if I don't have a dime, I know your love is mine

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Darling, everybody need somebody, o I need you
I know now, nobody really loves me, honey honey honey, the way you do
One more thing
I've changed, girl, through my life as often as I change my suits
Only to learn the only true happiness is being, honey, being loved by you
That's why

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place
Except you and me
So set 'em' up Joe, I got a little story
I think you should know
We're drinking my friend, to the end
Of a brief episode

[Chorus]
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

[Verse 2]
I know the routine, put another nickel
In the machine
I feel kind of bad, can't you make the music
Easy and sad
I could tell you a lot, but it's not
In a gentleman's code

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You'd never know it, but buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things I'd like to say
And if I'm gloomy, please listen to me
Till it's talked away
Well that's how it goes, and Joe I know your getting
Anxious to close
Thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind
My bending your ear
But this torch that I found, It's gotta be drowned
Or it's gonna explode

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I know I stand in line, until you think you have the time
To spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two

[Chorus]
And then I go and spoil it all, by saying something stupid
Like: "I love you

[Verse 2]
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true
It never seemed so right before
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right your perfume fills my head, the stars get red
And oh the night's so blue

[Chorus]

[Intro]

[Chorus]
This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it, I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Verse 1]
A-this thing (This thing)
Called love (Called love)
It cries (Like a baby)
In a cradle all night
It swings (Woo, woo)
It jives (Woo, woo)
It shakes all over like a jellyfish
Woo, I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

[Bridge]
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

[Break]

[Verse 2]
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride
On my motorbike until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Yeah
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat
Hitch-hike (Ah hum, ah hum)
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie)
Crazy little thing called love

[Chorus]
This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

[Outro]
Crazy little thing called love

Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
The game 'bout to change, Usher
Whoa, man, y'all are something else
Yeah, a lot of women
You know they say y'all do it better than us
(And I learned from the best, man)
Because we only see what you're doing
But I see you
Where we at?
This right here is for my triple G's with the double Ds
Hah, go get 'em, girls
You know who you are
Where we at?
Over here looking how we looking, ain't that right?
Go get 'em, girls

[Verse 1]
I profess, I'm a lover, minor scholar of anatomy
Doctor of feminine chemistry
Got a healthy fascination for a multitude of relation
With plenty women that's still on their feet
And it happens that every once in a while
I go too deep that I gotta shut it down
She keep on coming by, won't quit calling
It's safe to say that she's falling
She pleading, she don't want me to leave
I had to tell her

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no, no
She keep on begging for more
No, no, no
She said you don't love me no more
That's when I be like

[Chorus]
Loving me, baby, that's a no-no
I'm better when I touch and go
I'm trying to add your name to my hall of fame
Not just a player, I'm a pro lover, lover
(Not a lover baby, yeah, yeah man)

[Verse 2]
As a quid pro quo, we can both come and go
This ain't about fidelity
Thought I was a pimp, player, hustler, baller, huh
Whoa, man, she a G and do it better than me
(You do it better than us, baby)
And it happens that every once in awhile
She gon' cook just to hook you for a while
Can't escape, take your pick, either way, you're a trip
'Cause man, if she laying for it, that means you paying for it

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no, no
She keep on begging for more, yeah
No, no, no
She said you don't love me no more
That's when I be like

[Chorus]
Loving me, baby, that's a no-no
I'm better when I touch and go
I'm trying to add your name to my hall of fame
Not just a player, I'm a pro lover, lover
(Yeah, lover baby, ah yeah, ooooh)

[Bridge]
Tick-tock, better hurry, time's running out
(So you better be sure before we lay down)
Knock-knock, daddy's home, open up, girl
(I can tell that it's been awhile, you've been waiting)
Through it so many times (with women that I do it for)
Ain't trying to make you mine (but I like the feeling)
Let's both be honest here, baby
We don't go through drama here, baby
'Cause when you give it up
You gon' get addicted and go crazy and lose your mind
How many of you like that?
Keep on asking me for more (more, more, more, more)

[Chorus]
Loving me, baby, that's a no-no
I'm better when I touch and go
I'm trying to add your name to my hall of fame
Not just a player, I'm a pro lover, lover

[Outro]
(Not just a player, I'm a pro lover, lover
Not just a player, I'm a pro lover)
Better ask somebody
Players (lover)
Real G's feel me on this one
Ain't that right, girl? Yeah
(Not just a player, I'm a pro lover)
Not just a player, I'm a pro lover, pro lover (lover)

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Let's go, haha, tick tick
Six spots, twelve stoves, and I need more pots
And I tote more knots than a Boy Scout got

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
The junkies say it’s finger lickin’ how I whip up powder
I took your food and Prada shoes and added me more power
And if you bought some Sour Diesel, then your dream gone sour
I treat your shooters like cowards, make your team look sour
I feed the hood with the bowl like I cook clam chowder
RIP to Steve McNair, that boy right arm was a rifle
I would race you for the car, but look you don't got the title
If you ain't made ten mil, I can't call you my rival
I got your baby mama suckin' on me using saliva
I made the Forbes list bitch, man you just a subscriber
My mam say you just a lyin’ ass, conniving lil’ diver
My nigga killed his own brother, seen that shit in the bible
Man, Joe Blow chose the fork but you chose the screwdriver
I may did never steal a car, but I did cash off a nine though
I go so hard I make you dump your whole roster to sign me
And you can find me in the six with all my shooters behind me

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
I’mma say a prayer, get a blessing today (amen)
No grey hair, I ain’t stressin’ the case
Make you scratch for the chase, I invested in yay
Man what else can I say? I’m still gon’ flex in they face
What the fuck can I say? I got racks in the safe
Get wrong that gat on my waist, that house they trap in that place
Leaning so hard on the drank, I forgot what to say
Never forget where I came, and it’s all ‘cause I’m having my way

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
That right too, I’m having my way
By the bay, I move, penthouse by the lake
They cool, my neighbors, got a gate so you know them folks safe
Got a pool, twelve acres, and a guest house if you wanna stay
Man I’m cool, gettin’ paper, and a custom Cartier
I’m a smooth operator, I got a customer named Sade
And she’ll bug a motherfucker all day, then try to pull up in all grey
I ain’t gon’ play with you, I’m impatient too, ain’t gon’ wait for you
I’m pimpin’ like players do, lean and matching gator shoes, the windbreaker hater proof
Nigga lookin’ nervous, Gerber, soft like baby food
Okay cool, I got a plug like no other
No discussion, me and Thugger, waiting on judgement

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
I’mma say a prayer, get a blessing today (amen)
No grey hair, I ain’t stressin’ the case
Make you scratch for the chase, I invested in yay
Man what else can I say? I’m still gon’ flex in they face
What the fuck can I say? I got racks in the safe
Get wrong that gat on my waist, that house they trap in that place
Leaning so hard on the drank, I forgot what to say
Never forget where I came, and it’s all ‘cause I’m having my way
I’mma say a prayer, get a blessing today (amen)
No grey hair, I ain’t stressin’ the case
Make you scratch for the chase, I invested in yay
Man what else can I say? I’m still gon’ flex in they face
What the fuck can I say? I got racks in the safe
Get wrong that gat on my waist, that house they trap in that place
Leaning so hard on the drank, I forgot what to say
Never forget where I came, and it’s all ‘cause I’m having my way

[Outro: Rich Homie Quan]
Oh, Never forget where I came
And it’s all ‘cause I’m having my way
Oh, Never forget where I came
And it’s all ‘cause I’m having my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Hook x4]
Watch cost 'bout a Bentley
And my ring cost 'bout a brick

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm the man, goddamn I'm the man
Feature price so high you need a layaway plan
Your girlfriend made me call you and said stay away man
She easy as a free throw so you fade away fast
My ring cost bout' a brick, my watch cost 'bout a Benz
Your main chick on my dick, she let me smash her friends
My earrings are so cold, they look like they on fire
You think your stones are colder, I think that you a liar
I hold court in the street, I'm the judge so bring my jewelry
And ain't no one gon' take it so no need to get insurance
My chain cost bout' a Bentley and my trunk cost bout' a Phantom
I'm the King of East Atlanta and I'm shining like a lemon

[Hook x8]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
You know my time is my money, my money is my time
And I ain't wasting either, so have it on your mind
I shine like a diamond with the cuts of a princess
Ya bitch call me daddy when I fuck her like its incest
Oooo how 

[?], why you standing close to her
You should be like me and let her go like just you supposed to, bruh
Put her on a poster, a flyer and a bottle

[?] in a minute while you high-steppin your prada
I'm all about a dollar if you with me gon' n' holla'
She's a spitter, I ain't wit' her, you gotta roll or swalla'
Or we can't talk money, we can't chop green
Or convo' about the cabbage if you know what I mean

[Hook x8]

[Verse 3: Rocko]
Watch me kick it on these suckers like judo
Motley swag's on jones, catch me off in Pluto
All hoes still gon' ice this track, the new hoes
Still the same won't catch me in this thing unless it's two doors
Bitch got on my old dough now I got new dough
Still spending 1991 and '92 dough
Hoes like

Ooh, you, you I see
In my mirror in the morning, 'stead of seeing me
I see you, I see your face
(You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you)
And inside me is a growing need for your embrace

[Pre-Chorus]
In the light of day, though our faces meet
Someone there might see, so we never speak
'Til the dark of night, while the moon is new
When we whisper words of love in our secret rendezvous

[Chorus]
Though it's wrong, I know
Girl, I love you so
Yes, I need you (You know, you know, you know)
I need you, baby (I need you, babe)

[Verse 2]
Oh you, my sweetest joy
You can afford the best of life
I'm just a hard-working boy
Oh, you've given your love to me (You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you)
Girl, I can't let you hurt yourself by being seen with me

[Pre-Chorus]
We're worlds apart, so close yet worlds apart
So we must hide the love we're feeling in our hearts
We meet in shadows (We meet in shadows)
Your friends must never know (Your friends must never know)
That we are lovers, darling (That we are lovers)
Although it hurts me so (Although it hurts me so)

[Chorus]
For your sake no one must see
The precious love you're giving me
But you know (You know, you know, you know)
I need you, baby (I need you, babe)

[Bridge]
(You, you, you, you, you, you)
(You, you, you, you, you, you)

[Verse 3]
Oh, one day I'll make the grade, my lucky star will shine
I can tell the world that you are mine, all mine
'Til then we must go on ('Til then we must go on)
The way we have before (The way we have before)
And never let it show (And never let it show)
We love each other so (We love each other so)

[Chorus]
Our love's a one-way track
And there's no turning back
Oh (You know, you know, you know)
I need you, baby (I need you, babe)

[Outro]
You (You, you, you)
You I see (You, you, you)
Oh, in my mirror in the morning (You, you, you)
'Stead of seeing me (You, you, you)
I see you (You, you, you)
Seeing your face (You, you, you)

[Intro]
Ah, baby

[Verse 1]
After bitter tears fall from your eyes
Oh, a thousand times, you ask yourself why
The one guy you love has departed
Oh, you're left alone and broken-hearted, woo

[Pre-Chorus]
Love just comes and it goes
How long it's gonna last, said nobody knows, uh-huh

[Chorus]
That's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff how it is)
Oh, that's the way love is, sugar, oh, yeah
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
Oh, that's how it is
Oh, that''s how it is, my little darlin'
Yeah, now

[Verse 2]
I know you're walking down a lonesome road
And your heart is carrying a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend (Feel like you ain't got a friend)
Oh, and your whole world's caving in (Whole world, caving in)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, but now is the time to be strong (Now is the time, to be strong)
You gotta forget him now that he's gone (Forget him, now that he's gone)
And remember

[Chorus]
That's the way love is, honey
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
Oh, that's the way love is, baby, oh, darlin'
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
Ah, that's how it is
Oh, my little darlin'
Ah, baby
Hoo!

[Bridge]
Oh, listen to me, little darling

[Verse 3]
The road of love gets rough sometimes
Don't let it get the best of you
Said I've been hurt by love so many times (Been hurt so many times)
So I know just what you're going through (Know what you're going through)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, you wish that you were never born (You wish you were never born)
You gotta forget him now that he's gone (Forget him, now that he's gone)
Just remember

[Chorus]
That's the way love is, baby, ooh
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
Ah, that's the way love is, honey, yeah
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
Hoo, that's how it is

[Outro]
So wipe away your tears
Love is here today and gone tomorrow
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
I say all your joys turn to sorrow
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
One day gladness, and the next day sadness
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
Oh, that's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)

[Verse 1]
Seems just yesterday you were in my arms
And in a special way you touched my heart with all your charms
And now you're gone
Oh and I find myself, honey, I'm all alone
And there's no love left to take
Don't know where I fell, for you I've always cared
I did all I know
To win your love and make it so

[Bridge]
You'd always stay but you turned away
Honey, what could I say?
How could you, how could you
How could you do me this way?

[Chorus]
Because I'm chained to your love and affection
Because I'm chained; oh your love's my only direction
Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah

[Verse 2]
I've got to make it right, somehow it's always wrong
Somewhere down the line
The love I've lost I've got to find, yeah
But it won't be long
I'm going to make it right, baby
And carry you tenderly back home

[Chorus]
Because I'm chained to your love and affection
Because I'm chained; every time I hear your name I tremble
I tremble, oh you know, oh you know

[Outro]
Oh baby, oh baby
Well, now I admit that I
Haven't been the perfect guy
For a girl as sweet as you
But my heart and soul cries, How do you?
Oh, that's all I need
Oh, going to make it right, baby
If you just stay, stay with me
Because I'm chained
Oh I'm chained to your love and affection
Yes I'm chained

[Intro]
All you have to do is touch my hand
To show that you understand
And something happens to me that's some kind of wonderful

[Verse 1]
Every time my little world seems blue
I-I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful

[Chorus]
I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There is so much I want to say but the right words won't come my way

[Verse 2]
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I just know when I'm in your embrace
Lord!, this world is a happy place
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful

[Bridge]
Some kind of a soft love
Some kind of a warm love
Some kind of wonderful
Some kind of wonderful, yes, it is, I-I-I know

[Outro]
Say I know

[Intro]
I remember yet before we met
When every night and day
I had to live the life of a lonely one
And I remember meeting you
Discovering love could be so true
When shared by two, instead of only one

[Verse 1]
When you said you loved me
We could not be parted
Said, I built my world around you
And I'm truly glad I found you

[Chorus]
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
I never felt so good before
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
Yes it has, you know it has

[Verse 2]
Each night I pray we'll never part
Because the love within my heart
Grows stronger from day to day
Best I try, hard I try
To reassure and satisfy
You know I'd be lost if you went away

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
I never felt so good before
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
Yes it has, you know it has
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
Don't you know my baby there
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever

[Verse 1]
There goes my baby, moving on down the line
Wonder where, wonder where, wonder where she is bound?
I broke her heart and I made her cry
Now I'm alone, so all alone
What can I do, what can I do?

[Bridge]
(There goes my baby) Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
(There goes my baby) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(There goes my baby) Whoa-oh-oh-oh
(There she goes) Yeah! (There she goes)

[Verse 2]
I want to know if she loved me
Did she really love me?
Was she just playing me for a fool?

[Verse 3]
I wanna know why she left me
Why did she leave me so all alone?
So all alone
Hey, oh

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I wanna tell her that I loved her
And that I need her
Beside my side, to be my guide

[Verse 5]
I want to know where is my (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Where is my baby (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)?
I want my baby
I need my baby

[Outro]
Yeah, whoa-oh-oh
(There goes my baby)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Intro]
Ah-ah-aaah, oh yeah
Oh listen to me people

[Verse 1]
I haven't got time to think about money
Or what it can buy
And I haven't got time to sit down and wonder
What makes a birdie fly
And I don't have the time to think about
What makes a flower grow
And I've never given a second thought
To where the rivers flow

[Chorus]
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I haven't got time for nothing else

[Verse 2]
Said, I haven't got time to discuss the weather
How long it's going to last
And I haven't got time to do no studies
Once I get out of class
Telling you I'm just a fellow
Said I got a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just don't have any time

[Chorus]
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I haven't got time for nothing else

[Verse 3]
The diamonds and pearls in the world
Could never match her worth, no no
She's some kind of wonderful, people tell you
I got heaven right here on earth
I'm just a fellow
With a one, one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just don't have any time

[Chorus]
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I haven't got time for nothing else

[Outro]
(Yeah, she's never hard to find
Because she's always on my mind)

[Verse 1]
This magic moment, so different then so new
Was like any other until I kissed you
And then it happened, hell, it took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too by the look in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight

[Chorus]
This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever, baby
Forever till the end, the end of time

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, baby, this magic moment
Oh, baby

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, baby, oh, honey
Oh, I know we'll last, we'll last, we'll last, we'll last forever
Oh, this magic moment, oh, going to last forever, baby
Oh, I know, I know

[Intro]
Oh, it's over, it's all over
Said it's over, it's all over, baby

[Verse 1]
I got to get away from you as fast as I can
You're too much for me, woman
More than my heart can stand
Like a kid behind the wheel
You've been reckless with my heart
If I stayed around
You'd surely tear it all apart

[Chorus]
The road has got to end somewhere
Woman, woman, every road has got to end somewhere
Now is the time for the showdown
So let me give you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road

[Verse 2]
Woman, I'm just thinking about all the times you promised to call
And I sat at home lonely
You only did it because you knew I love you only
Running, running around with every guy in town
I'm telling you, woman, no longer will I be your clown

[Chorus]
The road has got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
I'm tired of your stuff
Say enough is enough
We've come to the end of our road
I can't take it no more

[Verse 3]
Woman, there's no sense in you begging and pleading
To hold on when I'm the one you're leaving
Say I've about had my fill of you (had my fill of you)
Flirting's all through the years
And I've almost run out of tears
I'm telling you, I couldn't cry if I wanted to

[Chorus]
The road has got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
Time and again I've begged you to slow down
So I'm giving you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road, road, road

[Outro]
(Oh, this is the end, the end of our road)

[Verse 1]
Oh, I used to ask my mother
Would I ever find true love?
She would tell me
(True love) Mhm (is hard to find)
Oh yeah (Mhm)
So I traveled on
Everyone I came upon, I would stop and ask
They would tell me
(True love is hard to find, mhm)
That's what they would say
Though years have passed and I'm all alone
No longer do I ask
I just place my faith in five little words
From way back in my past
My mama said

[Chorus]
Seek and you shall find
That's what mama said
Seek and you shall find

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I get so lonely (Lonely)
It seems useless to go on (Lonely)
But then I remember
Somewhere true love is waiting there
So I'll keep on holding on (Holding on)
Oh, and I'll keep on keeping on (Keeping on)
'Cause I know if I keep trying
I can't lose 'cause there's no denying

[Chorus]
Seek and you shall find
That's what my mama said
Seek and you shall find
Help me somebody, woo
Woo, oh

[Verse 3]
Now there is no happy ending
To this story I'm telling you
But I remember somewhere
True love, I know it's waiting there
I'm gonna keep on keeping on (Holding on)
You know that I'm gonna keep holding on (Keeping on)
'Cause I know if I keep trying
I can't lose 'cause there's no denying

[Outro]
Seek and you shall find
I know that's what my mama said
Seek and you shall find
Oh, oh
Seek and you shall find
If it's love that you're looking for
Seek, oh, and you shall find
It might be right around the corner
Seek—

[Verse 1]
Mmm, once I thought that love was a toy
For girls and boys
I never gave my heart
I just played the part right from the start
Then there was you, sweet you
With a love that I knew, I knew was true
But in my pride, I left you, baby
Oh, just hanging on, now love is gone

[Chorus]
Oh, only a lonely man would know
The bitter tears I've cried since I lost you, darling
Since you said goodbye
Only a lonely man would know
The hurt inside of me
(Only a lonely man would know)
Since I let my pride make a fool of me

[Refrain]
Ask any lonely man you see, darling
(Ask him, baby; ask him, baby)
Walk up and ask any lonely man like me, baby
(Ask him, baby; ask him, baby)

[Verse 2]
Ooh, foolishly, girl, I broke your heart
Now we're apart
Now, in my lonely room, I just reminisce
Long for your kiss
And through my lonely tears
I can see ahead long lonely years
Without your love
My world, my world's at an end
Black's closing in
Now, I know, oh, what I was too slow in learning
Oh, now I know
Now that I'm all alone, my heart is yearning

[Chorus]
Oh, only a lonely man would know
The bitter tears I've cried since I lost you, darling
Since you said goodbye

[Refrain]
Ask any lonely man you see, baby
(Ask him, baby; ask him, baby)
Go on and ask him, baby

[Outro]
(Only a lonely man would know)
Only a lonely man would know
The bitter tears I've cried since I lost you, darling
Since you said goodbye, woo
(Only a lonely man would know)
Oh, the hurt inside of me
(Only a lonely man would know)
Since I—

[Intro]
Oh, I got to get to California right away
Oh, now I got to get to California right away

[Verse 1]
Just to see the evening sun, oh, setting in the west
Breaks my heart 'cause it reminds me of the true love that I left
In the sunset I can see my baby's face just haunting me
Reminding me of the tenderness that heaven knows was in her kiss
I had a love that was mine, mine, mine, mine alone
But I played the fool and Lord I left my happy home

What a fool a man can be, but this loneliness inside of me says

[Chorus]
I got to get to California right away
Oh, I got to get to California

[Verse 2]
I wish I was there by my baby's side
Lord, I wish I had listened to my heart and not my pride
She tried to tell me that I had no reason for jealousy
But I was blinded by my pride and I just couldn't see
Now I've got to hurry, I've got a reason to worry
I've got to be on the move, true love I'm gonna lose
I pray it's not too late, oh, I might have to catch a freight

[Chorus]
But I got to get to California right away
Oh, I got to get to California right away

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, I may have to hitchhike, baby
Mhm, might have to hop a freight, yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, now I've gotta hurry
Now I've got a reason to worry
I've got to be on the move
Or true love I'm gonna lose
What a fool a man can be
But this loneliness inside of me says

[Chorus]
I got to get to California right away
I got to get to California (Right away), mhm

[Outro]
(California, I'm on my way)
Might have to hitchhike, baby
(California, I'm on my way)
Oh, oh
(I got to get to California right away)
Oh, might have to hitch a ride
(I got to get to California right away)
(I got to get to California right away)
Oh, oh, now, now, I got to get to California, yeah

[Verse 1]
There's a train leaving here tomorrow
And I'll be a free man once again
I'm so glad I served my time
I'm going to meet the girl that I left behind

[Chorus]
And when I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got

[Verse 2]
There were times
When each day seemed like a year
But the sweet things she said in the letters
Made the time just disappear
She said no other arms will I let hold me
Because in your arms is where I want to be

[Chorus]
And when I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got

[Bridge]
Baby, oh baby, my little darling
I'm coming home

[Verse 3]
The nights I've stared out my window at the moonlight
Thinking about the way I used to hold her tight
I must have been out of my mind to do the wrong I did
And leave her behind

[Chorus]
And when I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got

[Chorus 1]
Oh, yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now, I need a place to hide away
Oh, I, I believe in yesterday

[Verse 1]
Suddenly
People, I ain't half the man I used to be, no
There's a heavy, heavy shadow hanging over me
Yesterday, came all too suddenly
Oh, why did she have to go?
I don't know
Tell you, I don't know
The little girl wouldn't say

[Chorus 2]
I must have, must have said something wrong
Now I long, long, long for yesterday

[Verse 2]
Oh, talking about yesterday
Love, love, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Lord I, I believe now, in yesterday, oh

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse]
Ooo heartburn, cold chills
Dizzy spells, I bite my fingernails
I don't think I'm going to pull through
Everything depends on you
Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; honey, save this poor heart of mine
Oh dark days, empty nights
Without your arms to hold me tight
I don't know how long I'm going to last
So come back baby, I'm sinking fast
Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; baby, save this poor heart of mine
Baby, you left me in a burning condition
And my love, to you, has become my affliction
Ooo you know my need for you
Is oh so strong it's like fire set up in my bones
Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; baby, save this poor heart of mine
Oh I don't think I'm going to pull through
Everything depends on you

[Outro]
Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; honey, save this poor heart of mine

[Chorus]
Grooving on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon

[Verse 1]
I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There isn't a place I'd like to be instead of grooving
Have mercy on a crowded avenue
Don't you know we doing anything we like to do
There's always lots of things that we can see
You can pick anyone we like to be
With all those happy people we could meet
Just setting the groove

[Chorus]
Grooving on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon

[Verse 2]
Groove with me baby
We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
We're going to talk and laugh our time away
I feel it coming closer day by day
Life would be ecstasy, you and me endlessly

[Chorus]
Grooving on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon

[Verse 1]
Oh you've got a smile
Like a sweet loving Angel, oh baby
And you've got a heart
That's made of pure gold, oh baby
You've given me so much
That I'm grateful of such a faithful love

[Chorus]
And it gets sweeter as the days go by
Sweeter as the days go by

[Verse 2]
Oh I'd be lost without you baby
Now don't ever leave me
Because your sweet kiss
Turns on my sunshine, oh yeah baby
At night the stars, they wink at you
I have seen them, baby
Ah but I guess every single star
Knows how sweet you are

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Just a little sweeter, baby

[x4]

[Verse 3]
Now there are so many reasons
For me to love you, oh baby
And I'm so lucky to have you
And that's no lie, no baby
Yes, you're a candy maker's dream come true
And darling, sugar has nothing on you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Honey, you're sweeter than honey
You're sweeter than sugar

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Ooh baby, please turn yourself around
Ahh baby, so I can love you
Ohh baby
I'll make you feel so good
Ohh sugar, just like you want me to

[Chorus]
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball

[Verse 2]
Oh honey, I hope you never freeze
I love you, I love you so much
Ooh baby baby, don't ever go away
Oh, stay with me baby, I'll love you night and day

[Chorus]
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball

[Verse 3]
Ohh now, I just love you that's all
I've got my mind made up baby
There are no doubts (Ohh baby)
That you're my foxy lady, foxy lady

[Chorus]
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball

[Verse 4]
My lady my baby sure does love to ball
(On my mind there's

[?])
All I know that if we should ever
Ever, ever ever ever part
That one day will surely break my heart
Got to get ready, got to get ready

[Chorus]
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball

[Verse 1]
Little surfer, little one
Made my heart come all undone

[Chorus]
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl

[Verse 2]
I have watched you on the shore
Standing by the ocean's roar

[Chorus]
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl

[Bridge]
We could ride the surf together
While our love would grow
In my woody, I would take you
Everywhere I go

[Verse 3]
So I say from me to you
I will make your dreams come true

[Chorus]
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl

[Outro]
Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl
Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl
Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl

[Intro]
Dance with me
Come on, dance with me. Baby
Dance with me
Come on, dance with me. Baby

[Chorus]
I want you
And you want me
So why don't we
Get together after the dance

[Verse 2]
All right, ooh
(Looking girl, saw you smile)
When I first saw you
(Looking good on Soul Train)
You were looking so, so good
(Oh, I was looking, too)
Oh, I was looking at you
(Sweet and so fine)
Sweet and so fine
(Freak that she was)
What a freak thing
(Tantalizing)

[Verse 3]
And I thought to myself
(Ooh, on the floor)
She was so into her space
(She started to dance, would she)
So caught up in the time and the place
And I wondered would she want me
(Ah, wonder if she, she'd go for me)
If she knows what she needs is me

[Chorus]
I want you
And you want me
So why don't we
Get together after the dance

[Verse 4]
Oh, yeah
(Talk while we play records, girl)
We could play so, so sweet
(Look so fine, move next to me)
Come on over. Baby, move closer to me
(Your brown eyes, love for a while)
I love your smile, stay a while
Oh, Baby (I just got flashes)
I feel something (That you're wanting me)
Something in me

[Verse 5]
Oh, nobody else, girl
They'll be talking all night
(Can we leave sweet love. Baby)
Why did the morning come so soon
Love don't need time (Girl)
To make up its mind
(Satisfy) That's how I feel
(All the love inside of me. Baby)
How could you, Baby
(What you going to do)
Family, friends and fans alike who know me well, know that I’m absolutely not the person described in certain headlines today. There is no worse feeling than being misunderstood, especially when people are hurt or offended.

On Friday night we had a surprise show at the EMP Museum in Seattle.  Earlier in the day I thought it would be fun to dress up in a disguise and go incognito to the event, so that I could walk around unnoticed and surprise the crowd with a short performance.  I picked up a bunch of fake mustaches and beards and grabbed a left over wig from our recent trip to Japan.

As it turns out the fake noses they sell at the costume store are usually big (my nose didn’t fit most of them).  So I ended up with a big witch nose.  I went with a black beard, because that’s the furthest color from my natural hair.  Disguise was the intention.  I personally thought I looked very ambiguous in terms of any “type” of person.  Some people there thought I looked like Ringo, some Abe Lincoln. If anything I thought I looked like Humpty Hump with a bowl cut.

We showed up to the event, I hit the stage in the outfit, rocked two songs, took pictures and went home.  We had a great time and it was fun to be a surprise guest in a costume.  I’ve always loved dressing up and have been doing so my entire career. The character I dressed up as on Friday had no intended cultural identity or background.  I wasn’t attempting to mimic any culture, nor resemble one.  A “Jewish stereotype” never crossed my mind.

My intention was to dress up and surprise the people at the show with a random costume and nothing more. Thus, it was surprising and disappointing that the images of a disguise were sensationalized leading to the immediate assertion that my costume was anti-Semetic. I acknowledge how the costume could, within a context of stereotyping, be ascribed to a Jewish caricature. I am here to say that it was absolutely not my intention, and unfortunately at the time I did not foresee the costume to be viewed in such regard. I’m saddened that this story, or any of my choices, would lead to any form of negativity.

I will let my body of work and the causes for which I’ve supported speak for themselves. I hope that anyone who may question my intent take a few moments to discover the human and artist that I strive to be. I respect all cultures and all people.  I would never intentionally put down anybody for the fabric that makes them who they are. I love human beings, love originality, and… happen to love a weird outfit from time to time.

I truly apologize to anybody that I may have offended. I hope this better explains the situation and my point of view.

With love,

Ben

PS - Out of a negative can come a positive. Through this situation I’ve got hip to some incredible groups like the ADL and I encourage people to check the great work they, and others like them, do: http://www.adl.org

[Verse 1]
Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My girl has found another and gone away
With her went my future, my life is filled with gloom
So day after day, I stayed locked up in my room
I know to you it might sound strange

[Chorus]
But I wish it would rain
(How I wish that it would rain)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Because so badly I want to go outside (Such a lovely day)
But everyone knows that a man ain't suppose to cry, listen
I got to cry because crying eases the pain, oh yeah
People this hurt I feel inside, words can never explain

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Day in, day out, my tear stained face
Pressed against the window pane
My eyes search the skies, desperately for rain
Because raindrops will hide my teardrops
And no one will ever know
That I'm crying, crying when I go outside
To the world outside my tears, I refuse to explain

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let it rain, let it rain
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
Oh, let it rain
Oh, yeah, yeah listen
I'm a man and I got my pride
Give me rain or I'm going to stay inside
Let it rain

[Outro]
Let it rain

[x3]
(Let it (rain) (rain) (rain) rain, rain)

[Verse]
World, I'm not the same
I can't remember my name half the time
I took a walk - I thought I'd get some air
But was really not aware of what I said or what I did
I never see the dark of night or the light of day
I took a walk into the park and never saw the children play
Everything I see is a crazy kind of mystery to me
I'm flirting with the mother of insanity
Oh, babe, where is my mind?
Since you left me it's been hard to find
Sugar where, where is my mind?
It started to rain, and I felt insane
But one thing's for sure
It's going to rain forever more
Until you come back to me, please, baby
World, I'm not the same
I go somewhere and can't remember how I came
I'm completely turned around, lost in space
It's your face I see constantly
I never know from right or wrong, or anything
I'm like a desperate man
Just see me try to cling
To the only other parts you've left to me
I'm flirting, I'm flirting with uncertainty
Oh, bring back my mind
Since you left me, honey
I can't find it
Oooh, honey, bring back my mind
I'm starting to say
More and more every day
Please release my soul
Give me back control of my mind
Only you can save me

[Verse]
I have tasted success
I've been in love more or less
With a dream that will last me
A lifetime, baby
Other dreams, I have lost
But whatever the cost
The parade isn't passing me by
No, no, no, no, no, darling
So if the picture I paint
Makes me a sinner, or makes me a saint
I won't try, no, not I
To deny it, woo, oh
I may cry with the past
But it's easier to laugh about it
When I think of my wonderful life
I thank God for my wonderful life

[Verse 1]
Why did I choose you? What did I see in you?
I saw a heart you hide so well
I saw a quiet girl, who had a gentle way
Cute little way that caught me in its glowing spell

[Verse 2]
Why did I want you? What could you offer me?
Just a love to last my lifetime through?
And when I lost my heart so many years ago
I lost it lovingly and willingly, oh girl, to you

[Outro]
If I had to choose again, I would still choose you

[Verse]
The shadow of your, of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes, oh my love, and you'll see for sure
Ah baby, all the wonderful things you are to me
Darling, a wistful little star was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
Darling, so did I

[Outro]
Oh, now when I remember spring
And all the joys that love can bring
I'll be remembering
The shadow of your smile

[Verse]
Come on, girl, and fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Oh, let me know what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words, darling, hold my hand
In other words, little darling, kiss me

[Bridge]
Oh, fill my heart with song
Let me sing, let me sing forever more
'Cause you, you are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, baby, please be true
Just wanna say in other words, honey, I love you
Oh, oh honey, oh

[Outro]
Oh, in other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
Sugar, I just wanna say I love you

[Verse]
Oh, I won't cry anymore
Now that you've left me
I won't cry anymore
Now that you're gone, oh baby
I've shed a million tears since we've been apart
But tears can never mend
Well, my broken, my broken heart
I won't cry anymore, well, I'll just forget you
Oh, I'm closing the door
Closing the door of memories
Well, though, though you're the one love
That my arms are longing for
This is goodbye, well, I won't cry anymore

[Verse 1]
They ask me to forget about you
Go out and find someone new
But that won't be easy, you see
After all the things you've done for me
Told the men I ain't too proud to say
With you I stand tall and strong
Because without you, girl, I'm nothing at all

[Chorus]
How, how can I forget you?
After all you've done for me
Oh woman, you'll always be a part of me
I, I can't forget you
It's impossible, you see
Woman, you'll always be a part of me

[Verse 2]
Girl, I'm down on my bended knees
And I'm begging you please, begging you please
Woman, woman, don't set me free
Because right this moment in the sun
My life was wasting away
Girl, your love gave me hope and strength
You're the reason I'm alive today
Girl, you don't realize what your love means to me
It's more precious than the evergreens

[Chorus]
How, how can I forget you?
After all you've done for me
Oh woman, you'll always be a part of me
I, I can't forget you
It's impossible, you see
Woman, you'll always be a part of me

[Verse 1]
Just like a clock without hands
There'd be no tick tock
Just like a house without a door
There'd be no need to knock
Just like a pen with no ink
It cannot write
But if you come back to me
Everything would be all right

[Verse 2]
Just like a candle with no flame
It will not burn
Just like children without books
They cannot learn
Just like a lamp without a switch
It cannot light
But if you come back to me
Everything would be all right

[Bridge]
I tried to please you, honey
To the greatest satisfaction
But no no, no no, baby
You wanted another attraction
Now please tell me
How can I go on without you?
Honey, how can my life go on without you
Darling, you better come back to me
Oh, let you end my misery
Listen

[Outro]
Oh, just like a clock without hands
There'd be no tick tock
Just like a house without a door
There'd be no need to knock
Darling, Just like a pen with no ink
It cannot write
But if you come back to me
Everything would be all right
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Honey, just like a candle with no flame
It will not burn
Just like children without books
They cannot learn
Just like a lamp without a switch
It cannot light
But if you come back to me
Everything would be all right

[Verse]
Ooh, walking in the rain is insane, can't explain
How I feel when I'm walking in the rain with you
It rains in my hair but I don't seem to care
Just as long as you're walking with me, too

[Bridge]
It rains as we walk
We get sunny weather
We stop and we talk
Then we get wet together
Rain from the sky
Would be rain from my eyes
How I'd cry, oh my darling
Should you ever go

[Outro]
Oh, now rain from the sky
Would be rain from my eyes
How I'd cry, oh my darling
Should you, should you ever go

[Verse 1]
Like the birds in the trees, my heart sings a rhapsody of love for you
Girl, you won my heart the very first time I laid eyes on you
I know your love belongs to someone else
But girl, I got to have you for myself

[Chorus]
So, I'm going to keep on trying
Just keep on trying until I win your love, woo
Going to keep on trying
Just keep on trying until I win your love, woo

[Verse 2]
A fallen star that's what you are, from the heavens above
There's no treasure on earth, that can match your worth
You're a picture of love
I know to you I'm just a love sick guy
But you're wrong
I love you and I need you, by my side

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Aw, yeah
Baby
Keep on

[Verse 3]
I can't help but thinking about that guy
He just got you by his side
He's got everything
There's is no inch of his happiness to be in his place
I'll be glad to give you anything
I know your love belongs to him
But girl, I can't be satisfied just being your friend

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Intro]
Oh, oh, baby, oh, oh

[Verse]
Suddenly a stranger entered my life
Like I pictured her to be
Started my emotions running free
Oh, just like the waters in the sea

[Bridge]
As she looked at me with a smile so sincere
My heart started to sing in a voice, I'm sure she could hear
I reached out for a tender loving kiss
Only to find my love didn't even exist, oh baby
I then realized it was just a dream
The candlelight's burning such a radiant beam
Oh how I yearned for this dream to come true
For just one exciting moment with someone like you
But as I sat there with tears falling from my eyes
I seemed to dream a thousand and one sighs
Yeah, hope was passing by with a slow unhappy pace
And all there was for me was the bitterest taste, oh baby
Stranger in my life, surely it was
Stranger in my life, oh baby

[Outro]
But as I sat there, tears falling from my eyes
The stranger in my life reached out
Honey, reached out for me
And opened my world of loneliness with a magical kiss, oh baby
Stranger in my life, tell you she's so fine
Stranger in my life, she's wonderful
Stranger in my life, telling you she's fine
Stranger in my life, I know she's wonderful

[Verse]
The childhood part of my life wasn't very pretty
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city
It was a one-room shack we slept in, the children beside me
We hardly had enough food or rooms
It was a hard time
Needed something to ease my troubled mind
Ooh listen
Father didn't know the meaning of work
He disrespected Mama and treated her slightly
I left home seeking a job that I never did find
The first thing, downhearted, I took to Cloud 9
I'm doing fine up here on Cloud 9
Listen, one more time
I'm doing fine up here on Cloud 9
Folks now tell me
They say, "Give yourself a chance
And don't let life pass you by"
But the world around you is a rat race
Where only the strong survive
It's a dog-eat-dog world and that ain't no lie
It ain't even safe no more
To walk the streets at night

[Chorus]
I'm doing fine on Cloud 9
Let me tell you about Cloud 9
(Cloud 9) You can be what you want to be
(Cloud 9) You ain't got no responsibility
(Cloud 9) Yeah, every man, every man is free
(Cloud 9) You're a million miles from reality
(Reality) I want to say (up) higher (up up and away)
Cloud 9

[Bridge]
I want to say I love the life I live
And I'm going to live the life I love
Up here on Cloud 9
Uh uh uh uh, I'm riding high on Cloud 9

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
They say I'm wasting time, they say that I'm no good
Summer of my life, not doing what I should
Call me poison ivy 'cause I'm far from good
But pretty from afar, like a dark star

[Verse 2]
They think I'm dangerous, they think I'm really bad
I'm just making up for what I never had
Go out every night whenever I feel sad
All this drive-by love got me crazy like a drug

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
I'm Miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone

[Pre-Chorus 1: Demo Version]
I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
Stumble into trouble, siren with a sad song
They all got girlfriends, but I’m the one that they want
Miss America, with the blue mascara on

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

[Verse 3]
Mommy's Mercedes or Billy's pickup truck
Come home late at night and baby picks me up
Tell him just drive on and d-don't ever stop
Don't take me home again, take me to a new land

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wear my red lipstick, got my coat and gun
I'm Miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone

[Pre-Chorus 2: Demo Version]
I wear my red lipstick, grab my coat and gun
Wonder if this is it, it's darkest before dawn
Sometimes I wanna give in, but I just have to go on
Miss America, now I’m gone, baby, gone

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

[Bridge]
I was born to live fast, die young
Leave a beautiful corpse, live my life on the run
I got my cash and my Louis Vuitton, diamonds and guns
Girls just wanna, just wanna have fun

[Chorus - Shortened]
I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

[Verse]
Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, don't you leave me
Don't you break my heart
Why do you want to leave me?
Why do you want to grieve me?
Why do we have to part
Couldn't give my love to anybody else
You've got me feeling sorry for myself
Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, I'm lonely
Oh, so lonely
When you left me before
That's when you promised
Oh yes, you promised
Not to leave me no more
You ought to hang your head in shame
The way you keep my little heart in pain
Baby, don't you leave me

[Bridge]
Said you'd never let anything come between you and me
I'm yours and I guess I'll be yours until you set me free

[Outro]
Don't leave me
Please don't leave me
Don't you make me cry
Let's stay together
Always together
Until the day we die
You know you're coming out hard to wait
You're going to fool around and make it great?
Baby, don't you leave me
Don't leave me, baby
Baby, don't you leave me
Please don't go
Baby, don't you leave me

[Verse 1]
Ah listen everybody, especially you girls
Is it right to be left alone
While the one you love is never home?
I love too hard, my friends sometimes say
But I believe, I believe
That a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside
To see her treat me so unkind
Somebody, somewhere tell her it's unfair

[Verse 2]
Can I get a witness? Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness? Somebody
Is it right to be treated so bad
When you've given everything you had?
Even tossing in my sleep
'Cause I haven't seen my baby all week
Now, you chicks do agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Up early in the morning with her on my mind
Just to find out all night that I've been crying
But I believe a woman's a man's best friend
So I'm going to stick by her till the very end
But she cause so much misery
That I forget how love's supposed to be
Somebody, somewhere, tell her it ain't fair
Can I get a witness?

[Verse 4]
Can I get a witness? I want a witness
Witness, witness, witness, witness
Everybody knows, especially you girls
But love can be sad
But half of a love is twice as bad
Now, all you chicks agree
That this ain't the way it's supposed to be
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I want a witness
I want a witness
Come on witness
I want a witness
Just a little bit louder
Louder
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Father, stop criticizing your son
Mother, please, leave your daughters alone
Don't you see that's what wrong
With the world with world today? Oh

[Chorus]
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

[Verse 2]
We all talk about kindness
But it's only, only a word, truly
Brother turn on sister in this cruel, cruel world
That's what's wrong with, oh, with this world today

[Chorus]
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay, oh
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

[Verse 3]
Everybody wants somebody to play with 'em
Wanna to mold you, wanna mold you
Shape it like you wanna, want to do their thing
Children are told to give and not just to take
If we were all children
You know the world will be a better place, oh

[Chorus]
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

[Bridge]
We should all love each other
Love, not hate one another
We should all love each other
Love, not hate, oh

[Chorus]
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay, yeah
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Truly, everybody wants somebody
To mold 'em, shape 'em their own way
Everybody wants somebody
To try to make it, oh, do their, do their thing
Everybody wants to take somebody
To try to make 'em, make 'em like their self, oh
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay, yeah

[Outro]
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay, yeah
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody

[Verse 1]
Darling, please stay, don't go away
(If you leave me)
What a heartache, for Heaven's sake
(Don't you need me?)
Don't leave me blue of wanting you
(How could I live?)
Don't be untrue, what could I do?

[Pre-Chorus]
(Don't you know you)
Gave me the world, little girl
When you gave me your love
So if you take your love
You take my world with you too

[Verse 2]
Hm, hey, look at me, now can't you see
(Tears in my eyes?)
Hear what I say, stay here, I pray
(Never leave me)
Why must I plead, you know I need
(All your loving)
Don't put me down, keep me around

[Pre-Chorus]
(Don't you know you)
Gave me the world, little girl
When you gave me your love
So if you take your love
You take my world with you too

[Chorus]
And I said, baby
Hey, pretty little baby
Don't leave me, baby
Ah, pretty little baby

[Verse 3]
Darling, you give me joy, am I your toy?
(Cracked and broken)
I always share your every care
(Wishing, hoping)
All through the years, we have no fears
(Now I'm crying)
You leave the tears falling for years

[Pre-Chorus]
(Don't you know you)
Gave me your love, little girl
You gave me the world
So if you take your love
You take my world with you too

[Chorus]
And I said, baby
Huh, pretty little baby
Don't leave me, baby
Hey, pretty little baby

[Outro]
Baby please, baby
Ah, pretty little baby

[Chorus 1]

[Repeat until fade]

[Verse 1]
Oh, you don't always say the words
I want to hear, no baby
To me you're really saying
Something dear
Oh, you're not the kind of girl to win a beauty prize
Just your smile, girl, lets me know
Where your beauty lies
Makes me realize

[Chorus]
You're a sweet thing
You're a sweet thing, baby, listen, honey

[Verse 2]
You can't seem to do the things
I ask you to
Oh, but I can't help but love
The way you do the things you do
No, you're not the kind of girl
That men just can't resist
There's a certain something in your kiss
Oh, makes me want to sing

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 3]
There may be a lot of things
You'll never be
Ooh, but the little things you are
They mean everything to me
So love, don't ever try and be, all mankind's ideal
Just stay the way you are right now, girl
Truthful and for real
You've got your appeal

[Outro]
Oh, you're a sweet thing
Honey, you are a sweet thing
Baby, sweeter than wine
That's why I'm glad you're mine
Baby, sweeter than a rose
So now my love just grows and grows
You're sweeter baby

Dreams of you my darling still
Are so fine, so fine, baby
Since I woke up
So is my state of mind
Since we've been apart
Oh I miss you, miss you with all my heart
Oh baby, what else can I say
Put on three albums
And let's fly baby
I've got to know
How much I love you so
I'm going to make you feel
That my love is strong for you tonight
Baby, I'm going to make it right
Put three albums on baby
We're going to make it long, long, long
Now when the music starts
I'm going to groove you slow and quiet
And when the first side's through
I'll still be into you
I'm getting sober
Let's get high and turn the record over
'Cos baby it's time for phase two, yeah
That's how it is, yeah
That's how it goes, hey
Just why it is, yeah
Nobody knows
'Cos music's been my therapy
Taking the pain from all my anatomy
Oh and my anatomy
It's my symphony, always stay with me
You know that the world ain't right
Baby, lots of people stay uptight
I'll go crazy
If something ever happened to my musical thrill
And darling your love is just like music
The second jam, girl is falling down
We've been one hour, still I got the power
Turn up the sound
Sounds drown out the screams
Come rock with me
Straight into Side B
The time has passed
An hour and a half
I love you baby
I'm strong enough to last
You, you and your music
Are more precious than gold baby
Two albums later baby
And I'm feeling great
You said wait, let's take a break
Before you play the last side
Are you fit enough to ride
I said yes, baby
Just let me catch my breath
Honey, honey, honey
Oh baby, I'm not through yet
This is one night honey, that you won't forget
I love you darling, I'm going to prove it tonight
Put on some music
Turn on some music
I've got some music

[Verse]
Did you say, I've got a lot to learn
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Teach me tonight
Starting with the ABC of it
Getting right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

[Chorus]

[x2]
The sky's a blackboard high above you
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me tonight

[Verse 1: The Beach Boys]
This time each year in our hometown
The county fair comes our way
Where the folks gather round to be happy and spend their day
A-here's what happened now
I soon decide that I'd take with me
The most specialest girl I knew
I had her pack us a lunch and on down the dirt road we flew

[Verse 2: County Fair Folk & Girl]
Folk: "Hurry hurry, step right up and win your girl a stuffed koala bear!"
Girl: "Aw, come on Nicky, win me a koala bear!"
Folk: "Break the balloon with a dart! Yes, you son, come up here! Win your girl a stuffed koala bear!
Girl: "Oh please, win me a koala bear!"
Folk: "Break the balloon with a dart! Come on son, step right up! Get up there, that's a boy!"

[Verse 3: The Beach Boys]
Right then I knew what I had to do
(Hurry, hurry)
Before that day was through
(Step right up)
I had to win a stuffed doggie or I'd break her poor heart in two
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)
A-let me tell you now
I passed up a chance when I walked by a booth
(Hurry, hurry)
Where you throw a dart and break a balloon
(Step right up)
I snuck by a couple more, but I had to get caught real soon
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)

[Verse 4: County Fair Folk & Girl]
Folk: "Step right up, test your strength! Come on, son, ring the bell with the hammer!"
Girl: "Aww, come on, muscles!"
Folk: "Win your girl a stuffed koala bear!"
Girl: "Ooohhh!"
Folk: "Come on son, are you a man or a weakling? Yes, you, step up here and test your strength! Win your girl a stuffed koala bear!"
Girl: "Come on, baby!"
Folk: "Come on, son!"

[Verse 5: The Beach Boys]
I hit the rubber stump just as hard as I could
(Hurry, hurry)
But I didn't make it ring the bell
(Step right up)
I tried again and again, but I just didn't do so well
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)
Can you believe it now
Up walked a fellow and he tapped me on the shoulder, said
(Hurry, hurry)
"I can win your girl a prize"
(Step right up)
So he flexed all his muscles and he knocked the bell up in the sky
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)

[Verse 6: The Beach Boys & Fair County Folk & Girl]
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky
(Hurry, hurry)
Took my girl and the doggie away
(Step right up)
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky
(Folk: "Step right up son, test your strength!")
Took my girl and the doggie away
(Folk: "Come on kid, ring the bell!")
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky
(Girl: "Ah, goodbye, muscles, I don't need you anymore")
Took my girl and the doggie away
(Girl: "Loser!")
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky
(Girl: "Forget it!")

Ten little Indian boys

[Verse 1]
The first little Indian gave squaw pretty feather

The squaw didn't like them at all
The tenth little Indian said it really didn't matter

He acted like himself and he didn't look at her
(Fighting over a squaw)
The squaw didn't care if he never did a thing

Because she loved the tenth Indian boy

Loved the tenth Indian boy

[Chorus 1]
Oh, the world's situation should be Rated X, Rated X
Said, the world's situation should be Rated X, yeah Rated X
Listen people!

[Verse 1]
Not only in the movie shows
Take a look outside it's where the truth is really told
It's life in living color
Fighting, killing and dope dealing, it's everywhere

[Chorus 2]
What about the crime? Rated X
What about the killing, fighting, stealing everywhere?
They let the children see life destroyed
But they won't let them see its making
Oh what happened to God's creation?

[Verse 2]
The one thing that really bothers me the most
Is how we calmly take the lives of other folk
The world today is in a grave situation
Dirty water we can't drink, dirty air, it's so unfair
Oh, I know something is missing all over the world
Oh, Rated X, ooh, Rated X, ooh, Rated X baby
I know something is missing all over the world

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
Where's the love? Where's the peace?
Where's the joy? Where's the hope for us all?
Love has been Rated X
Hate is all the way Rated X

[Chorus 1]

Jamaica special love

Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love, hey Jamaica

[Verse]
Sitting down see the flower
On the window tops and the mountain
See the rain and the warm lit sun
On the beaches sand
Comes a man with a plan to renew the world
Up in Rasta land, hungry boys and girls
He lived up to his part
And he died with a cause in his heart

[Bridge]
Jamaica special love
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Special love, listen
Oh baby, ohh, Jamaica lady
Ohh, Jamaica girl

Peas and rice, they awful nice
But not as nice as you
Peas and rice, they awful nice
But not as nice as you
Peas and rice, they awful nice
But not as nice as you

[Verse 1]
Well, you been talkin’, talkin’ to the people
Tryin’ to get them to go your way
Telling us, telling us not to worry
You say we won’t be led astray
We’re so tired of your signifying
How do we know, 'til it’s too late
Whether or not you’ve been lying?
Think about the mistakes you make
I believe, sir, that humanity’s at stake
You see, busin’, busin’ is just one issue, one issue
What about the rest of it, mister?

[Chorus]
Well, if you've got the plan
I said, you, if you’ve got the master plan
I got to vote for you, ah yeah
I got to vote for you
‘Cause you’re the man, I know, ah yeah

[Verse 2]
Maybe what this country needs is a lady for president
No, we don’t wanna hear no more lies
About how you plan to economize
We want our dollar value increased
And employment to rise
This heavy taxation has got us all in this awful situation
Now, don’t, don't give us no peace sign
Turn around and rob the people blind
Oh, economics, money is all you’re interested in
Do you have a plan that all the people can share in?

[Chorus]
‘Cause if you’ve got the plan
I got to vote for you
Cause you’re the man, I know, oh

[Verse 3]
People marching on Washington
Why not hear what they have to say?
Because the tables might turn against you
Set around Election Day
Demagogues and admitted minority haters
Should never be President, this time a lady
Will you, will you stop the bombs
And right all the wrongs this administration has done?
I know peace and freedom is the issue, oh Lord
Do you have a plan with you, mister?

[Chorus]
‘Cause if you’ve got the plan
I said, you, you’ve got the master plan
Well I got to vote for you
Oh Lord, I got to vote for you
‘Cause you’re the man
Woo, got to vote for you
If you’re gonna take a stand
I got to vote for you
Gonna be the man?

[Outro]
What about the issues?
What about the young folks?
What about marijuana?
What about peace, peace in the land?
Do you understand?
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta take a stand
Then I’ll vote for you, I think you’re the man
Tell me something, don’t run away
Tell me something, gonna see your face
I gotta vote for you, I think that you’re the man
Gotta be strong whether you’re right or wrong

[Chorus]
Catch a wave and you're sitting on top of the world

[Verse 1]
Don't be afraid to try the greatest sport around
(Catch a wave, catch a wave)
(Everybody tries it once)
Those who don't just have to put it down
You paddle out, turn around and raise
And baby that's all there is to the coastline craze

[Chorus]
You gotta catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world

[Verse 2]
Not just a fad because it's been going on so long
(Catch a wave, catch a wave)
(All the surfers going strong)
They said it wouldn't last too long
They'll eat their words with a fork and spoon and watch them
They'll hit the road and all be surfing soon

[Chorus]
And when they catch a wave they'll be sittin' on top of the world
Catch a wave and you're sitting on top of the world

[Verse 3]
So take a lesson from a top-notch surfer boy
(Catch a wave, catch a wave)
(Get yourself a big board)
But don't you treat it like a toy
Just get away from the shady turf
And baby go catch some rays on the sunny surf

[Chorus]
And when you catch a wave you'll be sittin on top of the world
(Way up high, up on top of the world)
Catch a wave and you'll be sittin' on top of the world
(Way up high, up on top of the world)
Catch a wave and you'll..

[Verse 1]
There's a moon in the sky somewhere I know
Waiting for all the love to burn below
If you fall and it happens all to soon
Blame it all on the surfer moon

[Verse 2]
'Neath the hill 'hind the cloud one dreamy night
Rising up, throwing down its golden light
If your heart hears this melancholy tune
Then you'll know it's the surfer moon

[Bridge]
Brings the tide in
Takes it all away
Helps us ride in
Brings us waves each day, I say

[Verse 3]
Other moons have brought light and love before
Promising to remain for evermore
But they've all disappeared with each new tune
They make way for the surfer moon

[Outro]
Moon
Moon
Moon

[Verse]
Look out here come those South Bay surfers
California's getting hot
There they go cruising down that coastline
Looking for their favorite spot
We'll find the big one
Oh, the boys are rough
And ready to handle anything
They take the big one
They've got to be the best thing going
South Bay surfers really swing
Okay, rock out
Oh, Chicago can't you hear them
Hear that shore pound slam
You're going to eat it
Smash
It rumbles clear to New York City
Detroit back to old Miami
Philly back to Alabama

[Outro]
You'll catch them surfing

All my worries and my fears

Do my dreaming and my scheming
Lie awake and pray
Do my crying and my sighing
Laugh at yesterday

Now it's dark and I'm alone
But I won't be afraid

[Outro]
In my room
In my room (In my room, in my room)
In my room (In my room, in my room)

We don't give a damn
We just want to jam, party up
Party up, got to party up
That army bag
Such a double drag, party up
Party up, got to, got to, got to party up
Party, got to party down, baby
Revolutionary rock and roll
Going uptown, baby, ooh
How you going to make me kill somebody

Fighting war

Going uptown, baby, ooh

[Chorus]
Party up, got to party up
Party up, got to party up

Because of their half-baked mistakes
We get ice cream, no cake
All lies, no truth
Is it fair to kill the youth?

Party up, oh
Got to party up, yeah

[Verse 1]
Gary likes a girl's tight black pants
Larry knows he doesn't stand a chance
Carl says hurry up and order it quick
Dave gets out to chase that chick
Dennis wonders what's under the hood
A big chrome tack and it sounds real good
I go down to the root beer stand
And drink up all that I can

[Chorus]
Give me some root beer (chug-a-lug chug-a-lug chug-a-lug)
Give me some root beer (chug-a-lug chug-a-lug chug-a-lug)

Guy's got around to ordering fries
But root beer's my best buy

Give me some root beer (chug-a-lug chug-a-lug chug-a-lug)

All my life I wanted to see
The island called Hawaii

Oh, do you want to come along with me?

It's a genuine fact that the surfers rule

[Verse 1]
It's plastered on the walls all around the school, now
(Surfers rule, surfers rule)
Becoming just as common as a golden rule, now
(Surfers rule, surfers rule)
Take it or leave it but you better believe it
Surfers rule

[Verse 2]
They burnt it in the grass on the football field, now
(Surfers rule, surfers rule)
Just try to make them cool it and they'll never yield, now

Take what you've heard, now and go pass the word now
Surfers rule

A woody full of surfers pulling long side a wagon

The hodaddies sitting while the surfers are dragging

The surfers are winning and they say as they're grinning
Surfers rule

[x5]
Surfers rule
(Four seasons, you better believe it)

[Verse 1]
I've been cruising 'round the town, now
With the guys for quite a while
Oh, we been thinking about starting up a club
That shows some class and style
And we'll get the finest cars

[Verse 2]
We got a Deuce Coupe
A Stingray, a rail job and an X K E
(We'll start a car club)
We'll be the fastest at the drags
Man, we'll really cut some low ETs
(We'll start a car club)
And wipe out the other clubs

[Bridge]
We'll set a meeting and get a sponsor and collect some dues
And you can bet that we'll have our jackets on wherever we cruise

[Verse 3]
We'll get the roughest and the toughest
Initiation we can find
(We'll start a car club)
And if you want to try to get in

The girls dig the way the guys get all wiped out
With their feet in the air you can hear them shout
They're not afraid (don't back down, don't back down)
Not my boys (don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth, (a-oo) they don't back down

[Chorus]
Don't back down
You got to be a little nuts
Don't back down
But show them now who's got guts
Don't back down
Don't back down from that wave

[Verse 2]
With their feet full of tar and their hair full of sand
The boys know the surf like the palm of their hand
They're not afraid (don't back down, don't back down)
Not my boys (don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth (a-oo) they don't back down

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When a twenty-footer sneaks up like a ton of lead
And the crest comes along and slaps them upside the head
They're not afraid (don't back down, don't back down)
Not my boys (Don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth (a-oo) they don't back down

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Don't back down

Stop and find a pretty shell for her
Make it real, your summer dream

To them an ordinary day
Soon you wonder where the time has gone
The sun has almost slipped away

[Intro]
Betsy, Betsy, ahh

[Verse]
She was born in '32, and was she ever pretty
She rode a freight train west, all the way from Detroit city
Betsy's seen more places than I'll ever hope to see
Betsy's been more loyal than any friend could be
With some she traveled fast, with others it was slow
Betsy's seen them all, she'd seen them come and go
She must have had some favorites before I finally met her
And now that she's all mine, they'd better just forget her
Betsy was a lady and that she will remain
Betsy took some beatings but she never once complained
She had a classic beauty that everyone could see
I was the last to meet her, but she gave her life to me
She may be rusted iron, but to me she's solid gold
And I just can't hold the tears back
Cause Betsy's growing old

[Chorus 1]
Surfing is the only life
The only way for me
Now surf, surf with me
Bom Bom Dit Di Dit Dip

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I got up this morning turned on my radio
I was checking on the surfing scene
To see if I would go
And when the DJ tells me that the surfing is fine
That's when I know my baby and I will have a good time

[Chorus 2]
We're going surfing
Bom bom dip di dit  - Surfing

[x8]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
From the early morning to the middle of the night
Any time the surf is up the time is right
And when the surf is down to take its place
We'll do the Surfer's Stomp it's the latest dance craze

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Now the dawn is breaking and we really got to go
But we'll be back here very soon that you better know
Yeah my surfer knots are rising and my board is losing wax
But that won't stop me baby cause you know I'm coming back

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
Surfing is the only life the only way for me
Now come on pretty baby and surf with me
Bom bom dip di dit

Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy going to shut you down

[Verse 1]
It happened on the strip where the road is wide
(Oooo rev it up now)
Two cool shorts standing side by side
(Oooo rev it up now)
Yeah, my fuel injected Stingray and a four-thirteen
(Oooo rev it up now)
Revving up our engines and it sounds real mean
(Oooo rev it up now)

[Chorus]
Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy going to shut you down

[Verse 2]
Declining numbers at an even rate
(Oooo moving out now)
At the count of one we both accelerate
(Oooo moving out now)
My Stingray is light the slicks are starting to spin
(Oooo moving out now)
But the four-thirteen's really digging in
(Oooo moving out now)
Got to be cool now, power shift - here we go

[Bridge]
Superstock Dodge is winding out in low
But my fuel injected Stingray's really starting to go
To get the traction I'm riding the clutch
My pressure plate's burning that machine's too much

[Verse 3]
Pedal's to the floor hear the dual quads drink
(Oooo pump it up now)
And now the four-thirteen's lead is starting to shrink
(Oooo pump it up now)
He's hot with ram induction but it's understood
(Oooo pump it up now)
I got a fuel injected engine sitting under my hood
(Oooo pump it up now)

[Outro]
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down

[Intro]
Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)

[Verse 1]
The surfers call him "Noble"
And that's just what he is
He's dedicated to the mighty sea
Surfing night and day
Never twice in one spot
He's something you and I would like to be

[Chorus]
Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)
Noble (he's moving)
Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)

[Verse 2]
He's not afraid of body whop
From ten feet or more
He never backs away from a swell
Hurachis on his feet
Bushy hair on his head
And where he's going he'd never tell

[Chorus]
Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)

Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)

[Verse 3]
A surfing Cassanova
With his customized board
A Woody and his dirty white jeans
He takes his choice of honeys
Up and down the coast
The finest surfer yet to make the scene

[Chorus]
Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)
Noble (he's moving)

[Verse 1]
When some loud braggart tries to put me down
And says his school is great
I tell him right away
"Now what's the matter buddy
Ain't you heard of my school
It's number one in the state"

[Chorus]
So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
And let your colors fly
Be true to your school

[Verse 2]
I got a letterman's sweater
With a letter in front
I got for football and track
I'm proud to wear it now
When I cruise around
The other parts of the town
I got a decal in back

[Chorus]
So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
Let your colors fly
Be true to your school

[Verse 3]
On Friday we'll be jacked up on the football game
And I'll be ready to fight
We're gonna smash 'em now
My girl will be working on her pom-poms now
And she'll be yelling tonight

[Chorus]
So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
Let your colors fly
Be true to your school

[Outro]
Rah rah rah, be true to your school
Rah rah rah, be true to your school
Rah rah rah, be true to your school
Rah rah rah, be true to your school
Rah rah rah, be true to your school

[Verse 1]
My baby she told me
She don't want to hold me (oh, no!)
And kiss my lips anymore (unh-unh!)
She's going to leave me
And she don't believe me
That I'll be true now
Well maybe she don't love me
And is not thinking of me
But why'd she do it this time of year?
She knows that I'll miss her
And I'll want to kiss her
If just for Christmas

[Chorus 1]
Merry Christmas, baby

[x3]

[Verse 2]
Tell me, what did I do
To really convince you
That I'm not the guy anymore?
Take back my ring now
I'll do anything now
But please forgive me

[Chorus 2]
I made my mistake but
I'm willing to wake up
And never mess around anymore
Oh why did we break up?
There's still time to make up
If just for Christmas

[Chorus 1]
Merry Christmas, baby

[x3]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
Merry Christmas, baby

[Intro]
Every time
We have a fight
We flip a coin
To see who's right

[Verse 1]
Why do we have to gamble just to see who's right?
Why can't we arbitrarily resolve a fight?
But with your style of gambling there's no chance to win
That's how it is and that's the way it's always been

[Chorus 1]
Heads, you win
Tails, I lose
Heads, you win
Tails, I lose
Bad news

[Verse 2]
If we were playing cards you'd be the one to deal
You'd play with loaded dice and fix the roulette wheel
You pick them at the races like I've never seen
And then you make me pay off like a slot machine

[Chorus 1]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh well, match me honey (match me honey)
Take my money (take my money)
You know the odds are yours (flip it baby)
So flip the coin

[Chorus 2]
I'm going to make some changes with this gambling game
From now on I'm the dealer and I'll do the same
I'll load my dice and stack the deck and fix the odds again
So if you want to flip to see who's right I know I'll win

[Chorus 1]
Heads, I win
Tails, you lose
Heads, I win
Tails, you lose
Bad news

[Pre-Chorus 2]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[x2]
Heads, I win
Tails, you lose
Heads, I win
Tails, you lose
Bad news

[Chorus]
Run a-run a doo run run
Wo run a-run a doo run run
Wo run a-run a doo run run
Wo run a-run a doo run run

[Verse 1]
Well my steady little doll is a real-live beauty
And everybody knows she's a car crazy cutie
She's hip to everything, man, from customs to rails
And axle grease imbedded 'neath her fingernails

[Chorus]
(oh yeah) Run a-run a doo run run
(oh, oh, oh, oh-oh) Wo run a-run a doo run run
(ah, ah, ah, car cutie) Wo run a-run a doo run run
(oh, oh-oh, oh) Wo run a-run a doo run run

[Verse 2]
A power shift in second and a-riding the clutch
My car crazy cutie, man, she's just too much
I take her to the drags, man, and everyone flips
For her big blue eyes and her candy apple lips

[Chorus]
(oh yeah) Run a-run a doo run run
(oh, oh, oh, oh-oh) Wo run a-run a doo run run
(ah, ah, ah, car cutie) Wo run a-run a doo run run
(oh, oh-oh, oh) Wo run a-run a doo run run

[Bridge]
Yeah oh
Car crazy cutie
Car crazy cutie
Car crazy cutie
Car crazy cutie

[Verse 3]
Well I guess you might say she's the rodder's dream gal
Always there to help, man, when you need a pal
But when I talk of loving, man, some kisses and hugs
Says she's like to take 'em better clean and gap the plugs

[Chorus]
(oh yeah) Run a-run a doo run run
(oh, oh, oh, oh-oh) Wo run a-run a doo run run
(ah, ah, ah, car cutie) Wo run a-run a doo run run
(oh, oh-oh, oh) Wo run a-run a doo run run
Run a-run a doo run run
Wo run a-run a doo run run
Wo run a-run a doo run run
Wo run a-run a doo run run
(oh yeah) Run a-run a doo run run
(oh, oh, oh, oh-oh) Wo run a-run a doo run run
(ah, ah, ah, car cutie) Wo run a-run a doo run run
(oh, oh-oh, oh) Wo run a-run a doo run run
(ah) Run a-run a doo run run
(a-ah) Wo run a-run a doo run run
(a-a-a-ah) Wo run a-run a doo run run
(a-a, a-ah) Wo run a-run a doo run run

[Verse 1]
I kicked out of the surf
And stuck my board in the sand
And then up in my Woody
To a hamburger stand
And when I got back
My nine five board was gone

[Chorus]
She said yeah she said
(Finders keepers)
Finders keepers
(Losers weepers)
Losers weepers
(Finders keepers)
Finders keepers
Finders keepers
Losers weepers

[Verse 2]
I saw a Hodaddy
Paddling out by the pier
Well he must have got my board
Cause mine isn't here
But I know how to fix him
I'll just raise that meatball flag

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
He took off on a swell
When he saw the flag
He's just a crazy Hodaddy
Pulling some kind of gag
He went over the falls
And now my board's
Coming back to me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
That'll teach him to mess with my board
Next pass next time

[Chorus]
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me

[Verse 1]
Well, I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad?
All I do is hang my head and moan

[Chorus]
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me

[Verse 2]
If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't, I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes

[Chorus]
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me (Hey)

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm begging on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
If there's anything I can do
Then I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you, oh

[Introduction]
Go cherry, cherry coupe now

[Verse 1]
The wildest short around is my cherry, cherry coupe
It's the sharpest thing in town and the envy of my group
It's one of its kind and it really looks good
Chopped nose and deck with louvers on the hood

[Chorus]
Go cherry, cherry coupe now
Go cherry, cherry coupe now
(My cherry coupe beats 'em up comin' off the line)
Go cherry, cherry coupe now
Go cherry, cherry coupe now
(And she really gets sparks when she starts to whine)

[Verse 2]
Chrome reversed rims with whitewall slicks
And it turns a quarter mile in one oh six
Door handles are off but you know I'll never miss 'em
They open when I want with the solenoid system

[Chorus]
Go cherry, cherry coupe now
Go cherry, cherry coupe now
(My cherry coupe beats 'em up comin' off the line)
Go cherry, cherry coupe now
Go cherry, cherry coupe now
(And she really gets sparks when she starts to whine)

[Verse 3]
My coupe's tuck and roll underneath the hood
And the rugs, seats, and panels now are looking good
When I go looking for something to do
She's got enough room now to barely seat two

[Chorus]
Go cherry, cherry coupe now
Go cherry, cherry coupe now
(My cherry coupe beats 'em up comin' off the line)
Go cherry, cherry coupe now
Go cherry, cherry coupe now
(And she really gets sparks when she starts to whine)
Go cherry, cherry coupe now
Go cherry, cherry coupe now
(My cherry coupe beats 'em up comin' off the line)
Go cherry, cherry coupe now

[Chorus: Brian Wilson and Mike Love]
Round, round, get around
I get around, yeah
Get around, round, round, I get around

Get around, round, round, I get around
From town to town
Get around, round, round, I get around
I'm a real cool head
Get around, round, round, I get around
I'm making real good bread
Get around, round, round, I get around

[Verse 1: Mike Love]
I'm getting bugged driving up and down this same old strip
I gotta find a new place where the kids are hip
My buddies and me are getting real well-known
Yeah, the bad guys know us and they leave us alone

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
I get around
Get around, round, round, I get around
From town to town
Get around, round, round, I get around
I'm a real cool head
Get around, round, round, I get around
I'm making real good bread
Get around, round, round, I get around
I get around, round
Get around, round, round, oooh
Wah wa ooh
Wah wa ooh
Wah wa ooh

[Verse 2: Mike Love]
We always take my car 'cause it's never been beat
And we've never missed yet with the girls we meet
None of the guys go steady 'cause it wouldn't be right
To leave their best girl home on a Saturday night

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
I get around
Get around, round, round, I get around
From town to town
Get around, round, round, I get around
I'm a real cool head
Get around, round, round, I get around
I'm making real good bread
Get around, round, round, I get around
I get around, round
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

[Outro]
Round, round, get around

Get around, round, round, I get around
Get around, round, round, I get around
Wah wa oooh
Get around, round, round, I get around
Ooooh
Get around, round, round, I get around
Ooooh
Get around, round, round, I get around

Get around, round, round, I get around
From town to town
Get around, round, round, I get around
Ooooh
Get around, round, round, I get around
Ooooh
Get around, round, round, I get around

[Verse 1]
We knew it must have been late
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
We had no time to wait
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
I went to light the fireplace
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
I planned it all this way, and
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
I snuggled close to her
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
Her heart began to purr
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
I held my breath inside, and then
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
I put my arms around her
(Tick-tock)

[Chorus]
Cuckoo, cuckoo (go away silly bird)

[x3]
Cuckoo, cuckoo

[Verse 2]
I put that birdie away
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
His cuckoo was gone to stay
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
We both apologized for why
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
Forgave that doggone cuckoo
I went back to her side
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
I had to swallow my pride
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
The fire had almost died away
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
We just got situated
(Tick-tock)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I took that clock apart
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
I broke the cuckoo's heart
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
He'll never bother us again
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
We just forgot about him
(Tick-tock)

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Well, it's been building up inside of me for
Oh, I don't know how long
I don't know why, but I keep thinking
Something's bound to go wrong
But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize

[Chorus]
And she says (Don't worry baby)
"Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out alright"
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)

[Verse 2]
I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now because
I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive

[Chorus]
When she says (Don't worry baby)
"Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out alright"
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)

[Verse 3]
She told me "Baby, when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you
Baby, nothing could go wrong with you"
Oh, what she does to me
When she makes love to me

[Chorus]
And she says (Don't worry baby)
"Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out alright"
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out alright
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh

[Chorus]
Ooooooo woooo oooo
Dow dow
Ooooooo oooo oooo
Dow dow
Ooooo
Ahhhhh ahhhhh
Ooo

[Verse]
We're always first to hit the lot
And wave to the man in blue now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run de)
It's still so early in the morning
The grass is all covered with dew now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run)
She's turning on the radio dial
We can sit a listen for awhile
She looks so great in the morning
She doesn't even have to try now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run de)
It's not my metal flake paint that
The guys are digging when they pass by now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run)
Outside it could storm
But we'll still keep warm
All the kids are splitting to their lockers
But we're still making out in the car now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run de)
Just one long kiss and we'll be gone
'Cause two minutes all there are now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run)
Here comes the news
There's no time to lose

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Sitting in my car outside your house
(Sitting in my car outside your house)
Remember when you spilled coke all over you blouse
T-shirts, cut-offs, and a pair of thongs
(T-shirts, cut-offs, and a pair of thongs)
We've been having fun all summer long
(All summer long you've been with me)
I can't see enough of you
(All summer long we've both been free)

[Chorus]
Won't be long until summer time is through
(Summer time is through)
Not for us now

[Verse 2]
Miniature golf and Hondas in the hills
(Miniature golf and Hondas in the hills)
When we rode the horse we got some thrills
Every now and then we hear our song
(Every now and then we hear our song)
We've been having fun all summer long

[Chorus]
Won't be long until summer time is through
(Summer time is through)
Not for us now

[Outro]
Every now and then we hear our song
(Every now and then we hear our song)
We've been having fun all summer long
We've been having fun all summer long
(We've been having fun all summer long)
We've been having fun all summer long
(We've been having fun all summer long)
We've been having fun all summer long

[Verse 1]
What good is the dawn
That grows into day
The sunset at night
Or living this way

[Chorus]
For I have the warmth of the sun
(Warmth of the sun)
Within me at night
(Within me at night)

[Verse 2]
The love of my life
She left me one day
I cried when she said
"I don't feel the same way"

[Chorus]
Still I have the warmth of the sun
(Warmth of the sun)
Within me tonight
(Within me tonight)

[Verse 3]
I'll dream of her arms
And though they're not real
Just like she's still there
The way that I feel

[Chorus]
My love's like the warmth of the sun
(Warmth of the sun)
It won't ever die
(It won't ever die)

[Verse 1]
Check out the chick with the new dress on
(Wearing a shift and it looks real fine)
They call it a shift and it comes on strong
(Wearing a shift and it looks real fine)
When she's got it on, well she can't do no wrong
(Wearing a shift, wearing a shift)
You may think a dress can't do very much
(Wearing a shift really turns me on)
With the slit up the side, you can't resist that touch
(Wearing a shift really turns me on)
It's tighter than a moo-moo and it's just too much

[Bridge]
(Wearing a shift, wearing a shift)
(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)
(Can't go wrong now) (go wrong now)
(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)
(Turns me on now) (turns me on now)

[Outro]
Get your girl a shift and she'll look real fine
(Wearing a shift and it's just too much)
It fits like a glove and drives you out of your mind
(Wearing a shift and it's just too much)
She'll ball it with her shift on and we'll have a good time
(Wearing a shift, wearing a shift)
(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)

[repeat until fade]

[Verse 1]
We know they're right when they say we're not ready
But all we care is how we feel right now
We'll go ahead just the same
Prepare to take the blame

[Chorus]
We'll run away and get married anyhow

[Verse 2]
They warned us that we can't live on love forever
But we just tell them we'll get by somehow
Our problems will be greater
We'll worry about them later

[Chorus]
We'll run away and get married anyhow

[Verse 3]
If other kids went through it
Then I know we can do it
If our love is that much stronger
It will last that much longer
It wasn't too long ago when our folks were
Were going through the same thing we are now
But one thing they're forgetting
A thing they're not regretting

[Outro]
They ran away and got married anyhow
(Ran away and got married)
Anyhow
(Ran away and got married)
They ran away and got married anyhow

[Verse 1]
Little Richard sang it and Dick Clark brought it to life
Danny and the Juniors hit a groove, stuck as sharp as a knife

[Chorus]
Well now do you remember all the guys that gave us rock and roll

[Verse 2]
Chuck Berry's got to be the greatest thing that's come along
(Hum diddy waddy, hum diddy wadda)
He made the guitar beats and wrote the all-time greatest song
(Hum diddy waddy, hum diddy wadda)

[Chorus]
Well now do you remember all the guys that gave us rock and roll
(Hum diddy waddy doo)

[Verse 3]
Elvis Presley is the king
He's the giant of the day
Paved the way for the rock and roll stars
Yeah the critics kept a knocking
But the stars kept a rocking
And the chopping didn't get very far
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
Nothing's really moving until the saxophone's ready to blow
(Do you remember, do you remember)
And the beat's not jumping until the drummer says he's ready to go
(Do you remember, do you remember)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Let's hear the high voice wail (oooooooooo)
And hear the voice down low (wah-ah ah-ah)
Let's hear the background
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
They gave us rock and roll
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
They gave us rock and roll
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
They gave us rock and roll

[Chorus]
Spirit of America
Spirit of America
Spirit of America

[Verse 1]
The Bonneville salt flats had seen some strange things
But the strangest thing yet was a jet without wings
Once as a jet, it played in the stars
But now on the ground it's the king of our cars

[Chorus]
Spirit of America
Spirit of America
Spirit of America
Spirit of America

[Verse 2]
An airplane, an auto, now famous worldwide
The Spirit of America, the name on the side
The man who would drive her, Craig Breed love by name
A daring young man played a dangerous game

[Chorus]
Spirit of America
Spirit of America
Spirit of America
Spirit of America

[Verse 3]
With a J-47, a jet for his power
Craig Breed love had averaged four-o-seven per hour
Both man and machine had given fair warn
They'd set a new record on that warm August morn

[Chorus]
Spirit of America
Spirit of America
Spirit of America
Spirit of America

[Verse 1]
Wendy, Wendy what went wrong
Oh so wrong
We went together for so long
I never thought a guy could cry
Until you made it with another guy

[Chorus]
Oh Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurt so
