[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Yo uh-huh
Yessir
Turn everything up some more
The drums you know, the music and shit
(Holla back) I'm goin for it now
(Holla back) yessir
(Holla back) hey yo

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
In the heart of a re-up, it's somethin' like a g-up
M-C-A fingering that b-up or that c-up
Fiends creep up with their flesh lookin beat up
And my tennis ball is stuffed with enough work to fill a tea cup
He opened up his jacket, I opened up my packet
He pulled out his money, I'm pullin' out that honey
He stuff it in his stem soon as he took it from me
Yellow teeth chapped lips and his nose is runny
He lit that shit, he hit that quick
As if I was high I asked him where them bricks at, shit
He smiled as if he was payin' homage
He said in the back of the apartment
Where they be selling ganja
But beware of the AK held by Haitian Thomas
Son gotta keep him high in them bottoms or some old pajamas
I said shit ma nigga take another hit
We ran up in that crib with them Uzis and them Sigs
Give up the work or we tyin' up the kids
Did I get that work? what you think, yes I did
I didn't, actually that wasn't true
But if you aspire to hustle that's a
How-to to you

[Hook: Pharrell Williams & Lauren London]
This that shit make you wanna hustle
Carry square guns shootin' metal wit muffles
Trunk full of cash wit a couple of duffles
So we can sip wine and eat a bundle of truffles
We gonna show you how to hustle (Holla back)
So you can style on these niggas (Holla back)
So you can style on these niggas (Ya, follow that)
So you can style on these niggas (Well, follow this)

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Its incredible how I etch my plans out
To be physically subtle and financially stand out
You should see me stick the baguettes on my hands out
And literally carve a structure so no one can touch ya
Teenage girls'll love ya and models wanna fuck ya
Ice cream ya way on to somebody's magazine cover
So much money that the lid threatens eruption
And the bank says you don't
Have to call like you're Usher
And I ain't kill or sell drugs to nobody
But I know niggas that kill and stretch work like pilates
Nigga the crack house was literally right beside me
When them fiends hit that shit they kick just like karate
We named one Bruce lie, one slim Kelly
Who issued too much quicker than luis rank and m belly
Yeah ,I escaped but there's nothing you can tell me
Cause thought I paperchase my memories won't fail me

[Hook: Pharrell Williams & Lauren London]
This that shit make you wanna hustle
Carry squirt guns shootin' metal wit muffles
Trunk full of cash wit a couple of duffles
So we can sip wine and eat a bundle of truffles
We gonna show you how to hustle (Holla back)
So you can style on these niggas (Holla back)
So you can style on these niggas (Ya, follow that)
So you can style on these niggas (Well, follow this)

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
In the hood wake up to the hammer noise
Sound like the work of my jerks the swagger boys
Pull up in them eyes wide open
Stack of toys
If your girl want to leave with us that's her choice
The feelin throbbin' I got it and poppin' phenomenon
Nigga signed a million dollar check wit his pajamas on
Film it like a porno no need to re-word it
Nigga the enzo jus came and I ain't have to jerk it
Yeah niggas you heard it the perversion of stars
I guess if I go in my garage it'd be a ménage
Niggas can't hate on this like summer in '84
Knee highs and potato chips
New cript and Florida were the soul core corridors
Yes them babies mine, fuck I need to go on Maury for
Rewire my brain, aspire to attain
Tell Jacoblight on the platinum keep the fire in the chain
Yikes I mean ice on the motherfucker gleam
I guess if my ice is fire it leave you niggas stinged
See there's you, there's me, and there's between
If you remove the between you see I achievin' you dreams

[Hook: Pharrell Williams & Lauren London]
This that shit make you wanna hustle
Carry square guns shootin' metal wit muffles

[Intro]
Yes yes sir
Little message

[Verse 1]
He thinks combustible therefore his spits' explosive
Reverse osmosis landed him close with
Them unfuckable Mrs. Glamour ain't so glitz
His checks unsmudgeable the nigga is so rich
Forget magazines cop his album from go-gets
$2500 bapes of ostrich all that double R talk
Shut the fuck up it's all shit
Where's your sunroof homie you rocking the old shit
400 years later and we still in chains
And it ain't just in your brain nigga look at me man
You could put your house up and still kill you out your range
I accesorize in multi million dollar things
While my niggas generated where they still holla cane
Still holla bang still holla slang
And when it happen dude all I can do is get in my car
And get it cracking dude and I'll be laughing too
Me and this black girl that listen to Gwen Stefani
Prosciutto mozzarella vinegar at Chip Brianis
Her girl when she want to knows if I had her
But that don't matter bitch I got swagger

[Hook]
Swagger swagger international
Swagger swagger international
Swagger swagger international
Swagger swagger international

[Verse 2]
Aye yo you niggas pretenders you ain't big spenders
Narcissists full of shit and pretentious
You have no purpose so that means that you're pointless
She wants to smoke but your stupid shit is jointless
Okay bluntless she's walking away now your bitch is cuntless
Trust me you don't want this
Cause I could read you and your type of people
No one wants to be you cause all the bitches leave you
Me I get rid of them cause I don't wanna get at them
You finger fuck them and you think that you did something
Yeah I know her and I only had to fuck something
We walking back in the room and your face like "Did I miss something"
Sold most of my cars I couldn't make sense to the fact
That once I got that thing I wanted to ride in the back
I'm not trying to say that driving that is whack
But two seats that's impossible now where is riding that
The Rolexes got a shining grill with the diamonds here
So the light can play Tetris
Don't say my chain is sick say it's infectious
Fuck bringing Neosporin when the hero is touring
The chains chilling like it's below zero snoring
The poochie bucket the Louie luggage
The scarf is bunny my spirit's so sunny
Niggas call them out cause my thoughts turn to money, the...

[Hook]

I try to be strategic like a warrior
Man the young warrior shit is what you know me for
My mind's a rhapsody my heart is like an overture
None before me none after I'm the only for sure
Man you nothing like me you want to call me for sure
I sell suggestive lifestyle you sell homie couture
Ha ha never a runway for my clothing line
Strictly PJ runways occasional ocean line
In my aid to Bahamas and the coast is fine
I let the wind hit my watch I had to blow some time
See my ears rock n roll my money's no sublime
From these sherbet ice creams with a dose of lime
I'm strictly Shirley Temple Nigo wants to toast with wine
Cheers Fuck it can't let you niggas gross my mind
With your low ambition and no damn vision
Black and white ideas with no precision
My mind is like a diamond producing colors like a prism
With no knowledge or understanding
How the fuck you gonna reach wisdom
My mind is reasoning outlast ink and pens
If you niggas think you know me niggas think again, the...

[Hook]

[Intro: Pusha T + Pharrell]
Fly shit, uh
Turn me up some more
Pusha, Skateboard P
Give it to 'em

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
You're that girl
Who thinks the world
Is something beautiful
And that's all baby
But you're lookin' far abroad
Wishing upon the wrong star
'Cause you don't know
That's not how it goes
So, I can't explain
Why things remain the same and others change
He made it that way
But the perplexities of the world
Leaves more oysters and pearls
And I don't know
That's just the way it goes
But I know you can

[Hook]
Stay with me
Lock the door
Take the key
I am yours
Feel it babe
It is yours
It is yours
It is yours (Hey!)

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Don't take the time
To relax your mind
So unusual, oh baby
Put your priorities on the shelf
But your emotions and your health just don't go
Your body says no, so
I can't conceive
That leaves would grow on trees
And blow with the breeze
And come back next spring
But the perplexities of life
Brings more days that form new skies
So who's to know
I suppose that you could

[Hook]
Stay with me
Lock the door
Take the key
I am yours
Feel it babe
It is yours
It is yours
It is yours (Oh!)

[Bridge: Pharrell + (Pusha T)]
Up, up and away
I'll be the wind that blows your sail
The pixie dust of Tinker Bell
Up, up and away (P, I think we got one, baby)
I'll be the wind beneath your wings (Pusha)
The vivid colors of your dreams, oh (Let's go)

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Baby, let's pour it up
Lift them Gallardo doors up
Paris for them Louis as soon as the tour's up
The million dollar frames is his and her the same
I took it on the chin when I heard about the lame
And no, I ain't here to try to rewrite your past (Nah)
That don't measure up to the nights that we laughed
When considering love, you take the good with the bad
I've been disappointed by every bitch I ever had
Either she was dick crazy or cheddar mad
Shame what they did for them jeans and them leather bags
Reverse it, I want perfect
That was half the reason I bought half them purses
That chapter is over, it was worth it
My new angel surfaced
She ain't have to rehearse it
My baby's real
That's why I put the chill on her
So good make a nigga wanna kneel on her—not yet

[Hook]
Stay with me
Lock the door
Take the key
I am yours
Feel the BAPE
It is yours
It is yours
It is yours (Oh!)

[Intro: Pharrell]
Yeah, yep
Spit my gum out right now, yeah
What up, world?
Got my inspiration in the studio with me tonight, feelin' good
Got a lot to smile about
Talk to y'all niggas
Yessir, hey

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
My best friend say I'm bottled up, I need a fuckin' therapist
But I can't think of nobody I wanna share this with
Why should I open up on somebody else's carelessness?
Pop, there goes the top, nigga, so here it is
Mama workin' all day, Daddy out in the streets
Imagine ten years old, full of doubt and defeat
Growing up around criminals, with clout and deceit
My grandma Loucelle used to tell me, "You about what you weep"
She used to help me with my homework, addition, subtraction
Added faith to my life and doubt got subtracted
Wanna skip your mind from crying? Better learn something, son
You be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums?
Look, ooh, you see me, Ma, they wish they could be me, Ma
As I got better, her body was eaten by leukaemia
Seventh grade, it was cursed and sad
But the gift within it was when I first met Chad
But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed
'Cause Grandma Loucelle died on 12th 19th
I can't help but wonder what kind of black cloud I was under
'Cause fifteen years later, the other died that summer
Bummer

[Chorus: Pharrell]
My best friend told me (What?)
You be actin' tough, that's fine (Uh-huh)
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
Let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes
Until you in conversations, it comes out in a line
So let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
Let it out, P (What?) My nigga, let it out

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Ayo, 1021 Atlantis Drive, nigga was action packed
That's Atlantis Apartments, we live in half the back
That's where the 12-year-olds there, they be flashing crack
And when they shoot you, nigga, they ain't tryna pass it back
Ayo, Didi, Fleet and Marvian, can you imagine that?
The place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat
But I escaped 'cause I chased, what made me passionate
Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps
So many niggas will rise, so many them niggas try
So many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied
So many them same niggas, man, they moms eyes cry
So, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride
Well, let me tell you niggas something, I'm so glad you alive
Long as you got a breath, a pulse, nigga strive
Divine intervention this is, I heard a voice, nigga, listen to this

[Chorus: Pharrell]
My best friend told me (What?)
You be actin' tough, that's fine (Uh-huh)
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
Let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes (Uh-huh)
Until you in conversations, it comes out in a line
So let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
Let it out, P (What?) My nigga, let it out (Okay)

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
Jesus will arrange it, but Jesus won't change it
Hold yourself responsible, on yourself, you blame it
You mad, nigga don't articulate in Sans Script
I.E. we best friends, speak best friend language
I'm a happy nigga, you can't approach me in anguish
Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless?
Can't be mad at the world 'cause you and your girl ain't famous
'Cause you both on Bape, BBC and chain-less
Also you're Range-less, therefore switch lane-less
Know you brain-less dangerous cause you pull out the stainless
All of a sudden you smart, now you do something heinous
First time you get caught, now your ass is famous
No longer chain-less, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look
Your girl with ya man sellin' lane-less, stop
Nigga, rewind and reverse slides three times
Reassess your thinking and trust me, it'll be fine
First, picture your goal, and repeat, "It'll be mine"
Or fuck it, nigga, just keep imagine killin' me, fine
Now you scrunching your face, tryna ace attainment
When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, nigga
Success is tangible, don't wait for fame
I thought you would receive it better if I ain't say your name
You unsure of yourself, sit still and think
Review those actions if it fit, put your name in the blank

[Chorus: Pharrell]
My best friend told me (What?)
You be actin' tough, that's fine (Uh-huh)
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
Let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes (Uh-huh)
Until you in conversations, it comes out in a line
So let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
Let it out, P (What?) My nigga, let it out (Okay)

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
We've just been laughing
Chattin' but nothing's happened
Cause I promise I'll be gentle
I know your mind is travelling
I can tell you want some
I know you wanna come in my arms (my arms)

[Hook]
Take it off now girl, take it off

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
You breathe while your laughing
Smiling at what just happened

You wanna be wild (wanna be wild)
You don't wanna be tamed (don't wanna be tamed)
Even though you just arrived, (just arrived)
You wanna come again (you wanna come again)

[Hook]
Take it off now girl, take it off

Hee's baaacckk!!
To rip on this  track, I'll rip any broad
I don't care, white or black!
Hee's baaacckk!
If Pit's on the job, then there's no need to worry
Dog just hurry up and wait
Cuz I ain't Going no where anytime soon
Sick what these rappers wanna be?
That's me, times 2
Now...
Get ready for me to take over this game
I'm cutting the flow, like I'm cutting the cane
Things will never be the same
Pause...
There's a lick for 50 bricks
Now pause...
And think about it
Then pause...
Is it really worth it?
Then pause... pause...
FUCK YEAH!!!
I'm ready to go, jump in the ride
Get the mask, get the gloves
Cut off the lights, pop the gat
Run inside, fire'em up or tie'em up
But don't forget to pick up the prize
And upgrade the ??
If they don't give up the pies
Now...
I would hate to have to calm these boys down
Cuz to be honest I can't, so Pal...
Why don't you just give us the keys and pounds
Now Guess What He Said?

[Chorus 2x]
Y'all want my spot?! Hurry up and wait!
Y'all want me to stop?! Hurry up and wait!
Y'all want me shot?! Hurry up and wait!
Y'all hurry up and wait! y'all hurry up and wait!

I've been brought up
By street cats who didn't get caught up
Like that New Jack Nino Brown at the Carter
I'm the new Tony Montana, only I'm just a
Little bit smarter!

[Intro: Pharrell]
(You never, you never listen to me)
(I'm just, I just wanna tell you, something)
Mama, help, I fell in love with a young girl
(That's true, so true)
(You're the only girl I love too, but)
My heart was soakin' and got broken in a young world
(So true, so true, listen)

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
I wasn't trying to lead her on
See I didn't want to be alone
But when she smiles she brought me home
So I brought her home
Its not that the feeling of love is gone
Can't expect a college girl to be grown
I can't give a fuck what so and so says
Crushes hurt both ways

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell]
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Mama, help, I fell in love with a young girl
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do
My heart was soakin' and got broken in a young world
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Young girl, so in love with you

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
The single girls are out tonight (Hey, Pharrell)
But you have my word, my heart, my life (Hey, baby)
And I'm not looking around (I'm not looking around)
So why you lookin' down? (What you lookin down for?)
I fucked up a long time ago
See, I should have never let you know
See, I could give a fuck what tabloids say (As the People Magazine)
And crushes hurt both ways

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell]
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do

[Chorus: Pharrell & Jay-Z]
Mama, help, I fell in love with a young girl
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do
My heart was soakin' and got broken in a young world (Hov)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? (Hov)
Young girl, so in love with you

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Hov got a young girl, Hov got a young girl (Got a young girl)
Still not quite twenty one
So high strung, such a vibrant thing
I introduce myself, "Hi, Miss Thing"
You're nineteen? (Woo)
No, you're lightning in a bottle, I give you a ring tomorrow
The scene that follows
Screams of horror
Classic Stephen King novel
Mama don't think you should take someone so advanced in romance, you should just wait
Papa don't preach, Hov don't bite
Hov been through it, I might mold your life
'Cause I'ma show you right
Proper etiquette, how to hold your knife
Keep it competitive with Oprah's ice
Be like Janet, take control of your life

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell & Jay-Z]
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? (Young girl)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? (Young girl)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? (Young girl)
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do (Young girl)

[Chorus: Pharrell & Jay-Z]
Mama, help, I fell in love with a young girl
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
(Too young, a little too young)
Young girl, so in love with you
(Just a little too young)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
(She's a—) (Too young, a little too young)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
(She's a—) (Just a little too young)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
(She's a—) (Too young, a little too young)
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
(She's a—) (Just a little too young)
My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Young girl, so in love with you

[Outro: Pharrell]
This is where it all begins, baby

[Intro - Slim Thug & (Pharrell)]
Say P, man the other day foolin' at the club
Mane with this broad or whateva
I walk in see her talkin' talkin' to some dude or whatever
You know what I'm sayin, so I holla at her I say
"Ay man check this out, man I seen you over there
Hollin at ol' boy, I ain't hatin on that
You know what I'm sayin, but I got a friend coming through too
So when you see her, don't trip, you know what I'm sayin
Keep it playa man, you know what I'm sayin"
So my broad show up or whatever man (word)
This girl wanna try and take a swing at her man (turn that shit up)
(That ain't right, this my man favorite record right here)
(Haha, yessir, beat that shit)

[Verse 1 - Pharrell]
Before you say, it's cheaper to keep her, we consider and read her
Man she might be the type that won't pea you the feeder
She wants a little cheeba, a little margarita
Man them draws coming off, when she see the two-seater
So put your Porsche up, get your divorce up
I'm sure she'll sign it when she see me pull my doors up
Man them mansions on the water, motherfuck a hill
She threw her heels in the ocean, so she stuck to chill
The truck is steel, hoping somethin' between ya
And now she laughing how she took your ass to the cleaners
Man I'm on your side, not trying to inconvenience ya
Just now we get them million keys, and them plastic Ninas
So keep it playa dog, don't make me say it all
Do something drastic, know that plastic's everywhere dog
If it ain't music, all this money, I don't play at all
And she ain't either, so that mean she doesn't weigh it all

[Hook]
Now we can both post sip, and keep it playa mayne (yup)
Now we can both pull the misses, keep it playa mayne (uh huh)
Or we could both right our wrists, and keep it playa mayne (yup)
Or you could scram cock sucker, if you'se a hater mayne
I keep them ladies going
Uh, uh, uh (uh)
Uh, uh, uh (haha)
Uh, uh, uh (yup)
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 2 - Slim Thug]
I'm a grown man, Thug ain't the one that play no games witchu
Thug the one to call, to come get off the chain witchu
And hang witchu, when you full of Patrón
And oh yeah, brain wanna get two partners alone (that's right)
Because I'm only 25, and still going live
Got the estate by the pool, by the lake outside
I wake up, and gotta pick which car I'mma drive
The Double R 760, or the 645
I'm, having things mayne check out the chain
Money ain't never been a thing, you see the watch and the ring
Rocks the nicest, never seen none like this
I'm a boss, I don't ask what it cost, my life priceless
Baby girl you might just, get the share this shine
Long as you not selfish, and learn to share some times
And of course I'm still yours, and you're still mine
But you can't be a hater mayne, gotta keep it playa mayne

[Hook]
Now we can both post sip, and keep it playa mayne (yup)
Now we can both pull the misses, keep it playa mayne (uh huh)
Or we could both right our wrists, and keep it playa mayne (yup)
Or you could scram cock sucker, if you'se a hater mayne
I keep them ladies going
Uh, uh, uh (uh)
Uh, uh, uh (haha)
Uh, uh, uh (yup)
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 3 - Pharrell]
You don't stop, they say J.Lo just to show her ass and all
Knowing the worst thing could happen, is a nigga could palm
Now my agent saying the only way that he could be calm
I put a hundred mil' on each song, like my name was LeBron
What, not the ice, my beats is worth more
The track is like a whole damn Jacob Store
See niggas hate you more, when they take they broad
But his girl looked at my hands, seen a "Matrix" door
Dudes is foolish, the hues is the truest
I mean the smurfs look green, the rocks are so bluish
You can't out bling me, or BBC jean me
You ain't got no vibe, you can go and ask Me-Me
I think and relay it (uh), I blink and PJ it (uh)
You wanna make fast bucks, take this and e-Bay it
And all you Phantom owners know you can't stand me
Got one in Virgina, 'nother one in Miami, yessir

[Hook]
Now we can both post sip, and keep it playa mayne (yup)
Now we can both pull the misses, keep it playa mayne (uh huh)
Or we could both right our wrists, and keep it playa mayne (yup)
Or you could scram cock sucker, if you'se a hater mayne
I keep them ladies going
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh

[Intro]
Ah, my nigga you can do it too
(turn me up, turn me up)
You can do it too
My nigga you can do it too
You can do it too
You can do it too
(Just tellin you, ya know?)

[Verse 1]
Ay yo
Never in a million years I'll imagine I'll get my thrills
By listening to squeals of the PJ wheels
As we land, I duck down, I stick my head up
My dick is being sucked down by a bitch named What Now
I look in her eyes and her eyes are like an orange star
Look at the reflection of my foreign car, the R & R
I stick my feet out, you know the Bapes that's made of eel
You know the new shits with Nigo face right on the heel
I was in marching band, I was a skateboarder
Jesus made wine, I couldn't make water
Oxymoronic, I'm here to destroy all you hate hoarders
You niggas was cool in school, now you niggas take orders
I'm not dissin your job
But now you listen and nod
Some Outer Limits shit, I know this position is odd
Don't gasp for air
You can turn blue
Look, excel nigga
Trust me you can do it too

[Hook]
You can do it too young love
You can do it too young love
Just watch what you do young love
And watch whose in your crew young love
It don't matter if you do drugs
And even if you threw slugs
You can do it too young love
I did you can do it too

[Verse 2]
I know niggas is like, there's no returning when I
Bought that white 5-50
So white that the coke heads just might try sniff
Or ordered the Phantom coupe, that's smoke pipe grey
And the interior was like crack rock beige
At least that's what it looked like when it was on that page
I combed the whole brochure and it did not say, oh well
Life's a bitch, but not too extreme
Life's got a fat ass
Trust me, I'mma fuck full steam
I make the world cream and scream while I'm gettin my cream
I'm Coming To America call me Prince Akeem, yessir
It's kinda weird, cause this our dream
Kinda prophetic, you get it
Cause this I've seen
These type of visions, since I was teen
I told my teacher what I saw, she said I missed Visine
Laughed with the class, but with the slightest clue
You be buying my shit, and I be rappin' to you
But you can do it too

[Hook]
You can do it too young love
You can do it too young love
Just watch what you do young love
And watch whose in your crew young love
It don't matter if you do drugs
And even if you threw slugs
You can do it too young love
I did you can do it too

[Verse 3]
I know you heard the story about the dude with the attitude
Pharrell he don't even know you but he mad at you
He got robbed and it seems he has accused
He's really frustrated and that it all he has is you
So, things propel and things excel
The next thing bang comes out the barrell
And my man they accused sittin' tight up in jail
Ironically close, my man Lou can hear him yell
I ain't do it but somebody dropped him flat
I felt the wind from it, that was God cocking back
I got a call from Virginia grandma went back
The line was fluctuated but it just now went flat
See her body went down and her soul went up
She sent angels around me so evil could not touch
I don't lie no more and I'm haunted when I fuck
Wealthy niggas with a conscience, yeah you know what's up
The wires across, and it's breeding a plague
The conscience is hungry, and it's eating away
Trying to make sense of it, but it's speedy in vain
Up all night with the books and you read till the day
But still ya high sadity cause you got a little paper
Push a cat in the corner, trust me it's the nature
Never underestimate the-things you do
Read Job verse 2, inhale the "oo", and go

[Hook]
You can do it too young love
You can do it too young love
Just watch what you do young love
And watch whose in your crew young love
It don't matter if you do drugs
And even if you threw slugs
You can do it too young love
I did you can do it too

[Outro: Jamie Cullum]
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky

Let me tell you story of my situation (fellas)
Let me, let me, let me, let me  tell you story of my situation
Let me, let me, let me, let me  tell you story of my situation (see you bobbin' ya head)
Let me, let me, let me, let me  tell you story of my situation (Rolls Royce Music man)

[Break: Maybe (Original)]
Hold it now 

[scratched]

[Intro]
This for all the... All the connoisseurs of fine rhyme you know?
I dug deep in the cellars of my mind for this
I love y'all niggas, I just wanna air some things out
Dear hip-hop, ya know?
Dear hip-hop
Dear hip-hop

[Verse 1]
I got a cult following, N.E.R.D. is far from pop, G
No radio, light spins since the video drop, see
I'm the tourbillon of this shit, like Mozart and Bach be
I'ma show you niggas what time it is, niggas watch me
My falsetto's been hot, like The Sopranos' five seasons
Alto beats, "Grindin'" soundin' like "Frontin'"? Niggas is reachin'
I pimped across the stage, nigga tipsy off that reason
Snatched that Grammy, when I joke I call it the G-Thing
Ask Robin Leach how many V-somethings in my fortress
Like Russell Crowe in Gladiator, so many fucking horses
Porsches, Maranello, that's white, I call it Ghost
Phantom named Nightmare, black scares people the most
I introduced BAPE to the world, 400, nigga, out fast
Favorite group, White Stripes, R. Kelly, Kanye, and OutKast
A R&B producer, I was sittin' on the shelf
A Ralph Laurenic nerd then Noreaga gave me help
But my samples wouldn't clear, and I couldn't rock a wig
And they didn't have pimp cups, and dancin' wasn't my gig
But shoulder brushin', blazers, and trucker hats I did
And the only niggas I ain't work with was 2Pac and B.I.G, haha

[Hook]
You and me
BAPE, Ice Cream and BBC (Yup)
Just because we skate down the road (Niggas)
Don't mean we can't slam Phantom doors (Bitches)
You and me
BAPE, Ice Cream and BBC
Just because we skate down the road (Love y'all, man)
Don't mean we can't slam Phantom doors (You have no idea)

[Verse 2]
Now errbody keep asking me about Kelis
She's dope with or without me, 'til I die, that's what I speak
I never run to the tabloids and run around here grinnin'
I'm a peaceful, Rolls Royce-drivin' black John Lennon
Psychedelic beats, medals on my soldier jacket
Fuckin' the baddest bitches in fashion, niggas, can you imagine?
Ma, why you even breathin? Why you even talkin'?
Put my big bang in your black hole, I'm Stephen Hawkings
If the mind is full of water, can you believe I'm walkin'
On your thoughts, trust me niggas, what I've achieved is awesome
Mind readers, you think you know me, proceed with caution
Ohup! Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind, you lost him
I cried when my grandma died, Bob said Jah saves
If Jah's short for Jesus, then I'll sing what Bob says
Oh, small diamonds are blasé blasé
Remember 20 karat solitaires can not be pavé
And while my heart has lots of scars hidden
My beats is star-ridden, givin' trucks and jeeps and cars rhythm
Accompanied by 40 bars spitting, not from the prospective of narciss-um
But as N.E.R.D. goes, I start pene-trating minds unlikely fitting
Ghetto girls and thugs liking the album guitar-driven, yup
Ghetto girls to girls from the valley
From niggas that skate to niggas that pump crack in they alleys
I'm the black Carl Sagan, Timothy Leary, John Lennon
Lookin for my Yoko, hoping my wife hears me
And maybe she'll have more Interscope and won't be a Virgin
Who bought my album, and who will prefer the regular version that goes

[Break: Maybe (Original) plays fast]
See, maybe (Haha)
There was something wrong (Hooo!)
And you were telling me no wrong
(What up black radio? Daddy loves you)
See, maybe (Ahhhhohhhhhhhhhh!)
The laugh's on me (Yeahhhh)
And life was telling me a joke (joke joke joke)

[Hook]
You and me
BAPE, Ice Cream and BBC
Just because we skate down the road (Mean what?)
Don't mean we can't slam Phantom doors (Nigga nigga)
You and me
BAPE, Ice Cream and BBC
Just because we skate down the road
Don't mean we can't slam Phantom doors (Nigga-nigga)

[Outro]
Love y'all
P.S.: Daddy loves you
Yours truly, N.E.R.D
Yup!

[Will Da~Real One]
A 1980 exodus of a hundred and twenty-five thousand dreams
A quest to find out what freedom really means at any cost
Boatloads of Cubans lost in a maze of red tape, and hate
Entered this country through the bottom of the United States
And straight, set up shop
As Arthur McDuffy was being beaten to death by four white cops
This world was about to face the music
Between El Mariel and the 1980 riots, we as minority Americans
Could no longer take our freedom for granted and misuse it
Because in case y'all haven't noticed
We've gone from the El Mariel BOATLIFT
To the Hurricane Katrina buslift with the same response
With America standing to help us with one hand on their hips
And the other one on her guns
Like 9/11 somehow made us all Americans
But it took a tragedy to make us all feel like we were one
You see the El Mariel boatlift, Hurricane Katrina
And the Oklahoma BOMBINGS, we all got something in common
And that's the desire to enjoy a freedom that cannot be rearranged by fear
To let nothing stand in the way of the freedom of those who chose to live here
So, TODAY, is 1980 again
And I'm that bus that crashed through the gates of the Peruvian embassy
Hope that when I spit this poem, the whole world will remember me
I'm screamin like Sincaid give us us us free, me, Pitbull, and this industry
Will Da~Real One, I'm out

[Intro: Pitbull]
Young Bo$$, Miss Trina, Pitbull
Let's show them how we keep down

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I party like a rockstar
Look like a movie star
Play like an all star
Fuck like a pornstar
Baby I'm a superstar
Always posted at the bar
Always with couple boss
Maybe I'm just that that raw
Dawg check your resume
I hit something everyday
Ask about me and dey say
That chico run MIA
Pitbull and Young Bo$$, that's fire
Go girl work it out 'til you tire
Just tryin' to pay your tuition - liar
My corner is like HBO's wire
So please don't play no games
And baby don't say no names
And we can do this one more again
Next time you can bring your friends

[Bridge: Pitbull & David Rush]
So get your friends
And I get my friends
And we can be friends
Do this every weekend
We can hit your place
We can hit my place
She's on my top 8
I bagged her off of myspace

[Chorus: Pitbull & David Rush]
Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl
Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl
Shake them dice and roll them
Shake them dice and roll them
When they ask you, "What's that dance?"
You say that's the hustle man

[Verse 2: David Rush]
Girl I wanna know your name
Girl who you be?
Don't care with who you came
As long as you leave wit' me
What's you sippin' on?
I buy you a drink
Get you one of them shiny things
Yer Girl pick pink
I see those Jimmy Choos
Those Vera Wangs
I luv the way you work
Girl do your thing
You see my stunna shades
I'm like a star
My clique is full of ballas
We at the bar

[Bridge: Pitbull & David Rush]
So get your friends
And I get my friends
And we can be friends
Do this every weekend
We can hit your place
We can hit my place
She's on my top 8
I bagged her off of myspace

[Chorus: Pitbull & David Rush]
Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl
Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl
Shake them dice and roll them
Shake them dice and roll them
When they ask you, "What's that dance?"
You say that's the hustle man

[Verse 3: Trina]
Diamond princess
I make them bust quick
Man I back it up
Like a Mack Truck
(heavy breathing)
Don't talk about it boy
Be about it boy
I got them girls boy
Turn out your girls boy
I'm talking freak nig
I'm like a freaky shit
Coz you're my freak

[Bridge: Pitbull & David Rush]
So get your friends
And I get my friends
And we can be friends
Do this every weekend
We can hit your place
We can hit my place
She's on my top 8
I bagged her off of myspace

[Chorus: Pitbull & David Rush]
Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl
Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl
Shake them dice and roll them
Shake them dice and roll them
When they ask you, "What's that dance?"
You say that's the hustle man

[Pitbull]
Drop that beat, it's the truth
You don't know what you have until you lose it

[Jason Derulo]
I've had all the women you could possibly
Imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the
Money in my life (in my life)
I've had my ups, my downs, I've paid my dues
Earned my stripes (earned my stripes)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)

[Pitbull]
All I know is the hustle and grind
And all you want is some quality time but
I can't give it to you due to the life that I chose
My heart is so cold to the point that my blood it froze
I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time
But then again time is money and I needs mine
There I go again being selfish
And here you go again in love and helpless
You mean the world to me baby, you know it's the truth
But I don't know who I love more, you or the booth
These are just some things I need to get off my chest
Sometimes I feel all I can give you is sex I'm sorry

[Jason Derulo]
I've had all the women you could possibly
Imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the
Money in my life (in my life)
I've had my ups, my downs, I've paid my dues
Earned my stripes (earned my stripes)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)

[Pitbull]
I ain't gon' lie baby, this life is addicting
The fame, the money, especially these bitches
I've been around it all, I've seen 'em ball
I've seen 'em fall, go broke and lose it all
That's why I work hard 365, 24/7 baby this my life
I breathe, I bleed, I eat, I sleep, I shit this
I got a bad stomach with these haters on my shit list
Baby, I know it's hard to understand
But it's out of my hands, baby this is Gods plan
I came, I saw, I conquered
I apologize but this game made me a monster I'm sorry

[Jason Derulo]
I've had all the women you could possibly
Imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the
Money in my life (in my life)
I've had my ups, my downs, I've paid my dues
Earned my stripes (earned my stripes)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)

[Jason Derulo & Pitbull]
In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done some
Right (you live and you learn girl)
In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done
Some right (This the struggle)
In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done some
Right (from nothing to something)
In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done
Some right (This all I know)

[Jason Derulo]
I've had all the women you could possibly
Imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the
Money in my life (in my life)
I've had my ups, my downs, I've paid my dues
Earned my stripes (earned my stripes)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)

Done some wrong and some right
Derulo, Pitbull, this how we do

[Jason Derulo]
I've had all the women you could possibly
Imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the
Money in my life (in my life)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)

[Amanda Diva]
These words are written in blood, on red and white lines
Rhymes to the beat of a war drum that cries
Like mothers whose sons were sent to fight
And widows whose spouses souls are all that keep them warm at night
Underneath spacious skies where stars look more like bulletholes
And the haze of the clouds more like shrouds
I swear I smell gunsmoke, when I inhale too deep
Cause cheap lies have caused the loss of priceless lives
Bush is duckin the truth while the few and the proud dodge landmines
Niggas is doin time for gettin caught with a dime
But he will never be indicted for his crimes against this nation
Impatient with waiting it's time we fall in line
And STOP, falling for the lies
The war ain't only in Iraq
It's time we fight back, for control of our minds

[Intro]
This my way of letting my city know that I'd ride for 'em
I'd cry for 'em, Bust 5 for 'em, And most of all fuckin die for em...

Hey, 305...till I die (5X)

[Hook: Lil'Jon] (x2)
Nigga I ride for my motherfuckin clique
I die for my motherfuckin clique
I bust heads with my motherfuckin clique
Talk shit, watch my shit go click

[Verse 1]
Man I've been on the grind
1 in the head, 16 in the nine, I'm extra man
The game is mine in due time
It's alright I'm patient man
I know how to play my position, I know how to play my part
I know how to play these bitches, I know how to play with they hearts
I've done some dumb things, but for the most I've played it smart
Who cares if you run things? Cause I'm as live as 106 & Park
This game is nothing but a pool of blood with a bunch of sharks
Only the strong survive; It's do or die get it right
That why I roll for my peoples
Cock back, go to war for my peoples
Break bread with my peoples
Man, I'll die for my peoples
Everybody knows it's the truth
That why they respect everything that I do, everywhere that I go
Every friend, every foe, every bitch, every ho
Man I sold it all
From the weed to the X, from the X to the blow
Mark my words, I'm next to blow
P to the I, I to the T, T to the B, B To the U, Double the L
Me, Ima sell like ice cream in hell
This for my peoples that's locked up in jail
Ima succeed, I'm never gon fail
Papo just watch me

[Hook: Lil'Jon]
Nigga I ride for my motherfuckin clique
I die for my motherfuckin clique
I bust heads with my motherfuckin clique
Talk shit, watch my shit go click

[Verse 2]
Man I'm watchin the game closely
Uncle Luke that man did coach me
He taught me the who, what, wheres and whys
How to cross T's, How to dot I's
Little did he know he created a monster
Pitbull nigga I'm that monster
D.B. them chicos is monsters
Lil' Jon that nigga's a monster
Everybody in the clique is well equipped
Ready for Pit to take over shit
This here is not a game, this here is our lives
We can't fuck this up, we gotta get it right
If you with us and you ready for war then lets ride
Lets show how we do in the south
Kick in they door, run in their house
Since them boys think they spit fire
Fuck it, put the gun in they mouth
Follow me now, all these bitches wanna swallow me now
All these niggas that I don't even know wanna holla at me now cause they wanna be down but fuck'em man
Me, I'mma turn it up a notch
To my hustlers be careful when they murder in the blocks
To my killas be careful when you burnin up the Glocks
Last thing you wanna be is runnin from the cops
Pit's gon take it from the bottom to the top
Haters can hate but it ain't gon stop
Everybody knows I'mma blow just listen to the flow
This chico got it on lock

[Hook: Lil'Jon]
Nigga I ride for my motherfuckin clique
I die for my motherfuckin clique
I bust heads with my motherfuckin clique
Talk shit, watch my shit go click

[Chorus]
Haters in the club (back up!)
Gold Diggers (back up!)
Broke niggas (back up!)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up!)

[Verse 1]
I'm in the cut in the club scopin' the scene
Cup half way full smokin' the green
She got her hand on my nuts—what does that mean?
Pointed at her freind and she said they'll tag team
Now who said dreams don't come true
It's like I'm dreamin' when I come through
I always find somethin' to run through
Speak into the mic, mami, mic check one two
Drunk in the club off the chain
But who gives as fuck? That's why I came
So pour it up and get down
Y'all have no choice but to listen to Pit now

[Chorus]
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up!)
It don't involve money then (back up!)
Dawg, get from me and (back up!)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up!)
Haters in the club (back up!)
Gold diggers (back up!)
Broke niggas (back up!)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up!)

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows Pit's got tight raps
When I'm in the club, DJs bring it back
With no questions asked
But the number one question is, "Does he got cash?"
Lil Jon's at the bar
While me and them Eastside Boys smoke out
Roll another one, no doubt
Get a couple hoes, roll out
Beef, you dont want none to go down
Dum diddy dum dum, my time's now
The city I'm from is covered with federals
That'll make your crew run run, your crew run run
It's next to come

[Chorus]
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up!)
It don't involve money then (back up!)
Dawg, get from me and (back up!)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up!)
Haters in the club (back up!)
Gold diggers (back up!)
Broke niggas (back up!)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up!)

[Verse 3]
I convince mami to creep on the DL
Even though my head spinnin' like some sprewells
Skip the details, it's the vodka
Bottom line that's testin' my patience like doctors
I'm not impressed by the cool shit
Or those chains or that ice or them cars, all that's bullshit
If that's what your lookin' for, keep lookin' ho
'Cause you got the wrong one bitch, I'll let you know
Mami's like, "Damn, that Cuban's shot out!"
Bitch I came to the club to wild out
If you came to act up

Dawg, get from me and (back up!)

If you don't want those things to click-clack
Take a few steps back because I'm playin fo' keeps
Go ahead keep playin with me and watch how I hit 'em in the head once again
For those who didn't believe in the kid y'all might as well be dead
Because what y'all thought couldn't be done, I did
I'm like Ray Charles dawg, I don't see none of y'all
I'm blind to the fact that half of y'all rap and I'm outrunnin y'all
When I hit 'em from the back I got them mami's saying dammit man

Pitbull's that underrated underdog killin' the underground
But that's just an understatement
It's hard to understand why I'm still underpaid
Just look in my blue eyes and see the hunger and pain, dammit man
But I don't plan it man because I do what I wanna do
Move what I wanna move
Y'all gonna see what I mean when I live out my dreams
I'mma tell you like Biggie told me, cash rules everything around me
I could give a fuck about what you say about me
Cause when those things get pulled out and squeezed they'll spray about three
Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, thats how it goes
Pit's gon spit it up, flip it up, rip it up, but I'm a pro
(Time out! Whooo)
Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, thats how it goes
Pit's gon spit it up, flip it up, rip it up, but I'm a pro
So all ya'll amateur ass niggas do-don't try this shit at home
Pit's co-co-comin, runnin, gunnin fo-for that throne

[Verse 1]
He went from a street kid doin regular street things
Straight to a street king
Takin over the city, block by block
Breaking down bricks, servin them rock by rock
He's everything a young gun wanna grow up to be
But if only these young guns could see
That murder, money, and lust is slowly murderin' us
Cuz the drug game ain't what it used to be
So look deeper when they paint you a picture
And try to sell you a dream
Cuz a lot of these drug lords turn to the feds, or turn into fiends
The crack game ain't everything it's cracked up to be
Now that same cat that was a, neighborhood celebrity
Is coppin rocks off the news kids on the block
At the same time tryna school them
But these hoodlums got heads as hard as the rocks that he's doin'
Hustlin's like a drug, it's got withdrawal symptoms
And if you know this, you won't skip fame
But you will gain wisdom, and wisdom gains power
Don't let your life go sour over power

[Chorus] (x2)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictive
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)

[Verse 2]
Not only did my father used to deal dope
He used to do the dope he used to deal, I'm juss' keepin it real
Now my father doesn't have shit
I don't have shit
We don't have shit
Cuz he didn't stack shit
With all the money he made, he didn't think for one second to put money away
That's cuz his mind was clouded with white thoughts
He's lucky that he didn't end up outlined in white chalk
The only thing I can say I gained from my father is
Knowledge of the street game
And I hope that y'all follow this
I can't say I haven't sold weed or cocaine
But I can say this
Money that comes quick, leaves quick
And y'all better believe this
Cuz this I've lived and witnessed
Catch a couple of charges
Now you're on the Lord's shit list
Now you're forced to do business
Until this business does you of course
You can die doin' dope, or dealin dope, either or
You choose the road that you need to follow
And you choose the people that you look up to as role models

[Chorus] (x2)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictive
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)

[Verse 3]
I know about hustler's
But I won't mention no names
Cuz they still got cases pending
And some are even, appealing, life in the cage
At least they made it past the first phase, they passed a certain age
Hustlin's like AIDS
At first your infected with HIV, and then it's full blown
Only difference is, instead of havin' no immune system
You become immune to the system of havin dough, by dealin blow
It's a fast life and even if you survive, your mind will die slow
Dirty money attracts, dirty things
And if you plan to deal dope I hope you're ready for the murder game
Cuz that's what it brings
I'm not a preacher, I'm not tryin' to preach, no
I'm not a teacher, I'm not tryna teach, but yet
Like a faucet, I'm tryin' to leak
Any foe, tell these young'ns and their kinfolk
And let em' know there's more to life than a G of coke
If you used to push weight then you relate
Cuz you already had a taste of, hustler's withdrawal

[Chorus] (x2)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictive
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)

[Intro]
We gon take it from the bottom (M-I-A-M-I to Houston!!)
H-town, Pitbull, Bun B...
My dogg Demi, keep ya head up, I got you, I promise!
All my chicos, I got you, I promise!
Miami, I got you, I promise!
I'mma take over this bitch, I promise!
So get ready mothafuckaz this is not a game!!

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm from the dirty dirty
Where a lot of these cats mix the weed with the coke and blow dirty
We're off the chain meng
Rap game, crack game
Cut it, cook it, chop it, record it, Album shop it, its all the same thang
Y'all look at these blue skies and think paradise
I look at these blue skies and think what a disguise
That's why its called the "Magic City", it's a treat to your eyes
Cross the bridge and it'll fuck with ya mind
Word of advice don't follow the streets, follow the signs
Cuz the last thing you wanna do is get lost
Cause it might just cost ya life
Y'all heard about the smash-&-grabs
So watch where you put the map on the dash
Cause they might end up clapping ya ass
Why you think the traffic lights, they blink at late night
They don't want you to stop cause the streets'll be filled wit red stripes
Like Jamaican beer, we fry 'em like bacon here
Yo life'll get taken here, I just thought I should make it clear, Yeah!!

[Hook] (x2)
Everything we do is dirty
We pull up in the drop, it's dirty
We pound that twat, dirty
Miami, we're dirty
Where they lace 'em, roll 'em, smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty
Guns they hold 'em, if they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Straight up outta Texas, the reckless, PA to be exact
Where the streets is cutthroat and fiends kill you for a G of crack
8 g's and cadillacs, chevys cut on the deltas
Might swang up on ya then hurt ya, nobody here gon help ya
2000 heltah skelta, talking bout families and killers
Vicious like silver-back guerillas see then peel ya
Niggas down here ain't tryna feel ya, see ya, hear ya, know ya
Serve ya, for ya or for ya (Feel it)
You pussy niggas been hatin on us for too long
So we finna prove you wrong, teach you hoes a new song (thats whats up)
Cuz the time is now (now), the place is here (here)
I could smell you scared nigga, I could taste your fear
Go make it clear and move the smoke outta yo eyes
So that when everything go down, it won't be no kind of surprise
And I got no time for yo lies (No time for lies!!), save 'em for peter
Just remember my name, I'm facing my heater (BITCH!), let's get it dirty!

[Hook] (x2)
Everything we do is dirty
We pull up in the drop, it's dirty
We pound that twat, dirty
Miami, we're dirty
Where they lace 'em, roll 'em, smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty
Guns they hold 'em, if they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
These boys from the bottom are obsessed with old school chevys
We call 'em verts and donks, some we call box chevys
Seven-duece, seven-trey, seven-four, seven-five
M-I-A-M-I till I die, 3-0-5
Candy paint and leather
They don't fuck wit nothing but dubs or better
Y'all call 'em street sweepers, we call 'em choppers
Cuz when the bullets spit they spin like helicopters
This city's filled with crooked coppers and crooked doctors
So how could these streets not be filled with crooked bitches
And niggas cocaine cooking brick flipping bitches trippin for figures
This Cuban has seen it, heard about it and lived it
That's why I spit it so vivid, you got it, I want it, you give it
This is for everybody in county, TGK, Metro West and Stockade
Doing time and if you got more than 365
And you're up the road rep MIA with pride, That's right!

[Hook] (x2)
Everything we do is dirty
We pull up in the drop, it's dirty
We pound that twat, dirty
Miami, we're dirty
Where they lace 'em, roll 'em, smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty
Guns they hold 'em, if they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty

[Intro: Oobie]
Everytime I see you, you're tryna' to take me home
And it makes me wonder, if we were to get it on
Would you take the time to touch me (touch me)
And take me into ecstasy yeah

[Hook: Oobie] (x2)
And I wonder if I take you home
Would you give me your love baby
Would you fulfill my fantasies
Or would you just admit wrong (would you just admit wrong)

[Verse 1]
Mami what's up wit ya' I just wanna get to know you better
Mami you tight work and I know I could get you wetter
I know you hear this a lot and I know you fed up
I know life is hard but you gotta keep ya' head up
You got the real game, check
Nail game, check
Hair game, check

That's why I can't wait to slip off your clothes
And lick you from head to toe
And give you some of this fire head till you explode
I wanna make you cum till you can't cum no more (ay, que rico)
I wanna see you curl up your toes (ay, que rico)
I wanna be the one to turn you out (ay, que rico)

And if you think you got some undefeated Tyson pussy
Bitch, I'm Buster Douglas!

[Hook: Oobie] (x2)
And I wonder if I take you home
Would you give me your love baby
Would you fulfill my fantasies
Or would you just admit wrong (would you just admit wrong)

[Verse 2]
I wanna be that man that you've never had before
I wanna be that man that'll put it on you fast and slow
I wanna be everything that you need baby and more
It would be no fun, if I told you everything that's in store
You've got those body parts, I just wanna explore
Como me vuelves loco, ven paca mi amor
You got my two boys, below my waistline, singing the blues
Tell me baby, honestly, what is it exactly you got to lose
Nothing at all, except climbin the walls (ay, que rico)
Don't lie you know you want some more (ay, que rico)
I'ma have you going crazy, praising the lord (ay, que rico)
I fuck like I rap; hardcore
I'm not a hot boy, I'm a hot man
That'll eat yo' ass, till you say god damn
Girl I love this
And if you think you got some undefeated Tyson pussy
Bitch I'm Buster Douglas!

[Hook: Oobie] (x4)
And I wonder if I take you home
Would you give me your love baby
Would you fulfill my fantasies
Or would you just admit wrong (would you just admit wrong)

[Outro: Oobie]
Babyyy ... babyyy .. oooo ..
Baby, you ain't gotta front if you want me
(Verse 1)
I'm not a thug
No, no, no, no
I'm not a gangsta
But I won't hesitate
To cock back, bust and point blank ya
Lord thank ya
I'm like that coke and weed
When it burn slow
Motherfucker I'll stank ya
Thats what I been
Taught on these streets
Ain't a god damn thing
That can't be bought on these streets
You want a life gone
That could be done
I'm like a nigga that did ten years
I'm eager to come
In the game
And do more than entertain
I'm loco in the brain
I'm that man with the methods
And I always bring the pain
They know me out here
All these bitches cocaine
Cause they blow me out here
I'm always out here
Y'all keep it real
But I keep it realer
Ima make my first mill off the deal
But I'm still gon be labeled
A cuban dope dealer
I'm just statin the facts
Motherfucker
(Chorus)
I hang with Puerto Ricans and
Haitian killers and
Cuban dope dealers
And these here my niggas
I ride for 'em
And god dammit I'd die for 'em (2X)

(Verse 2)
I got that really foul
Kung flo flow
I'm tryna get that really foul
Kung do doe
But you dont know me homie
So dont judge me
I rep the real Miami
Thats why the city loves me
The feds wanna bug me
Haters wanna slug me
I thank God
Cause he's the only thing thats above me
Y'all gon feel me till it hurts
Like
Losin your family over someone elses work
Or
Losin your case cause your co-defendent chirped
Or
Losin your brain cause them thangs done burped
It gets worse
This is for those
That'll never see the sun again
That'll pick through shit
For a balloon just to get it in
This is what was fed to him
This is why the game let him in here
Being me (me)
Being Pit (Pit)
Being It
Pitbull and Trick (Trick)
Both from the down south
Bitch we from the bottom, shit
(Chorus)

(Verse 3) - Trick Daddy
Lord your son got problems
And I know that you know
Cause you made this all possible
I live a dangerous ass life you know
So I thank you for your doctors and your hospitals
Thank God for the thugs too
He understand what these drugs do
He wanna see us all pull through
But only if niggas in the hood knew
Hell, prayin ain't wrong
But the sqeezin trigger
Could you go kill a innocent man
While these weak niggas grillin his end
They tellin ya dawg
Reducin they buisness
If I wasn't doin this
Then I'd go do him in
Cause if he was dead
He couldn't say he knew me then
For them niggas who lie
When they pull me in
Its in the same older cell that they threw me in
And I just pray for 'em
(Chorus)

[Intro]
One time for my freaks that know what to do when I skeet, Skeet!
That like it hard, rough, face down, ass up, yes sir!
That like their hair pulled when you beat from the back
That's what I like but mami can you really get down like that?

[Hook]
She's Freaky! She knows how to do what I like just right!
She's Freaky! She likes you to talk dirty all night!
She's Freaky! She likes her ass slapped when she rides!
She's Freaky! And a freak is what I need in my life!

[Verse 1]
One, little two, little three, little four
Five, little six, little seven, little hoes
Now calling all freaks that like blind folds
Fi, fi, fo! From go ahead and blow me now
I need a freak to hold me down!
I like the way you move and the way you do the things you do
Can I get at you?
I'm just telling you the truth
Maybe I'm too blunt, but why front!
You got it going on, just pull up your skirt
I know what to do with your thong!
I'ma pull it to the side and rub it down right
Let me know if I'm wrong!

[Hook] (x2)
She's Freaky! She knows how to do what I like just right!
She's Freaky! She likes you to talk dirty all night!
She's Freaky! She likes her ass slapped when she rides!
She's Freaky! And a freak is what I need in my life!

[Verse 2]
Look at those eyes, look at those thighs
I could tell by the way she act that she's freaky and knows how to keep secrets
And knows how to throw it back right!
Go ahead and hurt me... put it on me, put it on me
Throw it back like an old jersey
I want ya'll, I want ya'll
To get loose, get crunk
Get high, get drunk to the point of no return
Take one more shot and feel the burn, now work it out
Shake that thing 'til you can't no more now!
Work it out, take that thing d-down to the floor now!
Work it out, Shake that thing 'til you can't no more now!
Work it out, take that thing d-down to the floor now!

[Hook] (x2)
She's Freaky! She knows how to do what I like just right!

[Verse 1] (Pitbull)
Now that Little Jon has opened the door

No more warning ya'll
We tired of getting over looked
You want beef? then I hope you like it over-cooked
Oh and for that bread
It's whatever man
I'm fully prepared to pump lead
At any nigga that wanna bump heads
So bring it
But when them things go Rr-rr-rr-rringing
Someones gonna get hit
And that's a fact, not an opinion
I'm buiding my connects
And that there is dangerous
Didn't your mother teach you
Not to talk to strangers?
Then why are you in my ear talking all the shit
Just cause I'm cuban doesn't mean I flip bricks
So stop asking me the price on them thangs down here
Cause that one of them thangs that get chu killed 'round here
I don't care who you are, who you might be
But I'd rather die, then let an undercover bite me

[Hook]

[Verse 2] (Cubo)

Ears open, mouth shut

And if it pops off

Guns, I was taught proper
To cop and aim

Just let me know exactly what it is you trying to do

[Intro]
Pitbull slash Q-Bon
Yo
One time for Heavy Management, Baja Pantie
Them 6 - 7 Boys

[Verse 1]
Welcome to Miami
Where them boys used to touch tourists on a daily basis
Duck charges therefore hardly caught cases
This is a city full of culture and different races
Where all the mami's come fully equipped at young ages
With the hurricanes cause even the biggest hurricane couldn't phase us
We got a dome for the Heat that put y'all to sleep
And we carry hits from night till morning
Like Marino strong armin' the game
But I'm not retiring till I got a championship ring
Poppin champagne simple and plain
Check the map and look where we at
The bottom, simple as that
I'm bringing it back to the fore-front
Like Luke in the 2 Live Crew days
He's the one that's got these mami's going two ways
"Oye"
God bless Uncle Al but knowin him MIA was probably engraved
On the tombstone that stands over his grave to this day!

[Bridge 1]
HEY
So if your visitin our city and your sittin pretty on duce tres
Or duce fours watch where you park your whip
Cause they will leave it sittin' on bricks awfully quick
"Yeah this is for everbody in Miami"
"Put them 305's up"
"It's about to get ugly!"
"Que Vuelta"

[Hook]
Welcome to Miami where they Hustle hey
And they ride duce tres like everyday
Palm trees blue skies ganstas and goons
Where parties dont stop till the next afternoon

Welcome to Miami where they Hustle hey
And they ride duce tres like everyday
Palm trees blue skies ganstas and goons
Where parties dont stop till the next afternoon

[Verse 2]
Westchester and West Miami
Where the heavy-weighters move to raise their families
South Miami always showed me love them boys from the Creek
Lee Park and THC knew me before PIT
South Miami Heights, Carib Villas
South Wood apartments the Square, Goulds, Naranga
Them boys throw dubs on Bangis
Kendall got them mamis that taste like candy
OT that's where you can catch Piccalo hollerin 4 LIFE
When I'm downtown I check out the shoe gallery
Cause Danny always looked out for me
Eddie from 24th Street barber shop, kept me out of trouble
I went from the waterboy to the quarterback in the huddle
Callin all the plays I live for, die for Dade
I ride for, lie for, cry for Dade
No if and or buts about it, I'm from Dade
Watch where you hang out in the Grove cause you'll go from
Havin a grand in hand to layin stiff on Grand Ave
I can't forget Liberty City and those notorious pork n beanss
And Scott Projects where nothing's clean
Miami's where we double the money
Cause of course we triple the beams

[Bridge 2]
If you live for die for this city
I want y'all to represent where your from and throw'em up. 3 0 5

[Hook]
Welcome to Miami where they Hustle hey
And they ride duce tres like everyday
Palm trees blue skies ganstas and goons
Where parties dont stop till the next afternoon

Welcome to Miami where they Hustle hey
And they ride duce tres like everyday
Palm trees blue skies ganstas and goons
Where parties dont stop till the next afternoon

[Verse 3]
Pitts that chico from the bottom
That's about to take over the rap game thats if they allow him
You know the city of Miami got the country spooked
Y'all got Uncle Sam, we got Uncle Luke
Where the poorest city, according to census report
Thatls cause they didn't count all the bricks that came through the port
Live by the code die by the code
So much cane done came thru this city
We named 40th street Bird Road
Who made Opa-Locka? Who knows
All I know is you don't wanna get caught up in the triangle
After dark trust me bro, trust me bro
Carol City stays Cheifen, Hialeah Mango-hill them chicos stay beefin
Alapatah A.K.A. Dominican town
Dique cause there's nothing but Dominicans now
And to them little Havana boys that hold me down
Bet that up, Wynwood put them up
To all the Haitians from Little Haiti that show me love
Sak Passe gracia dios ya llegue
Now I'm on my way to the top bringin the bottom with me
You got a problem with that
Then obviously you got a problem with me
Pitbull putting it down for our city. Miami

[Bridge 3]
Pitbull M.I.A.M.I
Time to put Miami on the map
We on the rise M.I.A.M.I. nigga what?

[Hook]
Welcome to Miami where they hustle hey
And they ride duce tres like everyday
Palm trees blue skies ganstas and goons
Where parties dont stop till the next afternoon

Welcome to Miami where they hustle hey
And they ride duce tres like everyday
Palm trees blue skies ganstas and goons
Where parties dont stop till the next afternoon

[Outro: Instrumental]
Oye, que vuelta come pinga?
Uh, uh, uh

Truth hurts
Ha, ha

[Hook]
Oye!
If you broke but you still pimpin', drinkin', smokin', then say
Oye, oye!

If you pimp in your steps and your ass is fat, then say

If you willin' to fight then we fuckin' tonight, then say
Oye, oye!
(Oye!)
Oye, oye, oye!

[Verse 1]
All I can see, all the mamis pull your thongs up and party with me
On the count of three, everybody claim where your from
One, two, three!
The Bottom, that's where I'm from, that's where I reside
That's what I represent till I die
Tuck your chains in, put your drinks down
And your sex up and get wild for the night
Pit Bull rock stikes move like a Lex truck
Mami you got the next stunt (Alright)
Piccalo in the V.I.P. whip, four fingers in the air
Hollerin' for life
I'm the chico that'll put it down for his people
Get my hands on any and everything
But I always keep my hands clean
Cuz Miami's full of dirty money and dirty things

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Mami look good from far, but when she got close
She was far from good, and I was like "oooofff"
I got the vodka, Cubo's got the cranberry juice
Now it's time to get looooooose!
Se consigue para lo marinero que tiene mas cadena que cuello
Por dinero y una panza que parece que ese comieron - le son entero
I see mami who messes with nothin' but big tymers
Who loves to get her "Roll On" (Roll on)
Askin' me if I could get my hands on some vitamin E
And I was like mami hold on
But she must've loved Pac because she was grabbing me, telling me
"Papi picture me rolling"
So I pictured it, and it would've been a sight for the blind to see
So I gave it to her for free

[Hook]
Oye!
If you broke but you still pimpin', drinkin', smokin', then say
Oye, oye!
If you ballin' buyin' bottles, then say
Oye mami!
If you pimp in your steps and your ass is fat, then say
(Oye papi!)
If you willin' to fight then we fuckin' tonight, then say
Oye, oye!
(Oye!)
Oye, oye, oye!

[Verse 3]
Verse three, I said it once and I'll say it again
I want all y'all to eat but first me
Get it? Got it? Good
It's good that you got it cuz I got no time to be misunderstood
I don't know if it's the liquor that's got me lit
But damn, mami's thicker than thick
If you like coke roll a dollar, snort it up
If you like weed then you know the routine
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke that shit
Puff puff then pass that shit
Mami, mami! Shake ya ass, but watch yourself
Cuz - messin' with me, you might end up in a movie
Literally watchin' yourself, ha
Starrin' yo boo, in the hit movie called Amtrack
Choo-chooooo!

[Hook]
Oye!
If you broke but you still pimpin', drinkin', smokin', then say
Oye, oye!
If you ballin' buyin' bottles, then say
Oye mami!
If you pimp in your steps and your ass is fat, then say

If you willin' to fight then we fuckin' tonight, then say
Oye, oye!

Sweet and she don't talk back, tell your girl to hook it up
If she's looking for that real love, tell your girl to hook it up (ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh)
If she look like her, act like her, holla at me, hook it up

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Homie you was right, yeah your girl, she's a dime piece

The way she look I'd do the same, spend that time, play that game
Like to say if I'd lock that up, if I was you I'd knock that up
Open the door for her, man, pull out her chair
She may not know it but that's wifey right there
Worth it spending that money, looking fresh as a breeze
A sexy good girl, pretty and as sweet as can be
You could take her straight home to momma, even to meet your pastor
She don't come with no drama, damn you lucky bastard, OHH!

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
If she got a friend, homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a cousin, homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a sister, homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she look like her, act like her, holla at me, hook it up
If she's sexy like that, tell your girl to hook it up
Sweet and she don't talk back, tell your girl to hook it up
If she's looking for that real love, tell your girl to hook it up (ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh)
If she look like her, act like her, holla at me, hook it up

[Break: Huey]
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh
Kells, I got ya homie
It's your boy, Huey, yeah

[Verse 2: Huey]
Kells, I see you pimpin' in the club with the baddest chick
If she got a partner, tell her she should get with this
A well known money maker, H-U-E-Y
You need a man to give some real love you know that playa be I
The type that'll take her out the hood
Make sure her hair and her nails look good
500 Benz, you can break a lil' wood
If she was my girl I'ma do what I could
As long as you understand it's 50-50, you do for me, I do for you
You shoot for me, then I'd shoot for you
You be sweet to me, and I'm sweet to you
You may think I'm lyin'
But it's the truth 'cause I ain't gotta lie to kick it
It's easy for me to be pimpin', but I'm gonna make you my mistress
To avoid the life lookin' rough, head and attitude all messed up
All ya gotta do is holla at Kells and tell him gon' hook it up

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
If she got a friend, homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a cousin, homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a sister, homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she look like her, act like her, holla at me, hook it up
If she's sexy like that, tell your girl to hook it up
Sweet and she don't talk back, tell your girl to hook it up
If she's looking for that real love, tell your girl to hook it up (ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh)
If she look like her, act like her, holla at me

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
If she like real playas and don't fuck with no haters
Wanna get with a real baller that's making that real paper
If she want a good life, shop, hop out fancy cars
Award shows, party, mingle with the stars
Long as she understand that I am her bunny man
And when it comes to selling out, she's my sold out crowd
And if she's not the type that got a lot of girlfriends
Tell her girlfriend, holla at her future boyfriend
Hook it up!

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
If she got a friend, homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a cousin, homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a sister, homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she look like her, act like her, holla at me, hook it up
If she's sexy like that, tell your girl to hook it up
Sweet and she don't talk back, tell your girl to hook it up
If she's looking for that real love, tell your girl to hook it up (ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh)
If she look like her, act like her, holla at me, hook it up

[Outro: R. Kelly]

And them steel toe boots gone stomp yo ass
One hundred some odd niggas ready to jump yo ass
STOMP yo ass way past the grass
Motherfuckers run up but they don't last

[Intro: Eddie Talking]
This is a service public announcement
It's goin' out to all the paper haters
Now sure sure sure your broke, sure sure sure your havin' problems
Food stamps didn't come on time and the lights have been cut off
But look here

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Here's a little somethin' about a nigga like me "What's that?"
I never should have been let out the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg, would like to say
That I'mma crazy mothafucker when I'm playin' with my A.K
Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out
Now I'm that mothafucker y'all read about
Smokin' you and your crew, takin' a life or two
You don't like how I'm livin, well fuck you
This is my gang, nigga, No Limit
My nigga C will fuck you up in a minute
With the pow pow, bang bang (*gun shots*) and you're dead
And then we stamp that Tank on your forehead
Every where we go they say "DAMN"
Them gangsters, they be fuckin' up the program
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no, we to busy sayin' yeaaaahhhhhh
About drinkin' straight out the seven bottle
Do I look like a mothafuckin' role model?
To a kid lookin' up to me
Shit, life ain't nothin' but weed and money
Shit, I'm that type of nigga that's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck cause I keep sellin'
Yo, what the fuck are the yellin?

[Hook: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
Niggas livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches want to buy it, cause they love that straight G shit

"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
Niggas livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches straight buyin' it, cause they love that straight G shit

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Homies all standin' around just hangin'
Some dope dealin, some gang bangin' "what up nigga?"
We decide to roll a week deep
Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, and before you know
I had my double pointin' at his window
He got scared and hit the gas "Damn"
Right then, I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin, I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to Snukes
Sweatin' all the bitches in the Daisy Dukes
We couldn't no play, from the ladies
With seven niggas in a Navs, bitch you crazy?
She was scared and it was showin'
So we all said "FucK YOU Bitch" and kept rollin'
To the hood, now we was fin to
Find somethin' else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
Gettin' rowdy, shit but we call it rat pack
On a nigga follow nothin' at all
Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fuckin' with my Tank dogs
I might stumble and still won't lose
Now I'm draped in my gangsta blues
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll blast your ass
See, I don't give a fuck cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin?

[Hook: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
Niggas livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches want to buy it, cause they love that straight G shit

[Break: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Hold.. hold on Craig, B cut that shit man
Mothafuck that man, we need some gangsta in this motherfucker
Some of that South shit, you know what I'm sayin?
Some of that shit from the thiz-ird source, you heard me?

Here's another gangsta down to ride
A T-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
He represents the Tank, yet hard to hit
Snoop Dogg and C-Murder with this gangsta shit

[C-Murder]
Well, I'm C-Murder the one he talkin' about
Nigga tried to play me close and got punched in the mouth
Fed's tried to get me, you know they some haters
I said "See you later" jumped in the Navigator
With the $50's in the back, with the Navy blue top
True niggas on the scene with the triple beam
Cause I'm the C fool, I slang and Snoop bang
And I'll smoke a mothafucker like it ain't no thing
To all my bitches, I know your jockin' my crew
"We want to fuck you C"
I want to fuck you too
You see, No Limit niggas don't take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with
Cause I'm the kind of nigga that's quick to blast
If you fuck with me, I'mma smoke your ass
I don't give a fuck cause No Limit stay sellin'
Now tell me, what the fuck are they yellin?

[Hook: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
Niggas livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches want to buy it, cause they love that straight G shit

[Outro: Eddie Talking]
If you would just stayed down and been the motherfuckers real partner
You wouldn't have had that problem
But seein, as you want to jump ship and you thought the ship would sink
A motherfucker without turnin' into a submarine
Went under water came back up with a periscope lookin' at your bitch ass
Now, you have no paper, and now you're on a paper caper
Now, you comin' up to my face and you're sayin: Hey can I hang out?
I say: No cause you ain't got no clout, bitch get out
Now, I'm tired of all these silly ass mothafuckin' paper chasin' whores
Uhh, this has been a public service announcement from No Limit Records
And the Doggy Dogg world

[Intro: Lil Wayne]

No Limit Records: We so 'bout it 'bout it

Gotta kill the witnesses 'cause Birdman car red
Hollygrove Monster, Eagle Street creature
Come to your funeral, kill everybody but the preacher
I live in Miami, nigga, I'll South Beach you

Yeah, gangsta party, gangsta party, gangsta party
Big-head Desert Eagle, call it Sade

That Xan took me under, Patrón brought me back
I'm leaning on these motherfuckers like I caught a flat
And that Glock snap back like an old Starter hat, haha!
What the lick read? I'm in the big league
I'm a breath of fresh air—let the bitch breathe
I'm tryna chillax, but I had to do it, Dev
I'm at the funeral, like, "I had to do it, Rev.!"
Mack, you my big brother, I'll split a wig for you
Put that on Mary P., until they bury me
Moment of clarity—yeah, that's my diamond game
I keep a fine bitch 'cause I like the finer things
Haha! Fuck with me, slime
No brain on the whip, I got nothing in mind, hehe
Carter 4, they ain't fucking with mine

[DMX]
WOO!

Woo!
Uh, uh, woo!

Woo!
Uh, uh uh

[Verse 1]
Man, I hear you niggas talkin'
But you walkin' the wrong way, didn't really mean it
I done heard it, I done seen it, don't get caught up in between it
It's a dark road you walkin on, same street that I be stalkin' on
Supposed to be quiet, but you keep talkin' on
Now your mouth got you in some shit
So we gon' let everybody see your gangsta ass get smacked like a bitch
Just to remind y'all niggas, I can find y'all niggas
Click click, what's up? Walk up right behind y'all niggas
Once the four-four hit'cha
You ain't going nowhere but out the door on a stretcher
Boy, I'ma get'cha
Wet y'all niggas up like a pool
'Cause I done told you, Y'ALL GON' MAKE ME LOSE MY COOL
Yo Knock, get the Glock, these bitch niggas is actin'
Making movies, we'll make a movie about this shit after it happened
All that yappin', that them niggas is gettin' away with
Take it easy, my friend, let 'em know, dog ain't nothin' to play with

[Chorus]
A nigga gotta take the good with the bad
I'm fuckin' with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad
'Cause it'd take a lot of pressure of my back
A nigga gotta take the good with the bad
I'm fuckin' with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad
'Cause it'd take a lot of pressure off my back

[Verse 2]
Most of these hard rocks turn out to be soft as wet dog shit
Talkin' shit, but when the four spits, dog, they all split
Then all hit the ground around the same time
In the same frame of mind
Things up in the nine left them bitches blind
Hit 'em up from behind—yeah, that's how you do that
He had such a good head on his shoulders, but I blew that
Fuck you, black, you new cats don't know somethin' important
You die quick fuckin' with my shit, and my shit's extortin'
House rules, when I speak, y'all niggas listen
I drop jewels that you cats can't afford to keep missin'
Triggered by stress, fueled by drugs
Shit is about to get real outta hand, dog, better get ya man, dog
Rap shit comes second, I'ma show you what a robber do
Mention ice one more time and I'm robbin' you
Tie you up for a week starvin' you
Beatin' the shit out you every day, 'cause yo, these niggas gotta pay

[Chorus]
A nigga gotta take the good with the bad
I'm fuckin' with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad
'Cause it'd take a lot of pressure of my back
A nigga gotta take the good with the bad
I'm fuckin' with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad
'Cause it'd take a lot of pressure off my back

[Verse 3]
Dog, it ain't no secret 'bout how its going down once I put on the pressure
It ain't nothing but another nigga put on a stretcher
With a blanket over his face, take him to the morgue with the waste
'Cause he was in the wrong place, at the wrong time
So I gave it to him in his chest
In his throat, in his head, in his back, through his vest, YES
Ain't a whole lot to breaking a nigga down fast
They call me black 'cause that's how I'm gon' be on that ass
Y'all pussy niggas think it's sweet
But ain't a fuckin' thing going down until I eat, so kill that beef
You better, while you still got teeth
'Cause they about to get knocked out, hopped out
On that ass with a blast that'll make your shit drop out
Copped out, through a you know what
'Cause you know why, and you know my
Motherfuckin' name up in this game, and bitch, you know I
Will never be caught slippin', but on some East Coast terms
New York niggas don't fuck with perms

[Chorus]
A nigga gotta take the good with the bad
I'm fuckin' with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad
'Cause it'd take a lot of pressure of my back
A nigga gotta take the good with the bad
I'm fuckin' with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad
'Cause it'd take a lot of pressure off my back

[Outro]
Uh uh, woo, come on!
Woo!
Intro: BizMarkie

C'mon
Break it down
Rarrraaaahahhhh!!
What happened? C'mon!!
What happened?? Ahhrrrahhh!!
Rrrrah!
Now we got me
My man Chubb Rock over this Prince Paul beat
Yo Chubb you start it off we gonna freak it
C'mon

Verse One: Chubb Rock

Here we go
To the consumer, and the kids who drop rumors
For the man who sport, Timberland and dash suede Pumas
I, come backwards on stuff you don't deny
If you try to act fly then I'll, punk you I and I
When, I turn my ducats into Li Pao Yen
The gas from the past of the American friend
With your suits and your squads and your fancy car
Turn to bourgeoise, to invade the media, shame
Take it insult, call me, the Grape Ape
When I flow people gotta see the whole Ricki Lake
Ate, every cuisine and scheme from Jamaica
I like Spike Lee's a kind of sporty 40 Acre
I gotta have it, O.J., he gotta stab it
Stop dealin with that Cato Caelin kid, the drug addict
If you missed me, don't kiss me with the tongue
Soon to come is my man BizMark the one
Verse Two: BizMarkie

La-dah-di, la-dah-da, I like to say
You know me, as the inhuman orchestra
When you first heard me I did MEOW MEOW
Guaranteed to rock and shock and clock and
Oh, I made you say ow yes
You hear me rockin, you hear me clockin
You hear people jockin
Is it because I'm like smart like Mr. Spock and
Captain Kirk and, you know I'm workin
I'm bound to wreck your body, go OWWW, I go bezerk and
You always hearin, you always clearin, you always cheerin
Hey, umm, umm I'm dissapearin like Magic
I'm tragic, all of a sudden
You Gotta Have It like Spike Lee, hey, you know me
As the Uh-riginal B, I-Z, the M, the A
The ickaZarR-Kay, I-E
I'm not diggedy Das EFX but I can mic check it
The original, here to rock and get respected
I'm Markie, heh, the M-ahh-Zay-R-Kay
The man appointed rap King, and I'm here to stay
I'm down to wreck your body, I'm not here to scrub
I gotta pass it over, to my man Chubb

Verse Three: Chubb Rock
From the glass clear era that's the point of the one
Be unique, critique, from the crumb, me neva done
I check them then wreck them let them fall into my spectrum
Then the Punky Brewster kids they, squeeze like rectum
I become monolithic then rip it the remains I sip it
My hat I tip it, cheerio, kid and here I go
Off beat slackin, but the platinum mediocre rappers
With the corporate backers interfused to grab sag actors
The, acoustic suits it, the boys juiced it then boost it
It kinda Gravedigs, well it should, Prince Paul produced it
What about bourgeoise, super star, in unleaded fuel cars
Hangin in bars, talkin the trife squads
Girls buckwild, child, in the rub-a-dub style
Every girl love oh Chubb Rock profile, smile
At the camera point your gluttimus to the man
At the movie star to smack out, with my rubber band
I can tell that, you need me, you don't want me to get paunchy
And me, I don't want to catch no HIV
So we'll protect you, and me but mainly me
If you don't want no rubber then P-E-A-C-E

[E white]
It ain't shit like ridin' wit my niggas, watchin the world time
Down to spend every last dollar I earn
It ain't nothin' but a thang to a youngster
It wouldn't be the same if the paper wasn't amongst us
I used to wonder what the funk was
The Bigg Homie said 'Give em what they want cuz'
I can't remember gettin high as a muthafucker
Walking by not saying hi to muthafuckers
Little mama told me, don't get it wrong its the truth, but I
Prefer to have a nigga like Soopafly
Believe me I'm goin all out
And niggas trip when they see me up at Dogg House
And every time the Bigg Homie comes through they rush
My nigga truck windows down, not the move, givin it up
We live it up, so we don't stop for shit
We Dogg House in your mouth, where the props for it, come on

Chorus:

A nigga like moos best not make that move
Unless, you rockin wit the Dogg House best
Affiliated, trust, no niggas fuckin wit us
Many hate it but at least they strapped wit heat
They make it false tabloid, you froze back
These niggas must be on crack
Thinkin they can fuck around wit the cost of the town
They love to boogie, uh
One tough cookie chocolate chip dip
Wit the rockin this bitch hit top wit this hip-hop
And it don't stop (don't stop)
I make a lady go damn near crazy, I wanna treat ya lazy
Cos my bones tryin'a go like the disco age
And when I'm finished wit your bitch I'm like get on baby
And look its no maybes, about the game I pack

Runnin' they thoughts and runnin' most of they dreams
Sometimes call me daddy

Hold my thing
Don't fuck wit' my rings
Keep my makeup off them jeans

[Chorus]
Telling it like it is, is
And not like it was

[E. White]
I stay holdin' my nuts in

But I'm high with the Dogg, nigga what up
And that's the homie Soopafly muthafucker
Somethin' I been wantin' to say to y'all niggas
That's speak on me and the homies that roll wit' us
Some real hard hitters

[Chorus]
Telling it like it is, is

Once missiles are launched mo' quicker the slaughter

[Intro: Ja Rule]
Murda Inc, haha

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
It must be the ass that got me like damn
If they get any fatter, man, the Rule going to have to get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile in the freakiest manners
J to the L-O, hello
No, I'm not Lee Harvey Oswald
I'm the Rule and I shot call
"Off the Wall" like MJ in his early days
It's the Inc. and Lopez now

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny?
It's been a while since you came around
Now you want to see what's going down
Tryna tell me why you want my time
Tryna tell me how I'm on your mind (On your mind)
See, it never had to be this way
You should have never played the games you played
Now I'm seeing that you're kind of lame
Knowing how the situation change

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny? (Ain't that funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say

Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're looking like a lonely man (Lonely man)
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurting 'cause my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny? (Ain't that funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny? (Ain't that funny?)

And you know Tah get it gully

But Caddy ain't a dummy
What these brodies want from me?
'Cause all I got is G, J.Lo
And Murda I.N.C

[Verse 5: Jennifer Lopez]
I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Tryna make me sit and reminisce
Tryna blind me with your blinging bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)
Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever want to hear from you
I had enough of being there for you
Now I'm laughing while you play the fool

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny? (Ain't that funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny? (Ain't that funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?

Brotha's being fly
Ladies acting shy
Ain't no doubt to loose
I'm gon' get my groove on tonight
Gotta dance, gotta dance, gotta dance
1 - 	Ain't no use in holding up the wall
	Come and get that body on the floor
	Baby, lose control and scream and shout
	Get your boogie down and work it out

Everybody's out, party's going on
And we're gonna rock until the sunlight crash and dawn
('Till the break of dawn)
Ain't a thing that you can do
When the rhythm's calling you
Let it work it's way right into you
Gotta dance, gotta dance, gotta dance

[Garrison Hearst]
Make it move there's no need to hold back now
Hit the floor, let loose and watch me break this down
Keep it mellow or we can get wild
See you haters in the corner tryin' to peep my style
You want my stash, gold, checks, sports illustrated
I'm motivated by the fact that I'm being hated
Now my pockets swell, game straight outta ATL
G-land, Boyz II Men, work it out
What's the deal
Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Intro]
Oh, wait a minute now
Huh-huh
Come on
Oh, wait a minute now
Check

[Verse 1]
To the Young R to the E, the B to the E, the L
Never give up, just live up
Fed upon America, I'll be spittin' it up
Rippin' it up for an even amount in each cup
To my brothers' burning bare feet on black top
Whose curled 'neath the shadows from the gaze of the cops
Whose huntin' for 9 to 5's through factory locks
Is now hunted on this modern day auction block

[Chorus]
Mic check, ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker
Mic check, ha ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, what?
Mic check, ha ha ha

[Interlude]
Check, check, check, check, the check
Oh, packin'

[Verse 2]
Flexin' and mashin' with complex text
Fast and in a fashion that snap back necks
Quicker than a fed cash the company checks
I be the "Fire" only Marley could catch
Yes, I be the flame in the cellar, beware
Nameless cold millions gaspin' for air
The naked and wageless, scream within cages
What, they make you pull your shit
Just to get your share, what?

[Chorus]
Mic check, ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker
Mic check, ha ha ha ha

We'll walk 'em down with the warrior's sound

[Bridge]
With this mic device, I spit nonfiction (Fiction)
"Who got the power?", this be my question (Question)
The mass or the few in this torn nation? (Nation)
The priest, the book, or the congregation? ('Gation)
The politricks who rob and hold down your zone? (Zone)
Or those who give the thieves the key to their homes? (Homes)
The pig who's free to murder one Shucklak
Or survivors who make a move and murder one back?

[Chorus]
You better stop that
Before I come ridin' back (RIGHT BACK)
Right back to you (BACK TO YOU)
I know you wouldn't like that (OH NO)
We don't need no (WE DON'T NEED NO)
Extra eyes to see  (WE DON'T NEED NO)
Wasn't really no friend of mine (WASN'T NO FRIEND)
Wasn't really no friend of mine (OF MINE)

[VERSE 1]
I'm part of the meek, started to speak, at age 10
Other kids were ridin' bikes, but that was the age when
I became a man, learned to stand, on my own
One dog, no bone, so young, so grown
Kid left home, shit got harder, kid got smarter
Did my part of the bad shit, I was the starter
Came from the heart of the hood, not lookin' too good
Fuckin' did what I could; ready to bid to the wood
For all the shit you do, just when you think you sly
What goes around, comes around, the wrong damn time
Maybe too late, but damn, I shoulda did that back then
Shoulda thought about that then, now come on out the den
Slowly, Come on; keep your hands where I can see 'em
You don't know me, but we already got wifey tied up in the BM
And know who set you up? That bitch with the crazy ass!
Another shorty, another party of your shady past!

[Chorus]

[VERSE 2]
God don't like ugly, all that love me, wanna plug me
But fuck me, it's about "Is this really what you want G?"
The more dirt you do, the more dirt you get
More fake niggas that ride, that'll jerk your dick
The more you think your slick, but somebody sees everything
Sometimes the thieves never hang
They remain, outlaws, wild dogs, outdoors
Strippin' cats about yours, it's all about claws
Beggin', scratchin', weighin' and matchin'
You stayin with the batch, and playin' with what you catchin'
Do unto others, as you would have others do unto you, that's under you
You must first separate from, then connect with
Fuckin' with that X shit (WHAT), 'cos this the best shit (WHAT)
Motherfuck the rest bitch (WHAT), it's all about this (WHAT)
Do what you do, and you get what you get!

[Chorus]

[VERSE 3]
See what it boils down to, is that it all comes through
Remember what you do, cause it's gon' come true
A little harder than you did it, but that's the way it is
I ain't know it be like this, but that's the way it is
Keep fuckin' with them kids, cause they all get grown and shit
When they get they own, what's gon' been that you shown 'em?
Fuck how to take a bone? How to rob a nigga of his throne?
How to be left standin' alone?
Get a nigga gone, that ain't right
Do it yourself, be a man and fight
Nigga earn your stripes, I damn sure earned mine
I already know your language, now try to learn mine
Dig 'til you find, and when you find you keep
I done spelled it out for you, but you niggas is still asleep
6 feet deep, was just around the corner
Be surprised how many niggas, wanna, warn ya

[Chorus] X 2

[Verse 1]
The sun ablaze as Maria's foot touches the surface of sand
On northern land, as human contraband
Some rico from Jalisco passed her name to the Boss
She stuffed into a truckbed, she clutches her cross
Here comes the exhaust and it rips through her lungs
She's off fast to the pasture, like cattle she'll cross
Degree 106, sweat and vomit are thrown
And she prays and suffocates upon the memories of home
Of Yanqui guns for blood, debts on the loans
Of smoldering fields, rape, rubble and bones
Of graves hidden, trapped up in visions of war
Of nothing, no one, nobody, no more

[Chorus]
These are her mountains and skies and she radiates
Through history's rivers of blood, she regenerates
And like the sun disappears only to reappear
She's eternally here
Her time is near
Never conquered but here

[Refrain]
To tear away at the mask

[Verse 2]
And now she got a quota, the needle and thread crucifixion
Sold and shipped across the new line of Mason Dixon
Rippin' through denim, the point an inch from her vein
The foreman approach, his steps now pound in her brain
His presence, it terrifies and eclipses her days
No minutes to rest, no moments to pray
And with a whisper he whips her, her soul chained to his will
"My job is to kill if you forget to take your pill"
Her arms jerk, the sisters gather 'round her and scream
As if in a dream, eyes on the crimson stream
Numb as her wrists spit shots of blood to the floor
I am nothing, no one, nobody, no more

[Chorus]
These are her mountains and skies and she radiates
Through history's rivers of blood, she regenerates
And like the sun disappears only to reappear (Maria)
She's eternally here
Her time is near
Never conquered but here

[Refrain]
To tear away at the mask
Away at the mask
To tear away at the mask

[Bridge]
No minutes to rest
No moment to pray
No minutes to rest
No moment to pray
No minutes to rest
It eclipses her day
Just a moment to pray

[Refrain]
To tear away at the mask
Away at the mask
To tear away at the mask
To tear away at the mask

[Verse 1]
Coolin' on the scene like a horse in a stable
A brother got ill, and tried to snatch a fat cable
I stepped back, like it wasn't no thing
I punched him in the jaw with the fat gold ring
I had an ace in the hole when it came to that
Yo Z, you was packin? You know I was strapped
Posse kept rollin', it was hard to get with 'em
So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim
They kept coming, just like I figured
So I stepped back, and started sprayin' niggas
What a way to go out, out like a sucker
But I'm on track, like a Long Island train
That can head up your mission, suckers who be dissin'
Always on my jock like a snake always hissing
Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross
Take me to the bar for the drink and make a toast
Givin' best wishes to the best MC
And when the spot is blown and yo, you know it's me
Because I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
Because I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
Because I'm housin'

[Chorus]
Because I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb

[Verse 2]
Coolin' at a party, no better yet disco
Head feelin' mellow from a bottle of Cisco
Move
To crush and fry a sucker MC like Crisco
Gimme the cue, check, one, two
Don't try to come off on me, because you doo-doo
You treatin' me the Z to the D, like a stepchild
Let me tell you homeboy, you're livin' foul
MC's, you know who you are
On the bandwagon, why Z? 'Cause you a star
This is the year when the jokers are wild
When a fag can't hack it and try to bite your style
I get hip to the scheme, before it happens
If it gets wild, then I start cappin'
But for now, since everything's calm
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
Because I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
Because I'm housin'
Come on

[Chorus]
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
Because I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
Because I'm housin'

[Outro]
Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('Cause I'm housin')
Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('Cause I'm housin')
Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('Cause I'm housin')
Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('Cause I'm housin')
'Cause I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'

[Hook - Flashy]
All my niggas all my bitches
Get high get drunk get wild buck fool
You know my style get crunk
Bitches bounce niggas bounce
Let me give you that funk shit blunt shit
While I make you bang it out your trunk

[Verse 1 - DMX]
You cats, talk slick but walk quick when the dog hit
The dog hits coming back to the raw shit
Aww shit they done let me back out the gate
Back out to tape back out to rape
Back off the chains so please back out the way
Before I blow ya back out with this fuckin AK
Don't give a fuck what a nigga say no matter who he sound like
Make sure you know what the rain is but its gonna be coming down like
Cats and dogs hold up it is cats and dogs
Keep fucking with the dog its gonna be cats in the morgue
Twenty- two million sold lets keep it real
Most y'all killers ain't even twenty- two years old
Ain't never felt the cold wet behind the ears
Know what real pain is cried real tears
I go hard bogard and stand my ground
Fuck y'all niggas it's how its goin down baby

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Jadakiss]
It just don't look right
Bullshit coke don't cook right
The judge ain't throwin the book right
Should thank the lord that you blew up softy
Don't talk greasy, you grew up off me
I ain't letting go of the block
And if I get a good enough grip I ain't lettin go of the lock
If I happen to pinched I ain't goin to shock
I'm gonna to get aquatinted with niggas in general pop
Stop but don't hate cause everybody got a lil blood to donate
Thugs'll go ape the women'll come around
Shortly after that is when the jealousy sets in then they'll shut it down
It's just raspy nothin on the neck wrist ware just classy
No way I'm letting this money just get past me
When all I had to do in the first place from the beginning was get nasty

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Kartoon]
Niggas been waitin' for that west coast shit I tell them to go fish
Blowin purple in a purple Laker jersey wit the gold kicks
Bitches be like Toon you a mutha fuckin trip
Hop in the whip and lean til that mutha fucka flip
And every club in Cali crackin' its gangsta town
Keep a couple of niggas with me that'll bang you down
Now lil mama put switches on and make it jump
Before me you needed Lil Jon to make it crunk
Naw for real come to Cali player take ya pump
My New York niggas leave y'all wit razor bumps
Now pappa raised a rolling stone I feel like pops
In the absence of Makaveli I feel like Pac
Even though I got the deal I still might pop
Right in front of the po-po you could feel my shots
Man all my niggas carry bangers we feel like SWAT
And that's the reason why Rialto feel like Watts

[Hook]

[Left and right DMX parts simultaneous]
Whoo whoo! Dog ni-gga
WHAT?
Whoo whoo! Dog ni-gga

[Swizz Beatz]
Uhh, Ruff Ryders, WHAT?!
Volume One, Swizz Beats (WHOOO!)
WHAT?!
Uhh, uhh, (WHAT?!) all aboard!

[Verse 1]
If I thought y'all niggas really wanted drama
I woulda been pulled out the armor, word to my momma
I'mma -- hit y'all niggas with somethin that you ain't never felt (WHAT?!)
Hit y'all niggas for frontin you caught up in that hell (WHAT?!)
If I thought that half the shit that bitches said was true
I'd be spitting lead at you, to dead your crew
But -- if you know a bitch, you don't listen to that bitch
You don't argue with that bitch, all you do is fuck that bitch!
If I listened to all the snake niggas that's runnin they mouth
I wouldn't be in the crib, I'd be loadin up, to run in your house
But -- you can't fuck with cowards, cause a coward'll be a coward
He'll end up killin these cowards, and I'm not feelin these cowards!
If I let the niggas around my way tell me how to feel about me
I guess I really, wouldn't be D
But I'm the best that ever did it, the best at it because I live it
How many niggas eat it and shit it, you cats want it? Come and get it!
Chorus: DMX (repeat 2X)

Grrr, ARF ARF, woo woo!
Grrr, ARF ARF, woo woo!
Tell me how you feelin now (WHAT?!) I know you illin now (WHAT?!)
Tell me how you feelin now (WHAT?!) I know you illin now (WHAT?!)

[Verse 2]
It's not like me to have my back turned to open places
I wanna SEE it when it's comin, so I can open faces
Open cases got me PAYIN to stay out of jail (WHAT?!)
While these streets, got me to prayin to stay out of hell (C'MON!)
Slipped, and I fell, got back up -- slipped again
But no matter what it's been, niggas never got a win
It's a thin line I walk, everyday but I'm good with it!
Project nigga all my life, but wouldn't say the hood did it!
Knew what I was doin, everyday that I've been doin it (okay)
Seein niggas havin a good time, so I'mma ruin it (yeah)
Fuck you, and fuck your man, both y'all niggas is puss!
Frontin like you out the jungle but ain't never seen a bush!
When push comes to shove, whatever love we had take it witchu
Now peep what I just said and see how long it takes to hit you
Everybody knows you can talk all day (YES)
But when it's on what you gonna do - walk away? (YES)

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Man, I told you I lock jaws, carry a Glock four
Close my eyes on y'all niggas, the bullets'll watch yours
Then I gotta open up another can of ass-whippin
Y'all niggas better pucker up, time for some real ass-kissin
I'm a simple man, I lead a simple life, I mean simple like
I don't need much to be aight, live off the land, eat at night
Handle whatever's comin when I get there, but I'm good (WHAT?!)
Dismantle whatever's comin, y'all niggas sit there and put up hoods!
How my niggas feelin? (GOOD!) How my niggas like it? (ROUGH!)
What my niggas want? (BLOOD!) We stay callin niggas bluff
But if it's got to be, then it's gon' be, c'mon let's eat
Whatever my niggas want from me, is what my niggas gonna get from me
And if I ever.. let the words, of another nigga bother me
I might as well.. let the sperm, of that other nigga father me
But they know, like I know, the black Rhino
Niggas rippin through em and let the nine blow
Nigga die slow! Oh.. oh oh!!

Chorus 3X

[DMX]
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
What? Ruff Ryders, Volume One, the compilation
DMX, Swizz Beats, uhh, double R
What? Double up, y'all gotta feel us
Y'all GOTTA feel us
Rrrrr, ARF ARF, woo woo!

[Refrain: Eminem]
Shady, we're back!

[Verse 1: Eminem with Obie Trice]
Nothin' can stop and nothin' can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no, ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say "one of the best", I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay-Z, Nas, Pac
Biggie, or maybe they'll name me somewhere down at the bottom
Right after AZ, or say he
Ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay-Z
"Yo, his verses were crazy, on that 'Renegade', B!
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the radi-
-o, and they play 'em twenty times in a row daily"
And that very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends, which has amazed me
'Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big—ba—big—big bay—ba—baby

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryna get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately, my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin' the 8V at eighteen
Eight years later, his voice in Beijing
No choice, I chase cream, so

[Refrain: Eminem]
Shady, we're back! (Stat Quo! Get 'em!)

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
This is what I eat, sleep and breathe and feed
My kids wit', it fulfill all my family needs (Come on)
I treat the mic like the block, fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expectin' me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I receive by rollin' back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him "Suck my dick," take a bow and I leave (Woo)
With a sack full of unmarked cheese, I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed to be G's
And claim they runnin' shit, nigga, I run me (I run me!)
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
That same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin' where I be
Dawg, I'm out in Hawaii, don't like it? Drink my pee
Record song for the "Detox" LP
Feet don't fail he
Niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Belvee, I'ma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon' tell me?
A-Town's entrée Aftermath, Shady!

[Refrain: Eminem]
Shady, we're back! (Bobby Creek!)

[Verse 4: Bobby Creekwater]
What up?
Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that (Gimme that)
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga, I want 'em back (

[?])
Like mic check, pimp for what it's worth, I got the right net (Pssh)
Sittin' here, excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know 'bout (Yeah)
Y'all niggas won't be satisfied 'til I show out (

[?])
Go out on a limb with Em, 'cause I'm with him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
(None of them) Stand a chance, at the dance without a bowtie (No, you don't)
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti (

[?])
So high off the light that they have given me
And the haters like a chauffeur, because it's driven me (Pssh)
To a view with a vendetta, I am the epitome (That's 

[?])
I don't give a fuck about ya, nigga, I'm just livin' me
We the reason for the season, so I'm breezin' through the track, nigga

[Refrain: Eminem]
Shady! (Ca$his!)

[Verse 5: Ca$his]
I can prove I'm here to do somethin' you'd never do (Do)
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue ('Nue)
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through (Uh)
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth, to the cops, I'm the proof
Of this, and niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it (What?)
And lived the street life niggas run away from, if (Yeah)
You follow my life, in a midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach (Uh)
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof of the buildin', shootin' at police (What? Yeah)
Some of the homies feel opposition, can't kill me
I'm a walkin' obituary, death live in me (Uh)
I take life through the pen, by the way, I'ma see (Uh, oh, ha)
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat (Yeah, pussy)
I'm connected, gettin' weight from MS 13
With SKs, ARs and Mini 14s
I'm Ca$his, the last of the real, wit' a strap
On Prozac, D's and E-Pills, it's a wrap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back
Nigga

[Refrain: Eminem]
Shady, we're back! (Ha! I told you we was back!)

[Outro: Eminem]
Ha! *pbbt* (What?)

[Cee-Lo]
Huh, yeah.. hah hahhh ahh, oohh ahh
Get it, freak it down, oohh - ho yeah!
Ehhhh eh-ahhhhhhhh, hey nowwww

Hey now what it is party people
Shuga Baby got a brand new dance
It's just a little excuse to get loose
Instead of sufferin from circumstance
But first let's do this party right
A little Hennessy and Sprite, baby how that sound
Now gather round, get ready cause it's heavy
Hush your mouth while I break it down
See what you do is find a freaky little thang
Talk to her, take her out on the flo'
Then you grind 'til your body catch fire
Talk nasty or nice and slow
You say, "Come here" and talk softly in her ear
Say it's almost time to go
And in the mornin when you're about to leave
You say, "I hope you enjoyed the show"

[Hook: Cee-Lo]
They call it the - sexual chocolate
Eh, good God y'all - sexual chocolate
Ho, take it easy now - sexual chocolate
Hey, eh-eyyyy now now - sexual chocolate

[Cee-Lo]
See I'm talkin bout enhancin the dancin, romancin
You really want your freedom can't be scared of takin chances
It's kind of funny how the bumpin and the grinding's remindin
How everytime you dance it's yourself that you're findin
And then the music got me movin and it's groovin and it's soothin
You got to grab somebody's hand they'll tell you they know where to use it
Ohh, sweet-talkin and touchin and kissin and rollin
What's life without lovin?

[Hook: Cee-Lo]
They call it the - sexual chocolate

[Intro]
Feel the funk blast
Feel the funk blast
Feel the funk blast
Feel the funk blast
Feel the funk blast
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, check it out, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
I be walkin' God like a dog, my narrative, fearless
My word war returns to burn like Baldwin home from Paris
Like Steel from a furnace, I was born landless
This is the native son, born of Zapata's guns
Stroll through the shanties and the cities' remains
Same bodies buried hungry but with different last names
These vultures rob everything, leave nothing but chains
Pick a point on the globe, yes, the picture's the same
There's a bank, there's a church, a myth and a hearse
A mall and a loan, a child dead at birth
There's a widow pig parrot, a rebel to tame
A white-hooded judge, a syringe and a vein
And the riot be the rhyme of the unheard

[Pre-Chorus]
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?

[Chorus]
I'm calm like a bomb
(Ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite)
I'm calm like a bomb
(Ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite)

[Verse 2]
This ain't subliminal, feel the critical mass approach horizon
The pulse of the condemned, sound off America's demise
The anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, yes, I spit fire
Hope lies in the smoldering rubble of empires
Yes, back through the shanties and the cities' remains
Same bodies buried hungry (Uh-huh), but with different last names (Uh-huh)
Them vultures robbin' everyone, leave nothing but chains
Pick a point here at home, yes, the picture's the same
There's a field full of slaves, some corn and some debt
There's a ditch full of bodies, the check for the rent
There's a tap, the phone, the silence of stone
The numb black screen that be feelin' like home
And the riot be the rhyme of the unheard

[Pre-Chorus]
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?

[Chorus]
I'm calm like a bomb
(Ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite)
I'm calm like a bomb
(Ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite)
I'm calm like a bomb
(Ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite)
I'm calm like a bomb
(Ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite)

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
I'm calm like a bomb
(Ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite)
I'm calm like a bomb
(Ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite)
I'm calm like a bomb
(Ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite)
I'm calm like a bomb
(Ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite)

[Outro]
There's a mass without roofs, there's a prison to fill
There's a country's soul that reads post no bills
There's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill
There's a right to obey and there's a right to kill
There's a mass without roofs, there's a prison to fill
There's a country's soul that reads post no bills
There's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill
'Cause there's a right to obey and there's the right to kill

[Verse 1]
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as the weak grow strong
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for the dawn
The spirit of Jackson now screams through the ruins
Through factory chains and the ghost of the Union
The forgotten remains disappear to their new homes
The knife, the thrust, the life burns to the raw bone
The blood on the floor of the tear is still dryin'
Cover the spread sheets, the Dow Jones skyin'
The cell block live stock, the bodies they buyin'
Old south order, new northern horizon!

[Pre-Chorus]
Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be
(Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be)
Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD
(Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD)
Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be
(Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be)
Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD
(Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD)

[Chorus]
A fire in the master's house is set
A fire in the master's house is set
A fire in the master's house is set
A fire in the master's house is set

[Verse 2]
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as the weak grow strong
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for the dawn
Yo, yo, check the high tech terror of the new order athletes
Peering into the eyes of the child already on trial
These armies rippin' families apart, get 'em on file
Convictions fit the stock profile all the while
Films of dogs, cuttin' through homes
Ripping skin from bones, yes, the new millennium homes
Privatizing through private eyes, an era rising
Of the old south order, new northern horizon

[Pre-Chorus]
Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be
(Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be)
Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD
(Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD)
Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be
(Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be)
Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD
(Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD)

[Chorus]
A fire in the master's house is set
A fire in the master's house is set
A fire in the master's house is set
A fire in the master's house is set

[Verse 1]
A mass of hands press on the market window
Ghosts of progress dressed in slow death
Feeding on hunger and glaring through the promise
Upon the food that rots slowly in the aisle
A mass of nameless at the oasis
That hides the graves beneath the master's hill
Buried for drinking the river's water while
Shackled to the the line at the empty well

[Chorus]
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound over the new ground
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound over new ground

[Post-Chorus]
Listen to the fascist sing
"Take hope here, war is elsewhere
You were chosen, this is God's land
Soon we'll be free of blot and mixture
Seeds planted by our forefathers' hand"

[Verse 3]
A mass of promises begin to rupture
Like the pockets of the new world kings
Like swollen stomachs In Appalachia
Like the priest that fucked you as he whispered holy things
A mass of tears have transformed the stones now
Sharpened on suffering and woven into the slings
Hope lies in the rubble of this rich fortress
Taking today what tomorrow never brings

[Chorus]
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound over the new ground
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound over new ground

[Bridge]
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound over the new ground
Ain't the new sound just like the old sound?
Look at the noose now, over the, over the, over the burning ground
Ain't it funny how the factory's doors close?
'Round the time that the school doors close?
'Round the time that the doors of the jail cells
Open up to greet you like the reaper?
Ain't it funny how the factory's doors close?
'Round the time that the school doors close?
'Round the time that a hundred thousand jail cells
Open up to greet you like the reaper?
Oasis
This is no oasis

[Chorus]
This is the new sound, just like that old sound
Just like the noose wound over the new ground
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound over new ground

[Outro]
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall

[Verse 1]
The hills find peace, locked armed guard posts
Safe from the screams of the children born as ghosts
Gates, guns and alarms shape the calm of the dawn
Peering down into the basin where death lives on
When young run foaming at the mouth with hate
When burning batons beat the freezing who shake
Under the toxic sunsets they dine and toast
Of walls deny the terror faced
By the children born as ghosts

[Chorus]
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(We are the children born as ghosts, born as ghosts)

[Verse 2]
One book and forty ghosts stuffed in a room
Ah, the school as a tomb
Where home is a wasteland, taste the razor wire
And thought is locked in the womb
The tales that tear at the myth of the dream
(Myth of the dream, myth of the dream)
A suffering that shocks the lives off the screen
(Myth of the dream, myth of the dream)

[Chorus]
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(We are the children born as ghosts, born as ghosts)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(We are the children born as ghosts, born as ghosts)
Born as ghosts

[Verse 1]
Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured, silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle, monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle, monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the Fistagons, the bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord

[Chorus]
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio

[Verse 2]
Contact, I hijacked the frequencies
Blockin' the beltway, move on DC
Way past the days of bombin' MCs
Sound off, Mumia, go on, be free
Who got 'em? Yo, check the federal file
All you pen devils know the trial was vile
Army of pigs try to silence my style
Off 'em all out the box, it's my radio dial

[Chorus]
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up

[Bridge]
It has to start somewhere
It has to start sometime
What better place than here?
What better time than now?

[Outro]
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now

[Verse 1]
His spit is worth more than her work
Pass the purse to the pugilists
He's a prize-fighter
And he bought rings and he owns kin
And now he's swinging
And now he's the champion

[Chorus]
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver

[Verse 2]
A spotless domain
Hides festering hopes, she's certain there's more
Pictures of fields without fences
A spotless domain
Hides festering hopes, she's certain there's more
Pictures of fields without fences
Her body numbs as he approaches the door
As he approaches the door
As he approaches the door
As he approaches the door
As he approaches

[Chorus]
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver

[Chorus]
Yeah
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver

[Outro]
Revolver

[Verse 1]
My fears hunt me down
Capturing my memories
The frontier of loss
They try to escape across the street where
Jesus stripped bare
And raped the spirit He was supposed to nurture
In the name of my
In the name of my

[Chorus]
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man

[Verse 2]
Like autumn leaves his sense fell from him
An empty glass of himself shattered somewhere within
His thoughts like a hundred moths
Trapped in a lampshade
Somewhere within
Their wings banging and burning
On through endless night
Forever awake he lies shaking and starving
Praying for someone to turn off the light

[Chorus]
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man

[Verse 3]
My fear is hunting me down
Capturing my memories
The frontier of loss
They try to escape across the street where
Jesus stripped bare
And raped the spirit He was supposed to nurture
In the name of my
In the name of my

[Chorus]
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man

[Verse 1]
The main attraction, distraction
Got ya number than number than numb
Empty ya pockets, son, they got you thinkin' that
What ya need is what they selling
Make you think that buying is rebelling

From the theaters to malls on every shore
The thin line between entertainment and war
The frontline is everywhere
There be no shelter here

Spielberg, the nightmare works so push it far
Amistad was a whip, the truth was feathered and tarred
Memories erased, burned and scarred
Trade in ya history for a VCR

Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture, Americana
Chained to the dream they got you searchin' for
The thin line between entertainment and war

[Chorus]
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)

[Verse 2]
Hospitals not profit full
The market bulls got pockets full
To advertise some hip disguise
View the world from American eyes

The poor adore, keep fiendin' for more
The thin line between entertainment and war
They fix the need, develop the taste
Buy their products or get laid to waste

Coca-Cola is back in the veins of Saigon
And Rambo too, he's got a dope pair of Nikes on
Godzilla, pure mothafuckin' filler
To keep ya eyes off the real killer

Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture, Americana
Chained to the dream they got you searchin' for
The thin line between entertainment and war

[Chorus]
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)

[Bridge]
American eyes, American eyes
View the world from American eyes
Bury the past, rob us blind
And leave nothing behind

American eyes, American eyes
View the world from American eyes
Bury the past, rob us blind
And leave nothing behind

[Outro]
Just stare
Just stare
Just stare
Just stare
Relive the nightmare

[Verse 1]
Come on, check it
Through steel walls, your voice blastin' on
True rebel, my brother, Mumia, I reflect upon
You the spark, that set the prairie fires on
Make the masses a mastodon path to trample the fascists on
At fifteen exposed Philly's finest killing machine
Boots and mad guns, they pacify ya young
Cause and effect, smell the smoke in the breeze
My panther, my brother, we are at war until you're free

[Chorus]
You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless
You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless

[Verse 2]
Well, the powerful got nervous 'cause he refused to be they servant
'Cause he spit truth that burned like black churches
Prose and verses, a million poor in hearses
Watch the decision of Dred Scott as it reverses
Long as the rope is tight around Mumia's neck
Let there be no rich white life we bound to respect
Cause and effect, can't ya smell the smoke in the breeze?
My panther, my brother, we are at war until you're free

[Chorus]
You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless
You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless
You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless
You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless

[Verse 3]
And Orwell's hell, a terror era coming through
But this little brother's watching you too
And Orwell's hell, a terror era coming through
But this little brother's watching you too, watching you too

[Verse 1]
Yeah
The world is my expense
The cost of my desire
Jesus blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire
So raise your fists and march around
Just don't take what you need
I'll jail and bury those committed
And smother the rest in greed
Crawl with me into tomorrow
Or I'll drag you to your grave
I'm deep inside your children
They'll betray you in my name

[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire

[Verse 2]
The lie is my expense
The scope of my desire
The party blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire

[Pre-Chorus]
I am the Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire
Sleep now in the fire

[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire

[Verse 3]
For it's the end of history
It's caged and frozen still
There is no other pill to take
So swallow the one that makes you ill

[Pre-Chorus]
The Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire
Sleep now in the fire
Yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire

[Intro]
Come wit' it now
Come wit' it now

[Verse 1]
The microphone explodes, shattering the mold
Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' the thirst
Of the power dons, that five-sided Fistagon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The trigger’s cold, empty your purse

[Chorus]
Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

[Verse 2]
Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war, cannibal animal
I walk the corner to the rubble, that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetery now
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally 'round the family, pockets full of shells

[Chorus]
Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

[Guitar Solo]
Bulls on parade, uh

[Outro]
Come wit' it now
Come wit' it now
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
It's a Beautiful world we live in
A sweet romantic place
Beautiful people everywhere
The way they show they care
Makes me want to say
"It's a beautiful world
Oh, what a beautiful world
For you"

It's a wonderful time to be here
It's nice to be alive
Wonderful people everywhere
The way they comb their hair
Makes me want to say
"It's a wonderful place
Oh, what a wonderful place
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
Not me"

[Verse 1]
Every official that comes in, cripples us, leaves us maimed
Silent and tamed
And with our flesh and bones, he builds his homes
Southern fist, rise through the jungle mist
Clenched to smash power so cancerous
A black flag and a red star
A rising sun loomin' over Los Angeles
Yes, for Raza livin' in La La
Like Gaza on to the dawn of Intifada
Reach for the lessons the masked pass on
And seize the metropolis, it's you it's built on

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
And everything changed on a new year's day
Come on

[Chorus]
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land

[Verse 2]
Their existence is a crime
Their seat, their robe, their tie
Their land deeds, their hired guns
They're the crime
Shots heard underground 'round the rapture
The world's eye captured at last in a Mexican pasture
The masked screaming land or death
Within a breath, a war from the depth of time
Who shot four puppet governors in a line
Who shook all the world bankers who think they can rhyme
Shot the landlords who knew it was mine
Yes, it's a war from the depth of time

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Come on
Ugh, hear the masked scream

[Chorus]
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death

[Post-Chorus]
It's land or death
Yeah, uh
Come on
Come on
Yes, yes
Yes

[Chorus]
It's war within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death

[Intro]
Yeah, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun

[Verse 1]
Bangin' this bolo tight, on this solo flight, can't fight alone
Funk the track, my verbs sly like the Family Stone
Them pen devils set the stage for the war at home
Locked without a wage, you're standing in the drop zone
The clockers born, starin' at an empty plate
Mama's torn hands cover her sunken face
We hungry but them belly full
The structure is set, ya never change it with a ballot pull
In the ruins there's a network for the toxic rock
Schoolyard to precinct, suburb to project block
Bosses rode south for new flesh and a factory floor
The remains left chained to the powder war

[Chorus]
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So make a move and plead the fifth 'cause ya can't plead the first
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yes, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Bear witness to the sickest shot while suckers get romantic
They ain't gonna send us campin' like they did my man Fred Hampton
Still we lampin', still clockin' dirt for our sweat
A ballot's dead, so a bullet's what I get
A thousand years they had the tools, we should be takin' 'em
Fuck the G-ride, I want the machines that are makin' 'em
Our target straight with a room full of armed pawns
To off the Kings on the west side at dawn

[Chorus]
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
Make a move and plead the fifth 'cause ya can't plead the first
Can't waste a day, when the night brings a hearse
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yeah, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yeah, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun

[Outro]
(The rungs torn from the ladder, can't reach the tumor)
(One god, one market, one truth, one consumer)
Just a quiet, peaceful dance
Just a quiet, peaceful dance
Yeaah
Just a quiet, peaceful dance
Just a quiet, peaceful dance
Just a quiet, peaceful dance
For the things we'll never have
Just a quiet, peaceful dance
For the things we don't have

[Verse 1]
Satellites and pair of mirrors and
And a man without a home
With a horse and a rider
And a clever, cunning killer
Silent in error and vocal in spotlights
Lying always, sucking on a bottle of
That sweet indulgent fluid
Oh greed, oh yes, oh greed, oh yes

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Twenty-six years in this stage)
(You're twenty-six years in this stage)
Your friendship is a fog
That disappears when the wind redirects
You
Yes, you

[Verse 2]
Father's expectations
Soul soaked in spit and urine
And you gotta make it where?
To a sanctuary that's a fragile American hell
An empty dream
A selfish, horrific vision
Passed on like the deadliest of viruses
Crushing you and your naive profession

[Bridge]
Have no illusions, boy
Vomit all ideals and serve
Sleep and wake and serve and
Don't just think, just wake and serve and

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Twenty-six years in this stage)
(You're twenty-six years in this stage)
Yeah, your friendship is a fog
That disappears when the wind redirects

Nah, fuck it, turn it off
Turn it off, turn on the radio
Nah, fuck it, turn it off
Fear is your only god on the radio
Nah, fuck it
Your savior, my guillotine, crosses and kerosene

[Verse 1]
Merge on the networks, slangin' nerve gas
Up jump the boogie, then bang, let 'em hang
While the paranoid try to stuff the void
Let's capture this AM mayhem
Undressed and blessed by the Lord
The power pendulum swings by the umbilical cord
Shock around the clock, from noon 'til noon
Men grabbin' they mics and stuff 'em into the womb
Terror's the product ya push
Well, I'm a truth addict, aw shit, I got a headrush
Sheep tremble and here come the votes
Thrown from the throat, cages and scapegoats
Undressed and blessed by the Lord
The same devil that ran around Managua wit' a sword
Check out the new style that Ollie found
A tune with a bullet to shut down the devil sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Shut down the devil sound
The program of Vietnow
Shut down the devil sound

[Chorus]
Turn on the radio
Nah, fuck it, turn it off
Fear is your only god on the radio
Nah, fuck it, turn it off
Turn it off, turn on the radio
Nah, fuck it, turn it off
Fear is your only god on the radio
Nah, fuck it
Your savior, my guillotine, crosses and kerosene

[Verse 2]
Flex the cerebellum, fire, uh
Somebody gotta shell 'em, these evil angels' lists
Hittin' the AM playlist, paid to say this
That one's inhuman, illegal, single, woman
The one without a movement
The transmissions whippin' our backs
Yeah, comin' down like bats from Stacey Koon and
Terror's the product ya push
Well, I'm a truth addict, aw shit, I got a headrush
The sheep tremble and here come the votes
Thrown from the throat, cages and scapegoats
One caution, the mic's a detonator, unwound (Unwound)
To shut down the devil sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Shut down the devil sound
Check the heads bow in Vietnow
Shut down the devil sound

[Bridge]
Is all the world jails and churches?
Is all the world jails and churches?

Ya tryin' to tire me, tire me
Why don't you get from in front of me?
Oh, she's got everyone's eyes (Yeah)
In every home there's a sickening distress (Yeah)
Of roll that film she's a precious, a precious one
But we're all gonna, nah, we're already dead
We're already dead

And those colorful words for the Laos frontiersmen
Who passed away with the truth amidst the eulogies of bliss
Who will know now what I know about you?
Now that history's a flowery cancerous mess
Yeah, ya tryin' to tire me, a mess
Overbearing, yes, ya tryin' to tire me, a mess
Yeah, ya tryin' to tire me, tire me
So get the fuck from in front of me
Nah, let's see it broken, bloody and undressed
We're already dead
{Guitar solo}

In a violent time, in a violent time
In a violent time, in a violent time
In a violent time, in a violent time
In a violent time, in a violent time

I wanna be Jackie Onassis
I wanna wear a pair of dark sunglasses
I wanna be Jackie O
Oh, oh, oh, oh, please don't die

Yeah, ya tryin' to tire me, tire me
I can see you in front of me, front of me
Ya tryin' to tire me, tire me
Why don't you get from in front of me?

We're already dead

[Intro]
Uh

[Verse 1]
Got no card, so I got not soul
Life is prison, no parole, no control
The jura got my number on a wire tap
'Cause I jack for Similac, fuck a Cadillac
Survive, one motive, no hope
'Cause every sidewalk I walk is like a tightrope
Yes, I know my deadline, sire, when my life expires
I'm sendin' paper south under the barbed wire
The mother of my child will lose her mind at my grave
It's my life for their life, so call it a free trade
"Por vida" and our name up on the stall
I took a death trip when I tried to cross the white wall

[Chorus]
Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face
One motive, no hope, uh
Born without a face
Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face
One motive, no hope, uh
Yeah, born without a face
Without a face

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I tried to look back to my past long lost
A blood donor to the land owner holocaust
Pop's heart stopped, in came the air drop
Flooded the trench, he couldn't shake the toxic shock
Maize was all we needed to sustain
Now her golden skin burns, insecticide rain
Ya down wit' DDT, yeah, you know me
I'm raped for the grapes, profit for the bourgeoisie
War tape boomin', path is Luminoso
I'm headed north like my name was Kid Cisco
To survive, one motive, no hope, uh
It's hard to breathe with Wilson's hand around my throat, uh
Strangled and mangled, another SS curtain call
When I tried to cross the white walls
When I tried to cross the white walls

[Chorus]
Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face
One motive, no hope, uh
Born without a face
Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face
One motive, no hope, uh
Born without a face

[Outro]
You say fortify
Reaction, you divide

Mic check and one, two, one, two
Mic check and one, two
Mic check and one, two

[Verse 1]
Lick off the shot, my stories shock ya like Ellison
Mainline adrenaline, Gaza to Tienanmen
From the basement I'm dwellin' in
I cock back the sling to stone a settler
Breaks him off clean, call me the upsetter
Here comes the hands on the leashes, the cross
The capital, the pale families, the fear, and the mouthpieces
The single sista lynch, the cell doors crash
The master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo

[Chorus]
Roll right, roll call
But now we're alright, we're all calm
Roll right, roll call
But now we're alright, we're all calm

[Verse 2]
This hits like fists, bomb with the left and don't miss
With the sickest stilo, I spark fear like pigs in the park
Head crack, I hijack the papers
The vapors caught fire up in your mind, come back, rewind one time
Here comes the hands on the leashes, the cross
The capital, the pale families, the fear, and the mouthpieces
The single sista lynch, the cell doors crash
The master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo, echo

[Chorus]
Roll right, roll call
But now we're alright, we're all calm
Roll right, roll call

[Bridge]
We gotta take 'em to the seventh level
We gotta take 'em to the seventh level
For their lives and my lives were never settled
Come on, don't freeze when zero hour comes
Come on
Come on, don't freeze when zero hour comes
Come on

[Outro]
Send 'em to the seventh level
Send 'em to the seventh level
Send 'em to the seventh level
Send 'em to the seventh level
For their lives and my lives were never settled

[Verse 1]
Flip this capital eclipse
The vocal tone has got 'em sweating their own apocalypse
Yes, rebel of the grains stand masterless
The masked ones cap one, NAFTA coming with the new disaster
And yes, we in with the wind and the Plan de Ayala kin
Coming back around again
The slave driver saliva, one night, power turns
Them devils mouths dry, now Mexico burns
So here they come, one by one, them killers of the new frontier
Occupy, causing fear, come on

[Chorus]
With the wind below
We in with the wind below
With the wind below

[Verse 2]
Flip this capital eclipse
Them bury life wit' IMF shifts, and poison lips
Yo, they talk it while slicing our veins, yo, so mark it
From the FINCAS overseers to them vultures playing markets
She ain't got nothing but weapon and shawl
She is Chol, Tzotzil, Tojolobal, Tzeltal
The tools are her tools, Ejidos and ovaries
She was strangled, now through a barrel she breathes

[Chorus]
She is the wind below
The wind below
She is the wind below

[Bridge]
And all the shareholders gonna flex and try to annex the truth
While the new trust is gonna flex and cast their image in you
Yeah, all the shareholders gonna flex and try to annex the truth
And while the new trust tries to flex and cast their image in you
And GE is gonna flex and try and annex the truth
And NBC is gonna flex and cast their image in you
And Disney bought the fantasies and piles of eyes
And ABC's new thrill rides of trials and lies
And while the gut eaters strain to pull the mud from their mouths
They force our ears to go deaf to the screams in the south, yeah

[Outro]
But we in with the wind below
But we in with the wind below
But we in with the wind below

[Verse 1]
This time the bullet cold rocked ya
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya
Said it was blue, when ya blood was red
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through ya head
Blasted through ya head, blasted through ya head
I give a shout out to the living dead
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized
So serene on the screen, you was mesmerized
Cellular phones, soundin' a death tone
Corporations cold turn ya to stone before ya realize
They load the clip in, omnicolor
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And mothafuckas lost their minds

[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?" Yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?"
Run it

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?" Yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?"

[Verse 2]
Checka, checka, check it out
They load the clip in, omnicolor
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And mothafuckas lost their minds
No escape from the mass mind rape
Play it again, Jack, and then rewind the tape
And then play it again, and again, and again
Until ya mind is locked in
Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya
Buyin' all the products that they're sellin' ya
They say jump and ya say "how high?"
Ya braindead, ya got a fuckin' bullet in ya head

[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?" Yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?"

[Interlude]
Ugh
Yeah
Yeah
Fuck

[Bridge]
Ya standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Ya bowin' down to the flag
Ya got a bullet in ya head
Ya standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Ya bowin' down to the flag
Ya got a bullet in ya head

[Outro]
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in the head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
Ya got a bullet in ya fuckin' head
Yeah! Yeah!

[Intro]
Huh!
Check it
Uh!

[Verse 1]
Silence, something about silence makes me sick
'Cause silence can be violent sorta like a slit wrist
If the vibe was suicide, then you would push the button
But if ya bowin' down, then let me do the cuttin'
Some speak the sounds but speak in silent voices
Like radio is silent though it fills the air with noises
Its transmissions bring submission as ya mold to the unreal
And mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
Yeah

[Chorus]
And mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
With a fistful of steel
('Cause I know the power of the question)
With a fistful of steel
With a fistful of steel
(And I won't stop 'cause I know the power of the question)

[Verse 2]
It's time to flow like the fluid in ya veins
If ya will it, I will spill it and ya out
Just as quick as ya came
Not a silent one, but a defiant one
Never a normal one 'cause I'm the bastard son
With the visions of the move, vocals not to soothe
But to ignite and put in flight my sense of militance
Groovin', playin' that game called survival
The status, the elite, the enemy, the rival
The silent sheep slippin', riffin', trippin'
Give you a glimpse of the reality I'm grippin'
Steppin' into the jam and I'm slammin' like Shaquille
Mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
Yeah

[Chorus]
And mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
With a fistful of steel
('Cause I know the power of the question)
With a fistful of steel
With a fistful of steel
(And I won't stop 'cause I know the power of the question)
Aw shit

[Post-Chorus]
(And I won't stop, 'cause I know the power of the question!)

[Bridge 1]
And if the vibe was suicide, then you would push the button
But if you're bowin' down, then let me do the cuttin'
Yeah
Come on

[Bridge 2]
A .44 full of bullets
Face full of pale
Eyes full of empty
A stare full of nails
The roulette ball
Rolls alone on the wheel
A mind full of fire
And a fistful of steel
And if the vibe was suicide, then you would push the button
But if you're bowin' down, then let me do the cuttin'

[Outro]
Yeah
With a fistful of steel, uh
Come on
Uh, with a fistful of steel
Uh

[Intro]
Uh

[Verse 1]
The movie ran through me
The glamour subdue me
The tabloid untied me
I'm empty. please fill me
Mister Anchor, assure me
That Baghdad is burning
Your voice, it is so soothing
That cunning mantra of killing
I need you, my witness
To dress this up so bloodless
To numb me and purge me now
Of thoughts of blaming you
Yes, the car is our wheelchair
My witness, your coughing
Oily silence mocks the legless ones
Who travel now in coffins

[Pre-Chorus]
While on the corner (Corner)
The jury's sleepless (Sleepless)
We found your weakness (Weakness)
And it's right outside your door

[Chorus]
Now testify
Now testify
It's right outside your door, now testify
Yes, testify
It's right outside your door

[Verse 2]
With precision you feed me
My witness, I'm hungry
Your temple, it calms me, so I can carry on
My slaving, sweating the skin right off my bones
On a bed of fire, I'm choking on the smoke that fills my home
The wrecking ball is rushing
Witness your blushing
The pipeline is gushing
While here we lie in tombs

[Pre-Chorus]
While on the corner (Corner)
The jury's sleepless (Sleepless)
We found your weakness (Weakness)
And it's right outside your door

[Chorus]
Now testify
Yeah, testify
It's right outside your door
Now testify
Now testify
And it's right outside your door

[Post-Chorus]
Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set
Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set
Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set
Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Who controls the past now controls the future
Who controls the present now controls the past
Who controls the past now controls the future
Who controls the present now?

[Chorus]
Now testify
Testify
It's right outside your door
Now testify
Testify
It's right outside your door

[Intro]
Uh
Pump, pump, woo!
Come on
Uh

[Verse 1]
Solo, I'm a soloist on a solo list
All live, never on a floppy disk
Inka, inka, bottle of ink
Paintings of rebellion drawn up by the thoughts I think

[Interlude]
Yeah
Come on
The militant poet in once again, check it

[Verse 2]
It's set up like a deck of cards
They're sendin' us to early graves for all the diamonds
They'll use a pair of clubs to beat the spades
With poetry, I paint the pictures that hit
More like the murals that fit
Don't turn away, get in front of it
Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall playin Tic-Tac-Toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, three brothers gone, come on
Doesn't that make it three in a row?

[Refrain]
(Anger is a gift)

[Interlude]
Come on
Uh

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
Drop that
Uh
Come on
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 3]
Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall playin' Tic-Tac-Toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, three million gone, come on
'Cause you know they're counting backwards to zero
Environment, the environment exceeding
On the level of our unconsciousness
For example, what does the billboard say?
"Come and play, come and play
Forget about the movement"

[Refrain]
(Anger is a gift)

[Interlude]
Yeah
Uh
Aw, bring that shit in
Uh
Hey

[Outro]
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah, right
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah, right
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah, right

[Verse]
A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on, passed on, and passed on
A world of violent rage but it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes, I dwell in hell, but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family but I slipped
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane
I got a nine, a sign, a set, and now I got a name

[Chorus 1]
Read my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
Death is on my side
Suicide

[Verse]
A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on, passed on, and passed on
A world of violent rage but it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes, I dwell in hell, but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family but I slipped
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane
I got a nine, a sign, a set, and now I got a name

[Chorus 2]
Read my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
Caught between my culture and the system
Genocide
Read my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
If ignorance is bliss
Then knock the smile off my face, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
If we don't take action now
We'll settle for nothing later
We'll settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later
If we don't take action now
We'll settle for nothing later
We'll settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later
If we don't take action now
We'll settle for nothing later
We'll settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later
If we don't take action now
We'll settle for nothing later
We'll settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later

[Intro: Zack De La Rocha]
Huh
Yeah, we're comin' back in with another bombtrack
Think ya know it's all of that, huh
Ayo, so check this out, yeah

[Chorus: Zack De La Rocha]
Know your enemy
Come on

[Verse 1: Zack De La Rocha]
Born with insight and a raised fist
A witness to the slit wrist
As we move into '92
Still in a room without a view
Ya got to know, ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify, defy
I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in
Something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Fist in ya face in the place and I'll drop the style clearly
Know your enemy

[Chorus: Zack De La Rocha]
Know your enemy
Yeah
Ayo, get with this, ugh

[Verse 2: Zack De La Rocha]
Word is born
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Now I got no patience
So sick of complacence
With the D, the E, the F, the I, the A, the N, the C, the E
Mind of a revolutionary, so clear the lane
The finger to the land of the chains
What? The "land of the free"?
Whoever told you that is your enemy
Now something must be done
About vengeance, a badge, and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Now action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in

[Bridge: Maynard James Keenan]
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
Sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of you
Time has come to pay

[Chorus: Zack De La Rocha]
Know your enemy

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro: Zack De La Rocha]
Come on
Yes, I know my enemies
They're the teachers who taught me to fight me
Compromise, conformity
Assimilation, submission
Ignorance, hypocrisy
Brutality, the elite
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams

[Verse 1]
Rebel, rebel and yell
'Cause our people still dwell in hell
Locked in a cell, yes, the structure's a cell
Mad is the story I tell
How long can we wait?
Come on, seein' what's at stake
Action for reaction
If your mind's in a somewhat complacent state, get a check up
This is a stick up
Our freedom, or your life
Lord, I wish I could be peaceful
But there can be no sequel
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg, or South Central
On the mic 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion
Yeah, what about that, sucka?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, so you thought you could get with the hardlines
That fill your mind
Thoughts, battles fought, and lessons taught
Yes, I'll display the fitness, and flip like a gymnast
Raise my fist and resist!
Asleep though we stand in the midst of the war
Gotta get mine, gotta get more
Keepin' the mic warm against the norm
'Cause what does it offer me?
I think often it's nothin' but a coffin
Gotta get wreck 'til our necks never swing on a rope
From here to the cape of no hope
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg, or South Central
On the mic 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion

[Chorus]
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm

[Post-Chorus]
What's it gonna take?

[Bridge]
Shackle their minds when they're bent on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Shackle their minds when they're left on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Shackled our minds when we're bent on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Shackled our minds when we're left on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost, lost, lost!
Shackle your minds and you're left on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Just shackle your minds when you're bent on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Lost!!!

[Chorus]
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm

[Verse 1]
Hey, don't miss out on what you're passing
You're missing the hootah of the funky Buddha
Eluder of the fucked up styles that get wicked
So come on as I start to kick it
'Cause we're like outlaws stridding
Suckers are hiding
Jump behind the bush
When they see me driving by
Hanging out my window
And my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kinda loco
I'm just another local kid
From the street getting paid for my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

[Chorus 1]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

[Verse 2]
I've been doin' all the dumb shit, yo, because nothin' is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fucking around, I got ya humming
Hummin', comin' at ya
Then you know I had to gat ya
Time for some action, just a fraction of friction (Uh)
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shining a battle light
Swing out the gat, and I know that we'll gat you right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said, "Yo, it's on
Take cover son, or you're assed out
How do you like my chrome?" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did any way
Ha ha ha ha ha! Young punk had to pay
So I just killed the man

[Chorus 1]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

[Bridge]
It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite you with these site
So if you ain't down
Bullshit

[Verse 3]
Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would call the one time and play the role model?
No, I think you'll play like a thug
Next, hear the shot of a magnum slug
Humming, coming at ya!
Yeah, you know I'm gonna to gat ya
How do you know where I'm at
When you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm coming from
While you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome, just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, yo, I gotta say, "Fuck it"

[Refrain]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

[Outro]
How I could just kill a man
How I could just kill a man

[Intro]
Crank the music up
Bring that shit in, uh
Yeah, the movement's in motion with massive militant poetry
Now check this out, uh

[Verse 1]
In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
So-called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back
Bam, here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change and to counteract
We gotta take the power back

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
Yeah, we gotta take the power back

[Verse 2]
The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric, every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
We've got to take it back
Holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system who cares about only one culture
And that, is why we gotta take the power back

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
Yeah, we gotta take the power back

[Interlude 1]
Ayo check, we're gonna have to break it
Break it, break it down, aw shit

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude 2]
And like this
Uh! Come on
Yeah, bring it back the other way
Uh

[Verse 3]
The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit
And listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
(Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' Weathermen)
Expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
Yeah, we gotta take the power back

[Bridge]
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
Uh! Yeah

[Outro]
Take it back, y'all
Take it back, a-take it back, a-take it back, y'all
Come on, take it back, y'all
Take it back, a-take it back, a-take it back, y'all
Come on, uh! Yeah

[Intro]
Come on
Ugh
Come on

[Verse 1]
Although ya try to discredit, ya still never read it
The needle, I'll thread it, radically poetic
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double "I'm Mad", still knee deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it'll never come close
To the rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak, movements cease when their heads are flown
'Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police, (What!) the judges (What!), the feds
Networks at work, keeping people calm
You know they went after King when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

[Interlude 1]
Yeah
Yeah, back in this

[Verse 2]
With poetry my mind I flex
"Flip" like Wilson, vocals never lackin' that finesse
What do I got to, what do I got to do to wake you up?
To shake you up, to break the structure up?
'Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove, then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the "Stutter Step" then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
You better beware of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X and tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

[Bridge]
What was the price on his head?
What was the price on his head!?
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard, I think I heard a shot

[Interlude 2]
Black Nationalism

[He] may be a brave contender for this position
But should he abandon his supposed 'obedience'
To the 'White liberal doctrine' of non-violence
And embrace Black Nationalism
Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
And neutralize them, and neutralize them
And neutralize them, and neutralize them
And neutralize them

[Chorus]
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!

[Outro]
How long? Not long
'Cause what you reap is what you sow

[Verse 1]
You tell me you like the taste
You just need an excuse
You tell me it calms your nerves
You just think it looks cool
You tell me you want to be different
You just change for the same
You tell me it's only natural
You just need the proof
Did you fucking get it?

[Chorus]
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
And it doesn't look that way to me
In my eyes
And it doesn't look that way to me
In my eyes

[Verse 2]
You tell me that nothing matters
You're just fucking scared
You tell me that I'm better
You just hate yourself
You tell me that you like her
You just wish you did
You tell me that I make no difference
Well, at least I'm fucking trying
What the fuck have you done?

[Chorus]
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
And it doesn't look that way to me
In my eyes
And it doesn't look that way to me
In my eyes

[Chorus]
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fuckin' wit' other niggas' shit, but they can't be fuckin' wit' mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fuckin' wit' other niggas shit, but they can't be fuckin' wit' mine

[Verse 1]
I was raised in the hood called what the dif?
Where the brothers in the hood, we chivalrous
So I rest defense on my ligaments
Pistol grip pump on my lap, riskin' it
Full life, living it, never giving it back
Too late for slipping, so slack up
On my lap, it's on your lips, so track shot
A steel dick, more clip for pump but
All I'm saying there ain't no question who the man is
In my Civic or in this showbiz
I shit a fool, kill the fool, come on, what you say?
I think I can take care of all you motherfuckers, don't delay right away

[Chorus]
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fuckin' wit' other niggas' shit, but they can't be fuckin' wit' mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fuckin' wit' other niggas shit, but they can't be fuckin' wit' mine

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times, right?
'Cause tricks be out for your blind side
Never understood it, but remember I showed you
That in these times, you gotta look over your shoulder, strap
Well, that ain't nothin' but the intent of gettin' high
And a cop giving you shit for just passing you by
If you're ever in trouble or on the double, best to call your pals
If you ain't got none now, sucka, I got a million
Styles around me
Are we getting along? We family, we better be
We got your back, we got your back, kid
Just don't be pointing one of them guns, aight man

[Chorus]
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fuckin' wit' other niggas' shit, but they can't be fuckin' wit' mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fuckin' wit' other niggas shit, but they can't be fuckin' wit' mine
Everywhere I hear the sound of marching charging feet, boy
'Cause summer's here and the time is right for fighting in the street, boy
Tell me. what can a poor boy do
'Cept for sing for a rock 'n' roll band?
'Cause in this sleepy L.A. town
There's just no place for a street fighting man

A street fighting man
A street fighting man
A street fighting man

Do you think the, time is right for a palace revolution
Where I live, the game to play is compromise solution
Well, then what can a poor boy
'Cept for sing for a rock 'n' roll band?
'Cause in this sleepy L.A. town
There's just no place for a street fighting man

A street fighting man
A street fighting man
A street fighting man
Well, what else can a poor boy do?
Well, what else can a poor boy do?
Well, what else can a poor boy do?
Well, what else can a poor boy do?

Hey, my name is, called disturbance
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants
Well, what can a poor boy do
For sing for a rock 'n' roll band?
In this sleepy L.A. town
There's just no place for

For a street fighting man
A street fighting man
For a street fighting man
A street fighting man
For a street fighting man
A street fighting man
For a street fighting man
A street fighting man
For a street fighting man
A street fighting man
For a street fighting man
A street fighting man
A street fighting man
A street fighting man
A street fighting man
A street fighting man
A street fighting man
A street fighting man
A street fighting man

[Verse 1]
Man walks along the railroad track
He's goin' some place and there's no turnin' back
The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up over the ridge
Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge
The shelter line stretchin' around the corner
Welcome to the New World Order
Families sleepin' in their cars out in the Southwest
No job, no home, no peace, no rest, no rest

[Chorus]
And the highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody as to where it goes
I'm sitting down here in a campfire light
Searchin' for the ghost of Tom Joad

[Verse 2]
He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag
The preacher lights up a bud and takes a drag
He's waitin' for the time when the "last shall be first, and the first shall be last"
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
With a one-way ticket to the promised land
With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock
Bathin' in the city's aqueducts

[Chorus]
And the highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody as to where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
With the ghost of old Tom Joad

[Verse]
Now Tom said
"Ma, whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy
Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
Wherever there's a fight against blood and hatred in the air
Look for me, Ma, I'll be there
Wherever somebody's strugglin' for a place to stand
For a decent job or a helpin' hand
Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free
Look in their eyes, Ma, you'll see me
You'll see me
You'll see me
You'll see me
You'll see me
You'll see me
You'll see me
You'll see me
You'll see me

[Chorus]
And the highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody as to where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
With the ghost of Tom Joad

[Verse 1]
Yo, I was a fiend before I became a teen
I melted microphones instead of cones of ice cream
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
Shot grabbed the mic and try to say, "Yes y'all!"
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small
Cool, 'cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet
Back to the lab, without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the another one, then I make another one
To diss the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
Thought of, cause it's sort of an addiction
Magnetized by the mixing

[Chorus]
E-F-F-E-C-T, a smooth operator operating correctly
An E-F-F-E-C-T, a smooth operator operating correctly
E-F-F-E-C-T, a smooth operator operating correctly
An E-F-F-E-C-T , a smooth operator operating correctly

[Verse 2]
But back to the problem, I got a habit
You can't solve it, you silly rabbit
The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
I fiend for a microphone like heroin
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix
Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
Unawareness? Beware, it's the re-animator
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
An assasinator, if the people ain't stepping
You see a part of me that you never seen
When I'm fiendin' for a microphone
'Cause I take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm
Hype as a hypochrondriac 'cause the rap be one
Hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke
More than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke
More than cracked up, you should have backed up
For those who act up need to be more than smacked up

[Chorus]
E-F-F-E-C-T, a smooth operator operating correctly
An E-F-F-E-C-T, a smooth operator operating correctly
E-F-F-E-C-T, a smooth operator operating correctly
An E-F-F-E-C-T , a smooth operator operating correctly

[Bridge]
A smooth operator operating correctly
A smooth operator operating correctly
A smooth operator operating correctly
A smooth operator operating correctly

[Bridge]
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated, originated

Oh my God, oh my God

[Verse 1: Redman]
Yo they call me Redman on stage slash Gorilla
So big I ride on back of vans like Magilla
My chest is hairy as fuck my back as well
Shit my granddad was built like a half a whaile
We rip through cell doors we don't ask for bail
Happy Gilmore Gorilla whooping ass for real
Beat you down till they knock me for a night in jail
Then I'm back on purple hills so I can jack the jill
They pass the ? I'm drunk tipsy punk
My sweat become whisky I'm looking for Lewinsky
So I can get head, done, get off me girl
I'm crooked like white folks dancin offbeat
Gangsta, I'm waitin for that ape to cross me
Shut up, now you gotta pay for morphine
We are them Gorillaz you starvin the fillers
We deep like parliament members, we're carvin' up winners

[Bridge 1: Redman]
Yo, I hear Gorillaz goin
All my Gorillaz goin

[Verse 2: Redman]
Yo, who's that ape? It's Mighty Joe Young
Lights, camera, action, roll drums
Now let me ask you what it feel like
With a banana in your tail pipe
Immortal, I walk the jungle with my balls showin
See me coming, better leave like when bar closing
At the bar posing with my Sean Combs brim
On the broad to get her bra open
See a Gorilla take it they don't ask
I'm pissed on the boss desk when he laid on cash
My whole state, I'm a grown ass man
Sole survivor I write with Bobby Womack hands
Holding me down when I'm the one
The last one with a bomb and the timer on
You are them Gorillaz you starvin the fillers
We deep like parliament members, we're carvin' up winners

[Bride 2: Redman]
Yo, I hear Gorillaz goin
Yo, my Gorillaz goin
My Minnesota Gorillaz goin
My Detroit Gorillaz goin
My Oakland Gorillaz goin
My Indiana Gorillaz goin
My Atlanta Gorillaz goin
Yo, my Canada Gorillaz goin

[Chorus: Noodle]

Get the cool, get the cool shoe shine (Gorilla)
Get the cool, get the cool shoe shine (Gorilla)
Get the cool, get the cool shoe shine (Gorilla)
Get the cool, get the cool shoe shine (Gorilla)
Ooooooh oh ooooh

[Hook]
For the longest time, I’ve been wantin' my shine, I’m Songz
And I will never let up I’ve been wanting this way too long
Got me sitting so high, trying to balance out the lows
And I think it’s time that I propose a toast

Let’s make a toast to the dickheads that boast ’cause we get bread
Toast to the bad bitches that shit on the ass bitches
Everybody think they’re Jordan so toast to the Pippen’s
Nobody’s the same but we know different
We all want this money right
Everybody trying to eat like it’s money pie
I should live 100 lives I should have 100 wives
In a hundred beds, I should tell her 100 lies
Then I wonder why, when it’s all set and done
Tell me what will I become
I wanna say that I did learn some, earn some
Bad memories I done burn some
Sanitize my hands and now the germs gone
See you niggas is disgusting
Bad bitches worldwide wanna fuck em
You see they treat my dick like lip balm
They know I hit hard, no concussion, come on

[Hook]

Let’s make a toast to the cool tags
Let’s have a toast for the cash flow
Make a toast to a new bag
On the arm of a bad ho
Make a toast to the bad days
So we appreciate the sun rays

If you still don’t understand , stay away as far as you can
Stay away, stay away, stay away as far as you can X 3
Still don’t understand
Stay away as far as you can

This girl I barely even know, scream loud for me
Whore hey no one get to lie of me
See I’m living life with no boundaries
But even a sunny day got clouds you see
I’m floating in the air, I live there
Laid back chair, call me song Air
I got a beautiful beach, you got a beach chair
I’m the big picture and you’re just a small square
But who am I to say I’m better man
I just want this shit forever man
Momma said there will be better days
But when better days came
I knew there were better thangs
I hated me, you telling me this everything
Now quit playing man where’s everything?
The women are amazing, the liquors always tasteful
The party off the chain
But emptiness remains, tell me where’s the love that I’m missing?
From every day kitchen, or a girl thats really down cause I know she’s been around
I feel like something wrong, but everything’s right
Hand quotes in the air read left right
I ain’t trying to bitch I’m living a blessed life
Would I trade it in motherf-cker? Yeah, right
Wack n-ggers can’t hear me nor see me
This is the graveyard, death sight

[Hook]

Let’s make a toast to the good times
Let’s have a toast for the cash flow
Make a toast to a new thang
On the arm of a bad ho
Make a toast to the bad day
So we appreciate the sun rise

You still don’t understand , stay away as far as you could
Stay away, stay away, stay away as far as you could X 3
Still don’t understand
Stay away as far as you can

If I could stand on a cloud and speak out loud to the world below me
Proclaim my name just so that they know me, you see the neighbors know my name
Even the haters love my fame, everybody plays my game
We’ve got mental hypocrisy at such high velocities
When I speak truth, everybody calls me Socrates
I’ve got such a philosophy that everybody’s watching me
Looking at they wrist, shit everybody’s clocking me
Ahhh, there’s no thrill like a slow kill
Standing at the bottom looking at the top
Hoping that they stop blocking me
If I had a day job n-ggers probably stay docking me
See I hate rules, if you said I obey, you ain’t ever know Trey
You ain’t know I’m seasoned like obey
Do re mi so fa la ti do, toast it to the assholes, exclude me through
Please, don’t involve me in that, see I’m a dignified man with a signified plan
And all problems he'll solve them just leave them into his hands

When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Verse 2]
I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his goofy way
I've learned love is like a brick
You can build a house or sink a dead body

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Breakdown]
Ew...
Ew...
In the most Biblical sense, I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute, wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense, I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offensed, or wear ear condom next time

[Bridge]
I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue, and Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to

[Chorus]
Just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby (Just a Holy Fool, woah-oh-oh-oh)
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Ayo, rippin' y'all niggas is the easiest
Y'all style is the nacho cheesiest
Everybody wanna shine, they the greasiest
When they know they bank account is the measliest
You gotta know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to run when my niggas be rollin'
Holdin' your gun, especially if you owe 'em
Watchin' yo back, especially in the mornin'
Now niggas give you a pound and tell you, "Be safe"
Like you carryin' a million dollars in a briefcase
Now you're all paranoid like, "Is this shit laced?"
My niggas come in all black like deep space
When we turn the toast, turn you to a ghost
Any more want they girl to play Demi Moore?
As long as you sure, my point is mainly that
We maniacs, maniacs, nigga, what

[Chorus: sample & Mikkey]
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down, nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round, nigga
"So many rounds"
Even if you gotta slug it out
If you gotta thug it out, thug it out
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down, nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round, nigga
"So many rounds"
A lot of MC's came to my showdown
And watch me put the low down

[Verse 2: Rhymefest]
Nothin' nice when you fightin' for your life
With the ruger, did he shoot him? Did you see it? Was it right?
Did he deserve that? (Naw) Ask 'em maine
Did he know he turned his son to a bastard maine? (What?)
If I see him on the street, I'mma blast him maine
Have a 

[?] and a 

[?] in the casket maine
This guy saw me on the strip, tried to out the thang
I told 'em, "Slow up. This wasn't even about you maine"
He must of thought I was scared though, unprepared though
Oh, no, here come my guys hoppin' out the Volvo
Fo' fo' out in the clear, one shot hit 'em in the ear
Open the trunk, put 'em in here. What it is stick? Put it in gear
You need to know you can't fuck with my blood
We throw you in the trunk, get you drugged
Take you to your own grave, that's the shit you dug
Now it take at least six niggas to pick you up, c'mon

[Chorus: sample & Mikkey]
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down, nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round, nigga

A lot of MC's came to my showdown
And watch me put the low down

[Verse 3: Rhymefest]
Got my money and my loot now, tell the truth now
Don't make me grab the .380, don't wanna shoot ya
You got a little girl? Think about her future
You need an outfit, these slugs should suit ya
Like 5-0 my nigga, I hot pursuit ya
Bullets trimmin' the side of your head like crew cut
Used to be po', never could afford new stuff
Even so we grabbed ski masks to do stuff
All on ten, niggas was high and juiced up
While you livin' with your girlfriend like a moocher
Get your own shit, be about grown shit
When the chrome spit, you can hear a bone split
I don't give a fuck 'bout who you gon' get
After you dead, killin' him is just a bonus
Ding ding ding, you my millionth customer
Yo, K? Why these niggas always think they can fuck with us?

[Chorus: sample & Mikkey]
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down, nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round, nigga
"So many rounds"
Even if you gotta slug it out
If you gotta thug it out, thug it out
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down, nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round, nigga
"So many rounds"

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around and choose your own ground

[Chorus]
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

[Verse 2]
Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one

[Chorus 2]
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave

[John Legend]
Yeah-yeah, ooohhhhhhhhh
So many hard times
Yea-yeahhhhhh, ooohhhhhhhhhh
Yeahhhh-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeahhhh
YEAHHHHH, yeah-yeah
YEAHHHHHHHHHH

Cold, cold eyes upon me they stare
People all around me and they're all in fear
They don't seem to want me but they won't admit
I must be some kind of creature up here having fits
From my party house, I'm afraid to come outside
Although I'm filled with love, I'm afraid they'll hurt my pride
So I play the part I feel they want of me
And I pull the shades so I won't see them seeing me

[Hook: John Legend]
Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found

[Hook: John Legend]
Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found

[John Legend]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
In my party house I feel like meeting others
Familiar faces, creed and race, a brother
But to my surprise I find a man corrupt
Although he be my brother, he wants to hold me up

[Hook: John Legend]
Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found

[Hook: John Legend]
Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found

[Black Thought]
Check it out, seventeen years and counting
Of tryna climb up the rough side of the mountain
Friends warned me I'mma have to do it without them
No problem really, it was never about them
So my house, I never come out from
Cause every day a drought, then a shadow of doubt come
I'm down to do whatever if it betters my outcome
The city's like the Audubon Ballroom waiting on Malcolm
Cause people wanna see my blood flow like fountains
I got nowhere to go and still feel like bouncing
I'm looking for the closest window I can rap from
Or for the highest speaker-box that I can shout from
And I'm hoping to feel like something is real
But it's no hope when you are but a spoke in a wheel
A brick in a wall, tryna find an opening still
Having hard times, tryna climb over the hill

[John Legend]
Yeah, so many hard times, yeah, yeah
Sleeping on motel floors, yeah, yeah
Knocking on my brother's door
Eating Spam, Oreos
Drinking Thunderbird baby, yeaaaaaaahhhh

[Hook: John Legend]
Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found

[Hook: John Legend]

Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found

Yea-yeah, yea-yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeaaaahhh, yeah
Yeah, mmmmm, yeah, yeaaah
So many hard times, yeah, yeah
Sleeping on motel floors, yeah, yeah
Knocking on my brother's door
Eating Spam and Oreos
Drinking Thunderbird baby, ohhhhhhhhh, yeah
I don't wanna do it no more
No-no-no, no-no
I don't wanna go back there no more
No-ohhhhhh
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna..

[Intro: Malik Yusef]
You know you ghetto boy, when you got a face, with a scar
And yo' highest aspirations is a place, and a car
Shorties pull out and bussssst, like a money shot
Now he on the run, he hot
And he hurtin his Granny and she the only one he got
The hood so shady
You give up hope, of ever even tryin to find a sunny, spot-
-light, they caught him at the stop-
-light, but if he woulda run that yellow
Then he coulda, run the globe
But insteed, with speed
They put one in the middle of his frontal, lobe
Like a unicorn
I'm just tryin to keep you, informed
To my little ghetto soldiers in they, gold
Green, red, and blue uni-forms - chuuch!
But I'm feeling like the loneliest monk
So I pull me a Thelonius Monk and blew, the horn
And we don the monikers of goons and gangsters
And are trained to conduct ourselves true, to form
So we add a Shorty, a Money, a Mack
A Lil', a Eazy, or a Young to our name
So all the big ballers grab rims and hung, in the game
And there's a degree, of difficul-ty
To make it from the ghetto boy into the man-hood
Especially when you know that yo' fresh greens
Will help eliminated a canned, good
Can, good, and bad co-exisssst?
In a place with plenty of off ramps but no ex-its

[Black Thought]
My grandmother suits was tailor made, Sundays Mahalia played
Simple familiar ways, like how she kneeled and prayed
Wailin', master forgive us, our trust, pastors had us real afraid
I never listened yet I still obeyed
I got to see how Philly played at such an early age
What my father was into sent him to his early grave
Then moms started chasin that base, like Willie Mays
My childhood was all of 40 nights and 40 days
Trouble was my ball and chain, shorties would call me names
Humble beginnings but a star is what it all became
My journey from a dirty hallway, to the Hall of Fame
Music my therapeutic way to cope with all this pain
Was headed for the drain, soakin before the rainwater came
And chaos, into the order came
I started doin' what I'm 'sposed to do in life
Tryin to move out of the dark, and closer to the light
They say if you get a chance to do it, overdo it right
Tomorrow isn't promised every time, you say goodnight
Knahmtalkinabout? Uhh, yo

[John Legend]
I wish I knew how it would feel to be free
I wish I could break all the chains holding me
And I wish I could say all the things that I should say
Say 'em loud, say 'em clear for the whole world to hear

I wish I could share all the love that's in my heart
Remove all the bars that keep us apart
And I wish you could know what it means to be me
Then you'd see and agree that every man should be free

I wish I could give all I'm longing to give
And I wish I could live like I'm longing to live
And I wish I could do all the things that I can do
Though I'm way overdue I'd be starting to move

Well, I wish I could be like a bird up in the sky
How sweet it would be if I found I could fly
Well, I'd soar to the sun then I'd look down at the sea
Then I'd sing cause I'd know
Yes I'd, sing cause I'd know
Sing cause I know
I know how it'd feel, yeah
Yes I know how it'd feel
Oh, I know... {*fades out*}

[John Legend]
Hope of the world is in our generation (let's straighten it out)
It's all left up to us, to change this present situation (let's straighten it out)
Take caution from our elders, don't make the same mistake (let's straighten it out)
Let's fill the world with love, and get rid of all the hate

Our elders taught us one thing but, practice another
Just look what happened to the Indian and the brother

(Straighten it out!) {*3X*}

Hope of the world is in our generation (let's straighten it out)
It's all left up to us, to change this present situation (let's straighten it out)
Our leaders make us fight, and we don't know what for (let's straighten it out)
If they want people killed, let them fight the war!

It's gotta end somewhere, this killing's got to cease
If no one were to fight, we'd all live in peace

Our generation (let's straighten it out)
It's all left up to us (let's straighten it out)
Our generation (let's straighten it out)
Let's do just what we must
And straighten it out! (Straighten it out)
Gotta straighten it out! (Straighten it out)
Straighten it out! (Straighten it out)
Yeahhh we gon' straighten it out, yeahh!

[CL Smooth]
As long as there's a you, there's a better me
It's why we're together and stronger than they ever thought it could be
A world motherless - can health care cover this?
A love for all people no matter what the culture is
Our generation, is makin huge strides
A self-empowering movement that's on the rise
The more the door is open, the more the youth can see
A fair chance means a greater opportunity
To have a brighter future, deeper insight
Work hard to be anything you want in life
It's what it's all about, the longevity
Educated enough to know what's ahead of me
Need to straighten it out, seek and you'll find
They can cage your body, but not your mind
We lay it all on the line in the struggle
We grew, but together here's what we gotta do

[John Legend]
Our generation (let's straighten it out)
It's all left up to us (let's straighten it out)
Our generation (let's straighten it out)
Let's do just what we must, and straighten it out!

[JL with background singers]
Our generation - straighten it out!
Let's straighten it out - and straighten it out!
Heyyyyyyyyy we can straighten it out, YEAHHH!
C'mon yeah! Our generation - let's straighten it out
Hey hey, we'll straighten it out
We'll straighten it out - straighten it out
New York City, better straighten it out
Atlanta, better straighten it out
In Los Angeles, you better straighten it out
We can straighten it out, we can straighten it out
{*fades out*}
{*23 seconds of instrumental to open*}

[John Legend]
They wait to plead their case, unknown cast aside
I love to see their face, can we spare the lie?
Are we afraid to see them, prisoners of history
These beautiful minds, trapped inside, bring them back to life
Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on

Ooooooohhhhhhhhhh
Aowwwww

So dark when I see sparks, if we don't snuff 'em out
We've gotta let 'em flame, let 'em speak their name
Let 'em reach up to the clouds
Can't eat if we don't feed 'em, can't read if we don't teach 'em
There's no light if we just hide 'em
Don't just let 'em die
Let 'em shine (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine on
Oh let 'em shine on (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine on (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine, on
Ohhhhh sparks flicker, in the distance
Lonely out in space
They sing out, but we're not listening
Cause we don't see their face
We can't let 'em die we can't, make 'em hide
All the little miracles that live inside
Let 'em shine, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Let 'em shine (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine on
Let 'em live (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine on
Let 'em be loved (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine on
Let 'em growwww (yeah yeah yeah) let 'em shine, on
C'mon let 'em love (yeah yeah yeah) hey
C'mon let 'em love (yeah yeah yeah) hey hey hey yeah
C'mon let 'em love (yeah yeah yeah) YEAH-HA-HEAH
C'mon, YEAH-HA-HEAH-HA-HEAHH

Hold 'em close, let 'em know
That they'll get through the night
Ordinary people could, be a hero
Don't put out the light!

Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on {*2X*}
Yeah
Yeayyyyeahhh
Let 'em shine on

[Mike Tyson talking]

[Verse 2]

Ho I go so hard

I travel like b-ball with no calls
I play my role and listen out for the roll call
This is a movie and every movie must go off
But this gangsta doesn't die like O-Dogg
Say what up blood, what the lick read!?
5 star general, in the 6 speed
Still hood like thick cheese, bitch please
Him squeeze quicker than the wind breeze
Niggas betta trim trees
Simply shoot yours empty if b turn dat thick cheese to swiss cheese
Folla me! A part of me!
Fuck around and see a whole notha side of me
I separate yo body with them hollow tips; biologist
Photographies, picture me in yo bedroom with a mask on
Pistol to yo head while you puttin' yo pants on
Peyton Manning offense, Singletary defense
Super-duper-extra-much-really-very-street shit
That is how I keeps it, R.I.P Beepsy
I do it how I do it cuz I know my niggas see me
And I'mma hold it down bitch, hope that crown fit
The boy got a flow, that you can drown in
When you in the water watch them sharks, when you in the water watch dat salt
Young Carter no floss that was so raw ohw!

[Mike Tyson talking]

My style is impetuous
And I'm just ferocious, I want to eat his heart..
..I wanna eat his children
Praise be to Allah!

[Verse 3]

Yawl niggas act like a bunch of bitches, blood bitches leave ya in a tub
Blood bitches, young niggas, Young Money, young niggas, fuck pistols

Big nuts, and they hung further than ya father's

[Mike Tyson talking]

You guys can't define me

Ima, Ima.. Ima hellraiser, Ima father--a lovin' father
Yeah, yeah I'm pretty much Tyson

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
You know us big mouth Harlem niggas don't know how to act
I got my West Coast connection
These dead in the street industry mothafuckas
Talkin' 'bout we can't eat, talking 'bout we brand new guys
Tell them niggas "Suck a dick!"

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I'm camo'd down to my boxers, gold teeth, a Bathing Ape
It's animals in my projects, like monkeys, orangutans
Banana clip on that chopper, I hold heat, bangers bang
(Let Chiquita speak) Bet it keep the peace, that Lil B, brrangadang
I don't care if you blue or you red flagging
Hair swinging, my pants sagging
Hoes all on my bandwagon, your bitch gagging, she jet lagging
All my cuz niggas, what's cracking?
All my blood niggas, what's popping?
I ain't set tripping, I just happen
To know who click-clacking, you mismatching
Fuck swagging, you been jacking, fuck fly, I am fashion
Tryna cop that Benz wagon, my bitch drive it, my friends crash it
Niggas threat with the chit-chatting, see a nigga don't shit happen
I'm finna blow on that Bin Laden, so talk money, pig latin
(Suck my fuckin' dick, bitch!)

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Brand new clip, brand new nine
Brand new bitch, brand new ride
Brand new weed, brand new high
Brand new me, meet the brand new guys
Brand new clip, brand new nine
Brand new bitch, brand new ride
Brand new weed, brand new high
Brand new me, meet the brand new guys

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
.345 be the big toy, now which nigga want it with the fat boy?
Uh, clipped-up like I'm paranoid, high as hell nigga, Fitzroy
Pull it off through the city like "errt"
Seen that ho nigga like "errr," hopped up on a nigga like murk
Put that pussy nigga in a purse
He wouldn't be the first, cover him with dirt (Yeah, uh, shit)
Put him in the ground, he was down to Earth
A napped up nigga, I been down since birth
Backpack full of random work
With two bad hoes, I'll teach you how to jerk
(Teach you how to jerk?) Swaggin' in my Js
Pop me a pill and throw that pussy a rave (Pussy a rave)
My prerogative ways
Nappy chin hairs with the brand new fade (Yeah)
Brand new nigga with the brand new venue
Sold that bitch out, shoulda made that ho bigger
Killing careers make these cupcakes remember
My objective is to serve your agenda
Biggie and Nas put they ass in a blender
Sprinkle some 50 and came out this nigga
Equipped with a gat and a dick in your mouth
Balls in my hands and your bitch in my house
Twisting up weed, I'm digging her out
Just filling her out
Do all that shit you be talking about
While you gone? Shit, Netflix on your couch
What this popcorn about?
Microwave oven while you out there cuffin'
You over there lovin'
That bitch be my stuffing, like, like we really be fucking

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Brand new clip, brand new nine
Brand new bitch, brand new ride
Brand new weed, brand new high
Brand new me, meet the brand new guys

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q & A$AP Rocky]
Brand new shirt to the brand new drawers
Brand new socks to the brand new Glock
This mothafucka hold 15, slap that ho in, tell the clip get lost
Bitch, I'm a boss, pulled up clean, don't you hear the exhaust?
Got my tie on, gripping on my iron on who I'm 'bout to fire on
Rap game fucked up, boy, fuck you think I rap for?
Crack game fucked up, boy, fuck you think I trap for?
Ridin' 'round with that mask on
Like a MAC attack when that strap on
Like a Shaq attack on that backboard, clap on, clap off
Blue pit in my back yard, red nose my bad broad
Titan full of that hydro, pretty nigga, no catwalk
Big burner in your big mouth, pussy niggas suck lead off
I pull it up then skirt off, vodka shots, he smeared off
40 ounce of that Cristal Rosé, that Rick Ross
Got it jumping like Kriss Kross, mismatching, no jigsaw
No horseplay when we quick draw, pussy nigga get a tit job
Hands up, stick your mans up, your time's up, the new brand's up
Q!
I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back

They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me

This is a beat with no words at first, it’s a blank painting
Exercising the mind, it’s brain strength training

My motto is live by the bottle
So why is my supply low? Bring in a truckload with a high-low

My name is Chauncey Billups, I'm kind of like a raunchy Phillips
Screwdriver, my crew's live when you can't sleep and you're still up

I came in this game with, bad intentions
And I ain't budged, not even an inch since then

Lava on my lips I flips, wake up think I have a cramp
I'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass
Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
I'm gonna step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut

Shady man, I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not

[Intro: Akon & DJ Khaled]
Oh oh oh!
DJ Khaled!
Konvict Muzik, oh oh
Cash Money, Young Money, let's go

[Chorus: Akon]
You already know the story
Down this road before (oh oh)
Gotta hold your breath, gotta take your time (oh oh)
If you want a taste of my life
Nothin' good comes easy
Gotta go hard, believe me
Gotta risk it all, gotta roll the dice
If you wanna taste of my life

[Post-Chorus: Akon & B.o.B]
My life, my life (My life, my life)
My life, my life (Yeah, my life, my life)
My life, my life (My life, my life)
You want a taste of my life? (Huh?)

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, they wanna taste that rapper life
But the road of fame usually spoils the appetite
We live the type of dreams you wish for in the afterlife
But all that they can see is velvet ropes and flashing lights
Huh, not everything is lavished life
But in the mirror, all I see is all the nights I had to fight
And so I run it, all I had to sacrifice
But now I got the money
I get everything for half the price
Damn

[Verse 2: Akon]
You know Khaled, everybody wants the good life
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Nobody really wanna pay the price
Ayo, ayo, ayo
No pain, no gain, na-na-na-na
This might take a little longer
No pain, no gain, na-na-na-na
It will only make you stronger

[Chorus: Akon]
You already know the story
Down this road before (oh oh)
Gotta hold your breath, gotta take your time (oh oh)
If you want a taste of my life
Nothin' good comes easy
Gotta go hard, believe me
Gotta risk it all, gotta roll the dice
If you wanna taste of my life

[Post-Chorus: Akon]
My life, my life (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
My life, my life (whoa-oh-oh-oh)
My life, my life (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You wanna taste of my life?

[Verse 3: Akon]
They all wanna make it up to the top
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Khaled, they don't wanna give up everything they've got
Ayo, ayo, ayo
No I can't, no I can't, na na na na
This might take a little longer
No pain, no gain, na na na na
It will only make you stronger

[Chorus: Akon]
You already know the story
Down this road before (oh oh)
Gotta hold your breath, gotta take your time (oh oh)
If you want a taste of my life
Nothin' good comes easy
Gotta go hard, believe me
Gotta risk it all, gotta roll the dice
If you wanna taste of my life

[Post-Chorus: Akon]
My life, my life (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
My life, my life (whoa-oh-oh-oh)
My life, my life (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You wanna taste of my life?
My life, my life (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
My life, my life (whoa-oh-oh-oh)
My life, my life (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You wanna taste of my life?

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
About to change the game
DJ Khaled!
We The Best Forever
Cash Money, Young Money
I'm for real about this shit
Let's go

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green & Ester Dean]
I'm counting my time cause my time is my money (Yeah)
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing (Yeah)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone, sleep when I'm gone (Gone)
I'm looking at the clock like yeah, yeah
Naps to my trash, yeah, yeah-eah (Cause time's on my side so)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone, sleep when I'm gone

[Verse 1: Game]
Yeah, they say sleep is the cousin of death, guess we related
Cause I’m the most slept on and the most hated
Hated, hated by niggas with no hustle
Staring at me in the club like I won't bust you
In the face with this Spades, life is a card game
And I'm playing Spades, gambling with y'all change
Fucking basketball wives while you at away games
Really fucking basketball wives; ain't gotta say names
Whole body tatted like a New York City freight train
Niggas get to barking, put a bullet in the Great Dane
Try me, end up like, "Why me?"
Team full of animals like I coach the Heat
Four floor mansion, close to the beach
Six car garage, that's how I'm supposed to eat
In Miami, rolling up kush on boat decks
Flagging down the waitress, waving my Rolex

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green & Ester Dean]
I'm counting my time cause my time is my money (Yeah)
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing (Yeah)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone, sleep when I'm gone (Gone)
I'm looking at the clock like yeah, yeah
Naps to my trash, yeah, yeah-eah (Cause time's on my side so)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone, sleep when I'm gone

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, I done survive the test of time doing this shit so long
And only rest to rise again homie, I sleep when I'm gone
Look, a legend while I'm prime, so current and they hate this
The streets classified me as another level of greatness
I don't fight for crowns at all, I let wack niggas bitch
And let 'em flip while they debate on who the king of this shit
Listen, see I don't waste time debating over them things
Because I'm God motherfucker, God create kings, bust it
I'm hearing that a lot of niggas mad through the grapevine
Piano sounding beautiful and sad at the same time
The feeling at a funeral, so study you niggas
Khaled provide the theme music while I bury you niggas
See now there's no escaping the God, you better find a getaway
'Fore I start wiling like Haitians and Jamaicans when it's Labor Day
Khaled, every time you know, we gotta make 'em love it
Realize that everything is hotter when we touch it

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green & Ester Dean]
I'm counting my time cause my time is my money (Yeah)
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing (Yeah)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone, sleep when I'm gone (Gone)
I'm looking at the clock like yeah, yeah
Naps to my trash, yeah, yeah-eah (Cause time's on my side so)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone, sleep when I'm gone

[Verse 3: Game]
Ayo, Khaled let this shit breathe
Spoiled little rich nigga, that's me
Smoke blowing out the sunroof, blowing on hashish
Can't stop now cause I'm in too deep
One point five wired every two weeks
Niggas wanna kill me, let the shells fall out
Life insurance and plates, my kids gon' ball out
They kids gon' ball out, twenty years from now, pulling cars out
You gon' think cocaine getting hauled out
X getting shipped in
Crystal meth getting dipped in all cause you let a nigga slip in
Aftermath, '05, G-Unit, '06
Everything else is gymnastics, watch the dough flip
Sitting on the couch, smoking up memories
Pouring Jack Daniels, toast to my enemies
Fuck beef, nigga, I ain't got the energy
Take the last shot to the dome, John Kennedy

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green & Ester Dean]
I'm counting my time cause my time is my money (Yeah)
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing (Yeah)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone, sleep when I'm gone (Gone)
I'm looking at the clock like yeah, yeah
Naps to my trash, yeah, yeah-eah (Cause time's on my side so)
Why close my eyes? I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone, sleep when I'm gone

Minoring in fucking awesome settlements
We better win,and Bastards in them Wolf Gang lettermans
Ski Mask to cover the face features
We rapin' the cheerleaders they needin' they knee pads
Sucking up all the white like their tummy's made for the bleaches
The teachers are getting antsy and acting like fucking pansies
Assault rifles for teachers wanna' romance me
Mr. Lee had his hands where his youngest teen daughter hands be
Now she wanna' sit down because she can't stand me
So I made her an amputee wooden planks where her legs be
Eat ass like candy, giving niggas more head than BrandUn
Her blow jobs feel fanwork, she's just a normal L.A bitch
With her hand work, she fuckin' stuck up
Know how to Hollywood and Jerk,(Me off)

[Hook]
Dem Hoes, I tell you bout them hoes

[Verse 1]
Ottoman couch, how handsome your furniture
Lovelier now, but dressed for a funeral
Begging you to sit for a portrait on the wall
To hang in the dark of some parliamentary hall

[Verse 2]
Elegant clothes you want to be seen with her
Under your tweeds you sweat like a teenager
Begging you to sit for a portrait on the wall
To hang in the dark of some parliamentary hall

[Chorus]
Today is for you
They laid it out for you, for you
There will be six bells a-ringing and white women singing for you
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel, too

[Verse 3]
All of the cards and all of the time it took
Soon it's all lines of red in a leather book
Begging you to wait for a minute by the door
Your creeping feet where they've never been before

[Chorus]
Today is for you
They laid it out for you, for you
There will be six bells a-ringing and white women singing for you
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel, too

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
See, it started at the park
Used to chill after dark
Oh, when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart
'Cause we both thought
That love last forever (Last forever)
They say we're too young
To get ourselves sprung
Oh, we didn't care
We made it very clear
And they also said
That we couldn't last together (Last together)

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
See, it's very defined
You're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You haffi get declined
Oh Lord, my baby is drivin' me crazy

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
It was back in '99
Watchin' movies all the time
Oh, when I went away for doin' my first crime
And I never thought
That we was gonna see each other (See each other)
And then I came out
Mami moved me down south
Oh I'm with my girl who I thought was my world
It came out to be
That she wasn't the girl for me (Girl for me)

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
See, it's very defined
You're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You haffi get declined
Oh Lord, my baby is drivin' me crazy

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

[Verse 3: Sean Kingston]
Now we're fussin'
And now we're fightin'
Please tell me why
I'm feelin' slighted
And I don't know
How to make it better (Make it better)
You're datin' other guys
You're tellin' me lies
Oh, I can't believe
What I'm seein' with my eyes
I'm losin' my mind
And I don't think it's clever (Think it's clever)

[Outro: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal, suicidal

My jewels have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My people die over colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

[Verse 1: The Game]
Check it! I'm the Bastard Of The Party, shit start off off coke and bacardi
Bandanas tied around the dubs on the Ferarri
I'm the bloods to what Pac was to thugs
What Snoop is to crips I'm the California king
Let it be known, I reign Supreme like Kenneth McGriff
Reincarnated put me in Queens and give me a strip
A couple red tops while the feds watchin
Infiltrate get a head shot Compton is the city of God
My block originators I said blood one on a Dr. Dre track
Now the world is affiliated
Some authentic some niggas Milli Vanilli bangers
Some get smoked others smoke chronic out of philly papers
Game time is really Jacob watches got them silly faces
Add red rubies to the dial they 'gon really hate us
I inherited gang bangin from my mother
And what I didn't get from her I picked up watchin colors

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
Jamaica have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My jewels have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My people die over colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
I'm from a world of different colors different faces
Different slang different races different gangs different places
Air Ones different laces
Different culture different livin different thugs different ages
The sky's blue the money's green the weed is purple
The ice is white you try me I'm a have to hurt you
Kingston boy I rep like no other
Black, yellow and green I bleed the Jamaican colors
The grill is cold the wheels is gold the chrome is silver
Nickel plated if it's blazin than the chrome will kill ya
Certain dudes get one in the head
Certain places you wear certain colors you dead
Fi yuh gang bang yuh diss mi yuh a dead man
Cau gunshot a be like drum pan weh mi come from
And it's the same old story
We don't give a damn about your guts and glory

Painted the car blue, that's for the sweat and blood
In my red tennis shoes fool cause the pain is love

Purple and the strawberry philly up in my five coupe
Yeah I'm in the yellow boss, they in the white gold
You might fold I'm platinum go ask them white hoes

Gettin cheese out a rat trap like I'm that close
Whippin keys in the back that's how I stack dough
Waitin on that jack boys get him in his afro
These assholes must be gone on that crack smoke
Try to cross the boss well let's front 'em what they ask for
Uh! I'm in the thangs, ten tennis chains

Standin in the street wavin my flag in the middle lane

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

[Verse]
Have you ever felt
Something evil
Lurking around
The moon is full
The streets are empty
Shadows cover the town
You can't call it
You can't shake the feeling
Quiet do not make a sound
But the wind seems to speak
Something's here in the room with me

[Hook]
I know that something is wrong here
I can feel it but no one believes me
I know that something is strange here
I can sense it but no one believes me

[Hook]
I feel like something is wrong here
I can sense it but no one believes me
I'm not crazy hell no I'm not loony
I'm not insane
Take a second
I heard it
I know it
Whispers say my name
Calling for me
Where do I go
Where should I run

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell her "now gon' pop that pussy for a real nigga"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord is my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hoola hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm, Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Chorus: Drake]
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I tell her "go on! Pop that pussy for me"
Haters can't see me but bitches still looking for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about "I" give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry, call that "wine and dine"
Try to check me and I'mma have em checkin pulses
They say "choose wisely" that's why I was chosen
Rocking like the asphalt, it's the cash's fault
Looked in the face of death and took it's mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face South and her ass North
But I'm Ray Charles to that bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

[Chorus: Drake]
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Pandemonium, she cause that
Toss it up, and I stuff 'em where her draws at
That's on everything like feets that's on my floor mats
Red bottoms, spikes on 'em, that's dos stacks
Speakin' Spanish while she tannin', body no fat
Shawty body body got me on my 4th stack
Pink champagne, order Moët
Rollin' airplanes, where I land at?
I levitate over numbers you niggas never make
The Columbians callin', I tell 'em "perate"
Every summer I celebrate with a new estate
Let's get the fuck out this club, call it the great escape
She wrap her lips 'round a nigga, just like a chinchilla
Crap table Bellagio, I'm a big tipper
My life a stage I need her just to stand on it
Every time she look back, I toss a band on it

[Chorus: Drake]
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

[Verse 1]
If a tree fell in the forest
And no one was around to hear it
Baby, does it go boom?
Does it go boom?
If I have love for ya
But you were never close enough to feel it
Is my love any good?
Is my love any good?
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But the distance ain’t even a room away
You’re laying in the bed right next to me
But there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I’m conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulder
You’re cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

[Chorus]
How do I stay in love with your rubbish
All the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel

[Verse 2]
I know you’re somewhere in there
Sometimes I wanna pick up a hammer
And start chiseling away, away
Chiseling away, away
Girl my phone bill is crazy
The rate is sky high when I call ya
But you only let it ring
You only let it ring, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But the distance ain't even a room away
You’re laying in the bed right next to me
Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I’m conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You’re cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

[Chorus]
And how do I stay in love with your rubbish
Shorty leftovers in garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel

[Bridge]
Stomp, stomp
I think I hear ‘em coming down the hall
He don’t hear a word I say at all
I’m wishing these 4 walls could talk, talk
Oh, stomp, stomp
I think I hear ‘em coming down the hall and
He don’t hear a word I said, oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I’m conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You’re cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

[Chorus]
How do I stay in love with your rubbish
All the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel

Hey girl, who you bites off
Guess you dangerous

Wait, this is not funny

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful girl

You know you are killin' me
See these cuts on my wrist
Sike! What I look like?
I am way too busy feelin' my self
These cuts are princesses, baby
Ain't no way I'm killin' myself
If I'm thinking suicide
It must be them phantom doors
Your boy 'bout bringing toys out
Maybe they should call me Santa Claus
Picture me Cobain-ing, Belushi cocaine-ing
Why would I go blaming or even stoop to go naming?
Proclaiming shorty the reason
I'm thinking of trigger squeezing
I'm cold as winter season
Be cool as autumn breezes
I do what I pleases
Jesus, he just switch women like Regis
Life is so beautiful!

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You had me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn, all these...

You make me happy (ooh)
Any then you hurt me, badly
I'm a thug on the street, but a thug got feelings
And I don't want to be hurt (please)
So don't play with me, keep it real with me
And you won't get hurt girl
Went to church, asked God to help me with it
I, I had to holla
Cuz I seen what's in them jeans got Lil Boosie suicidal
I don't know what to do but I know one thing
I wanna lose
I say Sean, I'm so convinced that she the one, I'm confused, bruh
But she brighten up my day when I see her (When I see her)
Then she turn right back around and be a cheater
Them sexy lips and them sexy hips
They make me come back
We fight at day and sex at night
And I'm loving that
Them USA girls, them Jamaican girls
They shake that thing the best
They look you in the eyes and take your heart out of your chest, yes

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You had me suicidal, suicidal, suicide

When I was locked up, I couldn't wait to get loose
'Cause back in the days, on the side where it's at
A nigga had to have a fat stack
And I was a fool, don't make me have to grab my strap and go
Rat-tat-tat-tat, nigga slap to a motherfucker face he fall
Can't none of y'all niggas see the Doggy Dogg
'Cause I'm one rude bwoy comin with the wickedness
So shut the fuck up, and listen while I'm kickin this

[Hook]
Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg (pump pump)
Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg (pump pump)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now you can look to the Sun and spot the moon
And see Snoop Doggy Dogg step into the room
With the G funk, he funk, she funk, we funk
Follow me, follow me, listen to the words that a nigga (pump pump)
I come down with the wickedness
One rude bwoy comin with the dopeness (blam!)
Close your eyes 'cause you can't see me
I quit school 'cause of recess, you fuckin B.G
I'm shakin up the party, like Lodi Dodi
Is he the dopest? You better aks somebody
When, then, send some gin
And a pack of zig zags now let the games begin
In nineteen-motherfuckin-ninety-three
I'm fuckin up every nigga known in the industry
Check this out, it's a Dogg Pound thang
You know who I am you know my motherfuckin name, who am I?
(The S-N-Double-O-P) nickname (Silky Slim) last name (D-O-double-G)
The behavior and the flavor that I found
Makes me wanna hit that ass up with the Dogg Pound

[Hook]
Blam blam, blam to dem all

Blam blam, blam to dem all

[Verse 3: Lil' Malik]
Now just back up, don't act up, I pack up much heat
Any battle I'm in, I win, I can't be beat
Don't sleep while I creep peep out my technique
I forgot, I'm out of sight so you can't see the
MC of the year, you hear and you fear
I got somethin for them niggas in the front and the rear
I handle the sides, did a driveby in the who-ride
I'm satisfied now everything is really alright
You know when I come nigga I come wicked
Don't need no permission, motherfucker I'ma kick it
Niggas sweat my shit I wet 'em up with the biscuit
Lick 'em up shot, it don't stop, till dem all drop
Make up your mind, go pop or slang rocks
Just stop, ridin' on the next nigga's jock
I'm strapped with my Glock on your block
And ready to let loose on the first imitator that I spot

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Lil' Malik]
Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg (pump pump)
Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg (pump pump)

[Interlude]
The stock market has always been 100% when it comes to pussy
The worlds oldest profession
Yah it's still alive
No matter what the consequences
A trick 'gun still buy it
No matter how sick they make it
A hard stick gunna still wanna play it
Marching up, every day and every night
To the drummers beat
Titled the oldest profession, and it never fell back
Not even in the recession
No Christmas toys for the kids
Yah daddy fucked it up
He said he was drunk playing poker with the boys
Yah niggas pay for pussy
Remember that Easter Sunday
It was so damn sunny
We didn't get no Easter clothes, candy, or Easter bunny
Yah, daddy fucked it up
Rollin' dice with the boys
Yah niggas pay for pussy
Whether it's at the titty bar
Or outta the car
Yah niggas pay for pussy
Oh yah, Some niggas pay for pussy, oh yah
Some niggas pay for pussy, oh yah
Some niggas pay for pussy, oh yah
Dem niggas pay for pussy, oh yah
Niggas pay for pussy, oh yah
Intro:
G shit, LBC shit, remember how it used to be?
Mmm, you remember so much
No we didn't, see if you can remember this shit

(Verse 1)
1982 now what was I to do
All I wanna do is claim RTC
Cuz all of my homies from ICG
So we gon do this thang for tha LBC
Cuz we all one love and yeah this tha dub
On my eleven gettin slicker
Buyin liquor from a non-liquor store
Quick to dick a ho and get tha big homie for a 64
He ain't gon miss it though
Cuz I'm too slick for him to notice it was gone
But I fucked up and scraped his chrome
Now he's tryin to take my dome
Hangin out all in front of my home
Now I got to get some of my chrome on my own
Now it's really on
Cuz I'm a dome this nigga and get him for his shit
Put tha switches on his riches
Now his bitch is my bitch
Ain't that a trip how I'm a crip
But I won't hesitate to test another rep
See thats the plan I was brainwashed not to know
But nigga fuck what you goin through this 2-0
And by tha time I'm 17 if I ain't in tha pen
I'm on a mission wit tha homeboys mashin again
Ridin, hoo-bangin like Mack 10
Back on tha streets again and strapped in
I'm lookin for tha niggas wit tha wrong fingas up
Nigga I don't give a fuck, nigga I don't give a fuck em
Straight bang, bang, bang, bangin, bangin
Chorus:
Shoot em up, shoot em up bang bang
It's all fair in tha gang bang
X2

I feel like livin it up
I mean will like livin it up, you know
Bang to tha boogie and boogie to tha bang
Tha sound of mi nina when she feel tha need to sang

(Verse 2)
I got a gang of bitches who ride for me now
Not to mention tha homeboys locked down in tha p now
See now tha road get shaky but you can't break
Watch out for them hoodrats, snakes
Cuz E told me a little story that left me kinda hurt
The lil homie did too much dirt and got worked
Now he's on the run and dyin of thirst
Stayin at his girls spot on 21st
And when he gets snitched on that ain't tha worst
Cuz he might not make it to tha last verse
But meanwhile back in tha p now
Me and my niggas is representin LBC style
Straight hoo-bangin and slangin cigarettes
I shank ya baby brotha just to get a rep
We straight bangin
*Chorus  x4

(Verse 3)
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life, yeah right
What you join tha game for you lil busta
Now you wanna cross us out and disrespect us
Musta thought we was bustas or sumthin
I drop two niggas I don't need you niggas
Thats tha one thang I learned about tha gang bang
If you gon gang bang
Ya gots to be able to bang by yourself man
So whether you bangin for crip or blood
You better bang for sumthin young thug
Cuz you'll get banged on not by bangas
But by Johnny Law cuz they love to hang us (I hear ya)
I ride wit ya dogg if you can get me to tha border
My baby mama flipped out and dipped out wit my daughter
I oughta trip on that bitch I oughta flip on that bitch
I can't trip cuz she look like my daughter and shit
So I'm a load up my clip and go ridin high
And every police car that I see ridin by
I autograph their car wit my brand new lid
Drinkin to tha set and hope my dogg young have head
Throwin up DPG for L-I-F-E cuz thats all I see
Wit love for the LB
Chorus (w/ Snoop)

[Kurupt]
Now this side gangsta walk (say what?)
And this is how gangsta's talk (like that?)

[Breakdown: Kurupt]
Tell 'em how we do, tell 'em what we do
This is what we do nigga - gangsta's talk!
Tell 'em one more time - gangsta talk!
All the homies in the hood - gangsta talk!

[Kurupt]
To my nigga Eastwood - gangsta talk!
Kurupt and Daz - gangsta talk!
Gangsta's ride, uhh, do what gangsta's do
Bandanna hangin from the rear view
Too smart, load them up, hold 'em up (though)
We could go head up, and I'll fold 'em up slow
There's a gangsta loose, callin all cars
Just left the house in some blue Allstars
Passin by on them thang, it's a brown MC
Niggas goin buffin DPG (Dogg Pound, Dogg Pound)
Niggas mad doggin bumpin a bank account (wood)
But I don't recognize the busta
So I hit up the hood, wit one hand on the heater
The other in the air, Dogg Pound gangsta's yo, we don't care
I gots to watch myself - especially my health, before anything else
My life, my wealth, I'ma G, and I do what gangsta's do
And they do it like me and my G Tray Deee

[Snoop Dogg]
Bitch talkin shit, I'm finna dip
Call up my niggas and say "Yo, don't even trip"
DAZ and my nigga Kurupt
Came through in a MC and scooped me up
Aiiyo, I got the sack as I usually does
Young Gotti in the back seat fucked up cuz
Man it's a shame how my gang-gang-bang
No disrespect but, hey, we run thangs
In the ? lets see what quest over seas
Eightball slippin, Dogg Pound trippin
Back in the mo', where we don't give a fuck
My baby brother N-Y-A, and he just he got stuck
By them same motherfuckers who supposed to be killin me
Peelin me, and ya niggas ain't feelin me
Bad news, seem to travel fast
When you on the mash, and all about'cha cash
All my niggas in the pen, gangsta talk
And all my homies sippin Hen', gangsta talk
And If ya can't get out, and you mad as hell
Say "Biatch," that'll make ya sound for real

[Daz Dillinger]
Haha..
Fuck wit us we, gon' hurt somebody
Fuck wit us we, gon' hurt somebody
Corleone, Dillinger, Young Gotti
Fuck wit us we, gon' hurt somebody
Cha-pow!  Layin all these wack niggas down
Churned out, blowned out, work high, hell
Whattup?  I see my niggas all in the cut
Layed back, actin a nut, waitin 'till we 'rupt
No remorse, as we bust, let her feel the dust
Let 'em do what we gotta do, fuckin shit up
Let it be known - Daz Dillinger, rough to the bone
And all alone through ya neighborhood at high exhaust
High stylin and profilin, niggas comin after me
In actuality they face the technicality
Let 'em feel the battle, it was a tragedy
Everywhere a nigga die for the salary
Pray to God, pray to Lord, watch after me
Prepair the back sniff streets mentality
It's the gang and we mad and we walk and we stalk
And we do what we do after dark
Niggas keep doin what the fuck they gotta do
And we do what we do when we mash wit our crew bitch (ssh!)
Dillinger, willin ya and killin ya
Doin what I gotta do, it's blood that I'm spillin ya (yeah)
All over your floor; tell the fat guy "Ignore"
Break down your door and let kick ya one more!

Gangsta strait out! (bitch)

Punk-ass bitches, sucka-ass niggas

What? Man, you want to get out the game? Come on man
You can smoke a pound of bud everyday
You got a big screen TV, man, you wanna give all this up?

Nigga, is you crazy? That's the American Dream, nigga
Well, ain't it?
Fool, you better come on in
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold up Snoop
Hey, nigga, I put five dollars on the weed
You better quit fucking with me

[Dr. Dre + Gylan Kain]
(Smoke inhale)
It's time to get busy in this motherfucker
Like we always do about this time

[Snoop Dogg: Verse 1]
I'm sittin' in a over crowded tank
I'm tryna see which nigga these niggas plottin to gank
Cause if it's me, it's on (Sup, homie)
Loc, the Ese wit the black knights just got stole on
And he fell to the ground
Plus, his homie's ain't around so he better get a beat down
It's not a jack for his scratch nor his shoes
It's life in the county and the county gives plenty blues
One point for the black guys
They rolled him up, swelled and belled
And left him with two black eyes
He still alive so he know what's next
Any nigga they catch slippin' they gon' put him to rest
So I made my best to protect my chest
On point all night cause if I sleep I might
Not make it in this world of fools
I might come up missin' if I'm slippin' in these County Blues

1 - Niggas fuck around in they County Blues
You might come up missin', if you snooze you lose
You confused the fuckin system, when you need I be
Why? Cause it's this is gangbangology

[Snoop Dogg: Verse 2]
See the first verse got'cho ass scared
But hold up, you gotta take a trip upstairs
Where the fools always wonderin?
Young nigga, welcome (welcome)

{*interlude*}

[Snoop Dogg: Verse 3]
I be "God damn nigga, what'chu gon' do?"
Stay down for yo grits cause he who slips, gets licked
And stuck, fucked and all that
Boy when you get out you betta not never come back
I tell you that'll make a punk hard
Put him on a killer row, where the killers kill and disregard
Say you don't gang-bang
Well why your homie - baby boo callin you by ya gang name? (Sup nigga?)
Uhh, later that night, a whole 'nother fight
But it's aiight, cause it's a nigga and a white
But damn, the Ese's is deep
And it look like they straght tryna creep, you peep?
Creep like T-L, on the D-L
But you fail, tryna tell Deputy Bell
Well, that shit was disrespectful, nigga
You ran out on the brotha's
That's what'chu got checked for, and deck for
Nigga you'se a ho (you'se a ho)
Uhh, and I'mma let you know (let you know)
I mean, niggas is bitches, when they get behind the wall
But I ain't talkin 'bout all y'all
Cause I know some niggas from the C-P-T
And some big homie's from the L-B-C and South Central
Niggas y'all know, y'all is the looniest
Keep it true and ya County Blues doin' this
Repeat 1

{*singer's sings until fade*}
Chorus:
You remind me of somebody
I used to know, I used to know

Snoop ***talkin w/ chorus***
Ya'll ain't even gonna believe this shit man
Remember that bitch I had
That little light skined bitch
Yea this bitch was a trip
You know how she loved to sucked a niggas dick
Every once in a while this bitch got to the point to
Where she thought she was gonna be getting
Some here and there
I told her I wasn't tryin to have that
And the bitch wipped out
So check this out

Verse One: Snoop Doggy Dogg

I'm at home, layin low
Everything is everything waitin on my hoe
I know its hard to imagne that a nigga on my status
Had a night like tonight look here I'm glad
Came to an end
My girlfriend slid into the bedroom with a woman
Come in, is what she said closed the door and jumped in the bed
Baby would of gave a nigga head insted of flippin and trippin
I run along with the PG, hm
And that's on DP
I mean what could I say, what could I do
Anything I say and do is a catch 22
And I knew I had a clue
Of some type of suspion
Tuesday night when I see you up at peanuts fishin'
I wasn't really trippin
At first I wasn't gonna go dippin
Then I said damn look at all these bitches
I went inside couldn't believe my eyes
Snatch up four fly bitches, time to ride
Tell by the earl pull the Bently in front
Hit me with a G thang, fuck a blunt
Ridin at the highway, thangs is going my way
Tell the bitches that we be goin to my place
Fellin like Teddy Pendagrass on the freeway
Get my dick knocked off, in a G way
Yea they know the program is set
And lovin each other and lovin my dick
It's a trip but I don't see nothin wrong with it
So you can work your thang which is Snoop
And I'ma sip this drank, thank and recoop
Cuz when you close the bar down
You know what {you know what}
Baby you a star know
Hook 2X: Snoop w/ chorus
I can't fuck no head doctor
I don't give a fuck even if the bitch is proper
She might be cute, she might be thick
But she will get G'd if she don't suck dick

Verse Two: Swoop G

Man I wanted to fly
When it come to what these women say
You know I'm the coldest
Cuz I spit that shit you niggas thank
Like proper, pimpin', prevence for preformances
I have my baddest bitch go get my grip
Go walk the strips, her ten toes touch the payment for mine
You know the time, cuz when it's time to make the payment  of mine
My bitch grind, make that G's stack come back and gimme that
All of that proper amount yea, my full count
And now she wants to have sex with me
I told her please sell my piece make my portion a fee
And I'm put you in position for victory
As long as you follow directions carefully
So I flossed her for a month, nephew you know whats up
I keep a bad broad servin that raw and uncut
So I send her up in peanuts for the trickin
She ran into this nigga and some bitches
Who talkin bout he gone pay in a real way
No more be said, break off the big heads
And you can get that, hit that, and split that
Boss up muthafucka and you can pimp that
Hook: Swoop G w/ chorus
I can't fuck no head doctor
I don't give a fuck even if the bitch is proper
She might look cute, she might be thick
But she fuck with Swoop
The bitch gon get pimped

I can't fuck no head doctor
I don't give a fuck even if the bitch is proper
She mignt look cute, she might be thick

So you know she gettin' pimped

**Snoop & {Swoop} talkin**

Hook 2X: Snoop w/ chorus

And all I want for Christmas is forty city hoppin'

And I heard through the eastside you spend to get some dough
So when you get your funk, go take to the store
Take it to daddy rap cause hes a pro-fessional
Guaranteed to get your shit up off the flo'

Everybody in my family is nervous and waitin'
How can I be patience?
Look at what I'm facin'
They ain't the ones that gonna be riding to the station
So it what it all boils down to just some inspiration
Interpretation, the conversation you had with the judge
Of all judges budge this
And put it in perspective all praises due, true
We are living in a world
Where anything can go at anytime
And if you ain't up on the game
Then I suggest you rearrange
Cause change gone come
And it ain't waitin on no one
For all the drama I done went through
To get this to ya
How do I think I was gone do ya
Have you been mislead, since I asked you all to creep with me
You coundn't be cause ever since its been DP
LB-B.S chronic in my chest
Deathrow doggystyle holding down the west
With a shot of what gangstas drink
And a took off for a choke off, the most kept my G's off a toast

That when you're black, everybody tryna take yo stack
Now watch out for the rat pack
From the black, yo' niggas in the front, yo' niggas in the back
Yo' niggas who got stack, and yo' niggas who got 'Lacs
Yo' niggas who don't get it, but yo' niggas who pack
Now you gotsta have a full game, cuz if you gone be black
You gotsta watch out, cuz these niggas want stacks
These niggas on a mission and they have to rat pack
They don't give a fuck, cuz these niggas is black

And try to put you up on game and try to show ya
That if you ain't black, you besta get a white lawyer
Cuz I'mma tell ya and give ya the game, that
Being black is like being in the yang
Cuz they always gone label you, always gone fable you
And always gone point at you when somethin go down
And I knew, that it would be me, and not jiz-ou
Cuz they know that I roll, with the biggest black criz-ew
And we all about gettin green
But when your black tryin to get green
It's hectic, know what I'm mean?
Cuz they always gonna, stop ya - drop ya - pop ya - mop ya
And then they gonna sweep ya, up under the rug
No more gangbangin, no more hidin out thug

Cuz these niggas on a mission, a mission to kill
And they ain't askin nobody and that's a fact
You better watch out if your black

Better watch your back and step up your game
Beware, beware
We all people
Tell me when we gonna get cheated the same

[Snoop over Hook]
Uh, it's true that when your black, they out for ya stack
Gotta watch ya back, cuz niggas is niggas
And that's part of being black
You gotta keep ya eyes on ya stack
These niggas gone getcha black, uh it's real
It's a fact, cuz ya gotta watch yourself when your kinda black
Be real, watch ya back
Cuz if you don't these niggas gone getcha black

[Snoop Dogg]
Now you wonder why I put so much pressure on my brothers
But niggas is niggas, and I can't put it no other -
Way, just play and say what you wanna say
Niggas is the same all throughout the USA
I been around the world, and I came on back home
And niggas is the same, they always try to get ya boy
They like dogs, squabblin, tryin to get yours
But if you ain't gone open it, they knock down the doors
They gone take what they get, gonna get what they take
And if you gone be fake, check that shit from the gate
If you afraid of the dark, then stay out the alley
They got blacks being blacks way out in the valley
I used to be afraid, like to be shook up
Cuz niggas like you always leave the game hooked up
Tryna get yours, but you gone get it too fast
Cuz I'mma tell ya, watch them niggas
Cuz them black ass niggas on the move in the mash boy
And niggas don't care cuz they out for cash and they know
If they catch you slippin, they gettin you and gettin away
Its part of the pay, its part of the day, they do it they way
And if you black it goes on like ev-er-y-day
I don't know black on black, black for black
But blacks take off on blacks
Blacks need to realize and wake up
And see we all one color, all one game
You my sister, you my brother
So you my daddy, or you my mother
I don't know but I know we all realated
And if we stay down there's no way that they can fade it
But that's just a game peice from me to y'all
But if black on black gone continue to brawl
Then black gone fall, then black knah
Y'all better wake up and check out the black Dogg

[Male singer]
So Snoop Dogg speak the real
It don't even make a difference if it got matching sho'real

[Snoop Dogg]
Uh, its like that
Then your black, they out for ya stack
And its a fact, when your black, ya can't come back
Cuz if ya go to the hood, they watchin you
They will lurk in you, they gonna get you
Cuz your not payin attention, you led a nigga too much
But that nigga straight snitchin

[Hook - Male singer]
We all people
So tell me what we do to get cheated the same
Oooooohhh
Beware people
Better watch your back and step up your game
Beware, beware
We all people
Tell me when we gonna get cheated the same
Beware people
Better watch your back and step up your game

[Snoop Dogg over Hook]

Haha too black y'all

Uh it's too black y'all
Yea it's like that y'all
Yea it's too black y'all
Yea it's like that y'all
Uh, I'm too black y'all

[Verse 1]
Now... who got the beat that makes ya bump?
And who got the thump that makes ya cum?
Well, I got the funk that makes ya bump
So we gon funk this motherfucker right on up
Well here's a toast to the boogie while I step on in
So put your lighters in the air and let the smoke kick in
I got the motion, the potion
And once Priest hit the groove everything is in motion
We coastin through the neighborhood and lookin around
And all of my homies on lock down, or either underground
Man, I done found the only way to put mine down is to dip, skip with the homies from the Dogg Pound
Sup, Bow-Wow, how my nigga feelin?
Oh, I'm on the money mission to get a pocket full of millions
Like Sicilians, we do it mafioso
Doggy style, Dogg Pound, Death Row is the logo
I do it by my lonely cause I'm true to the code
Plus I die with the homies cause that's all I really know
Who started with me, who departed with me
Through thick and thin we heartless-ass G's
Regardless, let's see with bifocals, don't try the locals
And y'all wonder why they despise my vocals
I Fold you like crystals, rap spittin like clips do
When I dismiss you, me and my click, fool

[Chorus]
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?

[Verse 2]
To be a high rolla, you need a pistola
And about a half a key of some Coca Cola
Now that I got older, I got a little colder
And I don't trip to get a chip off my nigga's shoulder
Man dreams of a gangsta, being like Cagney
Or Bogey for Snoop Doggy
Ain't no follower, man, I'm a general, so when I put it down I gots to be so original
I'm quick to bust, just like Daz Dillinger
But that's the little homie, and I'm the big homie, Snoop Don Corleone
Spittin three words up in lightning
As long as I'm bouncin with this I know you likin this
Fo' sho tho, you can't take my photo
I'm layin around in the DPG in a grey fo-do
Get pushed around downtown in the back of a car
The Double R from the dirt to the stars

[Chorus]
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?

[Verse 3]
Well in verse three, the worst see?
After part two, know when I start the clock there be a heart, too
And just the two of us, gonna show you how we do
I thought you knew we bust
I demolish, stay polished, got no time to rust
No dividing, multiplying cause it's never too much, like Luther
Cause ya see ain't no loser
That can get the scoop on the Super Duper Snooper
I refuse the tactics, you ain't used to drastics
I choose to mash like Land Cruisers
You know I kizick the bomb digga-dee, bomb-ba-zee
They can't get with the D-O double G
You know MC slash master of ceremonies
Runnin thangs, pullin strings call me Snoop Pesci
Lesson, blessin', stressin' manifest me
Don't wanna test me, I'm guaranteed to let it rest, see?

[Chorus]
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I?
*Also On "Tha Doggfather" (Tear 'Em Off) Me & My Doggz*

(Snoop Dogg)
I was sittin at the pound about to eat dinner
Had a hard day at the studio, I was gettin thinner
My nigga Spanky-Loc was playin basketball
And my niggas in the backyard, 'bout to squab my Doggz
Dirty Red gets CREAM, it's a good scheme
But you know it's all a part of the Corleone team
I squabble, fight cos that's what I do
Dogg Pound for life nigga, uhh thought you knew
But you didn't, you think I'm kiddin nigga, my Doggz scrap
They get down for theirs, bring em right to the back
Hit the gate don't wait and ask the homey Nate
He gotta pit named Tiny mobbin behind him
Now they've got Michael Corleone
Oh, Kurupt he got Lonely the psycho assassin
He likes to smash on, uhh
And ain't no need to reach for heat cos you can't get your blast on
Doggz we keep em, busters we sweep em
And when it's time all my Doggz'll bite your momma
We leave you niggas on stuck in paws
And I'ma dedicate this one to my Doggz
Remember that pit, the one I had named Petey
Uhh, she got killed so I didn't need him
Uhh, it's like that, what about Sweetie?
He got killed too (damn) so I didn't need him
It's a cold thang but it's a cold game
But when you wit a Corleone name it's a cold thang
Cold name, cold game ya got ta get down
Cuz if you don't then you can't represent the Pound
Now it's like a sport
And if I get caught I'm right back in court
So I gots ta keep it on the DL and don't yeezell
But you know I gots tha pitbulls for seezell
So if you want one, get one, holla at'cha boy quick
Cuzz I'ma be on the lookout for the sell-to-dem pigs
Ask my little homey Technique
I 'came Scarface, Corleone killers, baby boy OG
The homey Tray Deee I give him rock seat
But the rest of the pits they rollin wit me
We're layin low in the cut, holstered up in Chino
Scrappy-Du and the crew called the Gambinos
Ma bark and she'll spark up some shit real quick
Just last week y'know what? She bit the shit out of me
Man this bitch is a trick, I had to get cold feet
To get the bitch up off me
And I can't tame her and I can't blame her
That's why I had to name her the top Dogg gamer
Man, it's a shame-uh nigga got love for y'all
But I got more love for my motherfuckin Doggz
It's just....
(Chorus)
Me & my Doggz (sick em), me & my Doggz (sick em)
(Beware, beware) Me & my Doggz

(Snoop Dogg)
Now when it comes to my Doggz they stay fly like geese
But as for me I'm Snoop Dogg I'm soopafly like Priest
I unleash my Doggz then I tilt my brim
I'm bout to trip off Locko cos he go taken my swim
I think cos my CREAMy low, get back to the pound
He gon' be itchin like hell to put the bite on the clown
And when you look with the frown he gon' get like 1-2
And ain't a damn thang that your ass can do
I think it's cos he lost his big homey Don Killer see
Who ran the whole yard and gangbanged OP
And leave your ass red and yeah half-Dead
He's a damn fool, he'll jack you for pants leg
Don't beg you're dead, and don't dare show fear
Young gangsta fucked wit Scrappy and Red tore off his head
And all the kid do was cry like a bitch
His life was a pit and mine's in the shit

(Chorus)
(Beware, beware)
(Sick em) It's just me & my Doggz
I keep my heat in my seat, my killers in my backyard
Just in case you niggas wanna fuck and try to act hard

[Chorus:3X]
Cuz were all a little strong
In the beach where the paper's long
But as for me my only G is when I'm buss'n rocks

Now when I wake up in the morining
And I get up out my bed
I fell good, oh yes I do
Cause I still can give it up for you {What up cuz}

[Chorus]
Cuz where all a little strong
In the beach where the papers long
But as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks {Dogg Pound}

Cuz were all a little strong
In the beach where the papers long
But as for me I only G when I'm Buss'n rocks {So take that}

[Verse One:]
You know you gotta have heart
I told you niggas from the start
If I'm still in it I'm in it for life
Always stay down and keep my muthafucking game tight
Cuz ever since elementary or was it pre school cool
I was a muthafuckin fool
I had to have papers it was routine
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens
I shake niggas, break niggas, make niggas , shank theyselves
For fuckin with my wealth
And it'll catch on
Cuz if it don't it's on
And cuz I ain't even slippin when I'm all alone
Sittin back laughin' in the chronic zone
Clown me, you're wrong
Surround me, you're gone
And it's the same old song
Nigga paper so long
They call him Snoop Capone
So if you want me, get him, got him
Shoot him, shot him
But now they call me Snoop Gotti
And that's all I LBC betta yet
That's all I DPGC

[Chorus:2X
Hook w/ chorus]

Yea Eastside

[Verse Two]
I'm slappin bones
Tryin to get some bones
With some dogg pound gangstas in front of my home
Bigg 6, bigg 5 3's with ya bitches
My girls in the kitchen cookin up some fish
I'm blastin at this nigga that was trippin
Knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin
But I wasn't slippin I was on deck
I blast his ass, peck peck know his shirts wet
Dead gone lights out
With no remorse, I had to take him out
I'm laughin at this shit cause it was funny
Fuckin with the dogg I take your life and your money
And now I dip too my spot
And set up shop with yo rocks
And bet nobody speak on the 8-7
Cuz still all doggs go to heaven
From my hood to your hood
Game reconize it's all to the good
So here's a toast to the indo
Doing it like it's the thang to do
I thought you knew

[Chorus: 2X
Hook  w/ chorus]

[Chorus:2X]

[Verse Three]

Where the bitches and the bud come free
And everybody listen to the D-O double G
Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts
People be lovin me because I drop cuts
That makes sense and make big money
Snoop is that nigga who don't half to play funny
But I got your honey up under my wing
Cuz she like that song that the bow wow sing
I'll put her in a cling
I won't buy her a ring
But I'll put her on a hoe stroller, make me some green
And even if she never even saw me before
There's just no way that she can tell me no
'Cause my game's unbelievable baby
And it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me

[Snoop Dogg]
Southern hospitality
Yea (This that south shit boy)
Y'all know how we do this (shit)
What up fool
This for all my boys in Mississippi
Magnolia, McConnell (fightin south you know)
This for all my boys in Tennessee (tell 'em)
Holler at ya boy when I get there (MJG and Eightball)
All my playas in Houston
Atlanta GA (Georgia boys, in the hou-)
(We'll say sup to that New Orleans clique out there)

[Snoop Dogg]
It's a Sunday a fun day, one day
Away from Monday, and all day ain't no gunplay
And everything is alright outside (why)
Cuz Farrakhan done put his speech down and got all the brothers to ride
For one cause, and that's how it is y'all
Wise on up to rise on up dawg
Each one teach one, let the lesson be taught
It ain't my fault your homie Tommy Boy got caught
If he was slicker than grease, he woulda been at peace
Instead tryna ride while the war was at cease

[Daz Dillinger]
When me and Snoop was kids we always knew this kid named Tommy
His parents died left him a gang of cars and money
But Tommy was a hustler from around the way
Stayed on the northside of town, is where he stayed
He payed attention to whatever, they was games so clever
If the situation was bad it can only get better
He ran around the dope house

[Snoop Dogg (Daz)]
So he put us up on his scheme
He knew that we was riders so he wanted us on his team
(Uh, poor Tommy)
Getcha money, size team (uh)
Getcha money man
(He was out to get paid)
Getcha money man (Poor Tommy)
Getcha money man (Me and Snoop on his team)
(Get paid) Gotta have that money man (Getcha money man)
Getcha money man (Getcha money man)

[Snoop Dogg]
Tommy was a rider, big money
Tommy had everything, it wasn't funny
All the younger G's used to look up to him
But there was no way, that the bigger ones could do him
They would try him, try him, everytime he was slick
But he never would slip, he always had his grip
And if he did, he'd get away cuz he was just too fast
Homie up Tommy, Tommy, Tommy's out to mash
Get it, get it, get it, cuz ya gotta have it
And when ya get make sure ya grab it and stab it
Maintain it, brain it, the way ya gots to
Cuz this is somethin to rock to

[Daz]
Man, we stacked up dollars and Caddies
On missions muggin 'em for him
We had to gather up cash - whoever owed it to him
The hitman had hit us, niggas runnin shit
And never wantin to quit us, when the machine gun spit
Now we really deep in the game, now it's murder and drugs
No names involved when that nigga caught a slug
Tommy told us forget it, that he's always down wit us
The problems of the murder will be aquitted (young nigga)

[Snoop Dogg]
Now word on the streets is that Machine Gun Tommy
Ridin on big ballers for a pasttime hobby
So if ya havin money, and ya smoke big weed
First thing ya need is a security team
And we provide, or should I say we ride for Tommy
My compadre, and if he say "spray em", we spray
So I suggest, you get with the 'PG
Or find yourself layin six feet dizzy

[Daz (Snoop Dogg)]
We was down with big Tommy
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man.. getcha money man)
On the streets doing his thang, gettin paid
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man..)
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man..)
We was down with big Tommy
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man.. getcha money man)
Me and Snoop still on his team, big pimps gettin paid
We was down with big Tommy
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man.. getcha money man)
We was down with big Tommy
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man..)
Check me out now man

[Daz]
We had money, jewelry and expensive cars
Niggas who didn't know us, finally know who we are
We was important to the neighborhood like presidents and mass
Everytime he do a lick he break us off our proper share
A couple of days Tommy was on top of the world
Threw a party with the homies, invited gangs of girls

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, it was off the hook ya'know
We had everything from Indo to blow (Whhaaatt, you sniff blow?)
Oh hell no, I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffin
If Tommy find out, boy he'll be trippin
So I stay A-Ok, but anyway
Tommy got somethin to say, to say, to say...

[Tommy talking]
Aye look here mayne
What some people won't do for money
Yea I had these two niggas that was on my team
Ya'know, down with me like the Grey Tape
It's always the niggas that's closest to ya
That be the ones that try to get'cha, ya'knowhaImsayin
Shit I heard these ladies the other day say that pimpin was dead
I said not in my bed bitch {*echo*}
Ah-ha, that's real, I'll put that on my fiz-sound
I'm a pimp 'til I die, cuz I represent the big
As well as the small ha-ha
Big Timin baby {*echo*}
(Intro)
Do you think it is by accident that everytime
A black leader appears on the horizon
With any kind of cleverness, or charisma he's cut down?
Malcom, Martin, Leadkur, I want you to arm yourself
And I've asked Josh to be your bodyguard

All right Dason
It might be good for Joshua to seal, like he has somethin' to do
So detatched from us, these are only for you

(Snoop Dogg)
Damn, cool, good, so good, gotta do wrong
So cold should... gotta do wrong

(Chorus: Snoop Dogg)
It seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me
The world is filled with so much jealousy
You don't know who to trust cause you might get shot

(Snoop Dogg)
You might get got, and you might not
Make it to see a whole 'nother day, you better
Watch your hand and watch how you play
Cause you don't know how the system might get you twisted
If you don't pay attention, and you'll come up missin'
I'mma give it to you - live and direct
Cause I know, a million niggas doin' bad and they check
They game every day but they try to find a way
But somehow, some way, there ain't no pay (uh)
It's the same game, from my town to your town
From L.A. to Chi-Town, Baghdad (that's right)
To the rebel we deliver the true game
And niggas gettin' upset cause they can't maintain (player haters)
Don't get mad cause I was blessed with a gift
To give you people what you need and no more deep shit (that's right)
Lit up, get up, sit up, I write it
Then I, put you all in the mood, you invited
So come on down and party with the pound (come on)
You ain't never heard a nigga come around and put it down
Just like the Soopa-Doopa, with no Woopers
Guranteed to comin' through the party, see you visual cooper
Take her to my criz-zay, what you dizzy-in'
I ain't gonna discuss this, no more about to bust it
And when I do it, I'm gonna touch it, no discussion
It's Snoop Dogg, I got some languages aimin' for the Russians
And the overseas g's, please
Let me get you one of these with another ill beat (number two)
I gots to do ya, like ya never been done
It's Snoop Dogg representin' Funk-2-1
I'm about the gee-ist of 'em all
Can you name a rapper who can fade the dog - hell nah
And if you can - you're lyin' to yourself
And if you lyin', you're dryin' with your cover
And if you dyin, you fuckin' with your death
I'm Snoop Dogg and I'm the top rapper, at the top of the shelf
I leave these suckers in amazement, dazement
And Death Row is still the label that pays me
(Chorus: Snoop Dogg)
Seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me
This world is filled with so much jealousy
I don't know who to trust cause
If I trust hey I might, end up shot (end up shot, hmm)

(Snoop Dogg)
I turn to the left and I turn to the right
I see some motherfuckers 'bout to have a fight (whassup, whasssup?)
What should I do? (should I do) Should I watch, uh?
Or should I jump in? Or should I come with the Glock?
I knocks on the door, plus "Oh No"
I gots to avoid the drama and take the slow-mo
Type of approach - I'm the team and the coach
I hooks a left turn - no burn, for your concern, you gots to learn
Cause Snoop is on the mic and I'mma give you what you earned
And if you get it, watch me spit it
I'm commited to do it and I'm a still aquitted
Never ever did it, or forget it
This guranteed to keep the party hittin'
And I'mma give you people what you need
And I'mma smoke up on just like a bag of weed
And if you into the mixture and into the rapture
Just sit back and listen cause Snoop Dogg's about to catch ya
Snatch ya and adapt ya with the shit that I got (hmm-hmm)
I'm guranteed to rock the party non-stop (that's right)
You ain't never heard a rapper who can flip this script
Guranteed to make the ho's go ahead and get whipped
And when they stop rockin' - they won't
But if you fake the funk (youse a punk), then youse a punk (haha)
You gots to keep it real with yourself baby boy (boy)
Cause if you don't then you ain't labelled "The Real McCoy"
I'm Snoop Dogg, yes I'm true indeed
I'm guranteed to light it up and ride it up and side it up
I'm guarnteed to, do my thing
Everybody in the party if ya down to bang - sing
What'cha wanna do, what ya gots to
Cause this is somethin' to rock you
(Chorus: Snoop Dogg)
Seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me
This world is filled with so much jealousy
I don't know who to trust cause
If I trust either I might, end up shot or (end up shot, hmm)
Seems like, (seems like), seems like, (seems like)
I gotta do wrong
Seems like, (seems like, uh), I gotta do wrong

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Well it's that slow flow, D-O-double-G, nigga
See these other fools but you can't see me, nigga
Who am I? (It's Kurupt, motherfucker)
Do or die (We gives a fuck, motherfucker)
So slow your roll, I'm In Control like Janet
The loc-est twenty-one year old nigga that's on this planet
Take it for granted, if ya wanna, 'cause I'm gonna
Grab my strap then clear the corner, biatch!!

[Chorus: Daz and Lil' Malik]
To all my bitches and my niggas and my niggas and my bitches

To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don’t give a fuck like we don’t give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin hands in the air

[Verse 2: Daz]
Now on a one (one) two (two) three (three) who could it be?
Comin with a grip of gangsta shit for ninety-three
So ninety-four's arrived nigga, back on up
And let me and my Dogg Kurupt fuck shit up
Now can't nobody see me here or there
Wherever I bails, I put it down all around
'Cause ain't shit for sale in the Coupe
With the beat flossin off gold D's
And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean
And it don't take much, for the Dogg Pound to bust a cap
In your ass, for gettin us all fucked up
Now check it, it's a callin for niggas like Doggs
Who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitchin like hoes
(Yes y'all) other Doggs (yes y'all) Yiggy y'all
Stay full of that gin and juice and have a ball

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
I packs a strap, like that, I kicks it like this
Now how many bitches must get dicked?
Before they say, "Oh is it that nigga from back in the day?
Ya never ever thought I'd see him bustin with Dr. Dre"
"Cause I grips mics, I rips mics in half
Hoes be comin to my flat so I can tap that ass

[Chorus: Daz and Lil' Malik]
To all my bitches and my niggas and my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave your motherfuckin fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don’t give a fuck like we don’t give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin hands in the air

[Verse 4: Kurupt and (Daz)]
You're headed my way, nigga you best to hit a U-turn quick
So what's happenin? I'm cappin shit up like a Western flick
The kingpin of the clique, top notch
17 shot Glock cocked, so all nigga drop
The run of the mill fool get broke off for tryin to serve
The best Kurupt's era, peep the terror, 'cause it's a murder fest
I smoke chronic every day, so what have we?
Another motherfucker, gettin served like some cavy
Now who, drops (ruff rhymes) I got the juice like 2Pac
(Plus I'm) rollin with two Glocks
Fly motherfuckers can't see Kurupt
Hellraisin like Pinhead, beware I'm tearin shit the fuck up
Slow your roll, like your legs was broken
Who's jokin? Rakim never joked, so why should I loc?
Now that's my idol, check the vital rhyme flow doe
Runnin em like Flo Jo, stranded on Death Row
Mediocre motherfuckers die 'cause I'm servin and
They can't fuck with or see me, I'm mass-murderous
(Smokin indo, look out my window I suppose) Yeah
(Niggas don't understand how we kicks diffrent flows
I'm raw like news footage) I'm rugged like a BF Goodrich
(Bring your whole set and get your hood lynched)
(Drop to your knees like a dog in heat)
Peep the murderous styles and the poetical techniques

[Chorus: Daz and Lil' Malik]
To all my bitches and my niggas and my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Keep your motherfuckin fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don’t give a fuck like we don’t give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin fingers in the air

[Verse 5: Lady of Rage]
Check it out, it's Rage, ready for the breakdown
Take down, when it comes to the mic I'm puttin my weight down
And that's 175 pounds of beef
Beatin' yo' ass down to the concrete
Fool, act like ya know
I'm stranded on Death Row with no where to go, so
What's a girl to do?
Take out a crew, or two, a few, what you wanna do?

[Outro: Snoop Dogg, (Tha Dogg Pound), and Daz]
Throw your guns in the motherfuckin air, we don't care
(Niggas don't give a fuck nigga)
About nuthin at all, just my Doggs and clockin the grip bitch
(Niggas don't give a fuck nigga)
That's why I can kick it so tuff, cuz when times get ruff, my
(Niggas don't give a fuck nigga)
The clique I'm with, don't give a sheeit, ya know why?
(Real niggas don't give a fuck)
Now all the bitches, and the niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
To all my niggas, and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
To all my niggas, and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don’t give a fuck like we don’t give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin fingers in the air

[Technique]
By dawn's early light
I shine brighter than the stars in the night
And 'bout ready for a fight
Come noon, I've consumed enough juice
To cut loose and throw a mic to the moon
Since I'm the sun, I'll make you one, it's all for fun
I'm torching hot and all the same
From playing war games with Saddam Hussein
Now who's sane? I'm insane, my membrane's on cold-grown
The tempature's rising, to fry the cells in your dome
It might be on, and if you think so, you know me
It's Tech Caponey, the Doggfather's little homey

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Ain't that somethin', how I got little homeys now?
I remember when I was just a little bow-wow
Writing for my rep, calling 'fore I step
Now I put niggas in the game just to stay on deck
High profile, but my style low-pro
Top dogg on the Row, Doggystyle C.E.O
And I blow the best indo, that you know of
So when I'm in your town, dip down, and show love
You know what? What's up? Shit, I'm feeling good now
You better come and get me 'fore I fall into a freestyle

[Technique]
They say, what's a rapper? Well nigga, what's an emcee?
If they don't got the skills, then they don't roll with me
Ain't that the truth?, I'm bulletproof off the roof
I got a mic and a fix, that'll jack you for your tooth
I'm out for rep, but how long will it last?
I'm coming up quick, cause broke niggas need cash
At last, I'm at the top, so I maintain now
Gotta bang now, nigga this Doggystyle

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
All she ever wanted was a small time, love thang
Got my homey caught up in the dope game, coke game
He so sprung, on top of that he young
He's only thirteen years old, and the world's so cold
He never took the time-out to fall down on his knees
Until he fucked his G, got some keys, now they's enemies
The niggas he grew up with, they put him in the game
Now they 'bout to take him out the game
Man it's a shame, but you know how that shit go
That's life in the fast lane, that's why I roll slow

[Hook]: Kurupt,(Snoop), 

[*some singing in the backgound*]
I'd rather not get shot
I'd rather sit in the studio and rock spots
Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, we're one big family, it's all D.P.G. (D.P.G.)
I got a G on the best bomb money can buy
I ain't out for no homicides, I'm out to survive
Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, one big family, it's all D.P.G. (D.P.G.)

[Technique]
(Niggas) Niggas and hoes will try to get you twisted
But I'm unlisted in the books
You base your life on that, you might get your life took, BLAOW!
Put me in the game, I'm riding hard 'til I win
Serve a crew, kill a few niggas, 'til the end
I mean, I'm a fiend for superior green
And all my life I got advice from a superior team
I gotta stay away from the casket
Don't get blasted, and tell my kids how I lasted
But my crew's mafioso, so my philoso-
Phy is to G to the day that I d-i-e 

[*echoes*]

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Snoop Dogg, smooth and imperial
Wake up every morning to my Lucky Charms cerials
Time's getting drastic, man I'm a flas it
Dogg Pound Gangstas' choking off that boombastic
Have you ever heard?
I'm loose, shook the feds, like the juice, Snoop Dogg is 121st proof
Fool, you's a deuce, Deuce is some Genuine Draft
I'm a genuwine, like ??, and all about cash, cash
Cash, I got some free, so indeed I gets the lighter for the hash
Has it ever been a time when you didn't have a dime
To your name, and the only way to gain is through crime?
Sometimes I used to pack, one time I got jacked by some sacs
But you know I got mine, you know about the Don Corleone
I'm-a survive and thank God for Lil' Spanky B. and Bone

[Hook]: Kurupt,(Snoop), 

[*some singing in the backgound*]

[*singing in the backgound continues until the end*]

[Intro: George Clinton]
Yeah, this is another story about dogs
For the dog that don't pee on trees is a bitch
So says Snoop Dogg
So you better get your pooper scooper, 'cause the nigga's talkin shit
Roof! Roof! Roof! Roof! Roof!

[Verse: The Lady of Rage, (Dr. Dre), & Snoop Dogg]
I'm sippin' on Tanqueray
With my mind on my money and my mouth fulla gan-jay
R-A-G to the motherfuckin' E
Back with my nigga, S-N-double-O-P
(Yeah, and ya don't stop)
Rage in effect I just begun to rock
(I said, yeah, and you don't quit)
Hey yo Rage, would you please drop some gangsta shit?
I rock ruff and stuff with my Afro Puffs
Handcuffed as I bust, 'bout to tear shit up
Oh, what? Did ya think I, didn't ever think I
Would be the one to make you blink eye, I'm catchy like pink-eye
Never will there ever be another like me
Um, you can play the left, 'cause it ain't no right in me
Out the picture, out the frame, out the box I knock 'em all
Smack 'em out the park, like "A Friendly Game of Baseball"
Grand slam, yes, I am
Kickin' up dust and I don't give a goddamn
'Cause I'm that lyrical murderer, pleading guilty
You know from my skills I'm about to be
Filthy, large, Rage in charge
You know what's happenin', don't try to play Raj
This ain't no rerun, see hon', don't you wanna be one?
However, Rage'll wreck ya, 'cause I'm def
I kick my vocals, I loc yo, coast to coast or local, uh
I'll make 'em go coo-coo for my Cocoa
Puffin' stuff, ayo Snoop, you're up
Let these niggas know that niggas don't give a fuck

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
This is just a small introduction to the G-funk era
Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror
And I see motherfuckers tryin' to be like me
Ever since I put it down with the D-R-E

[Outro: George Clinton]
Foamin' at the mouth and waggin' his tail
Searchin through the yard with a keen sense of smell
Lookin' for the business in heat
And when he find it he'll be sniffin her seat
We travel in packs and we do it from the back
How else can you get to the booty?
We do it doggystyle, all the while we do it doggystyle
Yo motherfuckin' hoe!
He fucked the fleas off the bitch, he shaked the ticks off his dick
And in the booty, he buries his motherfuckin' bone
And if there's any left over, he'll roll over and take a doggy bag home

[Skit: Daz Dillinger & Snoop Dogg]
Damn, that Tanqueray is talkin' to a nigga
I ain't bullshittin', one of y'all niggas gotta get it
Man, I got to piss
Breath test?

[Intro]
{*scratching* "To the Batmobile - let's go!"}
"Atomic batteries to power, turbines to speed"
"Roger, ready to move out"

[During Hook - theme song repeats the "Batman!" music + vocals]

[Hook: Lady of Rage & RBX]
No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin crime
No one, can save the day like Batman

[RBX]
Commissioner X here!
Batman & Robin, we have a bit of a problem
There's trouble brewing in Gotham City
You MUST act fast!

[Lady of Rage] + (Snoop)
Holy mackerel Batman! I think these clowns need to back down
Let's be the Gap Band and drop the bomb on 'em and make 'em SCAT man
(When you say scat man, like the Brother Cuh-rothers?) Uh-huh
(When it's on, it's cold, so bring the coroner cover)
We can take it to the Bassment, live with Tigger
Go get The Riddler, and watch me play that nigga like a fiddler
On a hot tin roof, I got them watchin who?
She who spits it like she was sippin rot-ten brew, ooh
(We Marvel at you Comics, you ain't no Superhero)
You just a stupid zero, you ain't hard like DeNiro

[Snoop Dogg] + (Rage)
Surprise! The Dynamic Duo
Batman & Robin, gats set for squabbin (nigga!)
Splat! Hit 'em like forty-five shells (nigga!)
Plaque! Means more than one million sales (huh)
That's nuff shot to lick, you get done up
Plus we got the Bat gats, so why would you run up? (huh)

"Batman! Batman! Batman."
{*scratched: "And you're about to find out"*}

[Hook]

{*scratched: "And you're about to find out"*}

[Lady of Rage]
Yeah, when it's beef in Gotham City I, gots to flip and
Hit 'em with the POW! BAM! BIFF! Whoa
Pick up your lips, don't trip, tie your shoelace
When I spit, I split it, turn Harvey Dent into Two-Face
Robin, I'm more than a sidekick, I'm more like the livest
They wanna go head up and collide
And like collision, hope your moms made provisions
See you ain't got no wins baby, not even a smidgen
Mad hostility dealt, now I'mma really be felt
Switch on my utility belt, make yo' facility melt
I go Mad on yo' Hatter, watch yo' whole shit splatter
Get, wicked on yo' case like Detective Van Adder
So the, sayin goes, if you snooze you lose
Trust you do, me and Batman the Dynamic Two!

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
Cold day in Gotham in the Bat Cave chillin
Catnip for Catwoman so she caught the feeling
Huh, talk about flavor for a Pringle
A favor for a favor maybe later we can mingle
Damn, just then, the Bat Phone ringin
They hoo-bangin' in Gotham, I got to do my thing

[RBX]
Batman! War is on the brink
It seems that the Penguin is causing a stink
Call up Robin quick, you know what to do
Add dye to the water and splash the town blue

[Snoop Dogg]
Shit I'm there in a flash, Batmobile on 3's
Trust me buddy, got heat for Mr. Freeze
And Clayface will catch the em-brace
Of napalm when I drop my Bat Bomb
.. and don't you forget it
Takin out you suckers and you don't know how I did it

[Outro]
No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin crime
No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin crime

[Lady of Rage]
Dirty Dinkins Batman!
Did you see those crispy khaki creases on that rugged wretched..

[Snoop Dogg]
Aiy-yo-yo-yo kick back Robin
Get Alfred and tell him to have barbecued buffalo wings
And a pitcher of Kool-Aid on chill
It's about to get real in the field

[Lady of Rage]
Leapin Lo-lo's! Over there Batman! That's a no-no!
Let's hop out this fo'-do'!

[Snoop Dogg]
Yea yea yea, systems engaged
Start the Bat Engine, hit the Bat Switches
You ready Robin? Let's dip

[Lady of Rage]
Let's, dip! Holy Hoodrat Sally smokin' crack in the alley
Let's, dip! I mean, crazy kinfolk in Kingsville Batman!
We must, we MUST Batman, listen to me
Holy Leapin Lizards and Gizzards and all that shit that come with it
And potatoes on top with gravy in the middle
God damnit Batman! {*echoes*}

"Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da--da-da-dah - BATMAN!!"

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, this record is for my baby, my baby boo
I know I'm always on the road, I'm always gone
And you say I don't ever make records for you no mo'
Well this record is from me to you baby
Yeah, real talk

[Chorus: Latonya Givens]
Been around the worrrrrld
I done been to many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to youuuuu
Soon as I get home I'm racin' to unplug my phone

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I seen everything twice
Been around the world I seen every scene twice
Stompin' down in Tokyo, dippin' in the rice
I'm a boss at the wind, I cracked every color dice
I do it big, fuck the rumors
Rich and infamous with the blue and gray Pumas
Gangstas don't die they just move to Miami
I did all that, I was voted my candy
I'm somethin' like Sammy
Smoother than Marvin, I need me a Tammi
Sippin' Chardonnay, makin' bills on my hands-free
Father Hood, now the actors can't stand me
Cause I own rap and I'm comin' for your day job
Until then, I'm chillin' at the day spa
Relax my mind and just chill
Cause without you, none of this is real
Baby you know I

[Chorus: Latonya Givens]
Been around the worrrrrld
I done been to many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to youuuuu
Soon as I get home I'm racin' to unplug my phone

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, but now I'm back across the water
I'm in Sydney with somebody's daughter
Blowin' sticky by the zips
And they can tell by how my rag hang, nigga this Crip
But I'm chillin'; it feels so good to get away
Especially when your name is D-O-double-Gizzee
Coast to coast jettin', man I been doin that
What y'all just start ballin' Cuz? I been up out the trap
Poppin' P's with the bosses
300 for the yacht, the third deck got an office
Dockin' down in Monaco, churchin' with my folks
Bad Lucc had me dyin' when he fell up out that boat
My life is like a movie
But the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me
Then I relax and chill
Cause without you, none of this is real
Baby you know I

[Chorus: Latonya Givens]
Been around the worrrrrld
I done been to many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to youuuuu
Soon as I get home I'm racin' to unplug my phone
Been around the worrrrrld
I done been to many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to youuuuu
Soon as I get home I'm racin' to unplug my phone

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
See you baby
Yeah I'm on my way home right now
I'm on my way right now!
I'm leavin' the studio right now
(None of them, none of them, yeahhhhhh)
Yeah, soon as I get home I'ma, I'ma go unplug it
Matter fact I ain't even gon' bring it in the house
See you in a minute

[Hook: Charlie Wilson]
I'm a man, I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shinin' and gettin' Grammy's
But these streets won't say goodbye

[Intro: Charlie Wilson] (Snoop Dogg)
I can't say goodbye (To the blocks)
Goodbye (To the hood)
Goodbye (To the streets)
I can't say goodbye (To the hood)
Goodbye (To the blocks)
Goodbye (To the streets)
I can't say goodbye (To the blocks)
Goodbye (To the streets)
Goodbye (To the hood)
I can't say goodbye (To the hood)
Goodbye (To the blocks)
Goodbye (To the homies)

[Verse 1]
I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out the homeboy
Plus my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got locked, and we don't know
If he comin' home boy
The industry tell me, just leave it alone boy
Let them do them, take care of your own boy
But I sit back, think about, before I was grown boy
Then had dreams of bein' a doe boy
Yeah I was runnin' from the po-po, bangin' for the turf
Late night huntin', puttin' in work
Hood day comin', airbrushed shirt
Payday at the spot, got my haircut first
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church
See I live in the 'burbs but I think 21st
I know since I've left that it's gotten much worse
But I'd still be there if I couldn't write a verse

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
To the blocks that raised me
The enemies and the homies that made me
Tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me
Critics wonder if I'm tryin' to be the old me
But if they think the old me ever left
Then they don't really know me
And gon' know we don't change, we just become O.G
You always addicted to the life, you just don't O.D
But shit, I owe the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my mama didn't want me
Too wild to be her child, and pops not around
Now all I got now is the homies
To teach me, how to be a man and what not
How to break ounces into grams and what not
The reason I'm so nice with my hands and what not
Shit, you think I forgot? Nah

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Thank God every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
I know I got plenty more awards to get
I got a beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignored the shit
That made me who I am, the music and the man
Told me that I can before the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my niggas sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub in the pen with my man
They say leave the streets but they don't really understand
All I had was the block when I didn't have fans
Rapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all came down, my career was to end
I'm sure my name would live, in these streets

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
Dogg back up in this motherfucker
Hoes know how to act up in this motherfucker
They I know I make it crack up in this motherfucker
All blue Chuck's and my khakis in this motherfucker
I'm lookin' for a thick one
Pecan brown, she lookin' for the slim one
Loves to go down, she say she likes the big one
I need her right now, do you know where I can get one?
To give me brain like a genius
She love my hair pressed like the cleaners
And got a friend named Trina
You see 'em from behind you'll think they Venus and Serena
Hmm, now that's my kinda bitch
Take your clothes off, damn baby kinda thick
Love Snoopy blue, yeah I'm that type of Crip
And we was about to dip 'til she hit me with this, trip

[Hook]
I ain't ever met another gangsta like you
I ain't really sure but I think I'd like to
Give you my number to my cellular phone
Play my cards right, will you take me home?
(Girl you will never meet a gangsta like me
We can our thing but you can't be wifey
Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone
At the end of the night I'll take you home)

[Snoop Dogg]
(Blaow!) I limp with my two step
Got two friends, we can have group sex
(Blaow!) Nigga from the 2-1
Tall and skinny and always got blue on
Say I make cool songs
My nasty video made her do porn
And she go real far
Still can't believe that she's talkin' to a real star
Pop told me real hard
And threw that backshot on me real hard
Royal penis is clean, I'm king like the boulevard
Dogg do his thing, got her feelin' like a superstar
Wanna share her feelin's with her friends
Tell her husband that there's another man
And she say that I made her fall in love
I had to shake her fast like I wasn't when I was
A pimp from the Beach, gator shoes on my feet
Got my game from the streets, never been for a freak
Had the nerve to ask for money when I beat it up
I looked at the bitch like cut, dat-dat-dat

[Hook]
I ain't ever met another gangsta like you
I ain't really sure but I think I'd like to
Give you my number to my cellular phone
Play my cards right, will you take me home?
(Girl you will never meet a gangsta like me
We can our thing but you can't be wifey
Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone
At the end of the night I'll take you home)

[Snoop Dogg]
The homies say cuz don't do it to her
You gon' have to always do it to her
She be creepin' to your hotel, sayin' that she won't tell
Knowin' one night won't do for ya
(Nope) You know I got that gangsta
Make you wanna tell my mama "thank ya"
Then give me all your paper, everytime I lay ya
Snoop Dogg, playa-playa
I'm always with a bad bitch
You could say I got a bad bitch habit
See a bad bitch, is like a fat blunt
I got one but you know I got to grab it
So lil' mama what's happenin'?
Let me know if you're tryin' to get it crackin'
Wanna chill, when you down for the smashin'?
Ms. American Gangsta, Mr. Blue Magic

[Hook] x2
I ain't ever met another gangsta like you
I ain't really sure but I think I'd like to
Give you my number to my cellular phone
Play my cards right, will you take me home?
(Girl you will never meet a gangsta like me
We can our thing but you can't be wifey
Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone
At the end of the night I'll take you home)

[Snoop Dogg]
What time is it...

[Snoop - singing like Prince]
I got a penthouse in Manhattan
Two more in Malibu
I bought a eight-seven Cadillac Seville
I got a Maserati too
I wear diamonds on my fingers
I got a couple on my toes
I wear the finest cologne money can buyyyy
It keeps me smellin like a rose

If you're wonderin how I do it
There's just one simple rule
I'm just cool (cool!!)
Honey baby can't you see
I'm just cool (cool!!)
Ain't nobody bad like me; spelled (C, O-O-L)
What's that spell? (C, O-O-L)
I might dine in San Francisco
Dance all night in Rome
I go any freakin place I want to
And my Lear jet brings me home
I got ladies by the dozen
I got money by the ton
Just ain't nobody better
Heaven knows that I'm the one

It's all because of somethin
That I didn't learn in school
I'm just cool (cool!!)
Honey baby can't you see
I'm so cool (cool!!)
Ain't nobody bad like me; spelled (C, O-O-L)
What's that spell? (C, O-O-L)

[Interlude]
And I'm cool
I'm just cool-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-cool
I'm just cool, c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c
Co-co, co-co-co, coo-coo-coo, I'm just cool, cool
I'm just cool
Coo-coo-cool

[Snoop Dogg]
When I look into the mirror
It just tells me somethin I already know
I'm just cool (cool!!)
Honey baby can't you see
I'm just cool (cool!!)
Ain't nobody bad like me; spell it~! (C, O-O-L)
What's that spell? (C, O-O-L)

[Outro]

[Hook]
Can you control yo ho?
You got a bitch, that won't do what you say

She hard-headed and she just won't obey

[Verse]
I went to your house
Your girl came in and started cussin' you out
You shoulda slapped her in the face
I wanted to tell you, but it wasn't my place
I kept on the low
Cause I knew that you was gonna check that ho
But instead you was quiet as a mouse
Made me start to think that it wasn't your house
Cause she was acting like a nut
You got the kind of bitch that will kick your butt
What kind of pimp holds back
Never met a bitch that a pimp can't slap
What's wrong with the pimpin'
Why you gettin' a whippin'
All I see is simpetttes

[Hook]
Can you control yo ho?
You got a bitch, that won't do what you say
You can't control yo ho

Even if it's slappin' her in her face
You got to control yo ho..

This is what you made me do

But, bitch you playing with fi-ire

Of loud mouth bitches like you
A nigga had to go and put tips on you
Cause bitch you playing with fi-ire
I'm so sick and ti-ired

This is what you made me do
I really didn't wanna put hands on you
But, bitch you playing with fire
I'm so sick and tired
Of loud mouth bitches like you
So a nigga had to go and put tips on you
Cause bitch you playing with fire
I'm so sick and tired

[Hook]

Boogie boogie boogie.. I'm goin 65, 75, 80
Mashin down the boulevard downtown movin like crazy
In the fast lane, High beams shinin
Tryna keep the timin on the track with the diamond in the back
Moon roof wide open, scopin, loc'in
The bitches believe, the hoes keep hopin
They can get it, fit in, back seat, just sit in
Fo' hoes on the block tryna put they bid in
Girl put it to work, you gon' do the damn thing
Hop in, the rest of y'all eat dirt
I'm rollin in the Mackmobile, I'm back for real
One hundred percent, pimp-motion, that's the deal
Back wheel spinnin, number one I'm winnin
Hoes lookin inside, and they just to grinnin
Waitin to choose, while the rest wait to pay y'all dues
Don't trip I keep my hoes in two

[Hook]

[Interlude]

My wheels cost a fortune, bitch I'm scorchin
Seen some niggas who love to talk shit
Reach for my thang in my glove compartment
Didn't have to use it, blasted my music
Kids in the streets askin - Doggy how I dooze it?
First place in the race and don't wanna lose it
Niggas better watch out and bitches better mooooove it

[Interlude 2]
Yeah baby, you gots ta move your groove
To prove that you supposed to groove in the move
As I recite naughty nothings in yo' eardrums
If you cruisin up the boulevard in your car
Put it in park and let the Dogg spark
Yeah baby!

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Interlude 3]
Ohhhhhhh noooooo, not the track of funk!
I am Sir Dunk, DPG Funk
And I hate Stoplight!
I always ran to the next like a Minnie
I told you I wouldn't C-Walk
Let me out, yarhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

[Snoop Dogg]
Half past late and I'm still rollin
Real ho'n, make a nigga pocket still swollen
Still goin, black and white tip-toe'n
Flashin my player's card (why you play so hard?)
Cause I'mma Don, sippin Moet, smokin chron'
Doggy wanna see that dress my loc's are on
Pimp from black-red, brunette back to blonde
Can't tell the sunset from the crack of dawn
Half tank of gas
Rollin' down the window, reach out and spank that ass
Gettin hot, turn down the heat, burn down the street
My hoes love to earn my keep
It's only five miles left, so I whipped it
Skipped it, flipped it in ovedrive
Straight bonafide pimp nigga on the rise
85, 95, 100 and good night and fuck that stoplight!
{*car crashes*}

[Snoop Dogg]
Well it's the super duper Snoopa once again I'm on the fly
Swoopin through I'm in my coupe and all the bitches want a ride
If it's trippin like I'm clippin I'm still grippin on my nine
We be Crip'n while I'm dippin with my C's up in the sky
And the East is still my side, I'm a reaper when I ride
Fuck a feature, I don't need a motherfucker, I'm the guy
I delete 'em, stampede 'em, straight eat 'em like some fries
Get a ketchup, get 'em messed up, turn the heat up let 'em fry
Ain't no different when I'm rippin, pimpin's still up in his prime
TV shows, movie hoes, pimpin's still up on his grind
Man these hoes all know, I'm workin with a nine
I ain't talkin 'bout a gun, I'm talkin feel it in your spine
When I hit it from behind, if I go up in your mouth
I might hit you in the mind, you know what I'm talkin 'bout
It'll thrill ya, I'm the stealer that'll kill ya with the rhythm of a trigger
Motherfucker better duck before I hit her, bang!

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]

Little nigga I'm the king, I ain't givin up a thing
If you want it come and take it nigga, I'll be sittin waitin
Make a patient nigga got the other ear and I'll bake a nigga
Fuck it put the gun down, and straight bank a nigga
Take it nigga, take it nigga fuck, you ain't this nigga

And the po-po know, that's why they on my dick
And they at my crib, tryin to find my shit
Tryin to search my house, what the fuck that's 'bout?

[Hook] - 2X

But you gotta hit the streets, go and get my money"
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine

Yeah, the mo' dedicated the mo' medicated

Girl my love's gonna last, just as long as my high
(And I'm high all day, every day)
You can trust every word I'm gonna say will be a lie

[Snoop Dogg]
Haha, yeah I lie sometimes
What's the use of the truth if you can't get a lie sometimes baby?
Now dig this

Jack starts a track up and down the hill
Got to walkin thinkin ace what he told to Jill
Come rain, come shine, come snow or if it's sunny
Get the fuck out, come and get my money
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine

They say you can't buy me love, but you damn sure can buy me bud

See my homie Snoop, we doin' what we do
Don't matter where we at, Miami or Vegas
Every time you ask me, yeah I'm a player
(Beotch) 'Cause I'm the life of the party

What's up with you girl, maybe we can do somethin'
Do you drink; do you smoke?

Hang with me, the first thing you do is get stuck
Take you somewhere, later on you'll get fucked, beotch!

Headed to the club in my brand new scraper
Gators on my feet, money in my pocket
I gotta do a show so you know I'm 'bout to rock it
See my homie $hort, layin' low-key
I strolled over to him, and passed him the bleezy
Doggy Dogg, anything goes
Snappin' my fingers, crackin' at some hoes
What do ya know, I'm in The A gettin' play all day
A lot of y'all wanna ball and try to walk this way
Y'all want that shine-shine but that's all mine
I'm bonafied, qualified to have a hot damn time
Now listen, get the picture, and take a picture of me quick
See 'cause tomorrow I got a new city that I'm gon' hit
A double whammy, right before I do the Grammy's

I see all the ballers in the house, what's up mayne?
They doin' it big over there too, but you know mayne
If I wasn't here, it wouldn't be the same
'Cause I'm the life of the party, baby
I hope you feel the same way about yourself, beotch!

[Intro: Kurupt]

Kurupt Young Gotti, “Ego Trippin'” ho
Ha-ha, what up Snoop?

Bendin' the curb swervin', blowin' on some izz-erb
The boss has returned, I'm still flyer than a bizz-ird

Go against the gang the man will have your whole clique served
Nice with the mic thang, the hoes love my pipe game
Put it in the hole all night, I got nice aim
Snoop Dogg nigga, how many times I got to show ya?
You don't wanna see this loc'ster Calvin Broadus from the shoulders
So, just get your rap on, that I never slacked on
Ho, you got your strap out, here we get our jack on
Dick you hoes can snack on, you and your whole crew
I'll pull out my nine, now do what you hoes do

God bless my pimp bone, gettin' my ego trip on, fool
Ease back before I trip on you-uh, flip on you-uh
And have them hollows rip on through ya, boy

[Break: Kurupt]
Dogg Pound is up in this bitch
Riders, yeah, ey Snoop

[Chorus: Kurupt]

Desert Eagle .45 totin', leave a niggas brain broken
Still loc'n, still potent
Still trippin', still tippin', yeah I'm still focused
And I'm still flippin', words, do it like ki's for G's
We swerve-swerve across seas gettin' cheese with ease

Dumb bitches still callin', foes still fallin'
Still bustin' a ho, still gettin' bucks out a ho
Bitch get outta line I put my Chuck's on her throat
Still hittin' switches, still gettin' riches
Still the best in the game, I'm still hittin' pitches

[Snoop Dogg]
Ridin in my Chevy and I'm sittin at the light
At the light, I got kush in my blood
Sippin Remy keep it pimpin with my pinky off the cut
And all the people when they see me like, "Snoop, turn it up!"

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
When I'm ridin in my Chevy and I'm sittin at the light
At the light, I got kush in my blood
Sippin Remy keep it pimpin with my pinky off the cut
And all the people when they see me like, "Snoop, turn it up!"

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm in my zone muh'fucker
Get stuck in the ribs by a old bone crusher
Two-tone leather with the soul of a hustler
Tryin to stack mayo, stealin clothes from my brother
People wanna know am I close to my mother
I'm a premature baby, I'm ahead of the others
Yes, I'm aware of the gutter
Ahead of my time, the game's gettin smothered
I stay on the grind but it's only gettin rougher
Niggas think I'm playin 'til they smokin like a muffler
'Bout to take flight, the lane open on you bustas
Catch me if you can in a world full of suckas
Niggas keep simpin, they wanna be Usher
Until they get their eyes and coffin closed by the usher
Them punches won't work, you need mo' muster
Lord lay him down, he need no sufferin, nigga

[Hook] - 2X

[Snoop Dogg]
Hmm, on my road to riches
I done seen a lot of roaches and bitches
That's why the Dogg keep, goin the distance
But niggas don't know when to listen, that's why I load ammunition
And stay in touch with my competition, I'm in touch with my composition
Roll a blunt, it's the kush, yeah we got prescriptions
Just a G5, no encryptions
Pick a side, yeah you know we Crip'n
And through my eyes I see the world different
100 G's to record wit him, hit the gas give me more engine
This is somethin that was born in him
No game for a bitch, just forfeit him
I'm in tune, give me more rhythm
I let the bullets and the swords hit him
All P's like a Porsche emblem
Now make dead with the mortician
Nigga, this Bigg Snoop Dogg you best to listen
Ya heard me?

[Hook] - 2X

[Chorus]
(Make it good)
You got one chance to crack
One shot to pop, better hit the spot
Cause there's a hundred other brothers that's waiting in line
Playa it's your time to (make it good)
(Make it good)
You got one chance to crack
One shot to pop, better hit the spot
Cause there's a hundred other brothers that's waiting in line
Playa it's your time to (make it good)

[Verse 1]
Now you've been waitin, patient
Dinner dating, classic chasing
Your homies hating 'cause you're never around
You're either at the movies or you're out shopping around
All that for the cat, it's a wrap
You gotta go hard if you get a chance to hit that
If you hit it then you gotta hit it harder
Than any other brother, the Karma Sutra be the author
Be her father, be a man, be the man
That made her never wanna see another man
Make it better than good, make it great
Make her visit, then make her stay

[Chorus]
(Make it good)
You got one chance to crack
One shot to pop, better hit the spot
Cause there's a hundred other brothers that's waiting in line
Playa it's your time to (make it good)
(Make it good)
You got one chance to crack
One shot to pop, better hit the spot
Cause there's a hundred other brothers that's waiting in line
Playa it's your time to (make it good)

[Break]
Yeah man, if you got a real one
You better hold on to her
See 'cause a real man will come along the way
And smooth knock her...

[Verse 2]
If you like her, wife her
If you love her, smother her
With that stuff that'll make her feel the same way
And pull that ring out on the same day
A couple heirs with the horse and the carriage
You gon' lose her if you scared of marriage
A real boss got a foundation
You need somebody in your life with patience
Minus the hate... Shante, what more can I say?
But baby look at us today
Your husband's a boss, the kids is cute
King of the Coast for the gang of loot

[Chorus]
(Make it good)
You got one chance to crack
One shot to pop, better hit the spot
Cause there's a hundred other brothers that's waiting in line
Playa it's your time to (make it good)
(Make it good)
You got one chance to crack
One shot to pop, better hit the spot
Cause there's a hundred other brothers that's waiting in line
Playa it's your time to (make it good)

[Verse 3]
I'ma make it good for you, make it hood for you
Make it do what he couldn't do for you
Tha Doggfather supreme, jump in the shower
I appear through the steam
Braids and all, over six foot tall
Can't no other brother fade the Dogg
I'm all ya need, I'm who ya want
I'm here to coach ya through your do's and don'ts and he won't
I got the remedy, the energy
It's your mama, your daddy, and then it's me
Bad talk a boss, I wish a player would
Close your eyes baby girl, let me (make it good)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
1992, "Deep Cover" hit the world and fell in love with Snoop
"Doggystyle" came out, it's like I dropped a bomb
One of the greatest hip-hop records of all time
I was young gettin' money, livin' wild and free
Got on and I brought the whole Pound with me
Didn't matter who's around, I kept it way too G
Niggas knew it was Eastside L.B.C
Gangsta shit, that's what a motherfuckin' gangsta get
The one up above didn't like my pace
I was movin' too fast and I caught that case
I fought that case, wonder where the West would be if I'da lost that case
I slow mine down, swimmin' with the sharks and I almost drowned

[Hook]
I done made some mistakes along the way
To become the G I am today
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Homie I ain't never comin' down
I'm too high in the clouds
To ever have to worry 'bout that

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm finally out
And the critics hated on me cause I went to the South
Said I wasn't gon' shine, had me left for dead
Switched sides, now my old boss want me dead
Dropped the first of the three and you said it was weak
"No Limit Top Dogg", the return of the beast
So from that point on I know what to do
Don't worry 'bout them just do what you do
"Last Meal" was the one that took me off the leash
That's the last time a nigga gon' eat off of me
Stack plaque after plaque, gain millions sold
I'm the Bo$$ of this bitch and I ain't never went Gold, nigga

[Hook]
I done made some mistakes along the way
To become the G I am today
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Homie I ain't never comin' down
I'm too high in the clouds
To ever have to worry 'bout that

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Bo$$ of the City, Boss of the Coast
Some other niggas tried but none of 'em come close
They stuck lookin' silly, but nothin' like a loc
The Bigg Bow Wow, I kill it with one stroke
(Wow!) That's what it's about
They tryin' to tell a nigga what could come out his mouth
Motherfucker I'm a G, but first I'm a man
Freedom of Speech, bitch is a word you can't ban
So they blamin' me, sayin' this my talk
To some women as hoes, like it's my fault
Damn they lost, man they just don't know
That a bitch is a bitch, and a ho is a ho
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
I'm gon' be smokin' dank, livin' like a boss
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
I'mma be smokin' my dank, livin' like a boss, nigga

[Hook]
I done made some mistakes along the way
To become the G I am today
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Homie I ain't never comin' down
I'm too high in the clouds
To ever have to worry 'bout that

[Chorus]
Snoop Dogg is out, you wanna be there partyin'
All night long until the break of dawn
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh
(Drink up 'cause the bottle's on me)
Snoop Dogg is out, you wanna be there partyin'
All night long until the break of dawn
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh
(Drink up 'cause the bottle's on me)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Now stop, pause, chill for a second
It's Snoop Dogg and Teddy Riley on the record
Tell your mama, tell your daddy, tell all your friends
They got a party that's crackin' and that shit won't end
Me and my folks, we drink and we smoke, we rockin' the boat
We pop about four, five more, so
Bend don't break, break don't bend
I'm number one with a bullet, I'mma make more ends
When you're great they gonna hate
So what, that's probably why we Cali-fornicate
And shake to a whole nother elevation
Catch me in the hood or your favorite television station
Creatin', a whole nother lane for the generation
I drink Sunkist for the good vibration
Dippin', Rippin', shakin' and bakin'
I know you've been patiently waitin', I'm back y'all

[Chorus]
Snoop Dogg is out, you wanna be there partyin'
All night long until the break of dawn
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh
(Drink up 'cause the bottle's on me)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
On your mark, set, party on three
Four, hit the floor and go for what ya know (Hey)
I'm in the party low-key, blowin' an eighth of dro
I'm playful but I don't play
Spinnin' the globe like the strobe
Like the club packed, my flow right the whole night
If I plan to go right, a cold night
In hell before I fail, I'm alright
Man, I'm like a flash of lightnin'
Breath of fresh air, classic debonair
Glass of champagne, hold it in my right hand
Finger roll cold, Dogg the Ice Man
Brazil to Iceland
I shine like a million lights man
The talk of the town, believe it or doubt it
I don't need to shout it, you better read about it

[Chorus]
Snoop Dogg is out, you wanna be there partyin'
All night long until the break of dawn
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh
(Drink up 'cause the bottle's on me)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Now pose like a superstar, walk like a model
I love it when you pop that bottle
I love it cause you're not so automatic
I love it when you put it where Dogg can grab it
I got my hands where you'll let me
I love it when you dance, so sexy
I love it when you in that night mood
Slow motion movin' like ain't nothin' like you
I'm feelin' good doin' what I like to
Suited up, pimp stripe, light blue
I let it do what it might do
Fresh and crispy, the rest a mystery
I'm blessed with history
No less than best, catch the rest
Live in the flesh, smooth with the style I choose
Not off the stress, I'm hot off the press

[Chorus]
Snoop Dogg is out, you wanna be there partyin'
All night long until the break of dawn
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh
(Drink up 'cause the bottle's on me)
Snoop Dogg is out, you wanna be there partyin'
All night long until the break of dawn
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh
(Drink up 'cause the bottle's on me)

[Bridge]
I'm gonna take my time
She gon' get hers before I
I'm gonna take it slow
I'm not gon' rush the stroke

[Chorus]
So she can get a sexual eruption
So I can get a sexual eruption
So we can get a sexual eruption
Sexual eruption, whoa, whoa

[Verse 1]
She might be with him, but she's thinking 'bout me, me, me
We don't go to the mall, we don't go out to eat, eat, eat
All that we ever do is play in the sheets, sheets, sheets
Smoke us a cigarette, then go back to sleep, sleep, sleep
'Cause we done got a

[Chorus]
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption, whoa, whoa
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption, whoa

[Bridge]
I'm gonna take my time
She gon' get hers before I
I'm gonna take it slow
I'm not gon' rush the stroke

[Verse 2]
If you don't know by now, Doggy Dogg is a freak, freak, freak
I keep a bad bitch with me seven days out the week, week, week
And all that we ever do is play in the sheets, sheets, sheets
Then smoke us a cigarette, then go back to sleep, sleep, sleep
'Cause we done got a

[Chorus]
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption, whoa, whoa
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption, whoa

[Verse 3]
I was all in the club, sippin' some Hen, smokin' on a blunt of 'dro
When I peeped this lil' ho out
I was all in the bar, when, drift up, Shawty Redd came on,
Then she hit the floor now
With a see-through dress, long hair, light-brown eyes
Lookin' like Ms. Bo Peep
And a nigga know if I take her home, with them wide-ass hips
You damn right, I'm gon' beep
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Big-ass booty with a little-bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you a freak, but you know I ain't gon' say shit"
See, my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some fuck-faces
But it wasn't no use for me to rush to bust one
'Cause I wanted her to have a eruption

[Chorus]
Sexual eruption (A sexual eruption... yeah)
Sexual eruption, whoa (Orgasms)
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption, whoa, whoa

[Outro]
Sexual eruption (All the time, anytime)
Sexual eruption, whoa
Sexu...

[Chorus]
(Those girls, those girls)
Those girls, they don't mean a thing to me
I was just playin' the game
It was all a fantasy (Those girls)

[Verse 1]
I got a call from this ho the other day
She say she just moved down from The Bay
To L.A. - well that's great
We should sit down and talk face to face
You bring the barbeque, I got the paper plates
I can't lie girl, I like the way you shake
And when you dance the way you make your booty shake
Give or take, I rate you 'bout an eight
Or a nine - okay, fine, you a dime
And them other bitches they gon' wait in line
They hatin' on you how you take away they shine
Rewind, pay attention to the signs
I see money when I look you in the eyes
No lie, I love how you stay fly
So fly, send a text and I'll reply
And when you need that good sex, I'm the guy

[Chorus]
(Those girls, those girls, those girls, those girls)
Those girls, they don't mean a thing to me
I was just playin' the game
It was all a fantasy (Those girls)

[Verse 2]
It was Kim, Dalesa, Vanessa, Rene
I don't love hoes or respect what they say
Hey... yeah that's life
The Pound comin' through, get the F out the way
I know it's been a minute but your boy been away
It feels so good, take me back in the day
I hit the studio, then back to the stage
The lights come on and the people start to wave
Then I seen this girl, she looked me right in the face
Like "I know you remember me and my homegirl Tanay"
We stay downtown in a loft on Santa Fe
And we your number one biggest fans to this day
Wait... baby girl I'm the great
Big Snoop Dogg, you got to bring me up to date
I know a lot of girls rock shows in many states
Room 220, bring your friend and some drank

[Chorus]
(Those girls, those girls, those girls, those girls)
Those girls, they don't mean a thing to me
I was just playin' the game
It was all a fantasy (Those girls)

[Verse 3]
Now where you gonna find a nigga fresh like me bitch?
Somebody pass the lighter so I can get this weed lit
She lookin' at my stones like "Damn, is he rich?"
I'm lookin' at her pose like damn is she thick
Fuck them other dudes, I'm the man to be with
Fifty million sold, who's bigger than me bitch?
Nobody, let me put you on to some G shit
Hop in the Benz, I'll get you higher than ski lifts
And then I'm 'bout to beat the cat up like Heathcliff
Yeah, cause all bitches need dick
And if they say they don't they just lyin', they wanna sit
Shotgun in the 500 like she the shit
Uh-uh, hold on baby, we the shit
Clear blue skies, dip 'til you're seasick
You're with the one and only
S, yes, N, double, O, P

[Chorus]
(Those girls, those girls, those girls, those girls)
Those girls, they don't mean a thing to me
I was just playin' the game
It was all a fantasy (Those girls)

[Snoop Dogg]
Yo, this next record right here, is a dedication
This dedicated to those, who've come to an end
Quit like Gladys Knight...
You know neither one of us wants to be the first one to say goodbye
So, hopefully this record will help you get to the conclusion, ya dig?

I love this girl but I don't know about her
.As a matter of fact, I could go without her
But she got my daughter, I don't know why I bother
To try to make it work when she make it so harder
Wake up and break up and do the same thing tomorrow
I get tired of fightin', I feel no sorrow
For you, to keep it movin' in that Monte Carlo
That's what I get for fuckin' with a video model

Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine

[Snoop Dogg]
You don't love me, you just love my Doggystyle
I used to put it on yo' ass, you ain't had it in a while
Instead of crackin' smiles, you'd rather cramp a nigga style
You act too wild, I won't walk you down the aisle
What you thought? Yeah, we could chill, we could talk
When I look you in your eyes I no longer see sparks
So it's, best we go our seperate ways and stay apart
No more me and you boo, I done had a change of heart

[Raphael Saadiq]
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine

I'm not sayin' I don't got love for you
But I'm not in love with you
(I'm just not in love with you baby)
I'm not sayin' I don't got love for you
But I'm not in love with you
And feels like such a...
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine

Go your way and I'll go mine

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Sorry it had to end this way
But uh, it is what it is

Til' they talkin' through that glass, like "See you in a minute"
That's not the Bigg Boss Dogg
I been in it since a youngin', I'm a Eastside hogg
21st Street ridin', rollin' with my partners
Hat to the back in a rag spillin' vodka
Stompin' through the city in my big blue Chuck's
Lil' homies on the corner not givin' a fuck
So I chunked up the set like "What's happenin' with you?"
"Shit, I just do what I do, I'm just stackin' it too"
Is what he said to a loc as I dipped on out
Or as we say on the Eastside, you Cripped on out
See the sunshine and palm trees, livin' it up
Don't forget the block boys givin' it up
Where you from, loc?

For the rules of the game, represent your shit
Flag around the steering collar makin 'em sick
Shoot, the L.B. made me, gangbang for real
If ya made it through the '80s I'm a product of the shady
Snoop D-O-dub, it's what I does
I'm worldwide love, the homies is like cuz
Stuck to the script and kept claimin' the team
They love it when I chunk it on the TV screen
Like a boss would do, how the fuck could you
Deny my gangsta? Haters in my rearview
All around the world, they respectin' a G
Overseas they respectin' the C, that's on me
I did it like I did it mane
Uh, if you ain't did it you ain't did a thang
Uh, you come through, you better holler at me
You need beats, you better holler at P
Now put your sets up

Oh I ain't got a problem, you see me gettin' stacks
You see I bought the Phantom, 24's don't come with that
I've been around the world, check grip in every state
Yo' bitch don't like me, she fake, some people might call it hate
But I don't give a damn, a bosses life is how I make that bread
Toss the mic and I'll still be richer than rich and have yo' bitch make my bed
My pockets fat as shit, you niggas mad as shit
Pumps "Neither One of Us", I'm on some Gladys shit
Many have tried and failed, shit I'm out on bail
I make more cheese than your old man and he went to Yale
Shit I went to jail, you can go to hell
You got some shit to tell? I got some shit for sale

I gotta get this paper, my kids they gotta eat
We got a lot of heat, just case them dollars cease
Been out for ballin', shot callin' I make that change
And I don't want the Range, chop that trey on thangs
That's how them gangstas do it, we get our green in bricks
We put our green in blunts, you spend your green on chicks
I'm on some player shit, dynasty, straight Laker shit
Cook it up on some baker shit and chop it up for some paper bitch
I got my mind right, and my money right
If you ain't in the game for the money you the funny type
And I'm laughin' my ass off, Phantom with the mask off
Legal so they hatin' when I gas off
You know how Snoopy does it, Phantom don't bitch touch it
One hundred thousand a show, I'm gettin' doe like fuck it

I'm bout my business boy, makin' money never been so smooth
Your bitch you 'bout to lose, cause she about to choose
And that's the way it goes, S-N double-One
You want that quiet type, I want that trouble ho
Now go get paper girl, yeah I meant for real
One time I told a bitch not to come back 'til she got $2,000 in $2 bills
That's cold game, the whole thang
I'm high as Soul Plane, I smoked the whole thang
You know how daddy do it, I'm true to it
I take a cocaine Buick and put some blue to it
That's some gangsta shit, these hoes love this gangsta dick
Khakis and some gangsta kicks, yeah bitch that's my gangsta fit

Car full of hoes and the music gon' bang
Everybody everybody, yeah we all doin everythang
So you know what's happenin, ain't no need to pitty-pat
Dogg in this motherfucker, yeah I get the kitty cat
Swervin on the 110, blowin on some purp'
One hand on the steerin wheel, the other up her mini-skirt
Tryin to get some pussy while I'm pushin my whip
Funny thing about is that I'm fuckin yo' bitch
Okay yo, ho lay low
Get mayo, like O.J. yo, say ho
Plug it in, pull it out
Put it in, what it is, that's what it's all about
Now what would I be
If I let a punk motherfucker run up on me?
I play chess, checkmate him in the streets
32 feet off glass, that's threes
Swish swish, fresh fish
Ain't that a bitch? Like Ray J, I got +One Wish+
Look at the plates I'm in
I never fucked Superhead or Kim Kardashian
It's a disgrace to yourself
Dogg is the champ, to the face with the belt
I'm undefeated, undisputed, persecuted
Spaded and neutered, faded and booted

We got that chronic chronic

Put your hands in the sky
Stick up, pick a piece of American pie
What kind of car do you drive?
Suicide doors on the passenger side
Do the windows roll down? Do the doors lift high?
Do the car change colors when that bitch drift by?
I don't really know and I don't really care
Cause me and my money's like Sonny & Cher
Spend dough at the Gucci sto'
I never spend dough on no coochie though (stop lyin)
You can check it, I got a record
In Brazil for runnin out and not payin a bitch (see ya)
Juvenile delinquent, see when I speak this
Move and I'll bleep this, lil' nigga peep this
No secret this all exposed
If you grew up on my music, your momma one of my hoes
Your daddy one of my foes
Your granny been to one of my shows
It is contrary, that my literature-y is very necessary
You feel me? And you can try to rewind it, define it
Assign it to a whole nother groove
Play it to another move, hope you go through
Cause you on strike two
With 12 jurors of your peers, you better hope they like you
Ain't no tellin what they might do
So I'mma just stay out they motherfuckin white view
Dippin in and out of town, got to get a hundred thou'
Even if it's just for a sit-down
I've been blessed by kings and kissed by queens
Even got a homie named Prince Akeem
Yes I mean, Black Diamonds, I can have anything
Yup, this 20 Gang
Even if I could've I would've, never stop
I started on the bottom now they got him on the top
Sensation - Bigg Snoop Dogg
Ranked #1 in the nation
Top draft pick, always got a top bad bitch
Every time you see me, niggas wanna be me

Bada-bing, bada-boom, what a dogg gotta do?
Let me holler at you boo, damn I miss you
I just wanna kiss you, and all that good stuff
Was I really all that bad or was I good enough?
I'm under pressure, I can't run plays like this
My mama always said that there'll be days like this
I'm all alone by the phone, in a zone, face is stone
Wonderin', if you ever comin' home
I try to run the streets and play
But that feeling just won't go away
My whole life I'd throw away, to get you back on my team
Damn, why'd you have to go away?

[Hook]
I miss your breakfast in the mornin'
Miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'
Please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me
I'm missin' my baby, think I'm goin' crazy

(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
You can't leave me by myself like this
(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
Mama told me there'll be days like this

[Snoop Dogg]
I get up early in the mornin', miss your rudeness and kissin'
I also miss that smell of that good breakfast in the kitchen
Listen, I'm a star but I'm wishin'
To follow you wherever you are
You the wheels to my car, and I can't roll without you
My heart is a ice box, it's cold without you
Why'd you have to, leave me this way?
I'm doin' bad, you don't wanna see me this way
I'm at the pad, tryin' to do my best
I'm so stressed, and yes I'm still the King of the West
Tryin' to manage, and I'm gon' handle it
I need you back in my life, cause I'm tired of livin' scandalous

[Hook]
I miss your breakfast in the mornin'
Miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'
Please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me
I'm missin' my baby, think I'm goin' crazy

(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
You can't leave me by myself like this
(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
Mama told me there'll be days like this

[Snoop Dogg]
Oh my Lord, I'm sittin' at the board with my head down
I can't write my next line, I need to lay it down
Hmm, I'm stuck like a dump truck
Lookin' stupid, cupid down on my luck
I touch a four leaf clover
Hopin' for somethin' good, like I should
If not I guess it's over
Baby be real with it
Do you love me, do you miss me?
I can't deal with it

[Hook]
I miss your breakfast in the mornin'
Miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'
Please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me
I'm missin' my baby, think I'm goin' crazy

(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
You can't leave me by myself like this
(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
Mama told me there'll be days like this

[Verse 1]
I'm the coldest of the coldest, the dopest of the dopest
The smoothest of the smoothest and the locest of the locest
The whole world on point for this new joint that I just put together
So kindly, and you can find me on the Coast with the most, layin' high post
Playin' it close with a bunch of thug niggas, drug dealers
Project fools, C-Murder pass them tools
Shit I'm 'bout to make these motherfuckers get up
I draw the line between yours and mines and make sure you don't get lit up
Hit up the motherfuckin' set when I dip
(Where you from?)
Dogg Pound motherfuckin' Gangsta Crip
Split wigs for a livin', everyday's Thanksgiving
Motherfuck y'all rides, we slides, nigga we dippin'
The tank's driven by the colonel Mr. Master P
Lil' Silkky, Mystikal, C, and me and Fiend
Nigga don't be trippin', cause we got my lil' homie in the cut
That's Soulja Slim nigga, he known for dippin', what's up?
(Don't let go)
We love to bang bang
And the rap game is just like the dope game
The minute you forget it - forget it, you bit it
But them niggas know when you ain't with it
That's when they get ignant'
(Don't let go)

[Chorus]
Life will twist ya like a twista, get twisted with this
It seems it's on, but it's off, I keep missin' and shit
I'm high but I try to stay focused, wide eyed
Lookin' dead at the chips, I blink, they dip
(Don't let go)
Life will twist ya like a twista, get twisted with this
It seems it's on, but it's off, I keep missin' and shit
I'm high but I try to stay focused, wide eyed
Lookin' dead at the chips, I blink, they dip, it's hard to hang on
(Don't let go)...
(Don't let go)...

[Verse 2]
Check this out man -
I'm the hardest of the hardest, the realest of the realest
See but I don't fuck with nothin' but G's, ballers, and killers
So pardon my expression G
If yo' bitch is seen with one of my niggas in the click
You best believe she done ate a gangsta dick
And you can't fault one of my niggas for that
Shit, we just a bunch of thug niggas, ex-drug dealers
The kind of gangsta ass niggas that your bitch love niggas
But don't do that to yourself cause I'ma tell ya
I love to plug niggas with the slug niggas
Now if yo' bitch way out of line
And you think about steppin' to Doggy Dogg, you better take your time
Cause you out on a limb fuckin' with Slim
And you don't even know that, cause ain't nobody told him that
I need to just show him that
Cause I'm a pistol packin', car jackin', hoe smackin' MC
I don't know why all y'all bitches is fuckin' with me
Fuck all my enemies, I'm chasin cheese with G's
Servin' tapes and CD's by the three's and ki's
Nigga, Biggie was large, and 2Pac was too real
They had homies with heat on the street and they still got killed
Now how the fuck did that happen?, I thought them niggas was rappin'
But in this real world, shit, murder keep thangs crackin'
Homicides, drive-by's, and kidnappin'
Shit, when you head up out the door, nigga don't forget your fo'-fo'
Never leave home without it, shit, why dogg?
Cause niggas everywhere gettin' rowdy and bout it, and don't doubt it
Real violence aside, just don't forget it
Cause like I said, when you ain't with it, them niggas get ignant'

[Chorus]
Life will twist ya like a twista, get twisted with this
It seems it's on, but it's off, I keep missin' and shit
I'm high but I try to stay focused, wide eyed
Lookin' dead at the chips, I blink, they dip
(Don't let go)
Life will twist ya like a twista, get twisted with this
It seems it's on, but it's off, I keep missin' and shit
I'm high but I try to stay focused, wide eyed
Lookin' dead at the chips, I blink, they dip, it's hard to hang on
(Don't let go)...
(Don't let go)...
(Don't let go)...

[Verse 1]
For all my homies with the eight tray Regals (ride on)
And all the playas in the '79 Coupes (ride on)
For all of my gang affiliates in tha hoppin' '68
This one's from me to you (ride on)
Well, not the Under Dogg, call me the Wonder Dogg
I keep it crackin' while I'm stackin' in this game called rappin'
Now I kick up my feet like I kick a rhyme to a beat
And everytime you see me on the streets ,I gots some heat
Hell, yeah, then pass the beat
And everybody wanna know what's up with me and Master P (ughh)
For your concern, you knew there wann't no gimmick
When I got into some gangsta shit and told you wann't No Limit
To the thangs I'm gon' do
Now it's really goin' down with the DPGC
Well, Daz did the beat, and Kurupt got the heat
And Tray Dee, he laid the hook and Supafly played the keys (woo, woo)
Ughh, it get no realer than this from the LB to the Down South
Add more killers to this entourage
South, West, oh, yes
We in charge and we'll pull your cards
No disrespect or disregards
Life in the big LB is gettin' hard (so what)
So my squad gon' mob and drop bombs
Ring the alarm, we causin' bodily harm

[Chorus]
I make ya scream (ahhhhhh)
I make ya shout (ooooohhh)
C'mon all you party people
Let me turn ya out
Cuz you know I'm all about
The hoes, money, and clout
And I rock a Long Beach City (heyyyyyy)
All the way down South
I make ya scream (ahhhhhh)
I make ya shout (ooooohhh)
C'mon all you party people
Let me turn ya out
Cuz you know I'm all about
The hoes, money, and clout
And I rock a Long Beach City (heyyyyyy)
All the way down South

[Interlude]
Can you feel me?

Hoes, take me to the bridge
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg (who)
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg (what)
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg (who)
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg

[Verse 2]
Whether in a Khaki suit or a pinstripe
I'm a G for G and dat there's for life
You can bet your bottom biscuit
You get twisted if you dwellin' in my felon intuition (what up)
Tha Doggfather is a household name
From basketball to alcohol, everybody love the Dogg
I'm sure Billy Clinton probably got a Doggystyle tape
Somewhere hidden in his briefcase
Newsweek, Rolling Stone, major magazines
Dope fiends, prom queens, we too clean
Take a look you ain't ever seen
One hip-hop rapstar drop this West Coast rap-cord
Back to the spot up top
West Hills for real, give it up to him (WC)
I hoo-bang with diamond
Take a hit with B-Legeezy or 40 Fonzereezy
With blue Colion playin' in the background
On the behind line with big style
Hitting P, LIG tell him let it go
Game strong, no longer in the roll
Just a few names from the respected files
LBC styles, DPG ale
I bought a house with a lake in the back
My big holey stack just like that

[Chorus]
I make ya scream (ahhhhhh)
I make ya shout (ooooohhh)
C'mon all you party people
Let me turn ya out
Cuz you know I'm all about
The hoes, money, and clout
And I rock a Long Beach City (heyyyyyy)
All the way down South
I make ya scream (ahhhhhh)
I make ya shout (ooooohhh)
C'mon all you party people
Let me turn ya out
Cuz you know I'm all about
The hoes, money, and clout
And I rock a Long Beach City (heyyyyyy)
All the way down South

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Damn a nigga only got 20 dollars shit
Check this out

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Nigga 20 dollars to my name
Deep in this dice game
I dust off my knees
I fucked off two g's
Nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my Glock
Why? so I can rob every known dope spot
I'm having hard times, grit, and grind
Shit I'm trying to get mine
Ain't nothing to lose plus I'm living on the frontline
It's a cold twist the way that shit goes
Gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo
And keep a down bitch for when your money run out
And get you gun out
And shoot'em up 'til they come out
I'm blowing in the wind
It feels good my friend
Silkk brought the Gin & Juice and my nigga chipped in
I'm amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc
A drug dealer at the same time I love to smoke
But if I wasn't in this rap game
Would a nigga Snoop Dogg have 20 dollars to my name

[Chorus: Fiend]
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb
Cause we smoke too much weed
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb
Cause we smoke too much weed

[Verse 2: Fiend]
I got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?
With this automatic rocket
Gotta have it to pop it, unlock it, and take me up a hostage
Let'em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch
Extended Glock clips allow me to cop chips
Erasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this
Cold blooded killing for 

[?] this
Soda couldn't rock this
Chop a shelf when I drop this
My 

[?] can't chop this
The hunger that I hold
Setting here wondering should I take it from his soul
See this here with a hole
Allowed that silencer to blow
And took motherfuckin' lives for less than twenty before

[Verse 3: Soulja Slim]
Now with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja
Because that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober
I seen my nigga nigga from way way back
Me and him used to jack and rock a rental Cadillac
He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossin
He sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin
And I'm bossin, and tossin' 'em up at the same time
So if you thinking about with me it'll be your death in ???
And why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that's all I got
And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain't worth being
Shot

[Chorus: Fiend]
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb
Cause we smoke too much weed
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb
Cause we smoke too much weed

[Verse 4: Silkk the Shocker]
Now look, I'm fresh up out of jail it feels good to be on the outside
I had 120 dollars, but I spent a 100 on my ride
Now the only thing I got left is 20 dollars to my name
Nigga want front me some motherfuckin' caine
I told him weed charge it 2 the game
Nigga now now I gotta be on some murder one shit
Some slum shit Some out the projects dumb shit
Some weed and blunt shit Some I don't give a fuck shit
Where it from shit Some penitentiary solitary
Confinement never see no motherfuckin' sun shit
Now I got 20 dollars to my motherfuckin' name, and I gotta get more
So I tell nigga hit the floor I'm about to pull a motherfuckin' kick
Door Now whether it's rapping, or jacking, kidnapping, or gun totting
Y'all call me down 

[?] do get scared I ain't flipped 'til my guns smoking

Gotta get my hustle
On Got 20 dollars y'all now that shit don't last long picture this

The Scene: Long Beach yeah '86
Where: The liquor store nigga on some devilish shit

My homeboy got away but shit I wasn't tellin'

In the County jail rappin and bangin' at the same time
And since I don't smoke cigarettes loc
Shit I gotta slang mine
And I ain't tryin' to get on swole so I ain't fuckin' with the iron
I got bitches bringin' me money and ain't a goddamn thing funny
My homeboy Devil from the HCG and Young Side Trey R.I.P
From the ETG Eight-Trey and oh yeah Baby Ken Dawg
From the Westside Four-O's got love for Short and my
Homeboy J-Ball from the Seven four

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
GAME, that's my thang
And it ain't no rules when you in this game

[Verse 2: Crooked Eye]
There's ten laws to the game nigga be raised by 'em all
Get ya respect on at all times nigga hustle 'til ya ball
Watch them hatas and pretendas and all the shit they do
Cause nowadays some of these niggas be bitches too
Keep the business professional get ya heat at all times
Keep them snitches on the sideline
Cause you know pressure burst the pipeline
Keep ya eyes on ya enemies watch those close to ya
See them outside niggas can't touch ya
It be the ones inside that do ya
Smilin' in ya face but want to take yo' place
Fuck around and be playa let's make a deal with the D.A
Don't be ridin' with no niggas
Who ain't sure if he gon' get down
Cause it only take a split second
To get ya buck buck and lay down
Hesitation'll buy ya fate get that ass all caught up
Ya little homey might be cool
If them other two priors ain't brought up
Remember took time to kill smash and don't give a fuck
Be a hog about ya papers straight hungry for that der come up
Respect the game feel what the soldier talkin' about
If you got to be in that game stack ya change
And get the fuck out!

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
GAME, that's my thang

[Verse One]
I'm still smokin, driftin, swifter than a motherfucker
Twisted off a cup of that 'ole ignat juice
Heated in the seat cup fulla drank
Beatin up the block in the dark blue tank
Bullet proof vest on my chest for the cause
Dig in my draws for dem muthafuckin laws
Harrassin a nigga, blastin a nigga
I ain't seen shit, so why you askin nigga
I'm too fucked up off that G-I and juice
C-I get loose, nigga what chall wanna do
I got a crew, but I choose to roll solo
Especially on Sundays dippin in my low-low
Convertible top spot for the Glock
I ain't fuckin with the hen dogg, so toss out the sauce hot
Put my shit on three wheels for thrills
I hit a corner and make sure my drink don't spill, that's real

[Hook]
Rollin down the street, with heat
Drankin, trees, sittin on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin, I keep my eyes on my enemies
Rollin down the street, with heat
Drankin, trees, sittin on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin, I keep my eyes on my enemies

[Verse Two]
Now trip dis, I'm on Interstate 10 fuckin with this Creole

Cup of that Gin and Juice, I blank a bitch out
Then turn the bitch out, look here
Ain't no need for you be wastin my time
See I picked you up, now I'mma stick you up, and dick you up!
And give you what you need
And then bring you back down to reality
With that California weed, she seemed trouble at first
And then it got worse, cause now (stop)
I got my hand up and down her mini-skirt
Twerkin that shit while I'm ridin up the highway
Doin it my way, the hella highway, the fly way
Swervin in another lane, tryin to maintain
And baby girl steady takin dick to the brain
Left no stain, cause she swallowed it up
Then she wanted to take a puff
I said "Look here bitch you done had enough" (hold up, hold up)

[Hook]
Rollin down the street, with heat
Drankin, trees, sittin on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin, I keep my eyes on my enemies
Rollin down the street, with heat
Drankin, trees, sittin on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin, I keep my eyes on my enemies

Somebody say, I wanna get fucked up
(Say what, say what)
Come on, now
Everybody say, I wanna get fucked up
(What'chu say, what'chu say) YAH

[Verse Three]
I popped by the ice cream shop
To cop something, pop something, ya heard me
Where's Serv-B, nigga well serve me
Since you got that big bad ass dank
Nigga you know I'm known for havin that big ass bank
Tryin to buy all your dope, cause you're a smoker
I'll find that indo weed even when I'm on the East Coast
Cause times gettin hard on the boulevard
But I refuse to lose by a zip of that backyard (hell no)
Lil' Jimmy's sent me something, I need to cop something
Got Some (Got Some), I know you got some
Nigga stop frontin, get at your boy
Hook it up like Master P (Ughh)
Or would it be a tragedy, ya feel me, the best weed nigga

[Hook]
Rollin down the street, with heat
Drankin, trees, sittin on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin, I keep my eyes on my enemies
Rollin down the street, with heat
Drankin, trees, sittin on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin, I keep my eyes on my enemies
Biach
Trade mark

[Intro: C-Murder]
For all them young niggas that didn't quite make it to another year

[Verse 1: C-Murder]
To all my thugs in the grave
This one is for my homies and my thug niggas
A bunch of used to be paranoid drug dealers
About it motherfucker standing on the block
Ain't no limit to his heart, cause his veins is non-stop
And constantly a nigga catching them cases
With them death situations
A nigga blast with no hesitation
Mama I wanna now where my daddy at
My only memory is a picture with a chrome gat
I wanna do, like them gangsters do
I wanna gangster walk
I caught a bullet now I'm in some chalk
Just another young nigga in a song
Mama always told me gangster's don't live long
After I'm dead can you still see me
Do you really want to be me
I'm just another bossaline
I represent all them niggas trying to get paid
But couldn't be saved
Huh, y'all now what I'm talking about

[Chorus: C-Murder & Snoop Dogg]
To all my thugs in the grave
See ya when I get there
See ya when I get there
To all my thugs in the grave
See ya when I get there
See ya when I get there
To all my thugs in the grave
See ya when I get there
See ya when I get there
To all my thugs in the grave
See ya when I get there
See ya when I get there

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
Ride nigga 'til I deduct
Them things die nigga for fuck
Fly. fly nigga
Since you absent I'ma tilt the bottle
Hit the weed and get high for my nigga
My partner my nigga
My round in my trigger
From the little shit I remember you was a down ass nigga
I'm mad I missed the shit you could have showed me  (fuck)
Shit still ain't the same even though my mama told me
I keep your memories in my endeavors (nigga)
Thank you for being my daddy, thank you for what you left us
I swear to protect, and the only way to carry on, is carry on
My nigga little Mike, my nigga G-Slim, and my cousin Larry gone
I ain't trying to question God, but why so young
That's why from daylight to night time I got my gun
This fucking thing we call life ain't nothing but a phase
That's why you better keep your faith,or you're that thug in the grave

[Chorus: C-Murder & Snoop Dogg]
To all my thugs in the grave
See ya when I get there
See ya when I get there
To all my thugs in the grave
See ya when I get there
See ya when I get there
To all my thugs in the grave
See ya when I get there
See ya when I get there
To all my thugs in the grave
See ya when I get there
See ya when I get there

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Rest in peace khaki's creased
From the east side of Long Beach
Pouring out liquor, thinking about my homie
Cause I can't understand how it went down
We used to clown from town to town
Claiming dogg pound
Took you on Lollapalooza with a nigga
L-Dog you my nigga
If you don't get no bigger
Spanky Loco from the the dub, and Little Man from the I
Dear God why them good niggas have to die
I can't reminisce too long
Cause I'm in a war zone
If I sleep, slip, trip I might get blasted on
So I'm gone mash on home
But on the way I see some of my enemies
And they tripping on me
Cause I fuck with Master P
But I'm heated, so beat it
And another 87 case, I really don't need it
Proceeded, I ain't gone cry for the homie
Shit we gone celebrate
Cause we now the homeboy is in a safer and better place

[Chorus: C-Murder & Snoop Dogg]
To all my thugs in the grave
See ya when I get there
See ya when I get there
To all my thugs in the grave
See ya when I get there
See ya when I get there
To all my thugs in the grave
See ya when I get there
See ya when I get there
To all my thugs in the grave
See ya when I get there
See ya when I get there

[Verse 1: Snoop]
I'm in Junior High with a C+ grade
At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade
I to school from my moms apartment
I got to tell these niggas everyday don't shit
Cause where I'm at if you soft you lost
And to stay on course, you got to roll with force
My homeboy Dogg is chilling in a Benz
In front of his building witht the rest of his friends
I give him a pound no I mean I shake his hand
He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man
I go upstairs, I hug my mother
I kiss my sister and I punch my brother
I sit down on the bed to watch some TV

[Gun Shots] Do my ears decieve me
No That's the fourth time this week
Four young brothers got shot in the street
The very next day while I'm off to class
My momma go to work cold bustin' her ass
My sisters cute but shes got no gear
I got three pair of pants and with my brother I share
So there in school I made a fool
With one and a half pair of pants, you ain't cool
Cause there's no dollars for nothing else
I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf
Now everyday I see my momma struggling
So now its time I got to do something
I look for work
I get dissed like a jerk
I do odd jobs
And come home like a slob
So here comes Dogg his gold is shivery
He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery
I do it once I do it twice
And now there's stake with the beans and rice
My mothers nervous but she knows the deal
My sisters gear now has sex appeal
My brothers my partner and were getting paper
And three months later the whole hood cought the vapors
My family's happy and everything is new
Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya

[Interlude: Mac]
Ay yo yo Check this out Snoop
All these niggas always talking about
"They looove this" And niggas got looove for you
Or nigga I looove this ride or this chin around my neck nigga
You niggas don't know what the fuck love really mean
Nigga you can't buy love at no corner store nigga
Love ain't got no price tag
Snoop I want you to kick this shit to them niggas

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Hmm, money is flowing everything is fine
I bought my self and Uzi and my brother a nine
Business is booming everything is cool
I pull about a G a week, fuck school
A year passed by and I began to grow
Not in height but juice and cash flow
I kick up my feet to watch some t.v
Cause now I got other people working for me
I got a 55" television you know
And every once in a while I hear "Just say no"
Or the other commercial I love
That's when they say this is you brain on drugs
I pick up the remote control and just turn
Cause with this bullshit I'm not concerned
Me and my brother bounced in the Benz
We driving around our territory again
I pull up at the light like a superstar
An automatic weapon cold sprayed my car
I hit the accelerator scared as shit
I drove one block to find my brother was hit
He wasn't dead but the blood was pouring
And all I could think about was Warren
Later I found it was Dogg and his crew
Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya

[Interlude: Mac]
Yeah so now you see what I'm talkin' 'bout nigga
You see what that love shit do ya
This nigga said he had love nigga and this nigga done shot yo brother
So what the fuck you gon' do now

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
My brother is out of it but I'm still in it
On top of that I'm in it to win it
I can't believe that Dogg would dis me
That faggot that punk he soft or sissy
I driving around with three of my guys
The war is on and I'm on the rise
We rolled right up to Dogg's favorite hang out
What's cracking Dogg and let the bullets stang out
Someone shot back so we took cover
And all I could about was my brother
Dogg jumped up and began to run
Bustin shots hoping to hit someone
So I just stopped and let off three shot
Two hit that nigga and one hit a cop
I threw down the gun and began to shout
"Ay y'all all lets break out got 'em dip out
Now as I left there goes the boys in blue
They pointin they guns at my four man crew
They shot down one, they shot down two
Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Ya see the moral of the story is this
Love is a motherfucka
And Doggs is a motherfucka
You mix the two up you bound to get some drama
Loves gonna get ya
Naw nigga Doggz gonna get ya you ever try to play me and thats real
That's real

In fact we stack G's for them keys, so when we finished doin' deeds
You all can't believe what we did
Provide an opportunity in the community
Tryin' to spread a lil' unity between you and me
Since IM the mayor, I think I gotta say-ahh a lil' something

So everybody in the world, welcome to the muthafuckin dogg house

[Hook x 2]

[Intro: Eddie Griffin]
This is a public service announcement going out to all the paper haters
Now, sure, sure, sure, you're broke, sure, sure, sure, you're having problems
Food stamps didn't come on time and the lights have been cut off
But look here -

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Here's a little something about a nigga like me
I never should have been let out the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker when I'm playing with my AK
Since I was a youth I smoked weed out
Now I'm that motherfucker y'all read about
Smoking you out and your crew, taking a life or two
You don't like how I'm living well fuck you
This is my gang nigga No Limit
My nigga C will fuck you up in a minute
With the pow pow bang bang and you're dead
And then we stamp that tank on your forehead
Everywhere we go they say "DAMN"
Them gangstas they be fucking up the program
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no we too busy saying yeah
About drinking straight out the satin bottle
Do I look like a motherfucking role model
To a kid looking up to me
Shit life ain't nothing but weed and money
Shit I'm that type of nigga that's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck cause I keep selling
Yo what the fuck are they yelling

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they yelling
Niggas living rowdy and stay 'bout it, 'bout it
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they selling
The bitches keep buying 'cause they love that straight G shit
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they yelling
Niggas living rowdy and stay 'bout it, 'bout it
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they selling
The bitches straight buying it 'cause they love that straight G shit

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Homies all standing around just hanging
Some dope dealing some gang banging
We decide to roll and we deal
Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, in you before you know
I had my double (gauge) pointing at his window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rolling I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him so I said "fuck it"
Then we headed right back to Snoop's
Sweating on the bitches in the daisy dukes
We couldn't no play from the ladies
With seven niggas in the Nav is you crazy
She was scared and it was showing
So we all said "FUCK YOU BITCH" and kept rolling
To the hood now we was 'fen to
Find something else to get into
Like some pussy or in fact
Getting rowdy, shit but we caught the rat pack
On a nigga 'for nuttin at all
Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fucking with my tank dogs
I might stumble but still won't lose
Now I'm draped in my gangsta blue's
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's quick to blast
You fuck with me or C and I'll blast your ass
See I don't give a fuck cause I keep bailing
Yo what the fuck are they yelling

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they yelling
Niggas living rowdy and stay 'bout it, 'bout it
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they selling
The bitches want to buy it 'cause they love that straight G shit
Gangsta -

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg]
Hol- hold on Craig, B cut that shit man
Muh-fuck that man, we need some gangsta shit in this motherfucker
Some of that south shit know what I'm saying
Some of that shit from the thiz-ird ya heard me
Here's another gangsta down to ride
A T-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
He represents the tank but yet hard to hit
Snoop Dogg and C-Murder with this gangsta shit

[Verse 3: C-Murder]
Well I'm C-Murder the one he talking about
Nigga tried to play me close and got punched in the mouth
Fed's tried to get me you know they some haters
I said "See you later" jumped in the Navigator
With the $50's in the back with the navy blue top
TRU niggas on the scene with the triple beam
Cause I'm the C fool I slang and Snoop bang
And I'll smoke a motherfucker like it ain't no thing
To all my bitches, I know you're jocking my crew
We want to fuck you C
I want to fuck you too
You see No Limit niggas don't take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you fucking with
Cause I'm the kind of nigga that's quick to blast
If you fuck with me, I'm a smoke your ass
I don't give a fuck cause No Limit stay selling
Now tell me what the fuck are they yelling?

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they yelling
Niggas living rowdy and stay 'bout it, 'bout it
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they selling
The bitches want to buy it 'cause they love that straight G shit

[Outro: Eddie Griffin]
If you'd of just stayed down and been a motherfuckers real partner you wouldn't have had that problem
But seeing as you want to jump ship when you thought the ship would sink and motherfucker without just turning into a submarine, went under water came back up with a periscope looking at your bitch ass
Now you have no paper, and you on a paper caper
Now you coming up in my face and you're saying "Hey can I hangout"
I say "No" cause you ain't got no clout bitch get out
Now I'm tired of all you silly ass motherfucking paper chasing hoes
Uhh this has been a public service announcement from No Limit Records
In the Doggy Dogg world

[Chorus: Odell & Porsha]
Slow down cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(Slow down baby, slow down baby)
It's wicked in these streets
Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(Ohhhhhhhhh, slow down)
It's wicked in these streets

[Snoop Dogg]
Life ain't nothing but a big old twist
A lot of times when I'm smoking
I'm doing that just to reminisce
It's funny, on how shit be
A lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me
But look here, I work hard for all the things I got
And to hang with a nigga's just an intricate plot
You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes
And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors
But look here dog, a hoe once told me loc
Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke
Bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it with rich niggas
Nigga we seven figure niggas
And we bigger than the biggest hip hop niggas in rap
And when we get to spittin' make sure y'all step back
You with that? Cause if you ain't clown
We from the D-O double G, we groupie true, and slow down

[Chorus]

[Mia X]
Ayyo Snoop (I used to)
I used to cook up dope, ride with niggas
Know about the hits, hang with killas
Take the broads down for the jailhouse visits
Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga
Have the card parties where the stakes was high
Go shopping hit the club and then start come out
Never had a day without no drama
Half the OG's age, but they call me Mama
Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag
Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad
I never thought about my life I swear y'all, for real
Until my best friend Jill got killed and then I
Dropped to my knees and called to the Lord
Please change my ways cause I'm living too hard
And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child
When I'm out here buck wild, damn, I had to slow down

[Chorus]

[Mia X]
Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut
And started putting all this game on records for my come up
From sun up to sun down, I'm trying to get my money
Hata's ain't gon' stop me cause hatas can't run me
It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul
Every body seemed glad, but now they meal
Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free
And Feds can't take shit from me, so slow down

[Snoop Dogg]
I got niggas shot niggas drop niggas for fun
I scroop from these shoulders, I don't need no gun
But it's the nineties, and niggas don't bump by the end of the round
The clown bound to dump, young chump
You don't wanna get caught up in my mix
Cause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch
We don't neva eva, talk no shit
Unless we mack that shit up, nigga you get lit

[Odell (Porsha)]
Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas
Slow down (slow down), cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(I can't take the heat)
It's wicked in these streets (It's wicked in the street)
Slow down, (I can't take the heat no more) cause I can't take the heat
Slow down (I can't take it) it's wicked in these streets
Slow down (slow down) cause I can't take the heat
(Slow down) Slow down
Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas
Slow down slow down
Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas

[Intro: Master P & (Snoop Dogg)]

Nigga, let's keep it real
Keep your eyes on your enemies cause some niggas kill
And the bitches, they'll break ya
Keep your dick in your pants nigga, cause they'll play ya

[Chorus: Master P]
Watcha gon' do when we come for you
If you a dog you better not run (Uhhhhh!)
Watcha gon' do when we come for you

Went from halves to wholes, from wood to marble floors
Fuckin with hoodrats to top notch hoes

Tick tock, we got shit locked (say what)
Goddamn it feel good to be sittin on top
So let's toast to the gin and juice and champagne
Welcome to my world and Snoop is the name

All the weeds, dope,coke and alcohol at the parties

[Verse 1]
It's like 4 & to the 5 & to the 6 & to the 7
I once was told that all doggs go to Heaven
Well how ya been where ya been & what it look like?
My game trump tight especially when it bump like
Four DPG's gettin' crazy
And No Limit is the label that pays me!
Ridin' 'round town layin' game down like Goldie
And I remember what my momma showed me
Told me game recognize game
& stay true to what ya do & don't be ashamed
I got all my game from her sometimes I have to wonder
How I keep from goin' under I'm a cold muthafucka
I fall to my knees & thank God before I do my thang
I don't know why, I love to gangbang
See life ain't nuthin' but a twist anyway bitch anyway
You can say what you wanna say
Just don't get in my way cause I'm a mean old
Fiend know C know & P know see loc
We make music for the thugs and the bangers
And the bitches. Fuck you R&B singers
She want a nigga with his khakis hangin' real low
In a black rag Sixty-four hmm
Rollin' down the street lookin' way clean
Bangin' that real shit nigga like Al Green
I'm headed straight to the LB
Forget it that's what they tell me
Sell me everythang except some bullshit
And when it's time for the gunfight nigga pull quick
Cause ain't nothin' butter but us
And nigga you'll get wet up for fuckin' with my cheddar
It's cold outside nigga grab ya sweater
And that bad bitch you fuckin' with
Nigga she get ya set up
Boy you done put all ya trust in that ho
Didn't ya see what happened to the President niggaro
Livin' in a tight house big as the White House
You fucked around & stuck ya dick
In that white bitch mouth
What you talkin' 'bout? Fool I'm dirty like the South
And to be real I feel that's how I'm comin' out
Back on the ho stroll highway pimp patrol
Put ya cuffs on ya girl nigga let her off parole
Man nigga way cold with his game
What's his muthafuckin' name? Who me?
I'm the capital S I don't fuck with stress
N double O-P D-O muthafuckin double G
Coldest entertainer gangbanger since Alphonse Capone
Count money like Basie police try to chase me
Niggas try to replace me but you can't
I'm ridin' in a tank I'm blowin' hella dank
So whether ridin' in ya lo-lo or smokin' on some doe doe
Spread the word and take the fo' door
The Last Don done hooked up with the muthafuckin'
King of the coast with the most here's a toast
And Snoop Dogg is the representer
Through the niggas & G's through the LBC's
And the Calio projects Brooklyn to Queens
Chi-town woe now the Dogg Pound in the house
Everytime we touch down right next to my hometown

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Ya I don't know why you treat me so motherfuckin bad
You ain't gonna realize whats you got till its gone, thats real
You gets no lovin, babe

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Girl you know I got you livin plush in the cut
And every time I wanna dig you out
You tell me "don't rush"
Money stashin, you got me sneakin
And we all alone in the zone, I be tweakin
I almost got caught, my game is leaking
I had to stay at my daddy's house, on the couch last weekend
It's written on my face, and I can't even hide it
So I decided, to ride it
Roses are red, and Violets are blue
Girl you got a nigga hooked, when you do whatcha do when ya do
And now ya want a Benz for ya birthday
And I been waitin to hit that ass since the first day
I'm buyin you gifts, draping you out, with gold
I'm showin you love, you's above any other hoe
Tattoo wit my name on your tits
And everytime I dip, I make sure to kick some chips
Now bitch trip

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Snoop Dogg]
You don't show me some love
Show me love, for real, you gets no love, yeah
You gets no loving, babe
You gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it 'til it's gone
You don't show me some love
Show me love, for real, you gets no love, yeah
You gets no loving, babe
You gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it 'til it's gone

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
And that's on us, and I trust you won't bust under pressure
And I ain't even trip, when you dip wit them chips off the dresser
And you didn't even have to fess up
I just gave you another G, and told you "pick ya dress up"
For the weddin, the settin was set
40 G's for your ring, you's a Queen sippin Moet
I'm upset, and I don't even want to have jip out
But baby didn't give it to me, ughh
I was down at the alter, I seen Sister Salta
Said "lady could you pray for me?" ughh
I'm in a love affair, I can't share, it ain't fair
Because my life is my wife, and that ain't right
Cause I'm a do what I'm suppose to do, and what I was choose to do
Whether it's buyin a house, or car, or some clothes for you
I try to stay true to it, see I ain't new to it
That's why I do for you boo, I need love too, three

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Snoop Dogg]
You don't show me some love
Show me love, for real, you gets no love, yeah
You gets no loving, babe
You gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it 'til it's gone
You don't show me some love
Show me love, for real, you gets no love, yeah
You gets no loving, babe
You gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it 'til it's gone

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
See I done put it on the line, see this here is genuine
An as long as you with me girl, see everything is gonna be fine
See can't nobody match it, don't touch it, ya might scratch it
This love affair, it's so original, I call it classic
See I'm attracted, an I'm infatuated
At the same time, elated, and gang related, Dogg Pound on mine
But to find time to leave all that behind
And try to spend some time and give you all of mine {what's that} ya see
I ain't hard to get along with, to do a song with a nigga like D.J. Pooh
Dedicate this whole thing, to a girl like you, boo, look here
You know I'm true, just continue to do me like you want me to do you
And, I hope we don't never have to, write another chapter
Just keep it on the real wit me
Cause I don't really wanna, see you on the corner
Just show a nigga love ya see {gets no love, gets no love}

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Snoop Dogg]
You don't show me some love
Show me love, for real, you gets no love, yeah
You gets no loving, babe
You gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it 'til it's gone
You don't show me some love
Show me love, for real, you gets no love, yeah
You gets no loving, babe
You gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it 'til it's gone

[Snoop]
Carla, Darla, Charlene and Camina
Tereka and Erika, they love to take care of a
Real motherfucker from the DPG
Keesha, Resha, Tammy and Renesha
I appreciate the way y'all skate
When the clock hit eight
Now April and Kate
Y'all be doin' too much
Running your mouths
Fuckin shit up, you gotta get up
Cus I done had enough
Getting sick and tired of the same stuff
You told Kamil and she told Karla
And she told April and now they all know
But I could give a fuck 'cus all y'all my hoes
So, all that confronting the real nigga on site
Today is today, last night was last night
As I leaned with my hand on my balls
I had to really check these bitches and tell 'em like this dog

(chorus)

[Snoop]
Nina do this and Tina do that
Sabrina, Sakina, nigga them all my hood rats
Back in the days when I was on the block
At an early age man, I was on the cock
Non-stop, I beat it up and tell that bitch to get ghost
(They be like hot butter on a breakfast toast)
Hollarin' out, poppin' a collar out
And talkin' shit on the phone to me at my baby-mama's house
(who's she?) Look here bitch do you know who the fuck I am
You better read your motherfuckin' press telegram
You remind me of this bitch that used to work for me
Had to cut the bitch up 'cus she tried to get too close to me
And tried to confront me at a club one night
Fuckin' with her friend, a fake bitch (Is that right?)
But you know I had to stop and I paused
And I put my hand on my balls and said check this out, dog
(chorus)

[Snoop]
I got my own spot and I got my own keys
So can't no bitch talk shit to me
Like Kiki did me, bitch changed the locks
And kicked me up outta spot
I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessin' or stressin'
I got another bitch and she was at the convalescent home
She said she needed a companion
Shit I needed a chaperone plus a new home
Snap, crack, it's on
But in no time at all seems she fell in love
But I wasn't ready for that
Topcat had to scat
I hit her friend from the back
While she was at work workin'
I was jerkin' that skirt
And fuckin with all her friends that was flirtin'
And when she found out she told me that that shit hurt (boo-hoo)
A week later she fucked my homeboy Kurt
Bitch you a'int shit but dirt for dirt (biotch!)

(chorus x2)

(shoop)
This is a sexy bitch
{*Music fades out*}

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Hell yeah

[Verse 1: Fiend]
I run with convicted felons screamin', yellin'
"Bitch, I'm a soldier!"
Sic'in' my chrome retriever, and I'm finsta get it over
Influenced by the doja
Blastin' at the rollers
Causin' company closures
Fuckin' over the soul, bitch
Your mom shoulda told ya I ain't nothin' nice
Snoop brought the boss
I got this bark that's gonna bite
I, put it on my life, and my favorite weed pipe
Soldier creeds with ice
And watch me boot up in the night
I, capital F-I, the one that bare a shotty
Bringing the drama like your pa caught your ma fucking somebody
What? Lodi Dodi, gin and juice up in the coupe
But not the heartache
Snoop and his soldiers gon' make you say

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Woof! motherfucker, Woof! motherfucker
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)

We tryna live some stress-free life
Pressure busts pipes
Yikes!

Vise grips on mics, turnin' 'em tight
I'm burnin' up the limelight, finally
And you ain't gotta strain your eyes to find me
'Cause I'm throwin' bad days behind me
Ah, damn it, it's headlights, now 'bout to let it shine
Come your ass in there tip-toeing, your ass is mine
We got 'em waiting on us by the radio for our albums to drop
Snoop, Fiend, me, Beats By The Pound, you know it's gon' pop
Jump in the game and walk away with enough money to run with
'Til you hear that last fuckin' "woof," we ain't done, bitch

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Let me hear ya say
Woof! motherfucker, Woof! motherfucker
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I come faster than a speedin' bullet
Or I can take my time and move slow
Wake up outta my seat and hit this mic and blow like some indo
You can call me what you want
Just don't call me no punk
My name is Snoop D-O-double-G
And I'm the godfather of G-Funk
I'll put this shit down, I clown, Dogg Pound is my set
Nigga step outta line, I'll shoot 'em in they motherfuckin' spine
And break they necks (Nigga, nigga)
That's how it goes down, you gon' realize that
See, when you run up in my face you liable to get smacked, jacked
Just like that (Like that)
I'm a fool, break the rules, down, way too cool (Hey, hey, hey)
They call me Snoop D-O-double-G
'Cause I'm a fuckin' fool
I can get silly
But I'd rather sit back, relax, new jacks, get smacked
'Cause I'm tryna blaze up a sack
To my nigga Mystikal, Fiend, and my big homie Master P
'Cause that's just the way this shit gon' be
Baby, N-O-L-I-M-I-T (No Limit)
We gon' make y'all say Woof

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]

[Intro: Kokane]
In these times, of hate and pain
We need a remedy, to help us through the rain
Can't you see, I'm straight OG (OG)
Fuck you niggas, think you can fuck with me

[Suga Free]
Oh c'mon
Make a pimp wanna jump back
Bitch, and fuck that
Shit, I'm qualified to knock a hoe no matter where ever I go
Excuse me partner, this the pimpin' let a pimpin pimpin' let you go
Break the bitch you say "I will"
Tryin to break the bitch but you saying "I will"
Then nigga, shit; since you put it like that
I'm about to lace em right now nigga
And take them straight to the track (track)
I've never let a bitch pimp me
Trying to tell me what to do but I'mma stay O.G
Fresh out the pen only 32 days (32 days)
And I added and subtracted in a multiplied way
Now switch worlds
Why did the little girl walk around with a gold fish in her pocket
So she could smell like the big girls
And check the one with the fast mouth
Just get your money if you have to knock her motherfucking ass out

[Kokane]
I don't care whatcha do
Long you don't fuck with mine (C'mon sing it ya'll)
You think you can't be touched
Niggas disappear all the time

[Snoop Dogg]
Old "Blue Eyes," Dogg Sinatra
Make a nigga disappear like Jimmy Hoffa (Where is he?)
The Glock cocker, hoe hopper, show stopper
Watch your mouth, watch your mouth
I'll put you in a brick in a building
And separate you from your children (Daddy)
I stay G'd up
All the G's from my set ain't never PC'dup (hahaha)
If you hit the main line
You gonna get stompped
Paying motherfuckers off use a sucka duck
Me and my niggas go hard in the paint
Puttin paint where it ain't, makin bitch niggas faint
It's a clear blue sky here on the Eastside (Eastside)
Throw your set up and wave it from (Rolling) side to c-side
I'm talking big shit, holdin my dick
Banging on you cuz, nigga this crip

[Kokane (Suga Free)]
I got so many tricks up my sleeve (Oh y'all ain't knowin')
For you hoes to disbelieve (Hoes in amazement)
You wanna bang let's bring it on (Oh Oh)
We's about thousand niggas strong
I don't care whatcha you do (I don't care what the fuck whatcha do)
Long as you don't fuck with mine (As long you don't fuck with mine)
You think you can't be touched (Uhhhhh)
Niggas disappear all the time

[Suga Free]
No, I don't love you bitch, you a hoe, I never will (Never will)
Can't tell you my feelings cause the pimpin' don't feel
Bitch, matter fact be gone
Fuck around and have your Momma saying "Baby, he wrong!"
Talking about he a real pimp
Bitch, is gumbo laced with the proper crop of jumbo shrimp
Stepped out the pen with my hoe, got it crackin with my hoe
Steady mackin with my hoe, now I'm stackin with my hoe

[Snoop Dogg]
I pop a bottle of Mo
About to model a hoe
I'm working them, serving 'em and breaking 'em off (You know)
Did the weed, man get here
Taking too long
But when he get here dogg
I'm taking a zone (Give it up nigga)
Niggas know how D-O-double G "doo's it"
Known for making that crip hop music, don't abuse it
Just ride to the rhythm of a pimp ass, upper class, cold motherfucker

[Kokane]
(Humming) Long you don't fuck with mine
You think you can't be touched
Niggas disappear all the time (Humming)
(Sir Dogg)
I am Sir Dogg, DPG fuck... and I hate water
I never learned to swim....
AAAAH! PUT ME DOWN!!!! Let go of my leg!!!
I HATE WATER!!!! I CAN'T SWIM!!!! AAAAH!!!!!

(Snoop)
No matter where I go, you got'cha eyes on me
And everybody sittin' around waitin' on me
Show us how you do it Uncle Snoopy
So fluid wit' your technique, y'all niggas gon' respect me
Man, I been doin' dis' shit before I even learned how to crawl though
Gettin' interviewed by mothafuckaz like Geraldo
And niggas wanna know if I smoke Newports or Marlboros?
Man, I'm fuckin' wit' dat real shit, nigga can you feel dis'?
I make dat shit for the realest of millions
While I'm wheelin' and dealin' and feelin the feelin'
Hmm... and oh what a relief it is
That Snoop is back in dis mothafucka handlin' his biz
Takin' care of his kids and makin' hits, oh shit
There it is again, you never know if your career might flop, fizz
So, stay on your toes and keep a pair wit'cha foes
And keep a set of new hoes and floatin' and tie da bow
Fuck these niggas and peep out Whitey Ro (?)
Somebody told? Well then, somebody gettin' rolled on
And that's usually how the scenario rolls on
Baby girl said she wanna keep her clothes on
She either fuckin' gettin' stole on or gotta stroll home
Well number one, keep your hand on your gun
And don't (don't) trust (trust) anyone (anyone, one, one.....)
Ohh... you can't trust nobody baby.... you can't even trust your own Mama!!!
This is Snoopy Collins.... trust no one.... especially a bitch....
Or even a bitch-ass nigga.... Yo Ha!!!!

T-R-U-S-T in me, I'm sexy but I'm pussy
The homies in the hood call me Lil' Bo Peep
And you da type a nigga I been dyin' ta meet
So Snoopy, what'chu tryin' to do?
Now hold on lil' mama, ain't no reason for me to lie to you
Now what I'm tryin' to do, and what I'm gon' do
Is hit this bud, I got a wife at home
Bitch I ain't lookin' for none, you might got kids for cuz, or down wit' bud
Pushin' them dubs, look here cuz
Lemme tell you how it's gon' be
If I was broke loc, these bitches wouldn't want me
I'm tellin' you the good-god truth, you want proof?
Ask them hoes over there, "Y'all wanna fuck Snoop?" (yeah!)
We'll take the money and the game away
I bet they won't say the same that day
But it's okay, cuz I don't trip
Cuz "Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks"
I thought I told you, bitch I'm a soulja
East side, long beach, gang-bang roller
From the solar, cuz this, is it
Can ya dig it? (I can dig it!!!)
Jelly Roll pulled a rabbit out his hat
I pull a strap out my mothafuckin' back (Aaah!), cuz I know it's like dat
I'm in a meetin' wit' these white folks talkin' bread
They want a contract on a nigga till' I'm dead
If I don't sign they gon' turn me over to the feds
They struck me out, now I'm pinch-hittin' for the Reds
But I'm a Dodger blue, so I gotta keep it true
I gotta home-run, nigga we long gone
I'm realizin', justizin', visualizin'
Rip-ridin', put mines in
Takin' this game to the next level
Trustin' no one, especially them Red Devils
Keep ya head level, hand on my get-up
Stay on the red-up, pimpin' ain't easy, but there's a whole lot of fed-up
And like I told you from the get-go, don't trust no one (no one, no one)
And like I told you from the getti, don't trust no one...
(Alien)
OH NO!!! YOU DID IT AGAIN!!!! PUT ME DOWN!!!!
I HATE WATER, I CAN'T SWIM!!!! I NEVER LEARNED TO SWIM!!!!
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TRUSTED YOU!!!! I PUT ALL OF MY TRUST IN YOU!!!!
AND YOU TOOK ME TO THE WATER..... OH NO!!!!

[Mac Minista]
Mac Minista in defense of the honorable Snoop Dogg
The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit
In the Game Court. With trumped up charges against
My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 227 counts
Of flexing his G's, popping his P's
Dotting his I's and crossing his T's
The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit
In the Game Court. With trumped up charges against
My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 357 counts
Of verbal and reckless endangerment
From the million dollar mouthpiece;
And leaving these super-sap suckers
Discombobulated and confused and shook up, like a pair of dice
The anti-player, has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit
In the Game Court. Charging my client Snoop Dogg
Tha Doggfather - for distributing and manufacturing game
Crossing state and county lines, with the intent to pimp the system
Now if you wanna judge Tha Doggfather
Bring him before 12 G's and open up his files
And you will see, that ever since Snoopy was a pup
His tail was straight up - ready to shake rattle and roll
And charge from a ho to a henchman about his pension
So all you jerks with them $11 words
Comin out of your $2 mouth
About a multi-million dollar Crip
Who's got the mind of a bid'ness man, the heart of a tyrant
And the tongue of a mack - I said
He's a five-star guerilla Crip, with bars and stars
While you suckers is lookin for stripes
His game is as sharp as a mosquito's needle;
And with this in mind, I'm gonna ask the Game Court
To grant a motion, of 995 - grounds, of dismissal

[Snoop]
Let cho' mind not be confused
If you can walk this walk nigga take my shoes
New fools, you fools, these fools, all y'all
Talkin bad about me, and my motherfuckin dawg
He ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, but y'all niggas still dissin
To me, some of these suckers'll never get it
Full clip and if I miss it I'mma tip it on the Crip
And DoggHouse in your mouth, now tell me how you livin
Who the villain, you the villain? Nigga, Ren is "The Villain"
My homey from the C-P-T, cold chillin
Now as time flies by I see the game gettin mo' reala
As I get mo' scrilla, can you dig it?
I always tend to come widdit
Gravy train on your brain, nigga come get it
I'm too young to retire, I'm havin fun wit it
See when you learn what to do with it, I'll be done with it
Come with it

[Hook: KoKane, Snoop]
Go.. (just go away).. go a-way!

[S] Niggas can't be trusted

[K] Just come back another day

[S] Niggas be on bitch shit

[K] Just go far, a-way

[S] Niggas get it twisted
Just go a-way..

[Snoop Dogg]
Now she said she don't like a G
Well listen here bitch, get the fuck from 'round me
You thought you was bout to get a drink on me?
I put hands on you bitch like Suga Free
I always let a bitch know her boundaries
Same with a nigga, I treat him like a flea
You claim to be, you aim to be in my spot
Motherfucker - you will get popped (BLAOW)
Not, knowin who you fuckin wit, niggas be on bitch shit
Nigga we be fuckin quick, nigga we ain't talkin shit
When the heat speak, niggas be on bitch shit
Tryin to get somewhere, coverin up they biscuit
And then he in the club, all up on my dilznick
But when I leave, you niggas pullin trick shit
But it's cool, cause niggas gonna miss this
Cause I'mma keep it all business, what is this?

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
I said let yo' mind not be confused
If you can walk this walk nigga take my shoes

{*vocals ad lib to end*}

Everywhere I go

Now, I don't really know
But I try to keep my head to the skitta
Slice my piece of hitta
Whatcha hatin' for?
You better get up, get out and get your own, Nigga
Pick up the phone and holla at your folks
Young locs in the hood, mashing Dogg House
Fuck them other fools
D-O-double G
Kick back, blaze the sack
And catch a muthafucking big, Mack Attack
We blazin' up the dough
It'll hurt you
Nothing but purple in my circle
To the day we die
We gon' get money, bitches and high
Dogg House Gangsta Crip
Right back in your muthafucking ass for the R-2-G, bitch
What ya'll wanna do?
Seems like these niggas wanna talk all night
What we gonna do?
We ain't gonna say nothing more, we gonna get with ya'll, on side
That's how suppose to see
So all that straggling in the gate trying to get close to me
Ya'll niggas need to stop
Trying to flip the hip hop scrip
I snap, crackle and POP
Tell your friends and foes
It's a whole new year and situation and I'm still hating hoes
Will it ever stop?
Look I really don't know but on the up, I doubt that, lo
Now what about your hood?
Man, I'm doing mine they're doing their's
So I guess It's all good
And, what about your crew?
Shit, my crew is the Eastside
Fool, I thought u knew
Dogg Pound ain't the same?
Yeah, them niggas split up and did they own thang and went made their own gang
Money is thicker than blood?
That's fuck up but on the real that's how it is cuz, damn
The world just ain't the same?
And come to find out these niggas crossing out my muthafucking name
So what am I to do?
I put it on mind continue to shine
Everything fine
In G-O-D we trust
That's why ya'll suckers can't "Touch us, Touch us"
Meech u made the beat
And you know when we get together
Shit, we like bread and meat
We coming with the heat
Close your mouth cause Dogg House is definitely turning it out
And what about the cops?
I paid them and the ones I didn't I slayed them, haha
Will it ever stop?
It's like asking "Who is it" before a nigga even knock
The game is here to stay?
And I'm here to change the rules cause I'm a player that loves to play
Did you thank the lord today?
Think I did and on that note young loc, I'm getting ghost
Why you tell the truth?
Cause I'm hundred twenty proof from the turf to the roof
Bigg Snoop

[Snoop]
Yo.. uh-huh
I'mma try somethin different on this right here
But I know y'all gon' feel it
Cause I know y'all feel me
It's some real shit right here, y'knahmsayin?
I ain't never did it like this before
Check this out..

[Snoop - singing]
I'm the kind of G that everybody knows
But I'm so low-key, when it comes to hoes
I never break the rules and that's just how it goes
All my friends and foes - know that's just how it goes
I can flip the script but I chose not to this time
There's so much to say with so little time, but I like it
(Yes I like it)
I'm gon' dip dive socialize and get high
I wish my people had, other ways
I'm thankful, that a brother's paid (that a brother's paid)
But how can I be happy? My hair is still nappy
I miss my grandpappy
I wanna do right but the world is wrong
That's why I'm singin this song

[Hook]
I'm tryin to stack a dollar pop my collar while I'm singin my song
Y'all niggas better leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)
I think y'all betta leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)
I'm tryin to stack a dollar pop my collar while I'm singin my song
You bitches better leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)
I think y'all betta leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)

[Snoop - singing]
There's so much goin on out there in the world today
All these - ladies, players, gangsters, and suckers
I get caught up sometimes, some of the people I hang with
They turn out to be snitches, bitches, yeah they switches
But you know like I know I can't stop doin, what I got to do
I'mma keep doin what I got to (I'ma keep doin) y'know!
Everywhere I go, the game is the same
People lookin at me want me to say somethin
Want me to do somethin, but I don't know nuttin
If I ain't gettin paid, I can't drop no rhymes
I can't do nothin for you no mo', I ain't got that kinda time
And they know..

[Hook] w/ minor variations

[Snoop - singing]
I try to be to myself, and try to stay.. away from the world
But the world just keeps runnin after me (runnin after me)
I try to shield myself away from all the wickedness
But somehow, the wickedness is in my circle - what am I to do?
I try to ask God to help me get through this
What am I to do to this? Just do this, let's do this
So I, continue to mash, day by day (day by day)
I continue to play, play by play
And I con-tinue to spit my manuscript (spit it)
And say what I want to say (say it)
And I do it to ya ev-ery-day

[Hook] w/ minor variations

[Snoop Dogg]
Leave me alone, I think you better leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone - better leave me alone
If it don't pay you wrong, leave me alone
I think you better leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alonnnne, leave me alonnnne
If it don't pay you wrong..

[Snoop Dogg]
Man, you got me goin crazy baby
Feel like I'm losin my mind

[Hook: Soopafly]
Feels like I'm losin control, and I don't even know
Girl you hurt me oh
So
Bad cause I love you so, hey
But it don't matter now, I'm doin better now
Whatever you do, bitch, will come back to you, bitch
Heeeeeeey, hey; heeeeeeey, hey
Heeeeeeeeeeeey, hey; heeeeeeey, hey

(Soopafly * overlapping chorus)
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
Now who would ever think that I wanted a home
Three kids and a wife, never be alone
A dog in the front yard and that picket fence
Havin somethin on the side? It didn't make sense
(Butch) I'm a family man sportin a weddin band

(Soopafly)
I heard them niggas on your pager didn't give a damn
I gave you eighty percent of all my trust in you
The other twenty was cool, cause we gon' make it through

(Butch) The homies said she got my mind blew in, blew in

(Soopafly)
I told that nigga like Chris Tucker
"Don't worry about what the FUCK I be doin'"
We was makin chemistry, but who is he?
And how dis nigga know the deal about you and me?

(Butch) I fell to my knees and asked the girl "Why?"

(Soopafly)
She looked at my eyes with no reply
So I cried, I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes

[Hook]

(Snoop Dogg * overlapping chorus)
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
I was in love at times
They say "Game Don't Wait" huh Warren G?
Well the game better wait for me
I'm spendin my time while I'm writin these rhymes
In the Hills for real, sippin wines, girl you'se a dime
Got me losin my mind
Well if lovin you is a crime
I'm down to do my time
Lock me up and throw away the key
I once told that "This was the way love was meant to be"
I see you with me forever
We can do things that you never, thought you coulda
Up out the hood-uh, is where I took you, never overlooked you
I can't believe that you shook to another spot
And left me cold, now I'm hot
I'm tryin to find you, what am I to do?
I gave you everything that you needed

[Hook]

(Snoop * over chorus)
Took it for granted, shit, I'm cool now
What goes around, comes around

[Snoop] I was in love at times

[Soopa] I was in love at times

[Snoop] I was in love at times

[Soopa] I was in love at times

(Snoop Dogg)
You know what girl I mean..
I was in love with you and you did me like that
But you know what they say?
What goes around comes around

(Butch Cassidy)
How could, how could, you do me wrong?
You be messin up my songs (my songs)
Now a nigga must move on (I gave you)
Gave love, and you just, straight played on me (on me)
Had a nigga sick for weeks (for weeks)
Now I must begin my streak (I was in love at times..)

Do you wanna have a sip with me?
Or would you rather try and trip with me? (trip with me?)
Put ya cups on the table and your hands in the air
And touch your brim to the side, that's only if you a player
And all the ladies in this motherfucker acting up
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up
Cuz we came here to have a good time

On 3 wheels with one 9 (ya know)
It's time to shine, the world is mine (the world is mine)


(Verse 2)
I never ever dropped a dime (shiiit)

Never hesitate to pop a 9 (bah!)
And always come up with the proper line
Stick to the script bitch I'm hurtin shit (hurtin shit)
Let me show you motherfuckers what I'm workin with

Don't need no water to go with your order
And you ain't got to smuggle the shit up over the border
Affordable, sportable, unbelievable, feasible, and reasonable
We leavin' 'em low
Cuz me and my loc, keep big leaves of smoke
Gallons of Hennesey and 16 liters of coke
He done drank and she done smoked
The meters are broke, we put the V to the note
I brought the weed to smoke
And Dr. Dre, he hooked the beat up, indeed it was dope

(Bridge)
Stackin what ya mackin D-O-double G
The shit ya doin' is so lovely
The haters hate cuz they can never be
There ain't no limit to this melody (melody)
You niggas sippin on that jealousy (jealousy)
I pour a tall glass of Hennesey (Hennesey)
Do you wanna have a sip with me? (sip with me?)
Or would you rather try and trip with me? (trip with me?)

[Eve]
Keep it shaking, Cali keep it quaking
Cause the Ryders got me bringin home the bacon
Show me love, and it wasn't no mistakin
That I would dedicate this melody - fuck the hatin

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
Cause she slipped and dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready to ride
To keep the heater right by her side

[Eve]
Aiyyo, so what the deal Dogg, tell me, keep it real Dogg
Niggas seem stressed to the brain, how you feel dogg?
Nigga I'mma ride, set it up, let it spill Dogg
Anything you want, I can flip, got the skill Dogg

[Snoop Dogg]
Baby girl you so so-phisticated
Finance related, you graduated
To the next level in the game, wearin my name
Bad little brickhouse, go and do that thang

[Eve]
Yo - niggas surprised when they open they eyes
Thick in the thighs wasn't part of they plan
Not just his bitch, I'm like his main man
Act shifty - your resistance gone swiftly
Bitches mad at a nigga, askin why he kissed me
Stop whinin, just to cry and get the mackin daddy
I don't like it when the angry chick is actin crabby
That's why he bagged me
Ghetto jewel, never loud and trashy
No stressin over chicks - problem? Bet I solve it fastly

[Hook] - 2X

[Snoop Dogg]
We gangbang on these niggas like we 'posed to do
And I'll be damned if I let a bitch get close to you
We posted Boo - you, my, one and only
Quick to dump before the homies
Remember when that phony nigga ran up on me at the club?
You filled him up with slugs, that's what I call love
All that pushin and shovin, kissin and huggin
Thuggin, dig it, dug-in
I'm lovin every minute of it Boo
The way you stay true, and always kept your cool
You kept the heater right by your thigh
And when the shit got hectic you was ready to ride
You didn't run out, when I pulled the gun out
That's what I'm talkin bout, no doubt
Ruff Rydin, Eastsidin, to the realest y'know
D-O-double-Gizze, you know how we get busy

[Eve]
Aiyyo, how could I leave a real nigga? A real nigga's all I need
Fake bitches try to take my place, fall to they knees
Don't violate, see my man, he don't like no scrapes
And if I heard you was frontin I hop on the case
Wild one? Maybe, but I'mma protect my baby
Test me fool and by the end you gon' think I'm crazy
That's how I do for my Dogg, keep my litter strong
Both sides relied on the shit, nigga sing the song

[Hook] - 2X

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah.. hahah, E-V-E! D-O-double-Gizze! Y'know!

Me and Snoop Dogg on the hog
On our way to the mall, fuck alla y'all

Intercept these fine bitches cause we want 'em all
Droppin drawers, poppin coochie and lickin balls
Only gangsta ass nigga follow nigga laws
Only gangsta ass bitches get to run the hogs
Only real ass niggas get to set it off

[Verse 3: The Lady of Rage]

[Verse 5: Snoop Dogg]
Niggas pop mo' shit while we drop mo' shit

Shootin the breeze, with a cute Vietnamese
Or was she Lebanese? I think she Chinese
It really don't matter cause they all on they knees

Make that cheese, when the cops come you bet' not freeze
Blast on 'em like the Genovese, they yo' enemies
Lock you up and fuck you up
Talk shit to you beat you down then cuff you up
And leave you in a cell stuck (damn!)
I ain't got no money for bail, that's real as fuck (f'real)
Tryin to get a meal ticket and kick it
Chill, catch a plane to Spain or maybe Brazil
On the real can you feel me?

[Outro: Kurupt]

{*cameras flashing, Snoop interviewing Bill Clinton*}
Yo, hold on hold on hold on hold on
Stop the cameras, stop the press stop the press
Now Bill, this yo' nigga, Snoop Dogg
Now answer me this - did you fuck that bitch or what?

[Bill Clinton]
That's actually, not the first time that question's been asked; but
Since, I believe, and I think any person - reasonable person would
Believe, that that is not covered, in the definition of sexual
Relations I was given - ahh - I'm not going to answer it except to
Refer to my statement. I had intimate, contact with her that was
Inappropriate - I do not believe any of the contacts I had with
Her violated the definition I was given; therefore I believe I
Did not, do anything but testify truthfully on these matters

[Hook One: KoKane]
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie..hie..
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie..hie..

[Hook Two: Snoop Dogg]
Lies, lies, stories and alibis
Big Mac in the land of the small fries
Everyone lies and tries to get by
Some of us drink while most just get high

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You tryin to cover up the holes in your sneakers
You need to put your motherfuckin face to the speakers (ba-bom, ba-bom)
And quit tryin to run from it (holla holla at me)
And c'mere, you big dummy (dumb ass nigga)
Don't you know you can't run from the Dizzogg
I'm down with Gizzod, the long arm of the lizzaw
Y'all, niggas know what's happening you turn your back again
And I'm bound to get it crack-a-lin I'm back again
And everybody happy for me - ain't that the truth?
That's a motherfuckin lie (fuck that fool)
Black folks stick together til we die, hmm
That'll be the day..

[Hook One]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Liar, liar, pants on fire
Smoke so much dope they call me Snoopy Pryor (well God damn!)
Which way is up I'm tryin to get higher
I won't stop puffin til I re-tire
My bitches, my nigga, they off the wire
They love-ly, they love me, call me Sire
Movie star bitches the ones you desire
Angela Bassett, Tyra, Mariah, the flyest, the flyer
See most bitches like fuckin with a rider
Slider, to the sider, invite her
To a gangsta, party, provider {*laughing*}
With a lot of meat by-products (mm)
And beat the puddy-pot and got up
She licked the dick from the top to the bottom
{*woo woo woo woo*} (That's a bad bitch!)
Then she grabbed me by my nuts, and said "Hmm I got 'em!"

[Hook One]

[Hook Two]

{*KoKane scats and ad libs to the music*}

[KoKane]
Ah what's the use of the truth
If you can't tell a lie sometimes?

Verse 1:

I'm in a three piece suit
Looking too cute
Mashin' flashin'
Lookin' for a prostitute
Boo boo, you got that loot
I'm watchin' you, you watchin' me
It's all to the gravy cuz it's V.I.P
And everythang in here movin' belong to me

The baddest pimp nigga that you ever gone see
Colder than Fillmore Slim

Gee'd up to the feet up

Verse 2:

Not only that but uhh

And look like Blackula
Smack ya up with the shit that I drop
911, call the cops
There's a bitch, snitch
Ain't that a bitch
I can't trust nobody in this sonofabitch
I get rich on the fakers who hate
Bakin' my cake
And catch the Lakers at 8
On channel 9
Pop a bottle of wine
Then at 10 hit the club
With my nephew Dub
11:30, talkin' dirty to this little birdy
I'm trying to get mine early
I can't be seen with your girly
Continue to mash these hoes
I keep it crackin' like pistachios
I get the money first
With no rehearsal
Snoop D-O double G
Still controversial
Aahhh
Chorus 3x

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]

But I really wanna let niggas know what's happenin though
You feel me?

[Hook: KoKane, Snoop Dogg, & Lil 1/2 Dead]

[Kokane & Lil 1/2 Dead] Now I don't want anybody

Gangsta niggas do your dance
(C-Walk, C-Walk homey, yeah)
Gangsta bitches wave yo' hands

[Bad Azz]
See me, I'm bout my money my paper I'm bout my dollars
Poppin collars with this mac and this slack and these two revolvers
See we smoke and go hoein cause this bitch ain't never shit to me
And pussy stay sellin, so I never let it get to me
The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials
We credible individuals, ahead of you we original
Better known as criminals, thuggin off on the stereo
Killin 'em on the radio, some of them wanna hate me though
Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again
The jealousy took me over success, just keep you slower
While, you get nothin, we keep gettin more
Pump pump the jam up, drop drop the top
Hit hit the switch and smash down the block
And oh yeah this Long Beach so you know when you see a nigga
And don't never get the wrong idea nigga
(Yeah, nigga what?) Holla at 'em

(C-Walk, C-Walk homey, yeah)
Gangsta bitches wave yo' hands

[Snoop Dogg]
I keep my khakis creased, hat tilted to the East
On a bitch I remain the beast, none the least
Police try to cuff me and stuff me in the back
Of they patrol car, cause I'm a former parole star
With the cool name, this nigga here's a fool mayn
Go on and do yo' thang, gang-bang
In the hood and in Hollywood
Record company executives think it's all to the good
Get to showin me around they house, then he slide me in the back
And had the nerve to try to buy me out, check this out mayn
I'm down with P, and D-R-E
A real nigga from the motherfuckin L.B.C
I just look like this, I stay down for the twist
I'm real with this, deep as abyss
I gave you a pound, then I gave yo' wife a kiss
I had to dip cause y'all was full of that bullsheeit

[Snoop Dogg]
Hmm, who that nigga that brought you that gangsta shit
Befo' you motherfuckers was even ready for it?
Showed you how to tie a flag on your head
And represent your motherfuckin set 'til you're dead
Bust on the cops while I cuss the Feds
Roll a joint, in the bathtub gettin head
Put the G in the P, flipped the G to a ki
Put the West coast back on the map bay-bee
Check my styles, check my files
I've been gangbangin since I was a juvenile
They cut me loose in nine-deuce I swore to tell the whole truth
Keep it gangbang 100 proof
E'rybody say, "Ay Snoop" - did Death Row pay me?
Look here young loc, shit it's all to the gravy
I really can't trip off the past, on the real I had a blast
2Pac, rest in peace and God bless all my enemies

[Hook: KoKane]
Rain-drops, falling on my head
Fuckin with them haters, messin with my bread
Talkin bout the raindrops, fallin on my head
Fuckin with them haters, sleepin in my bed

[Snoop Dogg]
Ain't No Limit to this shit, ain't no gimmick
Master P good lookin out homeboy, salute my Lieutenant (at ease)
I'm in it knee deep and can't creep no more
I had to move down South on the low-low, fo' sho' doe
Dippin through the woods with Fiend, Magic, Pokey
Mystikal, V-90, C, Boz and P (ya heard me?)
Windows on tint, ridin like the President
It's evident, shit I'm doin good (yeah)
I moved out the hood like I should (say what?)
And then they had the nerve to call me Hollywood (nigga what?)
But I don't give a fuck, if I'm misunderstood
20 Crip don't slip, yeah it's all to the good
Yeah the homies got twist too, whatchu say?
Oh the homies might get me? They'll get you
Listen here, don't try it, and don't deny it
And don't pay 'em no mind Dogg, man I'm tryin

[Hook w/ variations]

[Snoop Dogg]
Just when you thought I was gone, I'm back on
Knick-knack-paddy-wack give the Dogg a home
With a gang of pitbulls, rottweilers and doberman pinschers
Bonafied killers
The illest, cap peelers, that you ever wanna meet
Straight up out the ghetto where they pack the heavy metal
I got my hand on the wheel, my foot on the gas pedal
I'm drivin DoggHouse to the next level (woof)
And buckin two shots at the devil
Run up on his ass, and blast, like a rebel
Turn up the treble cause I hit you with the bass
Remember my name and remember my face
Remember these words, and remember the taste
And remember, we all gotta leave this place
I'm tryin to stay focused, I'm the loc'est in the game
The Rap Prime Minister, "Mr. G Thang"

[Hook Two: KoKane]
Rain-drops, fallin on my head
Fuckin with the wrong folks, messin with my spread
Talkin bout the raindrops, fallin on my head
Messin with my ba-by, who's sleepin in my bed

Me and my partner, in my Impala
Poppin our collars, tossin up dollars
A truck on the side of with hoes that wanna follow
Bet a hundred dollars that they all wanna swallow
Doggy Doggfather
I do it to you real hard then it gets harder
It's nada - thang on mine, I bang on mine
I smoke an ounce and bounce at the same time
It's off the limbo with Timbo, you motherfuckin bimbo
So quit knockin at my window, you nympho-maniac
Bring it back, now shake it up
Put it on the table, now break it up
Give it to me, now put a lighter on the end of it
It really don't matter what you spent on it
As long as you're gettin what you paid for
That's what it made for, ain't that what you stayed for?

[Hook]
Who's that dippin' in the Cadillac? (Snoop Dogg)
Smoke 'til your eyes get cataracts (Snoop Dogg)
Who got a girl layin on her back? (Snoop Dogg)
Who's that makin that paper stack? (Snoop Dogg)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You play me and I'll play you
You pay me and I'll pay you
Hold on boo, you got the game all wrong
This ain't yo' thang, this my song
Move on, we in the club at the Shark Bar
Valeted my keys and park my car
No snap shots cause I might get popped
As I slide by security, givin 'em props (whattup, whattup)
First thing I do, when I get in
Let me take you back to when I first slid in
Grab my gi-din, get my pid-in
Put my bid in, no bullshittin (no bullshittin)
We be sittin, in the corner
With smoke comin' from up under us like we sittin in the sauna
Burnin up the charts (burnin up the charts)
Break a bitch heart, lil' mama don't you start

Tick tock, the ice on my watch
Slap me 'cross the face around two o'clock
But the party don't stop till we blow up (ka-boom!)
Now every lil' bitch wanna show up
Manuev'in to this, groovin to this
Dippin to this, flippin to this, trippin to this
Ain't no skippin to this, trust this
Bust this, it's too hot to touch this (ahh!)
He say, she say, I say no way
Don't need foreplay, okay, obey
Everything that I say..
And every day'll be like a holiday
I put you in the front seat of my car
And roll you 'round town like a superstar
Recline your seat and turn up the beat
Number one with a bullet, rollin down the motherfuckin backstreets

[Hook] - repeat 2X

(Timbaland making vocal scratches to fade)

[Verse 1]
Drag him out your window
Dragging out the dead
Singing "I miss you"
Snakes and ladders
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get up, get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance, you fucker, dance, you fucker
Don't you dare, don't you dare
Don't you, flan in the face
Take it with the love it's given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman
Let me back, let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror
At the face you don't recognize
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside

[Chorus]
I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
Calls me on the phone, tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops

[Bridge]
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no

[Verse 2]
Walking like giant cranes and
With my X-ray eyes, I strip you naked
In a tight little world and are you on the list?
Stepford wives, who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers, investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and Sunday papers
City boys in first class
Don't know we're born at all
Just know someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone always does
Oh, I wish you'd get up
Get over, get up, get over, turn your tape off

[Chorus]
I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
Calls me on the phone, tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
So I'm just gonna...

Ohh

[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
I'm from the east coast but I'm falling
So hot a nigga got me crip walking

Make a good girl wanna get to the hood
You make me say (got me speaking different languages 

[reversed]) 

[x3]
So good got me speaking different languages

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Visualize like as I do
All I want to do is like be inside you
Ride you, try to find you, fill you, revive you
Go on with your bad self baby baby cause I do adore
And I give you more
Put it on you all the time you know mi amor
We got for sure pure, I'll even allure
Don't trip I ain't leaving you for
Jay got Beyonce, I got Shante
With no entree, that's my baby
You know the thing about when I bring 'em out
Feels so good I had to sing about
Get it, get it now, we flying out of town, checking in a suite
Pedicure on my feet
Miss Bow Wow, queen of the town
Aiyyo Jaz, tell 'em how I put it down

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Is it the way you look? Is it the way you walk?
Is it the way you cook? Is it the way you talk?
I think it's all of the above
No playtime in the daytime making love
Kids go to school, we can act a fool
Skinny dip in the pool, do it real smooth
Miss Bow Wow, queen of the town
Aiyyo Jaz, tell 'em how I put it down

[Hook]

[Bridge: Jazmine Sullivan]
Hey baby, ooooooohhhh
Got me going out of my head
Ooooooohhhh

He's here to stay, he's here to stay
Ladies, if your man make you say
(Got me speaking different languages 

[reversed])
He's here to stay, he's here to stay

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Uhh, oh yes I am
This my plan, you my girl, I'm your man
Take your pain, take my hand, take my name
Make my kids, do your thing
Ain't no game, show no shame
If I'm the boss, boss lady must be your name
So I got you, got 212
Put your face on my back, brand new tattoo
20 years in the game, what love won't do
A lot of women want me but I want you
You look cute when you smile, so I renewed our vows
Nowadays I ain't moving that wow, I changed my style
It might happen to you
What gotten to me, shit I gotten to you
And start rapping 'bout things like love and being true
Now maybe we can make another baby or two

[Hook]

[Outro: Jazmine Sullivan]

Uugh, yeah

Aiyyo Uncle Snoop
Let's go get these knuckleheads

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Pop bottles (pop bottles)
Shake hands (shake hands)
Recognise (recognise) I'm the man

Still fucking with them hood superstars (superstars)
Spend a hundred grand over by the bar like pimping ain't easy

[Snoop Dogg]
Well it ain't
All them faces in that laker paint
Casa by the lake
Make a little nigga faint
Balling is what I does
I ain't messing with you can'ts
I'm a can do negro
A real life California hero
About six zeros at the end of the number in my bank account
Nigga ain't ya mad at me
I'm so happy to see that you stopped your life to watch mine
Yeah you see it fool
Snoop's everywhere, Italy I'm heavy there
Did a show in Rome like ho say you ain't never there
Talking 'bout you popping bottles
I don't see none
You made it rain where?
I don't see a wand
Go on get it off
That's what they like to hear
It's your money pimp
We don't fight it here
It's hard enough to be me
Not trying to be you is someting I got to see
Until then I'mma

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
This ain't a joke a loc made it look easy to you
I been through some shit
I made it easy for ya
Now you ain't got to do much, I pop at everybody
Go unwrap a bottle, share it with them busybodies
Tell 'em what she want to hear
How you would like to take her out of town and shopping here
And Snoopy is your homie
Nah nah girl he out of here
Yeah he just act like he don't know me when he all up in here
You a fool Jack
Though I don't condone faking for a bitch
Don't call it pimping when you're bringing home the bacon to this bitch
Go ahead and talk money
Talk, look at the chicks it brought
But know the deal you better flip her like a somersault
Snoopy never played the role for which he wasn't built for
Never called somebody friend that I wouldn't kill for
I do this balling cause I can not cause it's cool
I pop cause I'm the man
Now watch me and Kells

[Hook]

[R. Kelly]
I got pimping in my veins
Pimping in my blood
Pimping in my swag
Pimping in my cup
Walking like a pimp when I walking through the club
Pause like a pimp so the hoes show me love
Pimp by day, pimp by night
Pimp haters make me keep my pimp game tight
See y'all type of fools make a nigga want thug
Like shots of patron make a nigga want fuck
But I ain't on that shit so I'mma throw my hands up
And keep it sexy pimping cause thats how I does
Uncle Snoop say Kells go hard or go home
Yo hating motherfuckers, I'm still here

[Hook]

[R. Kelly]
To all my honeys in the club getting money with the thugs
Keep it pimping baby
Keep it pimping baby
Southside, westside, eastside, northside
Keep it pimping baby
Keep it pimping

[The-Dream]
Oh oh oh

Close the door
Gon' lit it

And I know you'll love how a nigga break it down
And everytime I'm with her her I get her her love drunk (lovin' you in all ways)
And everytime she wit me me she get me me love drunk

[Snoop Dogg - each line x2]
You know who I am I'm the motherfucking dogg
The sheets fucked up and you know it was me
You can hear the bed squeak all the way down the street
And it sounds like a song cause we're fucking to the beat
I put my rat tat tat in her boom boom pow
And then she put her tit tit tit all up in my mouth

[Snoop Dogg]
I might've said it before I don't love them hoes
I told you before I don't love them hoes
But she got that good good I can't let her go
And I got to let her know that

[Hook: The-Dream]
And everytime I'm with her her I get her her love drunk (lovin' you in all ways)
And everytime she wit me me she get me me love drunk (love drunk)
Mmmm she needs that good love is what she's fiending for
And I got that fire loving

Let me hear you say oooh, ahah, oh yeah
Right now everytime she's with me we all dizzy
We love drunk

[Snoop Dogg - each line x2]
Shoot to the spot cause the spot is the lim'
On your lunchbreak let me hit it real quick
And back to your job 'fore they know what it is
Loving so good we done made three kids

Hugging and touching and all that shit
Drink 'til you're drunk, see my love is a fill
Yeah this for you boo, it's a gift

[Verse 1 : Lil Wayne]

Fix, Nigga

Change mind sporadically, same time compatibly
Wayne Carter, graduate, bang bang academy
Change my reality, thank God for grabbin' me
Sort of like him, cause they can't stop the wrath of me
But, Hell have no fury, Neither I
I would walk up in the Devil's Kitchen, eat a pie
Greedy eye, never full, getting fat
And bitch I got an itch, so don't let me catch you with the scra-scra-
Scratch y'all niggas off the face of the Earth
Even Mase came back for the money outta church
So with that on my mission for that money, I'mma work
My divine intervention might be in that woman's purse
Tryna find a better system, but I'm running out of perks
Baby daughter tummy irks, then daddy heart hurts
So daddy pop at 'em until they heart burst
For my baby girl candy I make her starburst
9/11 was a fucking shame, I done saw worse like
What if that bullet would have hit my heart first
Life, would it be different, I be still fuckin' 'round with death
Cause I got shot after that, and after that I grab the empty case
And then tried to throw that bitch back at they faces, Cita I made it
My nigga Real was on the ground like "naw", I got up and looked around, and grabbed the spot like "ahhh..."
I"m hard to kill, hardy har, cut the music back up and keep the party goin'
Fuck 'em, and I don't need no crease, I'm a motherfucking gangster off Eagle Street
I don't need the Hot Boys, I still keep my heat
And I ain't gotta squad up, I still keep my feet
They call me Michelangelo, you paint them so street
But you remove that wallpaper, bet that sheet-rock weak, (haha)
And you and I know what's goin' on, you probably riding to a different song
I'm probably riding on some different chrome, I'm probably high in a different zone
But when I'm off, we can get it on
I take no days off catch that shit for my friend
I clock out when I punch in, I'm shootin
Reel you ain't gotta block out, it's goin' in 'em
Them rats stop hatin' on the snake, the boy venom
The cat like Payton for the Lakers gon' win 'em
I'm certified stamp, I'm a champion
Like Buju Banton, I shoot you nine times like you was Fifty
But you won't be as likely as Fifty, I light me some Piffy
Light hella bright on the Infi, like what nigga, like me or lift me
I don't duck I be right in the city, for them bucks
I take me a flight, and come and get right, right in ya city
Yup, I'm just like Diddy, and nothing like Puff yeah
I'm something like city, he something like Young Wizzy
My Nike's is spiffy, I'm hardly a Gotti
I'm slightly a Nitti, all of a Carter
Bitch niggas never bitch me, bum niggas never ditch me
Shit I gotta get me, man I'm raw, slip me
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity, this moment of honesty
Ain't no more squad in me, unh

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Snoop Dogg]
You know if you through with me, then I'm through with you
But you're the one who fell in love and said that love was true
But you ain't never fake on me
And now you think that you gon' find another G like me?
Them, niggas, ain't gon' play
They gon' just hump, they ain't gon' do it your way
I can't hate and say what they gon' do
All I know is that I'm true and know that you my baby boo
Let's take a chance, go to France on a three-day cruise
Walk with your man in the sand like, oooh
It's our little rendezvous
Whoopty-whoop, Big Snoopy and boo
I picture this love affair, of ours
To last a lifetime, just like flowers
Take a quick flick then get dressed, we'll head to Brazil
I'll show you how it feel when you're rollin with the real
How it feel?

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Brandy + Snoop]
We can make it, let's just stay together
Come together, don't gooooo
Let's just have some fun and be together
Forever... for liiiiife

[Snoop Dogg]
Now that we're livin our life especially, I say that you're my pick
And every day we'll dress alike and always stay slick
To me, I see you as a gift
Incredible, it's edible, my ice cream, have a lick
I'll catch you when you fall like leaves
And be the one that you need, come be my #1 please
See I ain't never blown no cheese
Or done no songs like these, I love the air that you breathe
You know why? (why-why, why-why)

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Hook 1]
Like a star slipping out of place
Sliding from the sky
Tumbling through space
When you touch my hand
I swear I feel like I'm ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Yeh ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Like a wheel
Whirling round and round
Rolling down a hill (rollin' down a hill)
Spinning on the ground (rollin' down a hill)
Your kissing makes me dizzy yeh
In the head (ooh yeh)
And I'm ballin'
I'm ballin'

[Verse 1]
Hmm, I love this game coz this game love me back
I'm pushing a lac, smoking sacs like a mad mac
Bringing me back, banging the 8-track track
The Dramatics and Battle Cat and Snoop like that
Big stars in big cars we pull up at the big clubs and sit at the big bars
Sippin' champaign with a bowl of cavier
Hell yeh you are, yeh you are
Say it say it, coz they all deny it
Player play it, coz you can't deny it
As fly as it get, as fly as I spit you know its the shit
It's so gangsta, gangsta bitch
Switch back to the old school, old fools know
This here thang we do so original
I got to have it, lavish
Is how we establish
On the real love one it feels good to have

[Hook 2]
Like a rose, flippin down the street
Looking oh so sweet (lookin' oh so sweet)
Bumpin to the beat (bumpin to the beat)
These streets they keep me busy yeh
Makin' bread
And I'm ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Yeh ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Oh here I go!

Coz they know

Now you can cruise if you choose but I prefer to do the cha-cha
And once my small kitchen ?throw?
You know I gotcha
Watch out, no need to pull your Glock out

Look at my hair and the girls wit me
They got the same thang on
Pimp pimp parade, my nigga get your bang on
Coz my uncles about to get their sang on
And all round the world, my nigga, it's the same song
And when its time for your callin', fallin', wit no stallin'
Keep it ballin'

[Hook 3]
He starts to mill
Just rollin' tru his town
Stacking dollar bills (stacking dollar bills)
Raising dogg pound (he be raising the dog pound)
Becasuse he's loved
Loved in every city
Thats why he's ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Yeh ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')

[Verse 3]
There it is coz it is there
Now have a seat and come hit the game from a player
They say time brings change and change brings time
It's so genuine and so divine
It's been so long in fact its overdue
Now tell me baby girl what can D-O-DOUBLE-G do for you
I fell for you, I'll always look over you
Theres really not much that a player would'nt do for you
So quit stallin' and fallin'
And come get a bar of some of this ballin'
Now quit stallin' and callin'
And come get yaself a bar of this ballin'

[Outro]

[Snoop Dogg]
Big Snoop Dogg
You in the presence of a motherfucking rap star
I push up laid back in a black car
Though I bossed up, it ain't hard to tell that
I came up hard as hell, check it out
I stayed sharp and played my part
All I had was a mic, a dream and some heart
Me and my moms wasn't getting along at this time
And since pops was gone, I'm out grinding
Catch a nigga praying, swearing I ain't going back to jail
Judge about tired of a playa, I don't know about this bidness shit
But I'm good with this rapping, can I get a witness what's happening
That's about the time I put down the rocks
And got to working in the studio around the clock
For a small profit, but a whole lot of game
Man I'm famous, now it ain't the same

[Hook]
It's the one and only D-O double G
Do you want some of this
Top Dogg bite em all, yeah I'm burning it up
Aw naw, Big Snoop Dogg
You tuned in to the number one
Buck one, buck two, buck three, buck four
So get real fool, fool

[Snoop Dogg]
Local boy made good over night shit
Not only am I getting righteous but wise see
I paid the price, with consecutive platinum hits
I up my status, ain't no more Calvin Broadus
World on my shoulder, but I can handle it
Now that I'm older, I'm sharper and colder
Can you remember when I slid in Deep Cover
And made niggas in the Beach love eachother
A street hustler, but I'm all set for the come up
Best kept secret so I'm want up
I've been acquitted up for 1-8-7
Yes I'm blessed thank God in Heaven
Now all I need is a push in the right direction
Weed and a mic now I'm writing checks
And now the game ain't stopping
And can't nobody say my name ain't popping
Started off young as a little-bitty buck
Now I'm ready for the world, and I got to give it up

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
You in the presence of a motherfucking millionaire
Stop, look, listen, feel, yeah I ain't tripping on shit
I worked hard as a motherfucker
Fuck Cuzz, and him too cause all y'all suckas
Now with the savvy of a business man
I gave, new niggas a chance, to see what they was saying
And kept a spot on hot, West Coast on lock
Big Dizzel knocking down your block
Never looking back uh uh, a steady process
And leaving that way, cause see I'm blessed
It's like I'm happy now, cause I'm a family man
I fell in love with my kids and my wife again
And these here are the files of a classic
It's my throne till I choose to pass it
Worldwide and the sun shine so bright
That's why I wear my L-O-C's at night nigga

[Hook]

[Intro]
Yeah! Aight Bigg Dogg

Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(What?) Upside down (what?) upside down

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Ugh... the boss in the buildin'
Try to turn it on, you get offed in this buildin'
Higher than a muh, gettin' lost in the feelin'
Motherfuck the law, I got a ball for the children
Nigga - drunk than a bitch though
'Fore I hit the spot I had a bottle full of Cisco
Ate the kush and a model in a trenchcoat
A Crip with a lot of cash, check on how the wrist roll
Baby saw it in my eyes and she knew that I was lookin' at her
Ain't a chance to get her, I can M-I-crooked letter
If she with a nigga I'mma steal her, yeah a crook'll have her
Throwin' up the E once the D get to cookin' in her (Eastside!)
Yeah, so what's it gon' be?
Golden black Joe Clark, H.N.I.C
Regulatin' on any hatin' I see
Something good in your hands then repeat after me

[Hook: Problem]
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Said put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(What?) Upside down (what?) upside down

Fuck that, I'm drinkin' 'til I throw up
Turnt like a muh- 'cause my whole hood showed up

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Bang to the boogie, keep a thang in my dungarees
Bailin' through the Eastside, feelin' like a younger G
Eatin' like a muh, but I'm so, so hun-g-ry
I dare one of these young dumb fucks to try and fuck with me
Fucker, I'm back to the party
Marley, Bacardi, shawty, gnarly
Becky, and Vicky beggin' me to give me hickeys
Through my Dickies

[Hook: Problem]
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Said put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down

Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) And turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) And turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) Upside down (Fuck it up!) Upside down (Fuck it up!)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Lil' mama tryin' to show the Dogg her G-string
While she sang ain't "Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang"
A nigga throwin' signs tryin' to let me know that he bang
Like I give a motherfuck what he claim
Ay, your nigga better chill doggy
'Fore I treat him like a old bitch and menopause him
I'll stop your ass right there
I swear had homies on your head like hair
Homie I ain't thinkin', I'm too busy drinkin'
Plumber of the month, mami show me where your sink is
So I can get to uncloggin'
I hope that lil' cat ready for this Bigg Dogg and woof!

[Hook: Problem]
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Said put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(What?) Upside down (what?) upside down
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) And turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) And turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) Upside down (Fuck it up!) Upside down (Fuck it up!)

[Interlude: Problem]
Pause... pause... pause...

[Verse 4: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, I'm just a young nigga in the biz with mo' enemies than friends
Get no money goin' out, but I got it comin' in
And no, I ain't a G but every day that's what I spend
I get paid to drop a verse, for 16 I need ten
End all the speculation
Them pre-conceived notions got me over-compensatin'
And for you slow niggas that mean I've been concentratin'
I'm shittin' on these records while you rappers constipated
Uhh, it's get money, fuck haters
Me and hip-hop is like Chucks and blue laces
Me and Snoop Dogg is Sir Charles and King David
With Problem we all ballin' like the '09 Lakers
Yeah, it's Terrance Martin on the track
And I'm that young nigga droppin' crack back-to-back
My album on the way and I ain't worried 'bout the stats
But I could tell you how the streets gon' react
They gon' say

[Hook: Problem]
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Said put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(What?) Upside down (what?) upside down
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) And turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) And turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) Upside down (Fuck it up!) Upside down (Fuck it up!)

[Verse 1]
Watch your mouth never speak on what you not know
I'm from the west coast I turn his face into a pothole
15 deep niggas creepin' in the Tahoe
Let's see you act macho when I pull the burner on ya
Sideways like a taco
Rap niggas weak, all talk like a Raldo
Trunk full of cargo
Dry like Barstow
Arsenal run up on 'em
Get up on 'em
Drill 'em with the clips
Niggas gon' respect mine
I run this whole shit
Crip rag in my pocket
Three eighty on my hip
But back to this hip hop
Who next on the list
Gangstas don't kiss we get old and die rich
I smoke till I'm sleep
Crush these niggas with my fist
Your daddy was a coward you's a son of a bitch
So back to the Glock with the infra-blue clip
We hit licks and gang bang
You on some T-Pain shit
Chop the pop and 20 crip
Watch the flames hit his whip
Then I'm back to the block shit
Rock shit, hot shit
Hit 'em in the chest
Doggy run up in his pockets
Misrepresenting sock him in his eye socket
I sat back and let you little niggas make your profits
Nonsense, I'm watching, hoes out of pocket
You heard what they say
Don't block it till you knock it
You stole my whole style
I'm 'bout to take you fools hostage
Brrrah, bhrrrrah

[Verse 2]
From the looks to the hooks
I'm looking at these new niggas flippin' through my book
There's only one king
Is you a pawn or a rook?
I got hand machine guns and soldiers on foot
So beef with me it's none
Nigga down South, huh?
I throw a bullet at ya who gon catch it nigga duck
Then send them goons at ya
Turn your weapons into dust
You against me it's like trying to fight a bus
I'm at the BET Awards sitting in disgust
It's still a +G Thang+ but yet they wanna be us
They wanna be Daz
They wanna be Kurupt
Cash on delivery money up front
Yeah
Bubble kush out a purple blunt
Who's the best nigga circle one
Snoop Dogg
I'm large in the streets
My arms and my feets knee deep in the game
I'm the best on the beat
Let you little niggas speak
And run for a treat
Motherfuckin' geeks
All y'all niggas owe me until you rest in peace
And that's our D.P.G. motherfucka

[Outro: Snoop talking]
That's real shit man
How the fuck y'all gon' keep having these award shows out here on the west coast
But ain't no mutherfuckas from the west coast winning no awards, nigga?
It's like that, it's just like that
We showed you niggas how to do this shit
Bitch ass nigga. Want some, get some. Bad enough, take some

[Intro: Warren G]
Get on up to get down
And really go to town
And don't stop till you get enough
I wanna rock with you, shake your stuff
Get on up to get down
And really go to town
I said don't stop till you get enough
When I rock with you, shake your stuff

[Verse 1: Redman]
Yo Yo, Doctor, everybody hit the floor
Wild out till the security hit the door
I'm dirty, gorilla paws, bang sugar walls
Hoes wanna pop E, hang with a Dogg
I told my man Snoop, she salmonella
Got a ho with no dough with condoms with her
I'm a ride to the death of Def Squad on my chest
Look at it crook at it, rob you and jet
Surprise you and flex
Funk in the Cadillac truck with a chicken, bobbing her neck
You done woke up an ape trying to sleep
You done found to Hugh Hefner to find the freaks
I'ma ground with beast, I'ma stay on the street
I'ma stay saying 'fuck you' behind police
My mamma ain't raise no fool, she love me
That's why she hide my tool inside her room
I'm a jump, bump, throw that ass
Rough sex, I gotta fuck with shoulder pads
I'm like baby powder, ain't nann 'nother
Ain't nann not a ho getting Redman butter
And my man Gutter, DJ Murder Inc
Ja know them hoes, yo we can't love 'em
Underground the heat yeah I stay buzzing
Mixtapes I'm on the street they stay dubbing
Brick City riding, men 'bout it 'bout it
Shoot up you town then we Bin Ladin hidin'
Meth, show 'em where the luger kept
Open your safe, show me where the food and vest
I hope when Dre hear this, he give a beat for ten
Cause I stay on the corner like squegeemen
Yo Nate Dogg, what's happening y'all
Long Beach, Brick City, scream at your frogs

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Everybody shaking
All these hoes around me
She was lost in the land of love
"Glad that Nate Dogg found me"
Girl you got a phatty
New York back to Cali
You know who got the bomb weed
Long Beach 2 Brick City
I know just want you want, I got just want you need
Turn that shit around, and back it up on me
(Since I) Since I was the first, I guess I'll be the last to leave
D-O-double-G, could you keep it gangsta please

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I gots to do it
Yes, yes loc', we keep the best smoke
Me and my nigga, my nerve, my kinfolk
I kick a bitch in the ass and then smoke
I'm a motherfucking fool in the pool doing the breaststroke
You want a problem? Well let's go
Cause if not, I came to disco
And freak this ho from Acopoqo
And flip her inside out, now I'm bout to ride out
Let's go we hit the hood slow
Post up, set up shop and press four
Who got the best flow, who got the most dough
Who got the best hoes, nigga you know
Shit it's been ten years since I hit some cess smoke
But I still rock a mink coat on the West Coast in the summertime
And I crumble mine down to the dandelion
Nigga watch how I handle mine
Spiritual, hear we go, hear this
Snoop D-O-double-G, man I'm so fearless
Square biz, you know what time it is
I'm cool on these niggas but I'm hard on a bitch
Now check dis, fact is
Put your back out, now back in
Go head wiggle it round you feeling me now
Girlfriend, you killing them now

[Bridge/Outro: Snoop Dogg & Nate Dogg]
The way you shake your booty
It makes me want your booty
The way you shake your booty
Sure looks good to me
The way you shake your booty
It makes me want your booty
The way you shake your booty
Sure looks good to me

[Intro: Don Magic Juan] (*echo*)
Boss Playa ... Boss Playa
Big Snoop Dogg is a Boss Playa
This is the Archbishop Don Magic Juan
Skin in game, church

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game (Pimp game)
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game (Pimp game)
And to me, you know it ain't no motherfuckin' thang
To give it to you plain and simple 'cause you know it's played
Holla at 'em, Doggy Dogg, go and do that thang
Okay, "Sa Da Tay" like my nigga Pootie Tang
I got that bounce, to make her booty sway
That little cutie thang, 'Fred, she's a beauty, mayne' (Ooh wee)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Rollin' with a player 'cause that's what he was
And dedicated to his paper, Je-sus!
On his bitches hard as feezuck
And if them law boys pull him over he won't freeze up
He got the heata-fa-heata and the keysa
With a pocket full of big faced Visas
They say it's cheaper to keep her, now baby, ease up
Kick back and blaze some of these trees up
Now sit your ass in the treezuck
And do me a favor and turn the music up
Should I slap her, or should I freak her?
I'll take the stronger, you can have the weaker
Speak when spoken to, yeah, I broke a few
And by the way I was hoping you
Had a freak for me and a freak for you
I make 'em do for us
That thang you been wantin' her to do for months

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game (Pimp game)
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game (Pimp game)
And to me, you know it ain't no motherfuckin' thang
To give it to you plain and simple 'cause you know it's played
Holla at 'em, Doggy Dogg, go and do that thang
Okay, "Sa Da Tay" like my nigga Pootie Tang
I got that bounce, to make her booty sway
That little cutie thang, 'Fred, she's a beauty, mayne' (Ooh wee)

[Interlude: Don Magic Juan]
This is the Chairman of the Board
The Archbishop Don Magic Juan
Big Snoop Dogg is a boss playa
As a matter a fact
I was there when he was crowned 'Boss Playa', church

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I had three on my right arm and four on my left
Lime green and gold, we was sharp to death (Ooh wee)
Had to catch my breath, watch my step
Playin' this game, you can holla at the ref
And call a timeout before you put your dime out
Stop, pause, rewind before you put your rhyme out
And go to the "Wizard of Oz"
And tell 'em that your tryin' to get yourself a brand new heart
A brand new start
'Cause you realized that you hadn't played your part
And that was smart
It's like a art the way I articulate
And break these bitches from state to state
See, I've been the flyest since I came out the gate
I ain't ask for it, homie, I just shake and bake
I won't fake to make you buy my tape
I say a prayer to the Lord just to keep my faith up straight

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game (Pimp game)
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game (Pimp game)
And to me, you know it ain't no motherfuckin' thang
To give it to you plain and simple 'cause you know it's played
Holla at 'em, Doggy Dogg, go and do that thang
Okay, "Sa Da Tay" like my nigga Pootie Tang
I got that bounce, to make her booty sway
That little cutie thang, 'Fred, she's a beauty, mayne' (Ooh wee)

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg  & (Female)]
Will you steal for me? (Yes I will)
Will you kill for me? (Yes I will)
Would you lie to me? (Never)
Would you die for me? (Whenever)
Will you steal for me? (Yes I will)
Will you kill for me? (Yes I will)
Would you lie to me? (Never)
Would you die for me? (Whenever, whenever)

[Interlude: Don Magic Juan]
Big Snoop Dogg, lets you know
That this game ain't for no lame
If you got heart, you can play this game
But if your heart ain't right
We got a remedy for that, too
You got to go see the wizard .. to get you some heart
And the Archbishop Don Magic Juan is the Wizard
That's got the game ... for them lames
Boss Playa ... Boss Playa ... that's what this game is all about
Boss Playa

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game (Pimp game)
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game (Pimp game)
And to me, you know it ain't no motherfuckin' thang
To give it to you plain and simple 'cause you know it's played
Holla at 'em Doggy Dogg, go and do that thang
Okay, "Sa Da Tay" like my nigga Pootie Tang

That little cutie thang, 'Fred, she's a beauty, mayne' (Ooh wee)

[Outro: Traci Nelson]
Gangsta, Gangsta, where you been?
Round the corner messin' with brotha'n'em
Youngsta, Youngsta, you at it again?
Poppin' gats for the fuck of it, when you know you got ends
I don't think that you should be in the streets like that
You know you the fashion type of cat
Always in them stores, with major whores
Doin' things, bling bling
West Coast runnin', lovin', hustlin' smokin', always chokin' indo green
With the sticky in your hand, fo sho
Everybody 'round ya 'cause they know you got mo'
Wet Cristal, you like to get wild
You like to dip in your 6' n shit
Rollin' through them streets, poppin' CPT
LBC rollin' with me, ohh

[Kokane] (Battlecat)
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah
I got to snoop, so cold
Big Snoop (Battlecat, Snoop Dogg)

[Hook - Kokane]
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep

[Kokane]
When you close your eyes and you go to sleep
That's when I ride, late night I be on the creep
I'mma get you before you get me
Them niggas that you hang with are so weak
You're talking shit about me
Turn around and you're the homie
Man that shit is phoney
Tried to set me up bro
But you were singing to my ho

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
From a nigga to a dub
From a g to a scrub
I'm a vet on the set
I'mma show you what it was
Y'all flipping out, trippin' out
Cause I took a different route
6-2 rag, hell yeah come dippin' out
Beach city rider, 85'er, eastsider
Ain't none of y'all niggas live-er
I hear the bad shit that y'all talk
You want to catch me out of pocket but I can't get caught
I'mma show you what a bitch thought, a bitch taught
A nigga got played out and layed out in chalk
It's a cold game
It's like a rap riddle
Nine times out of ten a bitch was in the middle
Most neighborhoods started off cool
In the eighties it was Long Beach fool
With no seperation
Here's a toast to the real shit, the foundation
You know my game is amazing
I keep blazing
Eastside niggas is the craziest and the shadiest
Yeah dawg, tell 'em again
What you talking 'bout loc?
I got hell of a ends

[Kokane] (Battlecat)
Hell boss
Hoping that her smiling exes fall (ego hustling loopholes)
I'd always thought that you would've never have stabbed me everywhere

[Snoop Dogg]
More rumors, more lies
More money, more time
I don't really give a fuck cause you all gon' shine
So you better get yours and quit worrying 'bout mine
I see it in your voice and I hear it in your eyes
So jealous, so envious
What a drag
Real talk loc, you ain't acting like a man
Your message is how blessed you is
I guess you is
Look at the mess you in

[Hook]

[Kokane]
When you close your eyes and you go to sleep
That's when I ride, late night I be on the creep
I'mma get you before you get me
Them niggas that you hang with are so weak

[Hook]

[Intro]
Fa shizzle dizzle, it's the big Neptizzle
With the Snoopy D-O-Double Gizzle!

... (Snoop Dogg!)
C-walk to this (Snoop Dogg!)
Hehe, yeah, C-walk to this (Snoop Dogg!)
A-ha-ha! C-walk to this (Snoop Dogg!)

[Verse One: Snoop Dogg]
Bam! Boom! Whatchu gon' do cuz?
Guess who rollin in, with them baby blue Chucks?
And I've still got my khakis creased
I'm still loc'n on these beats and keep a bad bitch on the streets
It's the S-N-double-O-P'n
Biggest dogg of 'em all, and youse a flea'n
And since I got time to drop it for you I guess I must
And give it to you motherfuckers like Busta-Bust
I keep the heat on deck, but in God we trust
And can't none of y'all fuck with us
But you can run up on the G but that's not thinkin' wisely
These thrillers are "Contagious", just like Ron Isley
What the hell is goin on? Someone's sleepin in my home
Snoop to the D-O-Double G (uh-huh)
Get in where you fit in, follow me (ooh!)

[Hook: Neptunes]
Who's the man with that dance? (Snoop Dogg!)
Who keep the khakis for all his pants? (Snoop Dogg!)
Keep the low-low in a three-wheel stance (Snoop Dogg!)
Still got the "Gin and Juice" in hand (Snoop Dogg!)

[Verse Two: Snoop Dogg]
I do it for the G's and I do it for the hustlers
Here to annihilate you mark-ass busters
Eff the police cause all they wanna do is cuff us
The world is fuckin' chilly as if his name was Usher
But I'm still ridin' them 'llacs, makin them G stacks
And got them cornrows to the back
I ain't really tryin to be picky
But if you give me somethin, it's got to be the sticky
Green by the ounces, low-lows bouncin
Sandy Fay and Annie Mae kissin on my couch and
Ooh to the ouch and, Moet fountain
That's how we get down at the Doggy Dogg House'n
This year we ain't fuck with thousands
We clean with millions that get fly as a falcon
Pull up to the Doggy Dogg palace
With a car fulla bitches cookin grits like Alice (ooh!)

[Hook]

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg]
Three 14 inch rims is running on the side
(They're riding on the side?) Yeah they running on the side!
Three 14 inch rims is running on the side
(They're riding on the side?) Yeah they runnin on the side!
Three 14 inch rims is running on the side
(They're riding on the side?) Yeah they runnin on the side!
Three 14 inch rims is running on the side
(They're riding on the side?) Yeah they running on the side!

[Verse Three: Snoop Dogg]
Take two and pass it, it will not burn you
From the Long Beach Chronicles to the Wall Street Journal
They all know the G with the Cutlass Coupe
Ask Bill Gates, "Yeah I know the homie Snoop"
Yeah, I'm straight loc'n, hangin wit my folk and
Follow Rakim cause "I Ain't No Joke" and
Cuz, I done seen so much (like what?)
Enough to have your feelings touched
When the gunshots ratta, all your boys scatter
Check up on your homies but they gave ya bad data
Make a nigga stop BREATHIN, have his soul relievin'
And now you niggas believe in
What I say cause what I say is so real
Homie you don't wanna see the steel!
You dont wanna catch a body, you came here to party
Now that's what you should do, now where's my baby boo? (ooh!)

[Hook]

[Outro: Bishop Don Magic Juan]
Yeah, no introduction, is needed
But for those who STILL, refuse to accept
The reading on the wall, for the new Mack-allenium
This is the Archbishop Don Magic Juan
Chairman of the Board, of famous players EVERYWHERE
And I'm puttin it down with Big Snoop Dogg, the legend
The King Player, my friend, yo' friend
The L.B.C. SAVIOR!
Also known, in this new Mack-allenium, as DA BOSS

[Latoiya Williams]
I'm so glad that you believe in me like I believe in you

You play all day and I be working at night and
The only one who understands my life and

You're all I ever need

[Latoiya Williams]
I'm feeling good and my baby's home
You're spending time
Holding hands
To this beat
The fellow that can satisfy my every need
Is he the one?
We've been around and we're both grown... (grown)
Look at me... (me)
I'm like a baby
I took that chance
And I feel secure about this love romance
Let's have some fun
And I believe when you say
Ain't that special... (oh)
Touch my soul... (soul)
Feel the same
When you whisper softly
And call my name
Here I come
It's more than words that I ever could sing
You're that chill bring
Maybe your walk or just the way you do me

Cause I believe in you

And I believe in you too
Cause its the only thing to do
I couldn't give you away
No matter what my friends sizzay
See when I'm gone
Away from home

On your two way

I know you gon' lose it, this new Snoop shit
Come on, baby boo, you gots to get into it
Don't fool with the player with the cool whip
Yeah, yeah, you know I'm always on that cool shit
Walk to it, do it how you do it
Have a glass, let me put you in the mood, and
Little cutie, looking like a student
Long hair with your big fat booty
Back in the days, you was a girl I went to school with
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it
Hit her up with some pimp-pimp fluid
Mommy, don't worry, I won't abuse it
Hurry up and finish so we can watch Clueless
I laugh at these niggas when they ask, "Who do this?"
But everybody know, ooh, girl, that you is

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & Pharrell Williams]
When I see my baby boo, shit, I get foolish
Smack a nigga that tries to pursue it
Homeboy, she taken, just move it
I asked you nicely, don't make the Dogg lose it
We just blow dro and keep the flow movin'
In a '64, me and baby boo cruisin'
Body rag interior blue, and
Have them hydraulics squeakin' when we screwin'
Now she's yellin', hollerin' out "Snoop!" and
Hootin', hollerin'; hollerin', hootin'
Black and beautiful, you the one I'm choosin'
Hair long, thin, black and curly like you're Cuban
Keep groovin', that's what we doin'
And we gon' be together until your moms move in
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg & Pharrell Williams]
Snoop Dogg Clothing, that's what I'm groomed in
You got my pictures on the wall in your room, and
Girls be complaining you keep me boomin'
But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you, and
You don't ask why I roll with a crew, and
Twist up my fingers, and wear dark blue, and
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
On the Eastside, that's the crew I choose
Nothing I do is new to you
I smack up the world if they rude to you
'Cause baby girl, you're so beautiful

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Pharrell Williams]
See, I just want you
To know that you are really special
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
See, I just want you
To know that you are really special
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
See, I just want you
To know that you are really special

Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]

Ehh... oh yeah, there's something about you... Oh-hooo!

[Snoop]
This one right here is dedicated to a lot of famous players out there
That might have been in love before
I know some of you might not think gangstas fall in love (I miss that bitch)
But uh, it's true
If you been in love like I been in love before, you know
It's hard to get with somebody once they gone (I miss that bitch)
It's hard to replace that special someone
When they just up and you know
Dip dive and so socialize
And what we gon do right here (I miss that bitch)
We go'n kick something over this HiTek beat right here
For all the players that lost somebody special
And wonder where she at
E. White kick that shit (I miss that bitch)

[E. White]
I got my eyes wide open
The whole time I'm holding on to hope with you on my mind
It's been a while child, I'm getting down with Dogg
I bet my name all around your wall
Perhaps I went to jail
That left us out of touch
Shoulda shot some mail or something
Ain't no telling where she at now
I be God damn
Baby I really wanna see what you got now
I'm all grown up with my shit together
I don't know if I'mma see you ever
I got a woman and shit,but I must admit this
You at the top of my list
Unforgetable
Fuck with them nigga do
I still miss, there ain't no getting rid of you
But in the mean time I'mma get with cha
Until I get somebody with your hook up I'mma hit ya

[Hook]
I miss that bitch
She was a pot of gold
Her body was cold
I don't know where you went
Where did you go (I miss that bitch)
Shopping around looking around
I'm try to see
Where could you be
How could you do this to me (I miss that bitch)

[Snoop]
My momma got mad
I was young when I hooked up with her
One hit and I couldn't stop trippin
A long lasting relationship
Pass you around, and let my niggas take a hit
I used to break you down just to roll you up
You the real, you never will slow me up
And you was always on my mind
Say no more
I still miss you at times
All of a sudden you lost my interest
I packed it up and set about my business
You used to have a hold on me
Sometimes to the point that they said you controlled me
I kept going to jail and all that
Get out, fuck with you again, I'm right back
I guess I had to learn the hard way baby
I'm leaving you alone cause you driving me crazy (I miss that bitch)

[Hook]

Ohhhhh
Mary, mary, mary
Quite contrary
Ohhhhh
Every time I think about that girl
Make a nigga wanna have a wet dream
Release some steam
Ohhhhhh, ohhhhhhh, ohhhhhh
I miss that bitch

[DJ E-Z Dick]
W-Balls, it's your main man DJ E-Z Dick
About to unleash another one of those platnum plus hits
And the word is on the streets, and the word is the streets
We gon go to a live remote, licking wit my main man Mr Doggy Dogg

[Snoop Dogg]
A day in the life, of a Rollin' 20 Crip
I'm just a stubborn type of fella with a head like a brick
Now just because I sip Moet, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc'ness
Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip
Snoop Dogg is in this bitch, so don't even trip
I bust a funky composition that's as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick off in this funky-ass rhythm
It's six dub, the phone is ringing off the deck
And it's some homies talking about I disrespected they set
Aww nah, Dogg ain't diss y'all
I got a couple relatives up off of Crenshaw
This is about me and Simon, not me and y'all
I got love for a bunch of real B-Dogs
Like K-Dub, Top Cat, B-Real, E-Rock, Boo-Lay Face
And the homie Heron rest in peace
Big Jay from Campanella Park
He used to blaze with his nephew after dark
On and on, rocking big Neckbone
Mausberg I had to put you on my song
It's so real, I had to show some love
Now back to this scrub, it ain't about Crip or Blood
It's about you bein' jealous of what I does
Cause I does it the most, the king of the coast
In the paint playin' post - I back you down
Like Shaq-Daddy, and bust on ya out the new Caddy
And skirt up Wilshire Boulevard
I'm not Xzibit, you can't "Pull My Ho Card"
.. I fucked all your groupies
When you was doing time in Camp Snoopy
With the fags and snitches, no killers just bitches
And you was payin' niggas off with all my riches
You so hardco', why you ain't go to level fo'?
Oh I know (bitch!)
But I walk the mainline every time I go down
You can check my G Files I do it L.B.C. style
.. I got the word on you Simon
You need to just start rhymin'
Cause you the biggest star on your label
And them other niggas just crumbs off my table
You're not able, to compete with the heat that I drop
And I still ain't been paid, for "1-8-7 on a cop"
I started yo' shit and I will end yo' shit
If you keep talkin shit on Crip!

[Hook 1: repeat 2X]
It all boils down to the fact
That you're jealous of my paper stack (jealous ass nigga)
It all boils down to the fact
That you're jealous of my paper stack (gon' get pimp slapped)

[Hook 2: repeat 2X]
Money, I get it, paper I got it
I got the dope
Heaters, I keep em, bitches I got em
Run up, ya get done up, I stay one up

[Snoop Dogg]
If I shoot you, I'll be brainless, and you'll be famous
And I'll be spending money out the anus
Your only gain is to try to get me to fall down to your level
Man you worse than them devils
Alotta niggas should've said it, fuck em
But I'ma say it for em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for em
This nigga's a bitch like his wife
Suge Knight's a bitch, and that's on my life
And I'ma let the whole world see
Cause you fucked up the industry, and that's on me
We can go head up, nigga, set it up
Or we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up
Your rappers and artists, tell em, shut it up
Cause I'll fuck every last one of 'em up, especially Kurupt (shshshsh)
See that's my lil homeboy, so he knows what's up (what's up)
He better keep it Crippin', and slip his clip in
Cause these niggas trippin', this is official business
Do the same way, leave no witnesses
This is that unexpected misdirected, sprayed, covered and protected
Strip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it
It's all to the good again
You can catch Snoopy Do Double in the hood again (Eastside)
Spinning that real times, spitting that real shit
To make the whole world feel it (feel it)
So put the bacon in the skillet (hahaha), and try to peel it
Cause Doggystyle Records is the realest, nigga

[Hook 1]

Money, I get it, paper I got it
Heaters, I keep em, bitches I got em
Money, I get it, paper I got it

Jealous ass nigga

[Snoop Dogg]
Awww yeah
This one goes out to all you muthafuckers out there
That didn't think we could make records that could bang in the club
Ya that's right

With the long hair, the big titties, the pretty eyes

[Snoop Dogg]

[Goldie Loc]
I slap bitches in the face and give em Jay-Z lips
Make them sign their life off so they can pay me chips

Give bitches sandwiches with handmade mayonnaise
I put bitches on the stroll hall
Plus I control hoes like remote control suped remote controlled cars
Goldie Loc's ho on 'em like the internet

[Kokane]
Don't you wanna get nasty

You be doin' the worm in the club
Like a chicken with it's head cut off
Let me rub up on that clit it feels so nice and soft

[Snoop Dogg]
Coast to coast we do-si-dos
And get your day started like a breakfast toast
Me and my niggas make beats for your strokes
Heat for your tokes, baby tees for your chokes, keys for your notes
Me squeezin' your folks
When they come through
With their noses flarin' out like they be on that coke
Nah we on that dope
Now she wanna go cause she wanna know
How did we walk through the front door
No pat down, Straight V.I.P
Well when it comes to rap styles, and rap crowns, and mack downs

If you with it you can have a little hit off me
Get nasty, get freaky, get busy o-so-off the hizzy

[Kokane]

Sixty-five G's for a Snoop Deville
Get you one, matter fact get two
They come in burgundy, but I'mma paint mine blue
I can't come through half steppin'
I keep me a cane as a potental weapon
Slap a bitch or beat a nigga up too
I do what the fuck I want to do
I stay cool, act a fool, represent it
Hard from the get go, so hard to the finish
The cleanest, the meanest, I know that's right
And don't get to close cause these gators bite
Game on lock

Feeling way pimpin

Back up in the hizzle, Da Boss, Nigga

You play too much, I had to fuck
Cuddled you up and put my hands on your butt
Rubbin your stuff and now your pants full of nut

Let me shoot my thang on your bellybutton
I got to, keep it gangsta
Your homegirl want some, I just might bank her
Shank her, bank her, and take her bankroll
Big Snoop Dogg and my game is way cold
Never, ever, overexpose
I usually got a car with a room full of hizzoes

[Hook: Chrissy Luv]
Snoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly

Open up your eyes you'll see my navel
Flip down my drawers, you'll see that label
Sniffed so much 'caine/Kane, the bitch got able/Abel
Put the switch on, directed my cable

Bitch stop my dick hurtin, now fuck Daz

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Young! Woo! Hov'! Yes
She wanna meet the only king on the East coast
Hook me up witcha boy Snoop she said he so low
I never get the chance to get at him
Only on the TV when I blow kisses at him, muah
Listen here madam, you can throw the pussy at him
If it ain't about snatch, well it just won't happen!
Hov ain't into backwards mackin
How backwards that is
I don't love 'em though
'Less makin a little paper then I love 'em the most
If she's, sneakin in the club with the toast
I'm flyin the friendly skies with 36 Os
Shit, I can get a chef to cook for me
Talk about some paper if you tryin to book me
Ma, you can keep your head

[Hook]

"Let's go do the bump.. give me that funky stuff" {*repeat 4X*}

[Verse 4: Nate Dogg]
I like the way you shakin that ass, so don't stop
Slang that ass like I used to slang rocks
Bend over trick let me get to that spot
Later on you can lick on my lollipop
I like the way you shakin that ass, so don't quit
You know you get a hella response from my dick
Don't put your fuckin clothes back on 'til you rich
The type of woman I want tonight, a straight bitch!

[Voice talking] (*echo*)
Yeah .. niggas wanna take care of these hoes
Niggas wanna control these hoes
You can't control these bitches
These is independent bitches these years
You can't understand the 2000 in here?
Motherfuckers wanna put they mack down
Wanna put they soder down
Let a bitch do what she wanna do
If she chose to ride wit a G
Then let her ride wit a G
The bitch don't wanna sit back and be a housewife all the time
Let the ho be what she wanna be
A real slut, and let the ho get on and make her money
You understand? I got a homey sittin' by me
Understand this nigga don't understand because he's a young nigga
You know what I'm sayin'? I'm been in the game since '85
And I know a ho don't do nothin', wanna play a nigga like 9 to 5, alright

[Snoop Dogg]
YIKES, Shabba dabble do (*light barking noise*) I can dig it baby, you know
Because these hoes, they can't be controlled
You gotta find 'em, spot 'em, send 'em, get em, got 'em, you know

[Hook - Male voice] (Snoop Dogg)
It wasn't (uh uh) your fault (it wasn't your fault)
You was only tryin' to be nice (tryin' be nice)
Only tryin to be nice, ohh (can't be nice to these hoes)
You know you can't control these hoes (no, no, no)
You know you can't control these hoes (can't control these hoes)
You know you can't control these hoes

[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg]
What she do, she jumped out of her sleep and left the pad at a quarter to two
That's on you, you shoulda put your foot in her ass, like a pimp's supposed to do
But instead of goin' 'upside da head'
You bought her a 5 karat wit your bread
And then she went and gave her homeboy Ted some head
I ain't tellin' on her, I'm just sayin', what you do
When your bitch out of bounds and you don't know what to do
What we do, we check 'em from the gate, to keep a bitch straight
It's on you, see you can take her out and buy her all types of things
You's a fool, cause when she leave you, for what he do
You'll see fool

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
Me and you, that's what you thought 'til your ass got caught
Shame on you, and now I understand why my momma used to tell me that
Ain't that true, you can't make a queen out a motherfuckin' hoodrat
Game on you, cause now you back at your momma house
And you sleepin' on tha copeasack
What's she do, I gave her the keys to my '74 Cadillac
Say it ain't true, she let a nigga drive it, ask tha homie Battlecat
Whatchu do, put my foot in her ass and mashed tha gas
You know me, and ever since that day my nigga, I've been P I M P

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg]
Thats your boo, but she know every nigga in the Roc-A-Fella Crew
That's on you, baby blow too much, I mean she know too much
That's my boo, it's all about who she did and where she been
I love you, you shouldn't a told her that, you should a smacked her flat
Shame on you (shame on you), your so in love you fittin' to get a tattoo
That ain't cool (that ain't cool), love is blind and no friend of mine
If I was you, I'd a packed her bags and bust anotha bitch thats bad
Game got rules, if you lose a ho, you gotta gain a ho

[Hook]

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, this pimping stay open all night
Check this out Jelly roll...

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
We do break hoes
We don't fuck with fake hoes
Yeah, we make hoes
Strip down to they panty hose
Pop your whip, now grab that bitch
Pimping Snoop ain't having it
Oh you like pussy, congratulations
I'm trying to get your ass in my congregations
I keep three hoes in my room at one time
Two nickels and the other's a dime
You wouldn't wanna, keep a hood on her
When I'm dropping that motherfucking wood on her
Cause I perform, a G like Warren
A nigga getting paid off shooting porn
They call me the black folks President
Snoop Heffner mixed with a little bit of Doggy Flint
Banging this parliament, come get a bar with this
You would wanna be a part of this, oh bitch ass nigga
Quit playing with the ho, and let me borrow the bitch

[Hook: Charlie Wilson]
You got what I want
Tell me if you want, just what I want
Cause I got, what you need
Baby if you need some, get it from me
Cause I got, what you want
I want you to want, just what I want
Just want, what I want
Ooh you got just what I want

[Verse 2: Goldie Loc]
Look mama make you hot like a corn to pop
And watch how fast you see a nigga boxers drop
I'm trying to work it fast, but I know you like it slow
You know I got to bust a nut and hurry up and go
You got something that I want right now
Hurry up and let me put the black spot on the cow
Make the pussy ball up like salt to a snail
And when I kill it big daddy, I want you to tell
Cause I don't give a damn when it come to freaking hoes
Call up forty hoes, and have a rolly peep show
And when you give me something, you gone want something back
This dick to your mouth, little mama like that
Fish cost too much, so I feed her sardines
Man I'm the motherfucking MVP of the team
Cold game how a nigga steady spitting this shit
Make her mama jump back and say bitch is a pimp

[Hook]

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson]
Of course she love my nine
Bitch I got that antidote
Got a bigger dick that'll crack your spine
Then I'm gonna let it inside your throat

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Tricked out, kicked out get her on gone
Ludacris on the motherfucking microphone
Heey, what's up I came to pimp
Fur hats and fur clothes, time to raise the temp
Biiiiatch, I got it made
Just pick one of my hoes, and I got it laid
You never heard as many bitches so fast and frequent
"Can I get the ends?" Is this bitch delinquent?
Run my bath water, cook my meals
And SHUT THE FUCK UP, when I book the deals
And iron my draws, give me cuffs and creases
It's your nephew come to fuck your nieces

[Hook - 2x]

[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
Gimme what I want
I got what you need
Gimme what I want
Yeah, yeah

[Hook: Jasmin Lopez]
Bang out, til the sun comes up
The wheels fall off and the drop collapse
Cause I bang out, keep my Glock in hand
While you're posted up, chillin wit'cha mans
Bang out, won't catch me slippin'
While you in the club, goin' out for keeps
Cause I bang out, shots go off quick
Catch yo' ass butt-naked while you wit'cha bitch

[Verse 1: Snoop]
I toss up the set
I walk up in this bitch with some gold on my neck
Yeah nigga, I'm controllin' the set
Rock and roll on a bitch then grab a hold of my dick
Uhh, I pop a hole in your clique
So you don't wanna fuck with this
One nigga found on the ground, we don't fuck around
D-O-double-G Pound, L.B.C. style

[Interlude: J. L.]
Victory, is mine and I’m gon' shine
Ain't no need to try, can't stop my grind
Keep my pen in hand, goin' on for mine

Victory is mine

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop]
Eastside Long Beach Rollin 20's

Conversation flashy, y'all niggas can't match me

Take advice from a player
Don't love her just play her
Boy I never could dare, to pay double the fare
Man I swear to God it's gon' be some trouble in here
Before I pay that bitch, I'm like a bossy hog
Half dog, half gorilla, bitch Donkey Kong
Niggas thirst for hoes, I got a thirst to ball
Tryin to knock a pimp's hustle, be the first to fall
Fuckin with a-hundred-fifty, whole can of vodka
Mixed with gangbang, got a program like Poppa (hey hold up man)
I'mma do you a favor, let this pimpin save ya
Leave that bitch alone, the homies call her Ms. Behavior
Boy you move too fast, done too much talkin
I'm too much walkin to one who keep hoes hawkin
Don't fuck with Snoop too much cause he goes off when
Niggas mouth too much, so please no flossin

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
That's the bidness mayne, step my game up up in this mayne
Long hours hard minutes mayne, with this hustle on splendid mayne

Then you get to poppin you'll have change of heart
I hit your chest a couple times you'll have to change your heart
Have doc usin donors, dead niggas wit spare parts
You come back wit lungs of a snicth, and the heart of dead nark
Niggas never see the light till spark
Then they bleed, it get cold , then shit get dark
You can call me the beast from the east, I run these streets
You can eat hollow tip shells or you can work for me
These rap niggas crazy, my mercy has limits
Push me a hundred revolvers'll get to spinnin
Your services are no longer needed; rock-a-bye baby

Stay low key and keep it OG and don't try to burn rubber on me

Say that I dissed her cause I wouldn't kiss her
But I got her a picture say I'll holla back witcha (I'll holla)
Hey, they say that I'm like Mr. Bigsta
All these bullshit moves to miss us
Divide in twisters we buy relistas
We mind my listnats cause I'm a mimsta
Design by mimstas these time are senistas
But I'mma finish her on the ground until it's done
Knives and silly clubs - hoes and fake thugs
Pimps, players and all the above

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, that's bangin' loco (For shizzle)

Pack the pistas, twist don't twist us
Roll with me on this dog adventure
But you can't enter without your credentias
And if you get in, you might get a picture (come on)
So sit your shit down, go on and get down

It's time to slow it down, steadily grindin
And this is, the big Doggy Dogg..

And I ain't talkin about no Air Force Ones
I just gotta know, before you let me get some

[Hook]
Do you have a fresh pair of panties on?
I got to know, or you could show, me
Silk cotton see-through lace your sexy thong
I got to know, or you could show, me

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Freak-a-leek, peak peak
Let a nigga sneak a few, peek-a-boo
Let's see what we can do
I'm bout freakin you, and sneakin you
Into a quiet place
So I can look at it face to face
Let me guess, you prefer to wear cotton
I can tell, cause you like squattin
Your last dude, he was so rotten
And now your love is to be gotten
Yeah baby girl I can read your mind
But what I'm really tryin to do is read between your pantylines
I know it seems oh so personal
But I'm just tryin to make you feel real comfortable
I know, so, what will it be?
And the type of underwear you wear I mean it's troublin me
Can I get a glimpse, one for the pimps?
I got one question, answer me this then

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You came by the church with a whole lot of body
Got invited to our annual pajama party
Workin that lace, I think it was the French cut
Yeah bitch, you got a big ol' butt
Hidin it, should be dividin it
It's real tight now but I got a way to widen it
And slide in it, real smooth like
With a little bit of Miles Davis to get you in the mood like
Zoom boom hit the poom-poom right
Just to get your groove right
I can make it happen, but it can't happen if you ain't good at it
When you gon' let a nigga have a look at it?
Callin all cars, yeah baby girl you a star
But it's on you if you wanna go real far
Now let me get a glimpse, one for the pimps
I, have one question, answer me this

[Hook]

[Hook - Pharrell Williams] (Keyshia Cole)
Pass it, pass it - get it girl
Pass it, pass it - get it girl
Please don't be greedy! nooo!
Pass it, pass it - get it girl
Breathe it in! Now let go!
(La la la la la la la la la)
Breathe it in! Now let go!
(La la la la la la la la la)

[Verse - Snoop Dogg]
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Lay back hypnotized by The Neptunes sound
My peoples always see me and they think I'm on point
So they roll me a blunt, or either pass me a joint
I'm the modern day Rick James, yeah that's me
Anything less than the best is blasphemy
So ask for me - when you wanna get spliffted
I'm not Keith Murray but I'll Get Ya Lifted
Terrific, cause this is just the linguistics
This shit's cannibalistic, so I mixed it and twisted
With the berries and cherries, the high berries
The aura is horror, man this shit is so scary!
I took another hit and then my vision got blurry
I had to pass this shit in a motherfucking hurry
I'm looking at this chick, real thick, her name is Cheri
Big fat booty and her pootie was hairy, c'mon biatch!

[Hook]

[Verse - Snoop Dogg]
Nick nack patty wack, give a Dogg a bone
Naw don't gimme nothing but a handful of stones
Don't stop! I ain't finised yet
You say you got the bomb? You wanna make a bet? it's on!
I blew about three zones then took baby home
Nigga what?! Motherfucker I'm grown
I have it how I want it, did it done it and stunted
Fronted a hundred to my nigga cause he want to get blunted
Ain't nothing to it, but to do it so I did it cause I'm wit it
This is the Face Off, the one hitter quitter
It'll lay you on your back fast, sweat start to trickle
Everything is moving like you on a tricycle
You caught up in the pickle but I get you out
I blow you a charge through your nose, not your mouth
Slow down! ho damn! you're doing too much
You're supposed to take two puffs then give the shit up, c'mon!

[Hook]

[Verse - Snoop Dogg]
Yeah this is classic, fantastic, I'm blasted
I've been growing and blowing, niggas wonder how I lasted
Well, like Jesus I fasted, for 40 days and 40 nights
I got it all mastered
Now I need a hit of that, Neptune-ology
Gangsta philosophy, yep yep I gotta be
Real high, whenever writing my novelty
Because it adds to my celebrity
So I celebrated, teledated, innovated, dominated
Orchestrated, situated, petuated, reinstated
Then I created, you're happy that I made it
Take another hit, young nigga get faded
We're going all out, smoke till ya fall out
D-O double G House all in ya mouth
The West got the best, the East got the peace
I'm out and about with a blunt in my mouth, peace!

All my bitches let me hear you say

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake, Charlie Wilson & Snoop Dogg]
I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, and I don't see no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign? (Oh)
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone  (Ooh wee)
Nigga you ain't no G!
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll, you ain't no G!

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
It's legit, you know it's a hit
When The Neptunes and the Doggy Dogg fin to spit
You know he's in - tune with the season
Come here baby, tell me why you leaving?
Tell me if it's weed that you need
If you wanna breathe, I got the best weed minus seeds
Ain't nobody tripping, VIP they can't get in
If something go wrong then you know we get to Cripping

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake + Snoop Dogg]
I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, and I don't see no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign?
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone (Oh, oh, yeah!)
Nigga you ain't no G!
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
(Do-do-do-do-do-do) You ain't no G!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg with Justin Timberlake]
Now you stepping with a G, from Los Angeles
Where the helicopters got cameras
Just to get a glimpse of our Chucks
And our Khakis and our bouncing cars
You wit you friend right? (Yeah!)
She ain't trying to bring over no men right? (No!)
Shit, she ain't gotta be in the distance
She could get high all in an instant

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake + Snoop Dogg]
I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, and I don't see no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign?
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone (Oh, oh, yeah!)
Nigga you ain't no G!
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
(Do-do-do-do-do-do) You ain't no G!

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Mami, mamacita, have you ever flown on G5s
From London to Ibiza? You gotta have cake to
You'll have Sunday's with chiquitas
You'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena
And I can take you

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson + Justin Timberlake]
(Uncle Charlie, preach)
Nigga don't be young and foolish
You don't know what you're doing
You don't know what you've lost until she's gone (til she's gone)
She got a pretty face, drove you wild
But you ain't have that Snoop Doggy Dogg Style

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake, Charlie Wilson & Snoop Dogg]
I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, and I don't see no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign? (Oh)
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone  (Ooh wee)
Nigga you ain't no G!
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll, you ain't no G! (Hey! Haha!)

[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
Ooh wee!! Heeeeeee, hey!
Ooh wee!! Heeeeeee, hey!

[Intro]
Another dirty nine-inch dick classic, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, as I sit here thinkin' to myself
There is no one for you but me and I mean that
And I think about all the things we been through
Like arguin' and fightin', for example
You know, the love we have for each other
It tends to outweigh what we do to one another
You know, my granddaddy used to always say
You know, he used to sing it like this

[Chorus]
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe

[Verse 1]
What up, motherfuckers? This is Snoop Dogg
I'm tryin' to figure out how the fuck I'ma do y'all
Hangin' with my homie from the turf, that's young Q-Ball
Givin' me the word on the streets, here's the scoop, y'all
The niggas from Tha Eastsidaz split up (Split up)
And one of 'em tried to fuck your shit up (What?)
Nah cuz, don't believe that, that's my nigga for life
I'm out with the bullshit, I'm in with the real shit
I'm at the church doing work, spittin' game from the pulpit
Now that's the business, and God as my witness
LBC, 213, hell yeah, we in this
It's so relentless and all my dogs up against the life sentence
I love y'all like I love no bitch and that's real shit
On some Crip shit, homie, dig this

[Chorus]
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe

[Verse 2]
I used to have a lot of broads that I don't fool with
I used to have a lot of homeboys I ain't cool with
A lot of people that a nigga went to school with
Happy as hell to see the big dog doin' it
But wouldn't none of them believe it though (What?)
That I would be bigger than Kurtis Blow
I guess he was right, these are the breaks
Despite my mistakes and aches, I'm getting cake
To realize your fate through faith
'Cause we all gon' get that day (For what?)
To see if our life was straight
And see if we'll be able to walk through the pearly gates (Yeah?)
To see the man upstairs
On some real talk, homie, I'm tired of bein' stuck here
If I could, I would fly to the moon (Zoom)
Y'all probably think I'm trippin' off these mushrooms, I know

[Chorus]
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe

[Outro]
Now, as I think back to the words my granddaddy used to say
I never seen him in church, but he always had the word
He always would tell me, "Sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad
You got to do bad in order to do good"

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah man what's going on man it's really really pimpin' up in here man
I know you ain't seen pimpin' in a long time man, I've been MIA
You know what I'm sayin' missin' in action
I ain't been on no milk carton box
But I've been milking and boxing these bitches
Cause they got to step they game up, you know what I mean?

[Hook: Snoop Dogg (Lil Jon)]

Potato chip yup with a French dip
Say she wanna French kiss all on my diznick
It's cool, go on and break fool if you have to
What which you won't do bitch I'mma slap you
Stay in line ho it's a pimp affair
If you down to get low I can take you there
But you can't fake once you hit the gate
Shake till it ache, work that birthday cake
You say you wanna make it ho (make it)
Well quit bullshittin' and get naked ho
Now you always got to be hot and vicious
So move them biscuits and hit them tricks, bitch
Now you got about a minute to fix this
Cuz I'm trying to find a bitch that's bootylicious

[Hook: Snoop Dogg (Lil Jon)]

[Verse 3: Trina]
P-U-S-S-Y, run a world, I'm the girl in the flesh, ah
Lookin' for a nigga that will suck me like a blow pop
Run that dick to the door, do me baby don't stop
Same nigga talkin' all that shit
Just a little bitch, little balls, little dick
Let me show you how to work your tongue like a hurricane
We ain't here to play no games, baby give me everything
I know you like me when I drop it down low
Show it from the back, look back, let it roll
Drop it to the floor like a G bitch supposed to
Shake it shake it shake it make a nigga go postal
But that's for fucking with a Miami girl
Get your man, take his money, and then buy the world
So nigga don't front, cuz fat wallets and big dicks is all I want

[Hook: Snoop Dogg (Lil Jon)]
What you lookin' at? (step yo game up!)
What you waitin' for? (step yo game up!)

Creep Dogg, I know you trippin' (I feel you) Ya heard me? (um-hm)

[murmur] We just sittin' up in here droppin' game about these motherfuckin'...HOS
(HOS?!) That's right, hoes, and that what the topic is today on the show: hoes
(Why you always gotta talk about 'em?) I mean, cause if you gotta blame it on somebody
You might as well blame it on a motherfuckin ho....

[beat kicks in]

You feel me, Meech
(Now that I think about it...) It was all on a motherfuckin' ho
(Ya heard me?) That the topic today: Hoes
Live here, Snoop Dogg, and uh..what I'm gonna do right here

[inhales] besides smokin' this weed...I'm a holla at 'chy'all...
It was all on a ho, in one minute or two it, too
Cause I know I got it like that...y'knahmsayin?
It was all on a ho (Ho, ho, ho)

["Now that I think about it?" echoes]
Shiit, niggas straight feelin' like Bobby Womack
Is in this motherfucker tonight...y'knahmsayin?
That's the way I feel about 'cha...hm hm..it was all on a ho...
But uh...it's Nineteen-motherfuckin'-Ninety Eight
And I believe today is uh...October 31st, if I ain't...wrong...right, nigga?
Yeah, yeah there, so uh... as they say in Halloween world or...
White world or just a world, in general: Trick or Treat, bitch (Ha ha!)
Ya feel me? (Ya heard me?) We puttin' this Space-Age pimpin'
Full ?Fledge? pimpin' right here...y'know?
Right now, bitch can't even look at me
Bitch you under arrest for "Reckless Eyeballs"
We just doin' this real P-Im right about now, ya feel me?
(That's it...that's it...) Because...I mean, I got a big grip...a BIG, BIG memory, cuz
I remember a whole lot of bitches didn't wanna give no nigga no title "Playa"
Bitches wouldn't even look at me, y'knahmsayin? (Yeah you!)
They just want a nigga to bust a rap about 'em, y'know (Yeah you!)
Buy 'em sometin' to eat from...IHOP, y'know
Go get 'em a Big Mac value pack or sumthin'...
But uh...I'm a tell you what I really remember the most about these bitches, cuz
(What chu remember, dawg?)

[Snoop raps]
I remember Rachel, Tina, Lisa, and Grace
Cause every single one of them had a special place in my heart
From the start, see I was just a young puppy
A young dummy, panties, bitches to fuck with me
Now that I grew up and blew up, I look back
And thanked 

[thought] on these hoes, they straight to' up, know what?
I'm in effect for the nine-eight
See now I'm scared of love, like my homeboy Nate
And I don't wanna hurt no mo'...so...
I rather go to the Mo' with a ho and leave my rubber on the flo' (What?!)
And call my nigga, Sean Dizzay
To come scoop me up in the cut, Dogg, nigga, what, chy'all? (What, what, what)
Ain't knowin? Pimpin' and ho-in'
Keep the grass growin', "Nigga, where you goin'?"
Look here bitch, don't ask me shit
Did I interupt you while 

[*slurping noises*] you was sucking my dick, beyotch?
I don't need the stress, besides talkin' back to a pimp would get yo ass slapped
Respect the GAME (GAME), and I promise you the game gon' do the motherfuckin' same
I learned a whole lot from these bitches of my past
A bitch with no class is worse than a bitch with no ass
And you wonder why I'm from The Pound?
Shiiiit, if a bitch can't swim, nigga, she bound to drown, nigga
Hook: 

[with echoing "Now that I think about it"]
It was all on a ho, what chu trippin' fo', nigga?
It was all on a ho, Gs' up, hoes down, what chu trippin' fo'? (What chu trippin' for'?)

Now she feelin' freaky, and wanna braid my hair
So I sit back, relax, and let her twist
And put my head back on a pound of fish ?????
(Wait a minute!) Wait a minute! Let me hit it!
"Nah! I ain't even trippin' let me get some head in the kitchen
And keep dippin'", Then I looked in the living room and
See my nigga Sean Dogg bitch straight trippin'
So, you know what's next..(What up?)..no sex!
Pull out cha dick and bust a nut on her dress, (Say what?) (Word!)
Like Billy Clinton, we representin'
For all you women, bitches, keep swimmin'
We never save 'em and that's on The Pound
Cause if the bitch can't swim, she bound to drown, nigga

"Now that I think about it", and "hoooooooooooo" til fade]

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Goldie Loc, remember this last year
All them bitches wanting their bills paid
And was calling niggas scrubs and shit
Yeah, we let it slide all for the 9-9 but for the R2G
You know we got to come back on these hoes my nigga...
(For real, for real) That's real
Do it DPGC Dogghouse Style... Eastside up, check this out baby

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
When I wake up in the morning
You give me breakfast in my bed
And when I need a little loving
You know you're quick to give me head

[Verse 1: Goldie Loc]
I woke up, gave it a good scratch
Call my nigga so I can see what's next
Big movie cracking, Goldie Loc slack-a-lackin'
Bump head in the morning had a nigga crack-a-lackin
So I call my nigga Clean Right
I know he gon' have some bomb hoes tonight
But I got to get this work done, don't trip, the Loc is on one
Watch me get this cake and break bread with my little son
He tried a piece of the money that I was making
Tripping on my tricks now watch how they behaving
Sit down, jump, walk...
Now shake the park when the shit get dark
'Cause that's the one that be bomb as this and that
Don't get mad when I call my little bitch a hoodrat
(Snoop Dogg: You know what? Kiss me and I'll kiss you back)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
It's 6 AM, she won't pay him
But she will pay me, OG, ba-by
They be on bullshit most of the time
Hosted and fine, anxious like Ginuwine
I ain't got time to be messing around
Let's hit the hotel and straight put it down
You do me and I do you back
That's how a pimp player do it like that
I met you at the club so it couldn't be love
Come to find out you the motherfucking scrub, on the dub
And now you wanna get in my tub and get a back scrub
From Snoop D-O-dub? Ha ha
Hold on, put your clothes on
Bitch, you ain't bout to get your doughs on
Go in the kitchen and hook me up something to eat
And put the TV on BET
Crack the blinds and toss me a LA Times
And roll one of them dimes
And make sure the radio work
And get me some orange juice with the ice in the cup
I know I'm demanding
But I'm a motherfucking pimp and I don't give a fuck
And when I wake up in the morning, bitch you know what's up

[Hook]

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
You're the sweetest hoe I know
And I'll never let you go (I'll never let you go)
Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo
You gon' be my back up hoe (Ha ha, ha ha)
Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo
You gon' be my back up hoe
Back me up, back me up

[Intro: DJ EZ Dicc]
Smoking a fat sack, right here on the station that plays
Only platinum hits, W Ballz
My dicks in your ear, caller you wanna say what?
Hello? Hello? Caller?
Oh the hell with it
This is something new for the underground
In the L.B... See you when I get back
Dedicated to the East Side, Two One Street
My favorite and your favorite
Snoop Froggy Dogg and somebody new Tha Dogg Pound
Check it out right here on the station that plays only platinum hits
187.4 on your FM dial
We be taking caller number 21 for those Janet Jackson tickets
So call in, 310-D.A.P.O.U.N.D
That's 310-P.O.U.N.D. bitch
That's Da Pound

[Snoop]
Hear ye, hear ye, come one come all
It's the first annual G-nic and all my Doggs
Are invited, so go on and light it
Cause it's the first time in a long time (right)
Reminiscing about the Fresh Fest back in '85
When the dubs and the San Dieg's used to hoo ride
On motherfuckers like it was the thing to do
Eighty-five, eighty-fo', eight-three, and year eighty-two (eighty-two)
You know what the fuck I'm talking about
After party on the lake at the big homie's house
And bet nobody bring a motherfucking gun
Cause everybody in the house's from two-one...

[Tray Deee]
Twenty-first street, burst street, where it all started
And you know East Side, Long Beach, the hardest
Niggas coming realer than The Real McCoy
So step with your rap and we bring the noise
It's the gang of fly bitches, homiez on the switches
Dice in the back if ya wanna get your riches
No snitches allowed inside the crowd
Cause this is the G thang, East Side L.B.C. brang
Finna have some fun represent two-one
And bet nobody bring a mothafucking gun and a...

[Snoop]
Yeah, King Park was the location
And to be a G, that was my destination
(We were) lookin' up to niggas coming up before me
And L.B.C. into my East Side homies..... (It's like)

[Chorus]
Nobody can see you, but you (yeah, the East Side's perfect)
Nobody can see you, but you (ha ha, now that's worth it)
Nobody can see you, but you (hell yeah, the East Side's perfect)
Nobody can see you, but you (ha ha, yeah, now that's worth it)

Tatataratatatara...

[Snoop (Tray Deee)]
If ya bring a strap, then ya have to trip
(so if you're on a mission nigga, go on and dip)
We got meat to eat, (freaks to meet)
And chronic we can smoke on, (and forever get a loc on)
Strolling through the Park one day
Puffing on a fat ass J, with my homie named Tray
Deee tryin' to see if we could put this LBC thing
Back together like it was supposed to see

[Tray Deee]
Cause ya know I'm down with ya, to make 'em get the picture
And if I have to sit ya, down then I spit ya
Game from the heart, I came from the start
See I was regulating, when Cragars was the Daytons

[Snoop]
Nigga let me interact with my black croaker sacks*
And a gray golf hat tilted to the back (what's up?)
Ditchin' Sunday school to get a pack of Now and Laters
While I'm rolling with the Steelers and killin' with the raiders

[Tray Deee]
And when we bang with the Saints then we ain't no joke
Come around from outta bounds and we goes for broke

[Snoop]
Now we're breaking 'em up (hmm hmm), shaking em up (yeah)
And just for a second we're waking 'em up
(continue) Giving up game on this tight ass beat
With a small dedication, to two-one street

[Chorus: L.T. Hutton]
If I didn't have no dough
Would you love me?
If we didn't have a place to go
Would you still be there?
Or would you leave me alone
When the chips are down?
Or would you stay around
And be down, oh girl
I gotta have a chick like you
I gotta have a girl like you
I gotta have a chick like you
I gotta have a girl like you

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Eh..eh, eh, eh
Hey little Unc, who that is standing there like that?
Lookin' from the front, but I can see what's in the back
Hips like (Oh!), thighs like (Oh!)
Pretty toes in a row and they be lookin' like (Oh!)

[Verse 2: Snoop]
I don't know nephew, let's just do what we do
Let's just slide up on these hoes and put this pimpin' to use (Agreed!)
And then what we do (What we do?)
You take the one in the white, I take the one in the blue
Preach!

[Hook: L.T. Hutton]
If I didn't have no dough, would you love meeee? (Would you love me, girl?)
If we didn't have a place to go, would you still be therrrre? (Would you still be there?)
Or would you leave me alone, when the chips are dowwwn? (when the chips are down)
Or would you stay around, (oh, oh) and beeee down
Oh girl! (Oh!)
I gotta have a chick like you (I gotta, I gotta)
I gotta have a girl like you (I like this part)
I gotta have a chick like you (Make a nigga clap to this)
I gotta have a girl like you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Snoop]
Ay yo, I don't know if you been told
But, you look like you should be gold
You're so precious, the way you shape up
I'm just here to help you step ya game up

[Verse 4: Nelly]
You look like you might ride for me (you know)
Hop in front of the bullet and die for me
Cause when I fly, you be fly, you'll be fly wit me
And when I fly to other countries, you gone fly wit me
Come on

[Hook: L.T. Hutton]
If I didn't have no dough, would you love meeee? (Would you love me, girl?)
If we didn't have a place to go, would you still be therrrre? (Would you still be there?)
Or would you leave me alone, when the chips are dowwwn? (when the chips are down)
Or would you stay around, (oh, oh) and beeee down
Oh girl! (Oh!)
I gotta have a chick like you (I gotta, I gotta)
I gotta have a girl like you (I like this part)
I gotta have a chick like you (Make a nigga clap to this)
I gotta have a girl like you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 5: Snoop]
Now once the night wounds down, and the weed gets low
Players still playin', and I'm still on a float
I groove to the beat, 'til my feet get tired
I just want to be your desire
Eva Knieva, best believe-a
Your not a dime piece, your a diva
Take it from me you can be the, O-N-E
If you roll wit me

[Verse 6: Nelly]
Now if looks was the case, baby girl'll be federal
The top half - incredible, the bottom half - edible (huh)
I ain't telling you what I heard, mayne I'm telling you what I know
And I ain't telling her where to stay, or where to go
And, if she, want me, we'll take a trip down, wit the homie
The D-O-double-G
And if I'm lonely, jump from a lil' town
And it's low-key, and guess who wear the crown (Whoo!)

[Hook: L.T. Hutton]
If I didn't have no dough, would you love meeee? (Would you love me, girl?)
If we didn't have a place to go, would you still be therrrre? (Would you still be there?)
Or would you leave me alone, when the chips are dowwwn? (when the chips are down)
Or would you stay around, (oh, oh) and beeee down

And if ya came to party wit the D-O-double-G, and the N-E-double-L-Y band

[Minister]
Say man ay ushers, deacons, lock the do'

[Singers - repeat in background of Intro w/ ad libs]
{I love, to give you light)

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Geah, first of all
Givin honor to God, and all the ministers on the pulpits
Ushers, deacons, and my lovely choir
They sound so beautiful, don't you agree?
Sing it sister..
Yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all inside this R&G
Rhythm & Gangsta: The Masterpiece
Such a, heavenly experience
Alchemist, break it down for me nephew
Let me preach to 'em one time, chuuch

[Snoop Dogg]
In the beginning as a child I was chosen
Though not knowin the reason while still my eyes opened
Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog
Love was given to all, outside livin the ball
As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message
To reach teachin the masses, I wrote my first passage
It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap
I'm young, livin in the city of jackers and gangbangin
And dope dealin, cold feelin to be a product of niggas around you
Once you get on top they down you
But the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin
I found myself grindin on the streets quite often
With a blue rag, bangin the dub, fo'-fifth coffin
At the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the Eastside
Where most of the big homies had a Glock and flossed the G-ride
Niggas throwin up hands but it wasn't no peace signs
Never fo' a second did I think to let my light shine
Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messin up
Disrespectin my home, not carin 'bout what moms what sayin
And then I found out that mom wasn't playin
Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn't understand
Get my life right, step it up, nigga be a man
Never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with
Through the stripes still gotta shine my light
I've grown, to comprehend the game; my name is Big Snoop Boss Dogg
Just a block and a phone call away
I've reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist
I'm preachin just what I practice
To each and all, I got a word from the Beach to acros the globe
Man woman young and old
Don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite
Many circumstances Doggy gon' shine my light cause I love you

[Singers - repeat in background of Outro w/ ad libs]
{I love, to give you light)

[Outro: Minister]
And the people that is locked up, locked down
And the people that's locked dowwwwwn
Also God, should purchase the new, Escalade
On 24's, with the spinnin thangs, ha ha
I need you to, right now, look at your neighbors
Cause a lot of y'all think y'all goin to heaven huh
And you ain't gon' go!
So I need you right now to, look at your neighbor
And say neighbor, say NEIGH-BOR, YOU AIN'T GOIN!!
YOU AIN'T GOIN!!

[Snoop Dogg - talking]
Oh, yabba dabba doo bobble
This is somethin new
Puff, puff, pass and the Bo$$
I mean what do you mean, what do you mean
This is only the beginnin (Doggystyle, Bad Boy)

[Snoop Dogg]
It's a quarter past one, but it feel like two
Ey young Puff, what you want your big homey ta do?
Just say the word and his head spat out all over the curb
It ain't nothin to a playa, it's like rollin some herb
Click, clack on you fags, now I'm back in the burbs
I'm ready to splurge, about to put you niggas in perms
The first and the third, is the day that I usually reserve
To get this money with my niggas that bird the birds
Word to curb, my nigga you can fuck what you heard
You niggas talk shit, pop that bitch, now swerve (take that)
Yeah, I'm a Dogg Pound gangsta for life
I'm twice as night, yep and I dump on sight
Get through with ya'll as I catch my flight
I got a show I gotta do out in Miami tonight
With some Colombian friends of mine
Maybe we'll spend some time
Choppin up some million dollar shit up outta crime a mine

[Snoop Dogg - Hook] - 2X
And you don't quit
Ride to the rhythm of some gangsta shit
And you don't stop
(*two gun shots*) Pop Pop nigga what? nigga huh?

[Loon]
Uh, yeah, Loon
Niggas act like niggas ain't clap at nigga before
Like Loon never punch nigga in the jaw
Nigga quick to pop shit, never been in a war
Nigga get on my hot chick, start bendin the law
He the same chump nigga, used to send to the store
Ran off with twenty dollars, now don't send him no more
He them grimey ass niggas with the scent of a whore
Tryin a scheme on a nigga, that's clean
Think I'm gonna scream, but a...
Loon on some green nigga Infrared beam, malign nigga, spleen know what I mean
It's not a thing now (that's right)
Do what I say, leave you by the lake, put two in your face (uh huh)
With shit I couldn't do around Mase
You better check my forte, Loon got all yay
On Broadway they givin nigga royal all day
I ran through the game like Christian Fauria
How can the chicks ignore me, when the chicks adore me

[P. Diddy]
Come on now

[Hook]

[P. Diddy - talking behind Hook]
That's right
C'mon, yeah
Let's ride

[Snoop Dogg]
Shoot 'em up bang bang, yeah it's a cold thang
Diddy want Doggy to get in my baby body man
Get 'im got 'im man, tryin a feel up his body man
With a lot of thangs (fuck the nigga ohhh, *gun shots*)
A matter fact he gettin potty trained
Livin with his momma man
Stressed and pain, no gain
No fame, for a nigga like the D-O
Put a couple holes in your loud mouth zero

If you step to us, you'll get fucked up quick
We keep a Tek with us, that we bustin bitch
Niggas be talkin shit, but they be walkin quick
(P Diddy: This Doggystyle, Bad Boy bitch)
When I pull out my nine and pop two times
When you see my clique in this bitch we kickin it
Dogg's be rippin this
Slip a clip in it, flip the script and then
I'm the rap nigga bangin that (CRIP)

[Hook] - 6X - w/ ad libs

[Snoop Dogg - talking behind Hook - w/ variations]
Ride, ride ya'll

Bad Boy II

Ride on a nigga, like bang on a nigga - repeated until end

[Intro: Kurupt & (Snoop)]
Back by popular demand
Dogg Pound Gangstaville (DPG)
Where all the real G's at? (DPG)
Where the OG's at? (DPG)

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
A bitch is a bitch, whether she poor or rich
She still eatin' a gang of dicks
It don't matter what you do or say
'Cause bitch you can't change my feelings no way
I been across the whole U.S.A
Same ol' hoes on different days
Just ask my big homeboy Snoop de Snoop
Bitch you ain't cute, with all that (woop de woop)
I might just rock ya, I ain't afraid to blast
I might rock a fella like Damon Dash
Grip the heater and slap your ass
Cock it back, automatic clap your ass
Now this is how a gangster mash out
The homies in the Coupe, me and Snoop in the glass house
Bouncin (bouncin) bouncin (swervin)
Blaze up a whole ounce and get to rammin' with the cocked cannon

[Hook: Snoop & (Kurupt)]
Yeah, and all my niggas say... ride, ride on
Yeah, and all the homies say... ride on
Yeah, and all the bitches say... ride on
Yeah, and all the riders say... ride on (Don't get caught up)
Yeah, and all my niggas say... ride, ride on
Yeah, and all the homies say... ride on
Yeah, and all the bitches say... ride on out

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm out to paper count the paper, bump some bitches and move
I take a trip with my click on a three day cruise
Bank a corner in the fo', sittin' low, gettin' low
Now we headed to the sto' in the fo', hoes holler
Top dollar with the gold flea collar
Dippin in my blue Impala
They say Snoop Dogg is a fool
'Cause he got the bitches and the little homie sellin' weed up outta high school
I never ever break the law, I just bend it
Keep everything splendid, that's how I intended
Class is in session, you might get suspended (shhhh)
If you don't shut the fuck up and listen for a minute
I been in it for life, with two kids and a wife
With no tattoos, just stress and stripes
So, I'mma do what I feel and do what I like
But I won't go to sleep without my heater at night (Ride on)

[Hook: Snoop & (Kurupt)]
Yeah, and all my niggas say... ride, ride on
Yeah, and all the homies say... ride on
Yeah, and all the bitches say... ride on
Yeah, and all the riders say... ride on (Don't get caught up)
Yeah, and all my niggas say... ride, ride on
Yeah, and all the homies say... ride on

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Nigga, gimme everything you got
From your hat to your contacts, T-shirt to your socks
Dogg Pound affiliate? Hell naw, nigga
I'm certified branded—see the paw, nigga?
Mash in gray and blue all day
All night, all heated with heaters, Mac-11's, nine millimeters
What up, Big Nate?
I got a bitch that gobble up dicks like steak
She lives upstate, and I don't think
Nann one of those bitches is proper, stash the chopper
DPology (DPG) but first call Snoop
What up, big homey? Niggas with the swoop
The homie jumps in, whips out the four pound
When we get there, we shakin all motherfucker down
It's what I had in mind, let's get paid
Hit the spot just like a raid, one of the homies got a gauge
Come on

[Hook: Snoop & (Kurupt)]
Yeah, and all my niggas say... ride, ride on (Certified)
Yeah, and all the homies say... ride on
Yeah, and all the bitches say... ride on

Yeah, and all the homies say... ride on
Yeah, and all the bitches say... ride on out

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg]
Let me holler at y'all for a minute, man
I mean this game is gettin' real deep
We got niggas that be misrepresentin'
I mean, motherfuckers, you know, thinkin the DPG
Is a motherfuckin football game or a football team or somethin
Niggas walkin on and shit like they free agents
And just leavin when they want to
Nigga, this ain't no game, this is a motherfuckin way of life
DPGC, Dogg Pound Gangsta... nigga!
The fuck wrong with these niggas, man?
Niggas be straight tryin to put they little twist down (holla at em)
But you know we tryin to stay two steps ahead of the game baby, y'know?
Let me holler at y'all for a minute, especially YOU

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
You done stepped in some Dogg Shit, check your shoes
Nigga, this ain't Hollywood, the House of Blues
It's the Dogg House, so regroup your troops
And tell em... it's Kurupt and Snoop
Fuck your crew, it's on, I take your Brougham
It's Don Corleone in the chronic zone
I turn your dubs into nickels, while I'm chillin
I melt your rhymes into icicles, while I'm killin
Sell em, I tell em, Kurupt, West up
I know you feel like, givin it up
We can't stop, won't stop, what foe
Cause every other day another nigga tryin to pull a dulo
You know, when I was fuckin with the hood
It was all bad, thought it was all good
A nigga had to take a breather
Now I'm Living Single, like Khadijah, 'cause they'll squeeze ya
Fuck a feeding fish
I put my dick in your bitch and make a wish, ha ha
Nigga, that's gangsta shit, with the gangsta twist
Yeah, Dogg Pound Gangsta...

[Intro]
*helicopter flying overhead*
This is Angela Sanders coming to you live
From the scene of yet another murder mystery
It seems that entertainer Snoop Doggy Dogg has been murdered
We have no information at this time
Bueno, estamos aquí y parece que mataron a Snoop Doggy Dogg, y no sé que pasó, pero, hay mucha gente y hay mucha sangre
*lightning cracks*
*helicopter passes by again*

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
As I look up, at the sky
My mind starts trippin, a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shakin, and they breakin, tryin to save the Dogg
Pumpin on my chest and I'm screamin
I stop breathin, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can ya save me
I can't die my Boo-Boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for prayin, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started sayin
"Bring your lifestyle to me I'll make it better"
And how long will I live?
"Eternal life and forever"
And will I be, the G that I was?
"I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son"
My eyes are closed

[Hook (x4)]
Murder... "murder was the case that they gave me"

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get, fronted some keys, to get, back on my feet
And everything that nigga said, came to reality
Livin like a baller, loc
I'm havin money, and blowin hella chronic smoke
I bought my momma a Benz, my Boo-Boo a Jag
And now I'm rollin in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
"Just remember who changed your mind
Cuz when you start set-trippin, that ass is mine"
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cause my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe (check it out)

[Break]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the lord, my soul to take

[Hook (x2)]
Murder was the case that they gave me
"Murder was the case that they gave me"

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rollin on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with a izz-L, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad doggin niggas cuz I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scrapin on the floor
Niggas gettin they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo, he took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it, to see twenty-two
I put that on my momma, I'mma ride for you Baby Boo

[Hook (x4)]
Murder... "murder was the case that they gave me"

Switch!

10-20-71, the day I come out
Two days later, I'm runnin' my mouth
Mom's put a bottle to my grill
I look her in the face and I say chill
So she puts her back up on a pillow, uh huh
Two minutes later I'm bailin' out the hoes-pital
On my way to the liquor store
First thing I grab is some skins and a 4-0
Dropped the O-E cause it's just too cold
Get myself some gin instead and then I stroll
But before I get out the door
The man behind the counter says hey, yo, yo
He picks me up and sit me on the seat
And then he grabbed the phone and get to dialin' the police
I wanna run but I can't walk yet
Can't grapple nothin' said, cause I can't talk yet
First trip in the police car
Cameras all around me as if I was a star
Mom's grabbed me, hugged me, and kissed me
This fool tried to twist me, mom's say she missed me (I missed you)
Re-group it, swoopin' in the coupe and
That's what I'mma name you cause boy you be snoopin'
Soon to be hoopin' hoes I be scoopin'
First piece of ass before I got my first whoopin'
Cookin', bookin', hookin' up with G's
Twenty days later I'm from R-T-C
Doin' it up, rollin', givin' it up
Sellin' candy for a white boy outta light blue truck
And I'm comin' up, that's right, niggas runnin' up
Havin' fun and stuff
You niggas don't want none of us

[Snoop talking]
What's up homie (What's up cuz, where you from)
My name Snoop Dogg (Where you from though)
Eastside, rollin' twenty crip (What)
(Oh) yeah (OK, it's all good cuz) That's what I'm talkin' bout

[Hook]
Motherfucking dogg (Named Snoop) that's right (SNOOP!)

Motherfucking dogg (Named Snoop) roll, roll with me

[Snoop Dogg]
Roll with me, S-N-double O-P

Tell me, the game'll never fail me
Ask J or my lil' homie Shelby
Uh, I cut em' up like Marcus Welby
This is the dopest G, that you'll ever see
There'll never be, another me
By the grace of God, ya lovin' me
Pause, do it to em' dogg
Now drop a rock on em' dogg
Now put a lock on em' dogg
Rollin' down the river spinnin' on a log
Jog to the liquor store, grab me a thicker ho
Get me a Michelob, now I wanna Snicker though
Remind me of the old days
When my mama used to bang the O'Jays
Family reunion, ha ha, hey 8-track style
Mel-Man you a fool for this cuz
Cause I'm the motherfucking dogg, named Snoop

[2Pac]
Nigga you young! {Echoes}

[Nate Dogg]
No one does it better! {Echoes}

[Chorus 2X: Nate Dogg]
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Break out the weed and the drank and chill out and get high
It's 1 A.M. and the crowd is still live
Relax to the groove, I mean, just move with ya boy
Got shit poppin' like always, you know, so enjoy
Go make yourself at home, got big meat on the grill
Ladies and homies all in the mix, it's time to chill
Sha-La-La brought the orange, with the zags and the blunts
Roll up some Bob Marley joints of some skunk, Daz with Thai
And Nate got a hundred piece
So we piece up properly on the O.Z
We in the zone bombed out feelin' good, ya know
Got the homegirls and homies from the hood, ya know
2-1, 1-9, 2-0, we all in the house
And it's a Long Beach thang where I was born and hung out
To all my players and hustlers and gangbangers, listen up
It's about time I kick a rhyme to fuck shit up
Now who throws shit?

[Chorus 2X: Nate Dogg]
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg]
Now do the gangstas run this motherfucka? (Hell Yeah!)
Or do the ladies run this motherfucka? (Hell Yeah!)

[Chorus 4X: Nate Dogg]
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now the party is bumpin', thumpin' back to back
And Daz on the turntables puttin' down a scratch (HA!)
I'm on the mic so I'mma bust me a rap
And I'mma dedicate this one to a pack of hoodrats
The Dogg Pound nation, locs and big posse
These is the peoples I see rockin' the party
Make a nigga wanna poplock on the flo'
And do the Boogaloo Shrimp and pimp the ho
I got to owe 'em my life cuz I'm a O.G
I got the love in the hood cuz I'm the big homie
I got the skills when it comes to rockin rhymes
So put your hands up to the sky, get yours, I got mines
Now everything is live, don't you agree?
And if you do, then keep on groovin' with that nigga D-O-double-G
We ridin' with the hat to the side of the ride
Y'all know how we do on the Eastside
You see the thing is we like to keep it harder
And we real party people just like Afrika Bambaataa
What do you want? Matter fact, what do you need?
Cuz we keep it all on point from the drank to the joint
So pass the bottle, ain't no need to squabble
And hand it to the little homie, let him have a swallow
It's a Eastside thang, nigga, bring yo ass
G's up Ho's down, nigga, you know the program

[Chorus 2X: Nate Dogg]
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
(What you watchin' the clock for?) The clock tickin'
But it won't stop kickin' cuz everybody kickin' it
And gettin at the bitches, which is, the main thing gangstas do
Skip the bump cuz the rump's what I came to view
New pussy in the hood, shall I kill it? (Kill It!)
The way she got it poppin, no, it's probably hotter than a skillet
But baby don't tweak, like you ain't no freak, peep
I keep my game tight, it ain't no leaks
So we can keep this on the down low
And take a walk with the Dogg and lemme show you what the pound for
Candlelight and romancin'
If I can just get the last dance in at the mansion

[Chorus 5X: Nate Dogg]
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better

[The Ladies]
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better
Man I had a crazy crazy dream dogg
I had a dream I was in the NBA straight playin basketball
NBA straight getting my ball on dogg
Can you imagine?
Snoop Dogg in the NBA?
Imagine that, Hoop Doggy Dogg
Yea straight ballin
You know I'm a ball anyway so why not
Let me get my ball on

If I could play in the NBA
I would be that six-four all day shootin that trey
I dribbled to the outside and passed it to Shaq
They double teamed on him so he passed it back
Look at the 3 but I don't take the shot
Cause I think I'm cold and I ain't trying to get hot
I'm feelin bionic, we playing the Sonics
And I'm sticking Gary Payton so you know I'm ball hatin
Bang on Vin Baker cause real Lakers really don't care yea yea
Next stop in the court on Damon toast Stouda and my homeboy J.R. Rider
Minnesota Timberwolves, we cut 'em down
Hakeem Olajuwon and Scottie Pippen, we shut 'em down
The Twin Towers, Dave and Duncan
20 in the paint fool you get's nothing
On a four game roll sweep, beep beep
We beat the Bulls and we rocked the Heat
And we traded for a few players, some Pacers
Miller and Mullin and now they Lakers
We can't be beat now, we on a 27 game win streak now, bow wow
When it all started from a dream
I'm playin point guard on my favorite team (Lakers)
I got the big perm, doing interviews with Chick Herm
At Stu Lance, we do a dance
When it rains poppin shampane
Basketball yes yall thats the game
Two years ago a friend of mine
Ask me to glide from the free throw line
So I took the ball, and as I made the hoop
Everybody jumped up and they said "Go Snoop"
And my career jumped off into the fast lane
My rookie season I made my first all star game
Double G like George Gervin, thats what the call me cause I'm so ice
Ballin cause that's my life, I balls all day, and I balls all night
They call me Snoop Dogg and everybody know I love to hustle and ball
The season gettin tragic we lost to the Magic
And the word is that Rodman done had it
So I guess it on a young homie, the great number 8, Mr. Kobe
Give him the ball dogg he ready
We got to play Charlotte tonight, I'm stickin Eddie
Remember all the good times that we had
Cuz dont trip to long cause tommorow we play the Jazz
Then it on to play the Denver Nuggets
The homeboy Nick they traded, but damn I still love 'em
Keep a picture of 'em on the wall next to Dr. J
Meach, I love basketball
Allen Iverson on the fly boy he hard to stick
C Webb comin through with a quick pick
The NBA Saturday mornings hey or maybe on a Sunday
We in the playoffs so stay off the court
This ain't no game, this a sport
And we in it to win it, we ballin, No Limit
Remember this
When I grow up on wanted to be a point guard playing on NBC
With Herb and Suge or Pistol Pete or World B. Free givin dap to me
Givin up my dues with converse shoes
And tellin all the kids to stay in school
This is true and your dreams can come true
If it happen to me, it can happen to you
That's for all the NBA players that dream of being a rapper
I'm a rapper that dreams of being a NBA player and I'm a baller
Let's bounce up out of here man

[Nate Dogg]
We can get gangsta wit it
Get gangsta wit it
We can get gangsta wit it
Get gangsta wit it
We can get gangsta wit it
Get gangsta wit it

[Butch Cassidy]
Tell me can ya bust one line, tight as mine
Get the bullshit up in mine, it's my time to shine
Man I never felt this way, I hope it doesn't go away
I won't have to display, the dopest shit I ever could say
Never shall I meet defeat, so why should anyone compete
I keep my shit true to the streets, check me as I'm rockin' the beat
I got chu' on cruise control, head bobbin' whether young or old
Let me take over ya soul, so you can listen why the story is told

[Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
We can get gangsta wit it (Gangsta, gangsta)
Get gangsta wit it (Gangsta, gangsta)
We can get gangsta wit it (Stay gangsta)
Get gangsta wit it (Gangsta, gangsta)
We can get gangsta wit it (Gangsta, gangsta)
Get gangsta wit it (Gotta stay gangsta)
We can get gangsta wit it, (Gangsta, gangsta)
Get gangsta wit it (Gangsta)

[Snoop Dogg]
Gangsta blues with a gangsta ooze
A whole bunch of gangstas followin' gangsta rules
Baby girl tryin' to bring a gangsta some booze
I over-heard her tellin' Dogg can't out drank them fools
Bring it to me, shit I ain't got nothin' to lose
Just make sure you don't spill it on my Stacy Adams' shoes
Bad bitches usually run in twos
And gangsta niggas usually run in crews
Now take this for example, if Eve bit the apple
Would the police still gap em', pass em'
Now put him on a lasso
And keep my foot out his motherfucking asshole
For all the abuse and the wrongful bookings
Dr. King and Malcolm X good lookin'
Never will I ever forget the shit that I been through
The shit that y'all went through, I'mma keep it gangsta

[Nate Dogg]
We can get gangsta wit it
Get gangsta wit it
We can get gangsta wit it
Get gangsta wit it
We can get gangsta wit it
Get gangsta wit it

[Butch Cassidy (repeat to fade)]
La, la, la

[Snoop Talking]
Aiyyo Soopafly, why don't you get work with one of them fly-ass remixes?

[Nate Dogg]
Who's the man with the mic in haaand?
Who's the man with the masterlplaaan?
He goes by the name of Snoop D-O-G
He play the mic and these bustas fleee

[Verse 1, Snoop]
It's a whole-nother day, I'm back up in ya
Snoop D-O double G, I representah
Been away for a while but y'all know
I'm still doggystylin on Death Row (you know!)
Got things locked down, sold up
So If you plan on comin out, fool hold up
This a stick up, get up
They got yo shiz on the shelf, oh mine's too
And guess who they gon pick up
Some fools think they know they hit, but they don't
Some M-A's escape, some won't
Bumpin' heads with bustas
Where you from? EastSide, LongBeach, represent 2-1
The homie just got paroled
And he got more stories than the highway patrol
Tellin me about the money Suge Knight stole
But don't let that leak cuz, fool I get swole
I see you're tryin to get in, to get out
Put me up on game tellin me who gon' jack me
But ever since I was a puppy til I was paroled
I never had no other dogg pullin on my phone
Chorus:
Say Snoops Upside Ya head
Say Snoops Upside Ya Head (say what?)
Say Snoops Upside Ya Head
Say Snoops Upside Ya Head
Hold on, what's my name?
Snoop Dogg! Snoop Dogg! (Snoop...) x4

[Verse 2, Snoop]
I see these rappers in this game be doin way too much
Actin tough with this east-west coast stuff
See me, I'm all about my money man
I stay fly and dry
I don't get caught up in the rain
Cuz game (game) recognize game (game)
No matter where you from, we all can get dumb, insane
And turn the party out without a doubt
Unless you them fools who ain't got no clout
LBC and Beware Of My Crew
Cuz uh, we out there stuck on the crazy glue
Upside Ya Head like oops, Snoop's the lick
That you hear them bumpin in the hoops
You can't afford it homeboy, this is finished
I represented from V-A to Venice
So when it's timid and cold outside
Rely on the D-O Dub to put the heat in yo life
Chorus

Now bounce to this (Snoop Dogg!)
C-walk to this (Snoop Dogg!) Yeah...
Now bounce to this (Snoop Dogg!) Yeah...
C-walk to this (Snoop Dogg!) Yeah...
Yeah...know what...

[Verse 3, Snoop]
It takes a whole lot, to be number one
I can't walk down the street without my gun
I can't trust these fools, Fly, it ain't no fun
I'm sittin' up in court cuz somebody got DUMB
What really counts is how the crowd bounce
Go home and say Snoop rocked the partay
Nobody got killed, it's what got annouced
I guess they got a chance to see Dr. Bombay
But I keep my heat in case brothas get cold
Warm you up with the sheet, zip you up and roll
Now, Doggystyle records is now official
I'm gettin paper out the plizate with my initials
Shippin weapons overseas, I'm makin G's
With who you might call enemies
But I, see nothin funny about makin money
Cuz uh, we all know it don't grow on trees
So I...
Gotta get what I gotta get when I ?shake?
I'm up early in the morning with the homie Nate
Burning rubber down to get a new car
So don't get jealous when you see me in the double R
Chorus

[Outro, Snoop]
Now just ride to this, uh, bounce to this, uh, C-Walk to this

Nigga everywhere I go niggas be actin foolish
And uh, I'm a deal with that shit DPG style

[Kurupt]
I'm a rider, the first local stock pilot
Now what the fuck made you think the DP divided
Moving on up to the top of the map
Because gangsta will be here till the curl comeback
I'm moving down to block D, me and my homies
The Dogg Pound would rock overseas, immense degrees
No bitch niggas in the circle
Beat a nigga in his face till his fuckin eyes turn purple

[Daz Dillinger]
I told myself watch out for my family and health
I got my shit together, got the gauge up shelf
Knowing the rules have chose to hang out with the dummies and fools
Old school Poda Dada that I knew from way back to school
Attitude shitty, kept it raw and gritty
Uncut, me and my dawgs fuckin it up
What up

[Snoop Dogg]
Fuckin it up, fuckin it up for life nigga, Dogg Pound, ya heard
If I hear another nigga talking about what he gon do, to who
To me and my crew, nigga the grey and the blue
You through, you knew you shouldn't have done that
Now how the fuck you figure that we wasn't gon comeback
The D, the P, the G to C
Westcoast's finest and I'm a put that on me
See niggas been rappin but they ain't sayin shit
Nigga shut the fuck up, get off my dick

Chorus
Don't be foolish x2

[Daz]
Hook
You see you don't wanna fuck with us
Knowing how we throw it out, the sucka niggas want to imitate us
Cause all we wanna do is put the G right back in you
Yeah worry about your muthafuckin punk ass crew
And we keeps it gangsta fool, thats gangsta, keep it gangsta fool

[Snoop Dogg]
Trip, we got more dough than rock up, more niggas to lock up
You niggas need to strap up or pack up
See because this world we live in is crazy, and the people they so sick
See why I keeps it gangsta and I ride with the sickest clique
And when it comes to gun play, hell yeah we the quickest biach

[Daz Dillinger]
And oh my momma and my daddy, grandpapa and my granny
Homeboy you can't fuck with this

[Kurupt]
Smooth when we come through
The DP when we come through the gangstas is in the house
And all you muthafuckin niggas and you muthafuckin bitches
Get a muthafuckin dick in your mouth
I'm a gangsta I thought you knew, G'd up, grey and blue
Dippin through on the coop, made you blue
Kurupt and Snoop, Daz in the muthafuckin bomb ass clique
We gangstas nigga, laid back thinkin I tell you how it is in the hood
Where all my homies at, straps in Cadillacs
Hittin switches like e'yday, livin like the G way like e'yday, DPG-C

[Daz]
Hook

[Snoop Dogg]
Chorus x4

Just bullshittin man this dude done told me the Dogg Pound broke up
Wait till I catch that nigga, I'm a beat him down
Wait till I, wait till I catch em
Dogg Pound ain't gon never break up cause that's favorite group
They gon keep on commin out with albums
Wait till I catch this nigga, he lied to me

Wait till I catch that muthafucker
Man don't be foolish and believe that shit
Shit man, don't be foolish

[Snoop Dogg]
Don't be foolish nigga, don't be foolish nigga
Wassup baby
Chorus:

A nigga sayin hi to you (how you doin'?)
I really wouldn't lie to you ( I ain't lying)
I wanna get inside of you (mmm)
Inside of you (yes I do!)
What you try to do (Can I hit it?)
A nigga sayin hi to you (how you doin?)
I really wouldn't lie to you (that's real)
I wanna be inside of you
And after I do, goodbye to you

Verse 1:

Wash my clothes you hoes clean up the kitchen
Suck me dry, let's get high, then wash the dishes
You get three wishes if you're cute and ambitious
Like Tisha and Denisha, boy them bitches was vicious
Wicked, how I kick it, I stick it in the booty
Oops, slid it on the accident
But, when I first met her she was so innocent
So it made no sense how she suck dick for fuck of it
We did it on the wall, me and my dogg
And I met her at the mall
Lakewood, so good, when I be inside of you
I'm just tryna freak it, make it fly for you
Make you wanna come back and get another piece
And share with your peoples and tell your little niece
My khackis every crease with the rubber in my pocket
Ride it, devide it, and please don't knock it til you tried it
Chorus:

A nigga sayin hi to you
I wanna be inside of you
I know I'm lookin fly to you
I wouldn't lie to you, what am I to do?
A nigga sayin hi to you
You know I wouldn't lie to you
I wanna be inside of you
And after I do, goodbye to you 

[2X]

Verse 2:

Ay ay, baby who with cause your thang like tendin girl
Get it wit your fit in, and welcome to my world
Fancy cars, yachts n pools, basketball courts that's made for high schools
Backyard full of dogs, got a pawn full of fish
But a bad girl, I think that's all that's missin from my list
Unless you wanna be the girl that fill that void
And grow with a real G homeboy
I take you where you wanna be
And I strip you buttnaked right in front of me
Think I hop, beauty for that there, can see
On the floor, at the mo' gettin low
Two thirty real dirty I we ain't leavin em fo'
Close the do' and turn off the lights
I love it when you coochie me extra tight
Got you screamin dynamite, like Jay Jay
Hey hey, girl that's what happenen'
Chorus:

A nigga sayin hi to you
I wanna be inside of you
I know I'm lookin fly to you
I wouldn't lie to you, what am I to do?
A nigga sayin hi to you
You know I wouldn't lie to you
I wanna be inside of you
And after I do, goodbye to you 

[2X]

Verse 3:

I had a chick named Shamai, she love champagne
What a little twist the thing Alaine
She wadn't from America, so she couldn't speak English
I wipped out my ?zizag? and baby spoked dinglish
Reminds me of the supper free, that I bumped in Frisco
Same week buzzing another one up in Fresno
Hey ya'knaw, it seems that they knew what time it was
I've got a glass of Hurricane to get them all buzzed
Had them doin all type of craziness
And one freak said "All I wanna do is get a homegirl ???"
I flipped, for a second, look here I wrecked it
They gotta have that po-po, ?????????
They be we twisted, in case you missed it
See we gone keep this on the DL, It's our lil' secret
I won't tell, if you won't tell, see
Cause you gone work your thang, BANG BANG
Chorus:

A nigga sayin hi to you
I wanna be inside of you
I know I'm lookin fly to you
I wouldn't lie to you, what am I to do?
A nigga sayin hi to you
You know I wouldn't lie to you
I wanna be inside of you
And after I do, goodbye to you

Artist: Snoop Doggy Dogg
Album:  In Tha Beginning... There Was Rap
Song:   Freaky Tales

These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
I met this girl, her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked on the microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home
She was just like a doggie all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann, I shook her hand
We ended up freakin by a garbage can
The next young freak, I met was Red
I took her to my house and she gave me head
She like blowin dicks, is all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is Sherry
You talk about sex and the girl acts scary
I heard she was freakin from my big brother Jerry
Took her to my crib and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
I tell you homeboy if you get a piece
She'll only start talkin bout signin a lease
I met a young tender, her name is Lori
An X-Rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa
And just like Lori she's a real dick pleaser
My girlfriend's name, was Michelle
Her booty was bigger than the tail on a whale
When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than the flames of Hell
I G'd this girl, her name was Tammi
I didn't wanna do it cause the bitch was ?flantly?
She had a best friend, her name was Janet
I pulled her to the side and I spit that game
I had a lot of freaks, in my lifespan
I freaked one night, with this girl named Pam
The very next day, I saw her with her man
One week passed, and I was in her again
I had an old tender, her name's Jeanine
She was thirty-eight and I was only seventeen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans
I want a big freak, fat and sloppy
I kick on back, and watch the ho just mop me
Two tons of fun, Big Mad Magenta
A country broad from Alabama
I met this freak, her name was Beth
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as Hell, I was drippin sweat
But I was all up in her tryin to hold my breath
Bake, and, shake, ups
I met this freak in Vegas
She she said her name was Don-na
She was a ?belt? lil' freak from Chi-na
I said, "I don't pimp, or gigolo
I'm havin so much paper I don't need a ho
You can break yourself, but you can't break me
You never met a player like Snoop baby"
I knew a dick sucker named Betty Joe
I took her to my house and we did it on the flo'
The girl got freaky let me tell you mo'
She was down on her knees, beggin to blow
She's like another freak, named Renee
You get her all alone and she'll make your day
Like Burger King, she knows the play
And with a freak like Renee you can Have It Your Way
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well!

Raised on the turf where we, slay for the turf
And I'm the realest rider to walk the, face of this Earth
Strapped you best to be, ain't no standin next to me

Pure gangsta shit
Modefied, Purefied, nigga

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kinda hard being Snoop D-O-double-G
But I - somehow, some way
Keep coming up with funky ass shit like every single day
May I, kick a little something for the G's? (yeah)
And make a few ends as (yeah!) I breeze through
2 in the morning and the party's still jumping
Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the living room getting it on
And they ain't leaving til 6 in the morning
So what you wanna do? Sheeeit
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what) we don't love them hoes, yea
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckas bounce to this

[Hook]
Just rollin'! (I'm on a mission on the grind)
Just rollin'! (Homies get cought up, doin' time)
Just rollin'! (What?) (laid back)
Just rollin'! (with my mind on my money and my money on my mind)
Just rollin'! (I'm on a mission on the grind)
Just rollin'! (Can't get cought up and do time)
Just rollin'! (Laid back)
Just rollin'! (with my mind on my money and my money on my mind)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, cause you gets none of these, at ease
As I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
Beyotch I'm just

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Later on that day
My homey Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic that made me choke
Shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic: yeah I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stopping, I'm still popping
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the door
And I'll be

[Hook]

[Ol' G Henny Loc]
Yo, again!

[Verse 1: RBX]
Just then, I received a phone call, it was Morpheus
And he said i was the one, realizing the deal Heaven done
Turnin' to the east and all praise the sun
Now they blast me but they all miss
I do my 3D dance and remain undaunted
Then simply reverse the process
As the hot slugs hit their chest-plate, checkmate
Game over, you lose
Funky, drunken monkey technique without screws
As the sayin' goes, if ya snooze ya loose
And I won't be aimin' when the oozy ooze
Got em' runnin' for the hills
Style steady truckin' like eighteen wheels
Do got em' cluckin' like eighteen pills
The hex flies off then all the blood spills

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
The Legend of Jimmy Bones
Sharp as nails, tough as stones
This ain't based on no true story
This the real motherfucker

[Verse 2: RBX]
Carry vocal tones, most definitely will
Cause more horror than Amityville
Get out, this my house
Got you scared niggas don't chew like a church mouse
When I swing the Excalibur like highlander
The head flies off you see thunder and lighting
Much too late to realize your blunder
Suddenly you hear there can only be one
Well just X, We apply wild west tactics like turn back to back
Take ten paces and draw, but I'm sneaky with mine
Turn around at nine and blast you in your spine
High ride off into the hot sunset, like the high plains drifter
Hear me mister, no one blast with the
When it comes to shootin' gives up
X marks the spot and guaranteed to lift up

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
Payback is a dog, and revenge is sweet
Murder is the cold that Jimmy lifts by these wicked ass streets

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I cut ya head off, go ahead get ya lead off, set off
Motherfucker bit his leg off
I want revenge, this shit gon' end
You thought I was gone? Motherfucker I'm back home
Jimmy Bones, it's on so ain't no stoppin' this
I'll take you to the Necropolis, and place you in the front
Remain calm through this damn thang, listen here man
Killin' after killin', dealin' after dealin'
You motherfuckers don't really know how I'm feelin'
But I can't waste time and reflect on that
I gotta get these niggas who stabbed me in my back
Jeremiah, Lupovich, and Eddie Mack
You turn my peoples out on the crack sack
7-9, remember that, way back? But Karma came back
Now you motherfuckers gots to deal with that

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
What goes around, comes around
Do unto other, as you would want them to do unto you
It's a dog eat dog world

[Verse 4: MC Ren]
Nigga fuck that, my black ass back from the grave
Fucked up is how we behave
Where the fuck you think you runnin' to?
Everywhere ya bitch ass turn, I'm in front of you
Motherfuckers wanna scream but they choke
Pissin' on they self when I raise at that throat
Grab yo bitch that suck dick while I smoke
Then hang yo bitch, using tape and rope
Go on motherfucker take two to the head
Don't give a fuck, villain already dead, already bled
List of names, all on they ass, nigga fuck these games
Here to cause pain, payback a bitch
When niggas gotta beg, not to be filled up with lead
Time for me to fuck her, then villain get the fuck out
Leave you stuck out, leave yo fuckin' eyes plugged out

[Interlude: Ricky Harris as Eddie Mack]
Jimmy Bones, is that you? We killed you motherfucker
And buried yo' ass with nothin but yo bitch's bloody rags
Now I can count the holes in yo motherfucking chest

Niggas wasn't even rapping till I came out
You know what I'm sayin?
Y'all know what time it is

Chorus

Every nigga in this rap game, to the dope game
Now I got the hook up on the dodo, for sure tho'
But I'm not a weed seller, but a crocka sack beller
A rap star plus a 2 time felon
Sellin' phones out the trunk I mix G with funk
I put it all together, and rock it till it chump
Then bag it up and sag it up and then serve
I'm always on the pager, never on the curb
I'm big time, get mine, stay down for the grizind
I keep it gangsta, nigga, all the tizime
Ask them niggas, from way down South (who?)
The boys right there with the gold in they mouth
They'll tell ya (tell ya)
There ain't no bullshit to sell ya
Snoop D-O double G who wannabes wannabe
I got love for my folkers out in 'Lejo
And all my soldiers gettin' busy down in N-O
Gangsta's, get respect from me
And all you other niggas gettin' checked by me
That's on the C, DPG will never break up
There's too much motherfuckin' paper to cake up
That's on me (DPG)
Now what?

Chorus X3

Now all the bitches if you with me, come get me

That's the old fashion way, and bring a friend with ya
So when I'm through with ya she can hit ya
Shit I ain't trippin'
I'm dippin'
There's money to be made
It's funny how she layed when I told her she couldn't stay
Look here, my boo'll be through
So you gotta raise, boy game pays
On the next phase, gotta show to do at 4
Then I'm headed right back to the studio
If you need the hook up
Give a nigga a holla
I slide through your hood, in the gold impala
Drop off a sack, then I head right back
And I hope I don't get jacked, cause you know I'm ridin' strapped
But if the boys decide to pull me over loc
They recognize my face, and so they go
Gangsta's get respect ya see
All y'all other niggas gettin' shook like fleas

There's too much motherfuckin' paper to cake up

[Thurgood of PJ's]
	Yeah, get up, get down
	That's what P Funk say

[Snoop]
Get your money man, it's hard out there
It's hard out there, dogg
What, yeah, huh
Get yours, get yours, get yours

Shootin' dice on length with a couple of G's
Dust off my knees, twist off my cap and breathe
Jump in the six-four, sittin' on D
Spit a few caps at my enemies
Please, freeze, there's a new sheriff in town
Livin' in the projects, Dogg Pound Pound
No father figure, just gangbang nigga
Cuz they give it up quicker and they learn to pull a trigger
All role models on TV
Most of us ain't got a TV, you feel me?
Shit, Michael Jordan don't come through
I bet the nigga get the money when it time to sell his shoe
I'm telling you, I ain't puttin' him down
Cuz I love him to death but I ain't ever seen him in my town
But you could see Snoop Dogg everyday
I'm boss to the blocks like the projects in the PJ's
Yeah, for those of you who don't know
This is the land of the scandalous and cut throats
Child support- that's unheard of
Number one crime in the motherfucker- murder
Ya heard me?  Hmm, I'ma stay down
For the get down, from a puppy to the big dogg
Put that on the penthouse
Life in the projects, bang, bang, pow, pow
Is how it sounds

[Chorus]
Life in the projects
Where it's hard to get by
But you got it cuz your spot's gettin' hotter
Life in the projects
Where grass is cheese and cheese is power
Life in the projects
Where you got to have the will to know how
Know how to do what?  Survive
Life in the projects
You got to get yours cuz I'ma get mine

Life in the projects, goodness grief
Everybody waitin' on the 1st and 15th
The police man is tryin' to get atcha
Catcha, snatcha, open up your fridge
Nuttin' lookin' back atcha
So you open up your freeza and say 'God, please'
I wish we had some more of this government cheese
I'm duckin' buckshots, see, walkin' on my knees
Ain't no trees, the grass ain't green
And when I say it's all bad, you know what I mean
There's One In Every Family- what?  A Fiend
And a basketball star with no team, no dreams
Remember good times?  JJ and Michael?
And all the lil' thangs they went through despite
Nobody in the projects gave a fuck
Ain't no good, it's all badluck, shucks, shoppin' poppin'
Back up on all the scene, from the George Down, PJ's, Cali or projects
And the Cabrini Greens, my niggas get wild on they ass
We like to pow-pow on they ass
Here's a toast to the coast, so take a blast
]From the projects to the upper deck, upper class
A long way from where I come from
I know where I'm at, nigga, I can't forget where I came from

[Chorus]

[Repeat to fade]
Life in the projects

[Adlibs]
Yeah
I know all them real niggas out there that's livin' they life in the projects
That's going through that bullshit, y'know
I know how y'all niggas feel
Nigga, Doggy Dogg for ya pain
It's like I'm livin' in the motherfuckin' projects, too
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
They want y'all to throw me out my state
So, fuck
I might as well move back in the projects
That's where my real niggas at any motherfuckin' way
I gotta get mine, I gotta get mine

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I get my focus, then ride, I put some Hen in my life
I get my pen and my pie
Man, I drift when I drive
I feel the breezes I breeze, I got the keys to my boat
Ain't that a bitch, motherfucker, say the Dogg on coke
I sold coke my whole life, I never snort that shit
See I'm a ex-gangbanger, you can quote that shit
I'm livin'
Everyday like Thanksgivin'
I watch my big homey Tookie get murdered in prison
Now I can't sit back
I gotta spit that rap
I hit the streets with this heat, I got some cases to beat
I ain't bitchin'
Nigga snitchin'
They think I'm crippin'
And trippin' and flippin'
But trip this
You know I'm dippin'
With the bulletproof, tucked in a snub
I got the streets on lock
And now I'm up in the club
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
Thirteen years
Later, motherfucker, and I'm still number one
Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Big Bamm]
I make it clap (BRRAT!)
Ain't no questions about it
Bigg Snoop Dogg is who the ese is down with (Boss)
And on one
I was slangin' in Yale
It's 2007 and I got pussy to sell
Young Bamm, and I'm a beast on these streets
Now let me rap or take some game on this Snoop Dogg beat
Buck found me in the trap
From a quarter ounce of crack
To a thousand square feet
In the creek, in the back
I'm young, rich and strap, and I'm a make it Tron max
Sippin' cold cognac
On the old Cadillac
I put it down for the Pound like
Everyday
So when you see me, holla "Church!" cause I keep it that way
Yeah
We gon' bust in the air
I make the .40 cal clap like the motherfuckin' snare
From the L-1-3
To the DPG
I just got my weed license, fuck the L.A.P.D
Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
This old man, yeah, he sure can
D-O-Double G with twenty mil in his hand
I stand tall, against the wall, I'm gonna ball and I'll walk it off
My favorite shows to watch, on the phone, I don't really talk at all
From the valley Lowes of Clarksdale
I'm Gangsta, Gangsta like Avon Barksdale
You know the word is out
He's on the loose
I'm back in the hood again, sippin' on that Gin & Juice
Superman got dressed in the phone booth
Wha-wha-what, what you gon' do, my niggas is on you
See I was all about peace to your way
You motherfuckin' mouth, tell the police, now it's on
Yeah
My gangsta boots is laced up
I came here to shoot this motherfuckin' place up
Don't play no games, don't say no names
Don't do nothin', get popped in your motherfuckin' brain

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm gonna take my time
She gon' get hers before I
I'm gonna take it slow
I'm not gon' rush the stroke
So she can get a sensual seduction
So I can get a sensual seduction
So we can get a sensual seduction
Sensual seduction, whoa whoa

[Lil' Kim]
I'm gonna take my time
I like to get mine from behind
So he can take control
And lick me from head to toe

So we can get a sensual seduction
So I can have continuous eruption
With no interuptions
So he can have a Lil' Kim seduction, whoa

[Snoop Dogg]
She might be with him
But she's thinkin' 'bout me, me, me
We don't go to the malls
We don't go out to eat, eat, eat
All that we ever do
Is play in the sheets, sheets, sheets
Smoke us a cigarette
Then go back to sleep, sleep, sleep
Cause we done got a

Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction, whoa whoa
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction, whoa whoa

I'm gonna take my time
She gon' get hers before I

[Lil' Kim]
Don't rush
If you don't know by now
Lil' Kim is a freak, freak, freeeeak
He's lickin' his lips
Like I'm something to eat, eat, eeeat
Can't get enough of my honey
Cause he say it tastes sweet, sweet, sweeeet
He's got me so wet
Cause he's going so deep, deep, deeeep
So we can get a sensual seduction
So I can have continuous eruption
With no interruptions
So he can have a Lil' Kim seduction, whoa

[Snoop Dogg Rap]
I was all in the club
Havin' a drink, blowin' on a sweet
When I peeped this lil' freak out
I was all on the bar, went drift up
Shawty Redd came on
Then she hit the floor now
With a see-through dress
Long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Ms. Bo Peep
And a player know
If I take her home, with them real big hips
You so ripe, I'm gon' beep
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a little bitty waist
I whisped in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?"
I know that you a freak, but you know I ain't gon' say shhhh
See, my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it wasn't no need for me to rush to bust one
Cause I wanted her to have an eruption
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction, whoa
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction, whoa whoa
Sensual seduction
(All the time, any time)
Sensual seduction, whoa whoa
Sensual seduction
Oooh! Aoww! Well alright ch'all
Snoopy, tell 'em where they at
(In the Land of Oz..)

[Snoop Dogg]
In the land of the get killed quick
Some niggas turn bitch
Dig this, new fish, old twist
The way they turned a young nigga out, had him suckin dick (damn!)
He gangbang and slang 'caine on the streets
With a gang of bad bitches by his feet
But now, that he's, locked away
He can't get no love on visiting today
Holla holla, pop yo' collar
Shit a nigga just tryin to get a wet forty dollars
To get a cup of soup and some woop woop
Much love O.G. Big Snoop
I sent a nigga a package, on Monday
I got a G comin at'cha on Sunday
One way, to do it, and that's the G way
I'm hittin switches for ya homey on the freeway

[Hook One]
I know you caught a hot one (hot one)
Now I'm blastin with my shotgun
I know that stress seems kind of scary..
Put a dub on my commisary, up on my commisary

[Snoop Dogg - as inmate]
Nigga quit trippin; why you flossin hittin switches?
You need to send some flicks of some bitches (aoww)
They got a nigga workin in the kitchen
Sendin young writers on a mission
I'm in and out the hole, way out of control
But shit homey, you know real dubs gon' roll
You know Gusto? That's how he got on parole
But when we catch him, you know we get the stole on
I got that package, but I'mma need a little mo'
Check on my momma, my kids and my little ho
Don't even sweat it, better yet forget it
Cause I know fo' sho' somebody gon' get it

[Hook Two]
I know you locked up in the cage room
(I know my nigga, god damn mayne)
And you ain't comin home, any time soon
(Still I'mma keep it real and write you, y'knahmsayin)
All my life been runnin from the fuzz.. (cops)
Fresh meat! (Nigga) Welcome to the Land of Oz..
(In the Land of Oz..)

[Snoop Dogg]
Couldn't imagine what you go through e'rynight
You gotta squab with the brown black and the white
Turn off the lights and a nigga might get stuck
It's fucked up, at least one of us lucked up
I keep it crooked seven days a week
You wanna get married? I got a little freak
That'll do what I tell her to do, it's on the house homey
I owe you one, I'll throw you two
I know life is hard in Oz
I try to ease your pain with money cars and broads
What would you do if you was me and I was you?
My real motherfuckers know what they gon' do
Keep it true, so that's what I'mma do
Snoopy D-O-double, or just Big Snoop
Doin my thang for y'all, slangin doggs
Brangin broads - who else gon' bang for y'all?

[Hook One]

.. welcome to the Land of Oz.. {*repeat to fade*}
Yeah what up

[Chorus]
Nigga want hundeds, hundeds, hundeds
I need money money money
Nigga want hundeds, hundeds, hundeds
Nigga I need money money money
Nigga want hundeds hundeds hundeds
Nigga want money money money

[Verse 1]
The biggest fast time is rhyme the size crime
Its been the same man since the game became mine
I spot four one of these at the same time
Looking like Snoop Dogg back in eighty-nine
Do I give a fuck, no I never have
I just blow my weed and take a bubble bath
I laugh at these niggas, I ain't mad at you niggas
Cause half of you niggas can't even fuck with me
I'm on it cause I'm so fucking city
And every town that I roll through I leave my G prints
LBC, now that's what I represent, can ya feel it (Eastside)
I'm hotter than a batch of fish grease in a skillet
I wanna say what up to all the G's, the killas, and the ballers, and the dealers
See where I'm from you either rate us, hate us or steal us
And right about now all the cap peelers gotta feel us

[Chorus with slight variations repeat 2 X]

[Verse 2]
Money, money is everything
It's the crack to the fiend
It's the king to the queen
It reigns supreme
It's the crop to the cream (say what)
It's a po man, no man, its everybodys dream
Money, mo money, get money
But make sure you know that your folks don't get funny
Everybody claiming that they down on they luck
While I'm fresh dressed like a million bucks
I throw on my black socks with my all gold chucks
Now lets see which one of my trucks we gone use today
To slide away, (where we going) to Snoop World mother fucking U.S.A
Its all a dream, and dreams can come true
If it happen for me, shit it can happen for you
Meech from the beach, he keep shit cracking
And everything he touch guaranteed to go platinum

[Chorus with slight variations repeat 2 X]

[Verse 3]
Ya got to have cash to make it these days
And you can make at least one of a hundred different ways
You can holler at the homie Meech and get a dope track
And write you a rap, and try to get you to snap
Or you could stand on the streets and holler and wine
You can throw up insane, twenty crip or one nine
I chose DP cause financially money money money that's all a nigga see
See to get it, is to have it, interstate, maintain, don't get broke and fail the game
You might catch me in Brooklyn man hanging out with my sons and god sons, cause it's a blood thing
Or you can catch me in Oakland, or I might be on my way back to the west coast
Still smoking, with a pound of that shit
Waiting for me at the crib with my dogs my wife and my two kids, getting money

[Chorus with slight variations repeat 5 X]

[Ad libs over Chorus]
For all the niggas out there getting their money
Money is the root of all evil huh
You know what
I mean, we already living in hell
So fuck, get your money man
I look at shit like this:
The mother fuckers that don't got money, they doing bad
And they don't give a fuck and they rob they steal they kill
And the mother fuckers that got money, they depressed
You know they can't enjoy it
So I mean, whats your pleasure
You wanna live with it our without it, shit I'm bout it
I got to have it, you feel me

[Chorus with slight variations repeat 5 X]

[Intro: Raphael Saadiq]
Midnight love
Midnight love
Midnight love
Midnight love

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq]
Midnight love
Troubles plots on thee mind
Midnight love
Leave your back door open
Midnight love
Just have it ready for me
Back door little druggie's callin' for you

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I'm makin' things happen fast
Ain't no need to wait around for what never seems to come along
Face lookin' stupid, broke, startin' feelin' dumb
I'm young but I'm a grown man
Takin' thangs into my own hands, I'm tryin' to own land
But life a twist ya like a twister, get twisted with this
It seems on but its off, I keep missin' this shit
I'm high but I try, to stay focused wide eyed
Lookin' dead at the chips, I blink they dip
Its hard to hang on, but I can't let go
Smokin' on my last breath
Blow out life whats left is death
Now I can go wrong or I can G or make a right
Whatever way that I turn, its still death after life
And if it don't discourage me, I ain't got nuthin' to lose
But some punks that probably never turn the money to burn
But I learn cuz I see, and I earn cuz I G
But, these problems probably havin' niggas prayin' to see
At an early age so at an early stage in life
I chose to get my shit tight, ya gotta struggle and fight
It cost an arm and a leg, just to live on your knees
And I'm tryin' to keep my sanity, God help me please

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq]
Midnight love
Troubles plots on thee mind
Midnight love
Leave your back door open
Midnight love
Just have it ready for me
Back door little druggie's callin' for you

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Mischievous and devious is how my life was
Puttin' the serve down for cabbage, just to keep the cluckers buzzed
Some of the money makin' muthafuckaz from the other side
Was thinkin' about a jack move, tryin' to whoo-ride
Gettin' jealous cuz my niggas got this rap game sold up
Them niggas wanna trip, (brrr-brat-dat) they got blown up
Blown up or not you can still get shot
You don't never play a muthafucka out for his knot
Rule number one, pay attention to this shit
Don't be fuckin' wit my niggas on the midnight shift, Shit (shit)
He kept, gettin' it on, to the break of dawn
Now he's known, for servin' more than an oz. so
He's got a 187 on his muthafuckin' chest
A strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest
He's lookin' for them niggas from the night before
12:01 he layin' low, all in a nigga back do' (die)

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq]
Midnight love
Troubles plots on thee mind
Midnight love
Leave your back door open
Midnight love
Just have it ready for me
Back door little druggie's callin for you

[Verse 3: Daz]
Now its all about the dollars, Impalas that bounce
Havin' cars and bitches, havin' a proper amount
Quarter million chillin'
Robbin banks and many mo'
Some life and darkness
We all get it started, coldhearted
Get around, my life won't change for the good
It seems soon I walk out the door, I'm called by the hood
Daz, would you come and ride for me?
Ayo Daz, you da soldier would you die for me?
The hood tradition's got a lot of niggas killed for dumb shit
The OG's think they run shit, the youngsters control shit
Every midnight I be loaded, high as a kite
Be siding with the drama when the dogg fight, street fight
And a lot a mob puttin' on mo
Problems get solved, but revolved with ammo and a fo-fo
But sure I did the record blast five times
254 sentenced to jail time

[Bridge: Raphael Saadiq]
Midnight love
I've been walkin' the street
Midnight love
I put my life on the line
Midnight love
Cuz I've just gotta be me
Midnight love
Midnight love
Troubles plots on thee mind
Midnight love
Leave your back door open
Midnight love
Just have it ready for me
Back door little druggie's callin' for you

[Jermaine Dupri:]
Uhh, whatchu wanna do? SoSoDef
You wanna get down? (ah get down, get down)
Whatchu wanna do? (ah get down, get down)
Said you wanna get down? (We got Snoop Dogg, in the house tonight)
Whatchu wanna do? (with the homeboy JD)
You wanna get down? (ah get down, get down)
Whatchu wanna do? (ahh ha ha)
Yeah, now check this out

Now, everywhere I go
They wanna see Don Ciccio
Yes obsessed with SoSo all my dough
How the jewelry glow and the Cristi' flow
Ain't no secret I sleep with freaky
Premium bush when I push they push
And after we push I leave her
Cause I don't love her

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Ha ha, and me neither
A-B-C-D-P-G-C
Who could it be, it's the D-O-double-G
Known for the bone and the chrome on the D's
Gold credit card backyard full of green trees (what?)
Breeze through the summer in a Hummer with tint
Or dip in the low-low but that's just for promo
Never leave me alone, without the dough doe
I'm so so cold but y'all didn't know doe

[Chorus:]

[JD]
Whatchu wanna do? Said you wanna get down?
Whatchu wanna do? Said you wanna get down?

[Chorus: Trey Lorenz]
Get down on it, get down on it, get down on it
We just wanna party with you

[Snoop]
We have Snoop Dogg in the house tonight with the homeboy Ah get down, since you wanna get down

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
To be a high roller, you need a pistola
And about a half a key of some Coca-Cola
Now that I got older, I got a little colder
And I don't trip to get a chip off my 

[nigga's] shoulder
Mad dreams, of a gangsta being like Cagney
Or Bogey but Snoop Doggy
Ain't no follower, man I'mma general
So when I put it down I gots to be so original
I'm quick to bust just like Daz Dillinger
But that's the little homey
And I'm the big homey Snoop Don Corleone
Spittin it, hittin it, while I'm gettin that
Bout it, bout it, and happy to shout out, mmm
I dissapear 'fore the game get crowded
Take a trip overseas to the West Indies, freeze
JD (uh-huh), music please

[Jermaine Dupri]
I get goosebumps when the bassline thumps
So phat 

[niggas] call me Professor Klump
Ain't nuttin on the low about me I floss
And no there's none of these 

[hoes] son what I toss
On the track better bring chips cause I cost
Million dollar company 

[bitch] and I'm the boss
I don't sit back and watch, I go for it
Different colored drops on the car port, 

[nigga] who's short?

[Chorus]

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Khakis on my leg, Lugz on my feet
I'm walkin up the street while boppin my feet
I'm fresh off the bus from Memphis, Tennessee
Head still spinnin from the Coke and Hennessey
Sit down on it, nah, get down on it
It really don't matter cause you want it, Dogg-gonit
Cuzz, you must was buzzed
When you was bumping your gums, who you thought I was?
But look, I ain't even tripping right now
It's like that there, bow, wow
So many styles I could flip em like a file
Pop my drop top and let the beat rock
Dip through, course you do, miss you
But back to the issue, I wish you
Stop tryin to clown the Pid-ound
Cause you don't really wanna get down

[Chorus]

[Trey Lorenz]
All we wanna do is make you dance
No standing on the wall, baby

[JD] Get your back up off the wall, c'mon
All we wanna do is make you dance
No standing on the wall

[JD] Get your back up off the wall
Cause I heard all my 

[niggas] say
You know it

[JD] Uh-huh
When you're dancing yeah

You show it

[JD] Uh-huh
When you move move move

Like a dog without a bone (Woof, woof)
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm (Ride, ride, ride)
There's a killer on the road (Killer, killer, murder, murder, murder)
His brain is squirmin' like a toad

Sweet family will die (Ride, ride, ride)
Killer on the road (Killer, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder)

Goin' off of this, goin' off of that
With the Lizard king bumpin' in the back, how 'bout that?
Driftin', liftin', swiftin' (Let 'em in. let 'em in)
Coastin', testaroastin' (Yeah)
But the wheels won't stop (Won't stop)
200 on the highway, fresh up off the block
He's a rider? (Woo, woo) Naw, he's a killer
Dressed in all black, but his hat says Steeler (Steeler, Steeler)
Pedal to the metal (Metal)
I gotta go hard, drive by and say "hello"
Hey, Fredwreck, you my mello
Now let me hear what I sound like acapella (Shh)
Wow, ride, dip swish
Now bring it back, just like this
Like a dog without his bone
Unlike a G without his chrome
It's hard to imagine
The homie dog in a Jag and he's checkin' for the checkered flagin'
Comin' in first, never in last
'Cause my car too fast (Zoom, zoom)
I never ever run outta gas
'Cause I'm just too clean, I do it upperclass
So fasten your seat belts
It's so hot, it will even make heat melt (Woo, woo)
So get a bowl and roll and ride
Slip through the slip and slide

[Chorus: Jim Morrison]
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road
Yeah

[Bridge: Jim Morrison]
Woah!
Away in India
Woo!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Need for Speed, I'm tryin' to take the lead
Hold on, little homie, 'fore you run into the trees (Watch out!, watch out!)
I've seen things that I never would've saw before
Ayo, Jim, let 'em in, let 'em in
Open up, my back tire smokin' up
The whole street
And now the police wanna flash their lights (Wuuh, wuuh)
And chase the Dogg all night (Woof!)
But I won't pull over nor give up
'Cause I just don't give a (What?)
Yeah, I'm from the side, boy

[Intro: Bad Azz]
Is that the Black Santa Claus? (Ho ho ho ho)
I want a Super 'Intendo (Merry Christmas!), yeah
Sega Genesis (Mommy, mommy), yeah
Street Fighter 2 (Mommy, is that the Black Santa Claus?)
And a gang of toys (That is the Black Santa Claus!), uh
Mommy, mommy, mommy

[Verse 1: Dat Nigga Daz]
It's 12:30 a.m., Christmas Eve
I'm out with the gangstas and thieves
Celebratin', postin' up with eggnog head up-up in my cup
Put Rudolph in motion, sleigh all bang-bangin' and coastin'
Down the block, but be careful for the hawk because it's posted
Some stay to this day that Christmas ain't nothing but another day
But, out of respect, I gotta give the Lord his day
Tell me, tell me, where do the homeless and bums got to sleep? (Nowhere)
Where do hungry and the needy-greedies got to eat? (But who cares?)
Life is so crucial and cold, as for, for the children
In this world they hopes and dreams can't unfold
The young and old churches, the spiritual dreams, seasonal things
Heard throughout the ghetto, reaches gangstas and dope fiends, huh
'Cause those who ain't able get it now can finally get it
'Cause the ghetto Santa Claus has sprinkled the hood, now we ballin'
Livin' to a new year of better thangs
Celebrate it with some Champagne, haha, check it (Yeah)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is coming straight to the ghetto

[Bridge: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Now on the first day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A sack of the Krazy Glue and told me to smoke it up slowly
Now on the second day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A fifth of Henn-dawg and told me to take my mind off that weed
Now by the third day of Christmas, my big homeboy gave to me
A whole lot of everything, and it wasn't nothin' but game to me

[Verse 2: Bad Azz]
Back then, you woke up to the sound of "I Saw Mama Kissing Santa"
Made you reminisce on the old fashion Christmas days
Gifts, Mr. Fat Man jolly with joy
Down ya chimney with toys for lil' girls and boys
Pumped up, I jumped up before the sun peeped in
And hoped to catch a Santa Claus creepin' down my hall
Run to the window, put my eyes to the sky
To see if I could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy
I sigh, ain't no sign, but everything under this tree in my house is mine
My bike, that, and this plastic nine'll do fine 'til next year come
I try to see the same thing, they got us brainwashed dumb
And when you find it ain't no Santa, Christmas still mean a lot
'Cause it's the time to get together and give all you got
You got food, good moods, and what's better than together with your people
Well-wishers give a toast by the tree, it's Merry Christmas

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh, don't get too close because you might get shot)
Is coming straight to the ghetto (Welcome to the ghetto)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Santa Claus on the ceiling, Jack Frost chillin'
Pinch the Grinch for being a holiday villain
Season's greetings, all the proceedings
Are brought to you by the church house where we'll be eatin'
Chestnuts roastin' on a open fire
Singin' my jingle, where is Kris Kringle?
I didn't pout and I ain't even shouted
I even stayed in the house when the homies tried to sneak me out
And all I want for Christmas is my six-four Chevrolet
And a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly
Ain't that somethin'? (Uh-huh) Nah, ain't that nothin'
How it's Christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin'
Everybody happy (Happy), hair still nappy
Gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy
Catch me giving out turkeys at the church house
Don't try to work me, just stand in line and everything gon' be fine
Holla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down
Ain't no help from no elves, just Tha Dogg Pound
And we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs
Christmas on the Row, can you dig it? (Can you dig it?)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is coming straight to the ghetto

[Verse 4: Tray Deee]
Christmas Eve, I believe '76 was the year
Girls and boys full off joy with the season cheer
Smell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin' baked
To be ate after everything gone off your plate
But wait, not tonight it's straight beans and rice
On the table, are we able to proceed tonight?
I wonder what the morn bringin' so it's hard to doze off
Three 'o clock in my socks I crack the door soft
Hopin' when I open the door I'll see Santa
Now who the hell is this in this blue bandana?
Messin' with the boxes that's up under the tree
Look like Santa Claus done crossed into a woman to me
Now I'm comin' to see the whole picture gettin' clearer
How we have less as X-Mas get nearer
Mirror, mirror, please, it's seemed I've been deceived
And thank you, Saint Trick, for the gifts I received
So I creep back, and act like I ain't even peeped it
This'll be me and mom's private secret

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is coming straight to the ghetto
Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is coming straight to the ghetto

[Post-Chorus]
We wish you a happy new year
We wish you a happy new year
We wish you a happy new year
We wish you a happy new year

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is coming straight to the ghetto
Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is coming straight to the ghetto

Don't let this street life get ya down
Don't let this street life run you around
Don't let this street life get ya down
Don't let this street life run you around

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Val Young]
Since I was young I grew up in the street life
Times get hard for a gangsta in the street life
Ain't no tellin' what my life might be like
Growin' up in the street life
Since I was young I grew up in the street life
Times get hard for a gangsta in the street life
Ain't no tellin' what my life might be like
Growin' up in the street life

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You can't tell me shit, about these streets homie
I done lived it and done it, runnin' from the police
Out for the money, homies maintain their composure
Now that we older we sellin' ki's by the doja
Now I'm a soldier motherfucker for the chips wanna dip to trip
Headed straight for D.C., down for D.P
Flipped the script and came equipped
With some riders who got my back
Snoop Corleone, you know I'm always down to jack
I jack for instant thought, talkin' walk the walk
Niggas who oppose automatically get stomped
Terrorizing the neighborhood niggas gainin' they grab me
Southside and dash, mashin' for the rep
Test in peace to deceased homeboys who ain't alive
Street life took him over now he forced to die
Slippin' and slidin', bouncin' countin' my ends
To be straight, times is ruff for these days
Niggas is crazy, but the fear is much greater
The innovater, dominator, soul creator, out for the papers!

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Val Young]
Since I was young I grew up in the street life
Times get hard for a gangsta in the street life
Ain't no tellin' what my life might be like
Growin' up in the street life

Times get hard for a gangsta in the street life
Ain't no tellin' what my life might be like
Growin' up in the street life

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Bustin' and bailin', thugs addicted to drug sellin ki's
Got me riskin', the street living, catching felonies
How many niggas wanna see me gone?
You playa haters is bitches who hate to see a nigga hold his own
Forever ballin', no never fallin'
Live my life as a thug nigga, now can you hear the liquor callin'
When we blaze niggas is blinded
My competition, minimal so I live so, criminal minded
Nigga can you hear me wave yo' pistols in the sky
And roll a fat-ass blunt, I buck that shit, I bet it'll get you high
They wonder why I'm hard to kill, hard to let it go
How can I have fear, all my peers live on Death Row
Don Makaveli, 45, tucked next to my belly
Conversating with my nigga Dogg, lyrics so deadly
When ya come to get me bring an army
An Outlaw thug motherfucker, who can harm me
Bomb these bitches, see the track smokin'
Cause real Bad Boy killers be them, gat smoking
Ha ha, open ya eyes and understand this
World ain't fair these motherfuckers doin' scandalous
Niggas don't wanna see me hot with my Glock cocked
Drinkin on Henn', screamin fuck the world this is the end
In the street life!

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Val Young]
Since I was young I grew up in the street life

[Chorus, Snoop Dogg]
When you're at home
And you're alone
Tune In To Doggy's Station
When you're at home

Tune In To Doggy's Station
Yeah man
Which one of these cars you gonna use
I might use the Celica, the Mazda, the Nissan or the Toyota (what about that MR2?)
I heard they got that new PT Cruiser on there too
Tea that got that 

[?], too (oh fo sho!)
Yeah, which course we gonna use (I dont know)
Lets try the Deep Forest
I heard that was fly (yea, it is)

3! 2! 1! lets go!
Foot to the pedal and the pedal to the floor
Hurry up and take off, adjust my seat
Everything cool cause I'm dippin' to this beat
Slidin', slippin', smashin' off
I’m taking the lead while others crash the wall
Doggy D-O-double G in the (motherfucking) Gran Turismo 3
The coldest game, doin thangs
I'm picking up speed while I'm switchin' lanes
Doin' 'bout a 100 tryin' to reach two
My homie in the baby ('Bu), navy blue
Yea, it’s on! sittin' on Firestone
I'm tryin' to bring another checkered flag home
It feels bad in the worst way when you in last place But loc, I’m in 1st place
So how I’m gonna trip off that?
Cause if I lose I’m a turn it off and get right back
Chose a whole nother car
A whole new course, with tunnels and trees
Thanks for your support
I couldn't have made it without you
I doubt you ever seen a racing game this astounding
Picking you up when you’re down and
I drive good when the beat be poundin'
Knocking all across your face
Your boy want another race
In a whole nother place, a whole nother state
I was last seen doing two ninety eight
In a S2000 silver and black
Sitting on chrome, actin' bad like that
Burning rubber, smashing like that
On the real deal
Live from the Apricot Hill
I’m in hot pursuit
Being pursued by (hoes) that’s way too cute
Slipping out my lane, swerving trough the grass
Man these cars be on my...
Bumper jump up to three hundred, way cold
I’m doing too much I done lost control
Should I stop or should I roll?
My mission is to position my pole (position)
And fold these others up, even my brothers (what?)
It’s all about winning! y'all know what’s up
Playstation 2 taking you to a whole new dimension
Where the cars look fly and they got good suspension
Did I mention it was tight though for real though
Gran Turismo number 3
Your listening to the sounds of the D-O-G baby
Riding slippin', slidin'
Watch out for the curve the cars be colliding
(Damn) you in second gear? put it in third
And make sure you don’t hit those white lines by the curb
You wit your shuby do in the Subaru
Oh Lord I jumped in a dark blue Ford
Any claim that he in it to win it
Don’t trip, just make sure that you gonna finish 1st, 2nd, 3rd
That’s all that matters and I doubt there’s a racing game that’s phatter
For real though Gran Turismo for sho though
On the low tho, the game that’s for sho yo
Put your pedal to the metal
And ax all the kids in the ghetto
“Is the game hot, like the kettle?“
And I guarantee they all say, “Hello!?!”
Ride on, ride on, ride on
I know u swerving right there
Doing bout two hundred
In the fast lane
Yeah, what’s the name of the game?
Gran Turismo for sho' yo on the low tho
Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo
Is it the tightest game?
Better ask somebody
For real yo Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo

Gives em somethin' to move to, groove to
The next time you see me again gangsta'd up
Chilling wit my beanie again got many of friends

The church house and the mess hall
That's why I address y'all, express all Big Dogg

Now I can go on and on but I refuse to cause I might lose you
Let's cruise to the soulful sounds
I'm tryin to make y'all get down
And put some soul in ya ass Like James Brown (owwww!)
I feel good now; can you feel that?
It's like goin' bare back, I thought I oughta share dat
Compare dat, an' wear dat 7 days a week
Keep my name out ya mouth
And my business out the motherfuckin' streets

Your freak is a freak, I never crept with the ho

BEE-YACH!!!!

[Verse 1: Lil' Style]
Nine in the mornin, feds at my door (my door)
Blue Cotez squeakin cross the hardwood floor (right)
Dippin thru the alley I made my escape
Didn't even get a chance to grab my Snoop Dogg tape
Mad with no music but happy I'm free
Bailin fast as I can bail down 19th Street
I got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand
Gold on my neck, my pistol's closed in hand
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta from the LBC
Remotely controlled by the bomb-ity
But just livin in big city is a serious task
Didn't know what the feds wanted, didn't have time to ask

[Verse 2: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
We're comin with that G shit, that C shit that makin niggas sick
How does it feel to see a G from your clique?
Wake up, jumped out of bed wit my grin on (why?)
Last night's dice game got my win on
About a G and a half is what I came with
But twenty five G's is what I left with
*?Teatley?* was the word I heard
I went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the curb
Gimme the dice so I can break you niggas
I threw a 6 (C-I-X) so my point was the bigga
Seven-four-four-tre back to back
I sent two fools back to their lizzack

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
See now I'm off to the graveyard shift
And I gots ta pay my dues to make my grip
But I chill cos my ho might call
Ain't no thang cos I sleeps all day and slang when night fall
And I takes a quick walk up the block
With my Glock cocked, ready to make a stop where I set up shop
On Fifty-ninath and 8th Ave where all the homies be hangin
That's where a nigga'll be slangin
I'm makin a cool grip of shit, this ain't me
So I put my chips together and cops a quarter ki
And now the shops on deck
And everything that's mines I protect with a Tec, I don't half step
Now I got ends
And I'm rollin a Lexus, fuck a Benz, and so many new friends
But I could only trust a few
And unawarely I trusted you
But if only knew

[Verse 4: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
G And Snoop, homies from the motherfuckin get-go
Devoted and quotin, back in '84
I was thirteen, G was a year older
But I still wasn't afraid to throw 'em from his shoulders
Gettin good on the hood was the anticipation
And yeah, King Park was the destination
Every nigga that I knew was at the Park that night
Even the smokers that be lovin to get sparked at night

[Verse 5: Lil' Style]
Back on the streets, straight blue and grey
Cos I represent like every day
Nigga you can't tell me I don't be on the spot
When I can tell you all the homies that done get shot
From at least about five years ago
When I was in junior high goin to Marshall
The homey use to come up to the school and rock
And leave and have the bitches flockin his jock
Damn them was the days of the past
But since the Pizzound formed we been whippin people's ass
And everybody'll  blast
And if you don't believe me nigga you can axe the homey Daz
And that's your ass
Fucked around and let Young Swoop take your cash (ha ha)
He didn't even run, he walked away (busta)
Cuz I lived to see that day
I wished I was there I would've clowned
But that's why we "x"-ed your bitch ass from the Pound
Cos he wouldn't even squab back
Man we can't fuck with no niggas like that
He'll get us all cracked
If the police was behind us, he wouldn't even jump out with the strap
Now that's what I call a beeyatch! (Beeiyitch!)
I second the motion you was dropped from the clique (yeah yeah)

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Some of these nigga are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you've ever been told on...
Go out and get your roll on you punk ass nigga, you'll get stole on

[Verse 7: Dat Nigga Daz]
It's 5:30 in the mornin, now I'm yizzawnin
Now as I perceive to get G to a tee
And before I bell to school you know I blaze up a sack
Another day, another dollar for the gangsta mack
Bitch act like you know, show me some sex and affection
And lick me down slow, flossin, tossin a bitch (bitch)
Yeah Dogg, one more thing I forgot to mention
Shoot five niggas, shoot ten
Shoot the piece, slip to your Benz
Seven, goddamn it, went again
A '64 for the honeys, straight ho for the G
Young Daz, little nigga you can't fuck with me

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Now I knew that them niggas couldn't get at you
So what made them niggas try to spit at you
Disrespect the game and snitch on you
Y'all punk ass niggas, man y'all some bitches too

[Verse 8: Young Swoop]
Who got some gangsta gangsta shit? (ha ha)
Swoop G, I heard somebody's speakin up on you
Cos when I drop mines there was no more nickels and dimes
Just quarters, ounces, half ounces and quarta
PC is the season and I don't smoke blunt
It sees the indo with skunk, I might as well get drunk
To smoke some stress, that shit'll put a hole in your chest
I only want another twenty dollar, sure got me fucked up
My hood is gettin hot and niggas is tryin ta plot and
Come up off a young nigga, callin his shots
Swoop G ain't the one, I do its to be done (aah)
Al-ways have my gun and my G from 2-1
It's Cerritos but you don't hear me though cos you don't really know
About the you-know, I'm Cerritos, silly ho
Swoop G, mothafuckin fuckin L-B's-C
None of these nigga wanna fuck with these (aah)
Swoop G, Swoop G, G

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah wassup my nigga?
I'm sittin here chillin with my nigga Kurupt and we sayin
I mean it ain't no hard motherfuckin whiteboys in the rap game dog
You know? No disrespect (that's right)
That nigga Slim Shady is tight than a muh'fucka though (yeah that's true)
But we want a nigga to come with some GANGSTA shit
You feel me?

[T-Bo]
I went from rags to riches, to hittin these hoes and switches
Duckin snitches, and these money hungry bitches
So you want a dollar? Well baby I can't holla
You ain't gettin' shit from the break-a-bitch collar scholar
Not even a penny, homegirl you ain't gettin any
Oh by the way... you're too fuckin skinny
Why don't you go weep, and wash your stankin ass feet
While my vogues burn, up and down the street
Eatin steak and shrimp, got my name on a blimp
Walk with a limp, cause I'm a motherfuckin pimp
My diamonds is blindin yeah candy paint out shinin
Got yo' bitch chasin me, while yo' old lady two-timin
Whether you mobbin in buckets, or roll in a Benz
Keep yo' eyes on yo' enemies, seperate yo' foes from yo' friends
Fuckin models, drinkin Alize by the bottles
Eleven hundred sixty yachter and my hand's on the throttle

[Hook 2X: Snoop Dogg (paraphrasing Masta Ase "Jeep Ass Niguh")]
White boy, white boy, turn that shit down
You know that America ain't ready for the sound
From dem white boyz.. (white boyz) white boyz.. (white boyz)
White boyz.. (white boyz) white boyz.. (white boyz)

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm high 'n a motherfucker, perv on the curve
Fuckin with this white boy, slangin my herb
D.P.G. to the fullest young cuz
My homeboy Ricky said, "Show me some love!"
He got the club with this fool named T-Bo
From the Dirty South, gold's in his mouth, my peoples
All of my homies from the L.B.C
All my white homies who smoke with me
Sell me bud on the weekdays cause
This shit's for y'all, from me and my doggz
If you don't know you do know T-Bo my new dog
Fuck what you goin through, we bout to fuck it up y'all

[Hook: T-Bo says first line with Snoop] - 1/2X

[T-Bo]
You know who I wanna be, that white boy, that everybody talk about
The one that's tearin up shows, fuckin these hoes, representin the South
Eyes bare-ly open, laid back in the Cadillac tokin
Them hoes talkin bout ridin with me and Snoop the bitches must be jokin
Toke smoke, up the block and Glock stay cocked so you must get busted
And my city's hotter than a corner full of hustlers
Twelve slappin, trunk rattlin, and when you yappin we in a gun battle
When you talkin the talk, we walkin the walk
So stay in yo' house when after dark
You bark and we bite, you're wrong and we're right
Knuckle up in the club to push and shove til everybody starts to fightin
You might think the shit's funny, but fool we ain't actin
You bout that yappin? We bout that action and scratchin
Playin for keeps, screamin take it to the streets
Camouflaged down, with them soles on my feet
And up in the club, thugs push and they shove
And you won't know who's a killer, so you betta watch who you mug

[Snoop Dogg]
Bitch get your mind right, get your mind right
Bitch get your mind right, get your mind right
Yeah, white boyz up in the motherfucker
My nigga T-Bo!

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Intro]
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all...
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all...

[Verse 1]
Instructions to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge
I'm a player in the game and I know not from college
Eyes open, focus, scoping out the scene
Watch the gangsta haters close 'cause they worse than dope fiends
I hope things get better for you
Cos I'm gon' make things get better for me
And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB
The L-L-G wit DPG by the sea
We ride at high tide, the East is my side
Let me tell you 'long as my voice is recordable
That plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible
Oh yes I'm fresh 'til i expire from existence
With persistence, I proceed
Supplying you with what you need, no room for greed
Better go around and when it come to you
Don't bite off more than you can chew
Respect the game and the game will respect you back
Game is life, life is struggle
Without the coastal juggle
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crystal
(Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol?)
Or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces
And put it back together and remain tougher than leather
As for me I'm tryin to keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

[Hook]
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

[Verse 2]
T Lee, hold 'em, shake 'em, roll
Fly G boys and all you hoodrat girls
Pound puts it down all around the world
The best pick out the litter, LB young nigga
I'll eat your soul out my dog bowl, I bark when it get dark
Bitches in heat we tear the beat up, what?
On the microphone I bury the bone
Always, strays try to follow me home
Uhh, to get the pooper scooper, why? They droppin' doo-doo
I'm steppin' on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe
See I'm smashin' full-breaded wit no leash
When I mob, make marks across the street
See I'm vicious like hell, got 'em waggin they tail
For the bow-wow LBC style
Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever
I want 'em close enough so I can lock on 'em
Wit the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on 'em
Check this out here man, I lick 'em, sick 'em
Man's best friend, I hit you for ten, uhh
Fleas can't seize my pack, what, what's my name?
Major trick we're hittin' licks like the Doberman Gang
Y'done trip and try to fuck me up ever since a young puppy
Run a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG

[Hook]
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

[Verse 3]
They say once upon a time in the land of the loccs
Where it's all about dope and pistol smoke
I packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver
Weed out, DP'd out, GC'd out
Oh, did you not know
Snoop wit the .44 knockin at'cha door
We the passion for smashin and mashin the masses
Knockin' niggas like Cassius, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin
It's like in a action
Cos for the cash in my own zone we known for blastin
Bustin, no need for discussion
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust
Close enough to touch then rush
Clean and radical and get clutch
The Dogg is the Don like killer Corleone
Free the D-O-double G with the solid gold bone

[Hook]
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

[Intro: Prince Ital Joe]
Watch it, watch it - Daz is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
Watch it, watch it - Kurupt is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
Watch it, watch it - Doggystyle is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
You might be shootin, inna de place
Iffa eedyot ever disrespectin, nowww..

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind
Think how many plots blossoms to how many times
I'm sedatin my asphixiated from beginnin broke
And the bombest weed smoke that'll make a nigga choke
To my loc's way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from L.A. and the Beach
To my bulls out in Philly, cause all they smoke is phillies
With these silly-ass bitches out for a niggas riches
Now really, will he ever slip or trip
A big shout out, to my niggas in Darby Twp
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MC's like ships
With my nocturnal vibes and editorial clips
I got a click, that'll hit you like a thousand volts
The homies catchin cases robberies and assaults
It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that
Listen and get elevated off the verbal contact

[Bridge: Daz Dillinger]
When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
Now when a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt 'em in the worst way, put it down for myself
Put 'em to rest, confess, nevertheless
Snatch 'em a cap and destroy 'em at my best
For the simple fact with contact, we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle I'll mistreat
Any MC tryin to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest, it could be a verbal massacre
In ninety-six, with a different approach on shit
I got the flavor, and I'm major
Busta-ass niggas can't stop us, and can't fade us
Shady-ass niggas can't stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to ya
Swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya
I betcha I won't let ya escape, face the real on point
They're trained to kill, beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the area whether I'm toast(?) or at home
I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MC's try to step they get lit and blown

[Verse 3: Bad Azz]
At the end the lights go out so before they do
I'm a L-B-C on through, stayin true
Demandin my respect, respect is what I've given
So respect is what I expect, the money got me driven
To the point of no return - so the streets I roam
Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
.45 calibre Glock gat, gun, or pistol
Whistle, and watch all my homeboys come
Run, or hear the click, damn that shit that you get hit with
When we bust, I let loose
This is pre-meditated dick-up
To all the busters that jealous and hate it, but can't fade it
With they every attempt they fail,oh well
Consequences get suffered
I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers
The bill is crisp (the deal is) the deal is this
I gotta plot 'em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
I'm stompin, steppin, with my projectile weapon

[Verse 4: Techniec]
With subjects all subject to harm, when I swarm through
Who knew about the real deal I conceal?
And still, can you feel, the topic of the whole situation is trust
No ho is a must
If I bust my brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MC's who compose the violence
Bringin drama, with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceived, somethin up my sleeve to intrigue
And these MC's'll be G's
Also D-P-G's and, L-B-C's when
We do the do to you so go call your crew
And who, wants to compete with Techniec
Conflict will be verbal, so watch how you speak
And what you say when I display
Sleepless acts that's bomb to ya, suffer from insomnia
And I'ma, gonna be comin for you
So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew
(Watch out nigga!)

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
It's a sucker MC barbecue cookout
Look out.. watch out now!
Ha-ha yeah, witcha bad self, watch out!

[Nate Dogg]
Just Hit the Corner store
You know what I'm looking for
St Ides
Just Hit the Corner store
You know what I'm looking for
St Ides

[Snoop Dogg]
(I tip toe)
Through the door with a box of 4-0s
Party just to bounce and house full of hoes
No set trippin, just sipping on S.T
That's how we do it in the L.B.C
Here ye, here ye, come one come all
It's the first annual g nigg
And all my dogs are invited so go on and light it
Cause it's the first time in a longtime and I just might
Reminisce about the fresh vest back in '85
When the dub and the Zaniaks used to Hoo Ride
It was easy just to serve on the curve that's how I do
Ain't no slippin, dippin, now I'm sipping on my brew
Staying true cause now I'm supposed to
Grab my little friend, then my deuce deuce
I gets lose with my hands on my drinks
L.B.C. I see money in the bank
St. Ide's

[Chorus]
Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG
They say up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG

[Verse 1: Snoop]
Some do the things that they do 'cause they dumb
And some do the things that they do for crumbs
I do mine for me ya see?
Not the big homey double O-G
Scared to do your own work, man that's foul
And that's the reason why I had to shoot you down
Because you never should've tried to work my Dogg
And the lil homey wouldn't had no reason to bump
Y'all know the game ain't the same no mo'
Lil G's keep heat so big G's freeze, geez!
Johnny Rockafella went to jail-er
Few many times too many and became a teller
They sell a nigga dreams if he want em
But they won't sell you the game to get up on em
Ya tryin' ta find em 'cause you want em, they shook out
Get the book out and when the pitch come, nigga look out
It ain't hard to pump up the lil homies nigga
But it's hard for your bitch ass to get wit us
But instead, you put it in their head
That at 13 they better off dead (now they gone)

[Chorus]
Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG
They say up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Ayo Snoop, why when niggas get into the bracket
Of makin' loot, niggas wan' trip
Spittin' like you 'spose to be from the hood
Show me love nigga or don't show me shit
Feel the fever, million dollar man like Colt Seavers
Made a non-believing man into a believer
Receive a check the next day, my homies say
This the way to get paid, DP's invade
I don't know why you wanna get on my back? (Why?)
Trippin' 'cause you know the bomb's at where I'm at
Well if that's the case you shoulda rolled
Wit the PG instead of losing control (motherfucker)
This is how we do, Dogg Pound Gangstas in blue
Me, D-A-Z, N-A-T-E and Snoop
Niggas from sets be tryin' to set you up 'cause you set in your ways
So ask DJ Pooh what pays

[Chorus]
Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG
They say up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG

[Verse 3: Snoop]
Just what we need, bangin' on wax, another Crip
(What's up, cuz?)
What you gon' do nigga, jack the mothership?
You're like a actor wit another script
Predictable as Rambo wit another clip (busta)
How many niggas you gon' kill in your verse?
You need to sit down and learn to get down first
'Cause, uhh, real hoo-bangers are toast-slangers
Not part-time FBI singers
Niggas having bad intentions, sending BG's on a mission
One move too many, nigga you missin'
Listen, you fuck wit the cyco-lic-no
Loony ass nigga from your H-doubleO-D
Niggas got too flossy from all the sacs they tossin'
And guess what it cost me, they crossed me
But before I give a nigga a 9
I'd rather give a nigga a mic and write him a rhyme

[Chorus]
Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG
They say up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG

Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG

[Verse 1]
I put down more hits than mafioso made
And Lucky Luciano 'bout to sing soprano
And I know, I know the way you feel
And baby bubba we gon' keep it on tha real
Just to get you caught up in amazement
We puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous
But when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack
And let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha
How you feelin'? I'm up to dealin', ridin' like a villan
Makin' a killin', thrillin' the crowd wit my new hairdo
Outfits unused, fifty dollar socks, hundred-thousand dollar shoes
Man, I'm givin' blues to these sucka MC's
Who you be? You know who I be, young nigga
I'm Tha DoggFather

[Chorus]
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)

[Verse 2]
Let's make a move for this paper (Where we rollin' Dogg?)
We got's ta get paid (Makin' money all ya'll)
I mean I steps to tha stage in my G-boy stance
And say a few rhymes to make your girl wanna dance
I'm so fly like a dove
I come from up above
You trippin' on your girl cause she showed me love
Nigga don't beat em, cause if you beat em, you don't need em
You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom
I delete em, but don't mistreat em
I stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on
Let me flow on
You can rock to tha rythme you see
Or you can rock to tha rythme of me
Just remember when you do your thang
Make sure you do your thang on a hang
And everythang, is everythang
There ain't no mo' than this paper chase
Like them white-boy DA's was on tha case
You know I ain't tryin' ta floss, but uh
(Murder, murder, murder) was the case that they lost
I'm Tha DoggFather

[Chorus]
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)

[Verse 3]
Now, do anybody in tha house remember
When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)
There wasn't no rappers hollin' 'bout LBC
Am I trippin' ya'll? (Hell no!)
Now, when I grow up, I wanna be like Snoop
Have prestigious women
That's the truth from the begining
In and out of the flyest hotels
You say your family don't know me
Hold on hommie, that's formost and promos
Sales, tails, scales and jails
Success before death
No one in my clique fails
As females with the almighty Father lead
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need
And it ain't no party like this kind
Cause you can leave your worries behizzind
But I'mma git back to tha grizzind
Snoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and
I'm tha DoggFather

[Chorus]
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Ain't no funk, it's funky, it's Doggystyle (Ain't it funky nuff?)
(Death Row-ow, Death Rowwwww)
(Everybody knows I got more bounce than an ounce)
(Everybody knows I got more bounce than an ounce)

[Verse 1: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Shucks, stompin in my big blue chucks
More bounce to the ounce while I'm ditchin you clutz
Bump-bump-bump-bump while you're bumpin your sounds
It's the zoo and the Pound we don't fuck around
Relax your mind and let your conscience be free
And get down, stompin grounds is the LBC
I slid up out the game and MC's got wacked
But now I'm back (Oh shit!), so go get your strap
Watch your head, I break wit
Wit G's, Muslims, hardheads and dreds
Bounce, rock while rollerskatin
On them 20 inch tyres wit the platinum Daytons
I'm not that BG poppin all that junk
About "I'll fuck you up", he sound like a punk
I been there and done that, no inspiration
All day illustration beat conversation

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Ain't no funk, it's funky, it's Doggystyle (Ain't it funky nuff?)
(Death Row-ow, Death Rowwwww)
(Everybody knows I got more bounce than an ounce)
(Everybody knows I got more bounce than an ounce)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I keep niggas in the studio, word is bond
Been workin on ya new album for two years strong
And still can't come up with the right song
You know what they say:'Study long, study long'
All aboard the train so come along
Cos we keep the glue stuff against the bone
It's alright ain't no room for wrong
Doggyland is the motherland, make yourself at home
I got money loads by the barrels
I even got a few fans that's crazy like DeNiro
I'm international money maker, player hater
Shhok up off the sake of spendin dollars and I always holler
At a player though cos players know the real from the fake
You can put that on your toast, your coast and your state
I give you people what you like
What I look like in jail and can't get on the mic

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Ain't no funk, it's funky, it's Doggystyle (Ain't it funky nuff?)
(Death Row-ow, Death Rowwwww)
(Everybody knows I got more bounce than an ounce)
(Everybody knows I got more bounce than an ounce)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Killin up crews, give em the real street blues
Have em slidin in their eelskins, groovin in their tennis shoes
Of course it don't stop bein a Westside ridah
Wit no tattoo that's how they got the clue
I lay conversation on wax and CD's
BG's and o-riginals, here come the mission
Makin biters ride the Pound for the rest of the season
Doggy DPG ya lil homey, uhh
I represent the LBC-ment
Windows tint, nigga that's the president
I hit you with a tune every blue moon
Collard on your plate so you can stuff it in your face
Nigga say your Grace before you touch your plate
It taste like it's laced but it ain't
This one puff uncut, no doubt
Everybody know I gotta ounce and a half

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Ain't no funk, it's funky, it's Doggystyle (Ain't it funky nuff?)
(Death Row-ow, Death Rowwwww)
(Everybody knows I got more bounce than an ounce)
(Everybody knows I got more bounce than an ounce)

[Outro]
Shucks
(Oooh ooh ooohhh oooohhhh ooh, oooh oooh oooohhhh ooh)
(Death Rowwww, Death Rowwww)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Josey Wales was known for robbin' trains and banks
Layin everybody down for diamond rings and chains
It remains the same in the year you live in, see
'Cause if I pull out some heat, nigga, you'll go kick in
And that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school
When it's time to duel, you get two men
Two heaters, one street, one clock
And when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop
If you're quick on the draw
You're gon' see the morgue
But if you're too slow
I catch you on the downlow (Oh no)
Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit's real
I ain't no John Wayne, these niggas gangbang
The Four Horsemen, that's the click I'm wit
You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
Yeah, we're on a mission ta Kansas, slippin thru Texas
We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes
Bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses
The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen
Searchin for this location on the map
The gold rush, baby, got ta have it (I gots ta have it)
It feels just like it's 1865
And a trigger look-a-day is how I ride

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
On and on and on it's more strange
Time to heat, shootin range
Quick with the heat on their hip
Young Jesse James come to test your aim
I seen you at th e Wild Horny Corral
I hearda ya name
Tha forcify, nigga you ain't never lie
Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride
From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach
My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
The off-the-rocker roller coaster
On a six-shooter holster
With DPG on every Wanted poster
Let me think about which bank to gank
Which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
I want all the shit you got in stacks
Attached to this skirt in the corner
So I snatched the bitch in the back
The Dogg in me feels for the lust
But the hogg in me makes me wanna bust
Back to the drawin down board
Nowadays we drawn down more
To survive thru all the round wards
Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
Or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen
I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it
With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
Like that cock back
Quick to pull my strap
Just to put the Horsemen on the map
(The gold rush)

[Verse 3: Techniec]
Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots
I got the six shots for all the plans and plots
I gots lots o' cash stashed in money bags
Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags
I got stacks so my stacks excell
Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells
I'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse
A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o' course
It ain't no stoppin young Josey
Box all the nosey
Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hoes be
Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell
Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele
Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet
Divide between my homies and ride the sunset

[Verse 4: Bad Azz]
Two sacks o' money from the train heist
They ain't even counted it up
Just mounted it up
Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster
Pass thru a run-down town whose walls hold my poster
Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
So I gotta have what I can get
Heard word about the gold rush and headed West
On my white horsey with three straps in my napsack
Giddy up, the next town I rode thru
I had to threaten to blow their city up
Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west
Sell us some beads and hail us some weed
He offered me a toke
He didn't have a 20 he had they peace-pipe smoke
I almost choked
Break him for the get, right, I'm off into the sunset
Tryin ta reach my destiny fast
It's these two bags o' cash
44's cocked I ain't makin no mo' stops
Till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot
I slid off my boots, counted my loot
Five minutes after the strike of midnight
I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight
(At the gold rush, at the gold rush
At the gold rush, at the gold rush
At the, at the, at the)

[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Homie]
Ay Dogg, let me holla at'cha man
Wuz up home?
Word is on the streets, your beats gon' be delicate
Since Dre did shake the spea's out, man
Delicate? Beats?
So that's what makes me now?
Man, I don't give a fuck about no beat

(Now let me shake that shit man)
(I hear ya Dogg)
(It's a cold, cold thing!)
(It's a cold thing!)
(For real, hmm!)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I got more niggas tryin to get at me than the President do sometimes
Niggas be tryin to get at me cos I be droppin funky rhymes
What the fuck is goin on? This rap game is made to make money
You niggas is taking the shit outta hand, actin' way too funny
Doin too much, y'know I see it from the get-go
What the fuck's goin on wit you niggas, y'all tryin to play a low pro
And tryin ta be hard and tryin ta be big willies or whatever they call it
I guess it's time for me to act just like an alcoholic
And step to the game, I'm a stumble in like I don't know
And if a nigga say somethin wrong, I'm takin off from the get-go
I ain't givin no room to try to get me first
Cos I done been bombed on before and I'mma tell you, man, that's the worst
Fifth in the world, but I'mma keep my thang together
Cos I'mma keep makin money and hope everything is still together
Havin papers, man, now what y'all niggas doin?
All y'all broke on the corner
Drinkin your drink, wanna be doin what I'm doin
But don't get mad and don't be tryin to play-hate
Cos, uhh, takin trips around state to state
Representin, uhh, what y'all wanna represent
But y'all can't represent it cos y'all got no dollars, no cents
I'm movin on, groovin on and I'm movin
Makin more moves than the average Cuban
Tryin ta get G's across the town, tryin ta make more hits
And tryin ta get my game tight and get at your bitch
Now if she wants to get with this, she gone come holla at a player, do'
Cos she know that Snoop Dogg is got that white Rolls Royce
And she wants to jump in, bring a friend
Cos everything is like alphabet, come on in
Come on in and bring a friend and you can come on back
Cos when you do, we gone be sippin on some Cognac
It's on me, I'm feelin good tonight
Cos I'mma do mines and I'mma keep everything tight
I ain't lettin nothin leak cos if thangs leak, then I'm get caught
And I can't get caught cos you know how they do it about that child support
Shit, bitches is cold on a nigga who ain't got his game tight
Gettin 18-point-5 percent, half your life
Shit, I love my baby boy and all
But I ain't gonna be payin no bitch, no no, no way Dogg
I'm too slick on my toes, I'm too tight
I'm guaranteed to get away from some shit like dat, ain't that right
Cos, uhh, when you play in this game you got to be the real player
You can't be no fake ass nigga talkin about you wanna be the man
Cos if you ain't with the game, the game ain't gonna be wit you
And I can put that on everything including you

[Interlude]
One of every five black males before the year 2000
Will be detained or deceased
No justice, no peace
Yeah the truth hurts, if you're scared, go to church

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Look here, but don't cut it, gettin five points
Step back for a second, I'm puttin less than five to this joint
Hmm, if this is the bomb niggas gonna blow up like Atlanta at the Olympics
Niggas be trippin but I'll be pimpin
I don't be trippin off no nigga at all, no bitches
Just tryin to get money, I don't even be trippin off no switches
I used to like low-riders but now I like Eastsiders
I put it down wit me and make a hit maker, y'knowhatI'msayin?
I love the Lakers now cos now they got Shaq O'Neal
It's time to make a million dollars and that's for real
See we gone blow up and show up and throw up nuttin but Dogg Pound
Guaranteed to put it down and we'll be 'round to your town
So just sit in your seats and wait 'til we come through
Until we do just keep smokin grey and blue
Or whatever you do just stay true to what you do
Cos we gone keep doin what the fuck we got to do
Now, follow me now and listen to the instructions
Cos the game's gonna get deep now, niggas is tryin ta creep
Tryin ta get up on game but they don't wanna be down with the PG
All of a sudden everybody wanna dis DP
Now, what we look like?
Makin y'all diss us, that ain't right
I should get upset but I'mma stay composed
Chill for a second, spit at some hoes
Drinkin my drink, smokin my dank
Countin my bank, uhh that shit stank
Stanky bank is what I got cos I'mma keep it
And nah this ain't no motherfuckin secret

[Interlude]
Yeah, we're in drought season
Niggas lookin for a reason
It's like thanksgiving without the feast
Yeah the truth hurts, we're scared to go to church

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
They got me runnin' for my life, I'm jumpin' gates
They got dogs on my ass, but I'm a Dogg
So I know how to alert and get wit dat shit
The dog run up on me I give him a cold
Like nigga back up off me
He turn around and bite the police, hmm
Game recognise Snoop Dogg too cold, I'm on my toes
I slide in the back of a garage, dippin with this ho
They run right past me, ask me "Have I seen the suspect?"
"Yeah, he went that way", now for the jack

[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger]
Yeah
Vision 88 kilos of cocaine smack-dead in your face
The street value of that is what you dream to make
Run an illegal business,racketeerin
Smugglin,doin things from handin a gun,is what they fearin
Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit
Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick
Different locations,spots where it takes place
If you short them my money, your ass is gettin filleted
There's four major games that run the city of G's
The violators,the Gambinos and the Corleones and me
The violators and Gambinos they run uptown
Me and my cousin Corleone we run downtown
Murder's an everyday thang in the city
Where you gotta plot chips,jag robberies and do in its
Tanadian Nay,the charge of the weapons
Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected
So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot
Buck em till they all drop,circle round the block
Let em have it as soon as they come out
Unload on their ass,commence to takin them out!

[Interlude: Daz Dillinger]
Throughout the streets of Long Beach
The streets was infected with drugs,dope pealers and addicts
Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young
Youth behaviour is outrageous with crime
They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements
Have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs
From coming into our country, but they can't
The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount
Of which they make is more than 700 million dollars
Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion

[Verse 2: Big Tray Deee]
I had no choice or remorse for time for puttin it down
Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town
I been around since the Jumpstreet makin it pop
Young crook keepin hook,nigga,shakin the spot
Had to be a standout not to get ran out
Look for help,you help yourself cos there's no handout
Since the city Long Beach is only G's and hoes
You hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes
Trust,bust,be aware and I ain't ya curse
Cos the niggas that I dared to (?agank?) the first
Think I might be deceased 'fore I reach my calling
As long as I'm haulin my heat I'm stallin
I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life
Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes
Don't speak on the creep,mo' fools is listenin
And war story glory ain't worth the riskin
Real niggas still get a mob like respect
If you represent ya set,till ya bite the deck
Who I be?I'm the Dee,nigga check the file
Under G you will see not to sweat my style
I'm takin em out!

[Interlude: Corleone]

[Verse 3: Soop Dogg]
I come through blastin', me as a Downtown Assassin
Mashin,may they rest in peace in they caskets
Shoot em down in front of Hassans
Should've known from the gate,who's the baddest?
In my zone,Don Corleone wanted
For the murder of forty men
Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again
From the U-S-C,I shift ki's,a 120 plane rides
Multiplied by G's,87.3 million in a matter o'months
Big business and big dollars is all that I want
I blaze up to celebrate,new empire to make
Toast till we all die,till we burst and break
From knives to guns,from the rich to the slums
We ran outta dope,I don't think so son
While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park
From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark
From when I pick em off like darts
Stab em in they hearts
Make an example,what I said,ya end up dead
Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs
Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die
All I ever want is to be left alone
Me myself,me my dope,me and my chrome
Got paid by cops and judges,I budge when I buzz
I got the City of Long Beach goin crazy for drugs

[Outro: Corleone]

[Chorus]
She was just a groupie (She just a groupie)
She was just a groupie
She was just a groupie (All she wanted was Snoopy)
She was just a groupie (A groupie)
She was just a groupie
She was just a groupie (All she wanted just was Snoopy)
She was just a groupie (Yeah just a groupie)
She was just a groupie

[Dat Nigga Daz]
Beotch! (Beotch!)
I come through with the humps, I'll thump the shit out your block
I'm on alert for the cops, be on alert for the cop
Spotted some hoes, tooted my horn at the bitch
The Riviera skated, my interior's the shit
Fifteens humpin', dropped the top some more
Countin' my doe, purchased 250 of some bomb indo
Floss through South Central, I'm on my way to the Eastside
We high, blazin' like crazy and don't know why
Feelin' good as fuck, on a hot ass day
And there's a pool jam right around the way
Niggas got hoes, but ladies in the world
They wanna play with their minds like little girls
I twirl my fingers in the air, run my fingers through my hair
Redbones to blackbones, darkbones to Redbones
Skinny girls come a dime-a-dozen
But I play hoes like Plenty Lenny cause I get pretty
It's all about game...
Cause with no game is hard to maintain, for so long man
From Long Beach, California
From Tul-sa, Oklahoma
Tonight boardin' New Orleans from Mississippi
I know you hold the key to unlock the door
From low pro's she rolls with gold thangs, we ridin' fo' sho'
So tell me how much money can one playa make?
And how much ass can one nigga break?
You're just a gigolo (ya know)
To the heart you're just gigolo (ya know)

[Kurupt]
I was off in Vallejo
Peelin' hoes like Idaho Potatoes
What am I to do when life as a G
Bein' from where I be - D.P.G
It's manifico, ran into this pretty ass skirt
Mexi con Puerto Rico
Mixed with a sprinkle of black
So I'mma approach her like that
And let her know where I ride and reside at
My zone, the place that I call home
Is the world from Philadelphia to Rome
Picture me ey, entrepenuer with my nigga D-A
Rockin' tours and we still young boys
We got bitches, they got some bomb ass lips
She used to put 'em on this bomb ass dick
She always talked some bomb ass shit
She used to blow some bomb ass dick

[Chorus]
She was just a groupie (She just a groupie)
She was just a groupie
She was just a groupie (All she wanted was Snoopy)
She was just a groupie (A groupie)
She was just a groupie
She was just a groupie (All she wanted just was Snoopy)
She was just a groupie (Yeah just a groupie)
She was just a groupie

[Nate Dogg]
Someone's at my door, baby who could it be?
Someone wants to score, and get laid by the D-O double-G
Hey girl, what's your name? You wanna go a couple rounds with me?
I told her Nate Dogg is just the same, but she kept screamin' out Snoopy

[Warren G]
What's up baby, my name is Warren
I'm down with the Pound, cause I get around
So let me scoop you, swoop you, and take you
Give me a chance, and I'mma break you -
Down - to the very last compound
With my homies from the Dogg Pound

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Now you know and I know
Rule number one, you can't trust no ho
Now you can get caught up in the mix real fast
The ho gon' slip away, get away with all your cash
You gots to stay up on your toes when it come to hoes
I bust a brand new ho at every video
That's on the Pound and the Row, and like the wind blow -
I pass a ho to my kinfolk - and then smoke
She say she was no groupie, coochie lookin' juicy
She say she never ate a dick before but she gon' do me
But before she do me, I blaze up a doobie
Then turn on some Snoopy and uh - heat up jacuzzi
And, later on I just might turn on a movie
So you can regroupie and re-do me, just for Snoopy

[Chorus]
She was just a groupie (She just a groupie)
She was just a groupie
She was just a groupie (All she wanted was Snoopy)
She was just a groupie (A groupie)
She was just a groupie
She was just a groupie (All she wanted just was Snoopy)
She was just a groupie (Yeah just a groupie)
She was just a groupie

[Intro]
I think it's bout' time that we hit these niggas upside
Their head with some of that west coast
Gangsta' shit......... Ooh.....Wee!!!!!!!!!!

[Verse 1]
It's a whole 'nother day
I'm back up in ya'
Snoop D-O-Double G

Been away for a while but you all know
I'm still doggystylin' on Death Row
Got shit locked down
Sewed up
So If you plan on comin' out nigga hold up
This a stick up
Dick up
They got yo' shit on the shelf, oh mine is too
And guess who they gon' pick up?
Some niggas think they know they shit
But they don't
Some M-A's escape
Some won't
Bumpin' heads with niggas
Where you from?
East Side Long Beach, nigga, 2-1
The homie just got paroled
And he got more stories than the Highway Patrol
Tellin' me about the money Suge Knight stole
But don't let that shit leak, 'cause nigga I get swole
Niggas tryin' to get in to get at me
Put me up on game, tellin' me who gon' jack me
But ever since I was a puppy 'til I was full grown
I never had no other dog pullin' on my bone

[Chorus]
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head

[Verse 2]
Niggas in the game be doin' way too much
Akin' tough with this east-west coast stuff
See Me
I'm all about my money mane
I stay fly and dry
I don't get caught up in the rain
Cuz game recognize game
No matter where you from
We all can get dumb, insane and
Turn the party out
Without a doubt
Unless
You them niggas who ain't got no clout
LBC and B what?
Uh, my crew
Cuz uh, we out there smokin' on the krazy glue
Upside yo' head like oops
Snoop's
The shit, that you hear them bumpin' in the hoops
Can't afford it
Homeboy
This is finished
I represented
From V-A to Venice
So when it's timid
And cold outside
Rely on the Doggy Dogg
To put the heat in yo' life

[Chorus]
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head

[Verse 3]
It takes a whole lot
To be number one
I can't walk down the street
Without my gun
I can't trust these niggas fool
It ain't no fun
I'm sittin' up in court
Cuz somebody got dumped
What really counts is how the crowd bounce
Go home and say
Snoop rocked the parte`
Nobody got kilt
It's what got annouced
I guess they got a chance to see Dr. Bombay
But I keep my heat in case niggas get cold
Warm you up with the sheet
Zip you up and roll
Now Doggystyle records is now official
Gettin' money at the Pliz-ate with my initials
Shippin' weapons overseas
I'm makin' G's
What who you make call enemies
But I
See nothing funny about
Makin' money
Cuz uh
We all know it don't grow on trees
So I
Gotta' get what I gotta' get when I can
Up early in the mo'ning wit' the Gap Band
Burning rubber down to get a new car
So don't get jealous when you see me in the
Double R

[Chorus]
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head

[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah, make some motherfuckin' noise
Yo Doggy Dogg you're on, live on stage
Performing tonight
(Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on)
You know! The one and only
Don Corleone
The big homey, y'know me

[Verse 1]
Well if it's on, then I guess it's 'bout time
Let me slide into this OG rhyme
I do mine the way I do mine
And I takes my time when I'm droppin' my lines
I look around, I spot MC's (and they)
All in the place (and they) all wannabe's
Tryin' to make their paper, tryin' to do they thang
But to me they all tryin' to say the same thang
How could you rap over beats that whack?
You ain't reachin' the crowd, you ain't makin' your fact
You ain't droppin' lines that hit the top
You can't make the party go hip-hop
And you can't do your thing without using mine
We get and steal, I see you're on the grind
But I'ma take my time to get my point across
And if you get caught up in the rap shit then got lost
And if you get tossed it's on your own, it's your own fault
See I gots ta get mine, I don't try no song
I just move on, groove on, try to prove on
Then I do mines to do mines and I'mma keep on, keep on, keep on
To get'cha you in a... .smooth type of atmosphere
Sit back and pay attention yeah
You ain't never heard it like that
Uhh, is that right? That's right black
But uhh

[Chorus]
Six minutes (six minutes), six minutes (six minutes)
Six minutes, Doggy Dogg you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on
Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on
Six minutes (six minutes), six minutes (six minutes)
Six minutes Doggy Dogg you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on
Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on

[Verse 2]
I gets my hair whipped on Friday, my day, why they
Even trippin' on me? Yeah the big homey
Gamey Gamey says "Snoop Corleone
Listen to me man, stay away from them phonies
It's niggas like that that get you caught up quick
You gots ta stay focussed Dogg, keep your eye on your grip
Cos if you slip they gon' getcha and they gon' getcha fast
These niggas out for your money man, they tryna get your cash"
I don't give a damn, you gots ta match
You can be from the East Coast and get love cos I ain't trippin' on your ass
I don't smash on niggas who are smaller than me
I smash on niggas who big like the DPGC
Oohwee, I getcha crazy
You gots ta have a stomach for this shit, baby
And if ya don't you won't, you fake the funk
See Snoop is the G in the G-Funk
Now don't do nuttin' that you can't get out of
Uh uh, you know I got big love for the real G's
We make mo' G's, I gots ta have it

[Chorus]
Six minutes (six minutes), six minutes (six minutes)
Six minutes, Doggy Dogg you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on
Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on
Six minutes (six minutes), six minutes (six minutes)
Six minutes Doggy Dogg you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on
Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on

[Interlude]
I got the, I got the, I got the paper
I keep ya, I keep ya, I keep ya cryin
I thought ya, I thought ya knew my nigga
Ya better, ya better ask somebody (Better ask somebody)

[Verse 3]
Uh, it don't quit
Now let me take my time and just get into the shit
I'm just driftin', so swift and smooth
How many niggas make the whole party move like I do?
I can't name nobody
So sit back relax and let the Dogg rock the party
Ain't no party like a DP party
Cos everybody in the DP party's naughty
They acts a fool, old school, new school
Everything is everything, everybody playin' cool
Ain't no set trippin', everybody just dippin'
Bitches gettin' with niggas and niggas gettin' bitches
It's all superb, word to my momma
Ain't no drama, no need for that
You can put your gat back in' your pocket
Unlock it cos Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I plan to rock it
Don't stop, (excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on)

[Chorus]
Six minutes (six minutes), six minutes (six minutes)
Six minutes, Doggy Dogg you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on
Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on
Six minutes (six minutes), six minutes (six minutes)
Six minutes Doggy Dogg you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on
Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on

[Intro]
The dog saw 'im...they tear...they...looked liked they try to tear him off
I said "Oh my God! They want to eat my husband"

[Verse 1]
I was sittin' at the pound about to eat dinner
Had a hard day at the studio, I was gettin thinner
My nigga Sparky-O was playin' basketball
And my niggas in the backyard, 'bout to squab my Doggz
Dirty 

[?] gets CREAM, it's a good scheme
But you know it's all a part of the Corleone team
I squabble...Friday cos that's what I do
Dogg Pound for life nigga, uhh thought you knew
But you didn't, you think I'm kiddin nigga, my Doggz scrap
They get down for theirs, bring 'em right to the back
Hit the gate don't wait and ask the homie Nate
He gotta pit named Tiny mobbin behind him
Now they've got Michael Corleone
Oh, Kurupt he got Lonely the psycho assassin
He likes to smash on, uhh
And ain't no need to reach for heat 'cause you can't get your blast on
Doggz, we keep 'em, busters we sweep 'em
And when it's drama, my Doggz'll bite your mama
We leave you niggas on stuck in paws
And I'ma dedicate this one to my Doggz
Remember that pit, the one I had named Petey?
Uhh, she got killed so I didn't need him
Uhh, it's like that, what about Sweetie?
He got killed too (damn) so I didn't need him
It's a cold thang, but it's a cold game
But when you wit' a Corleone name, it's a cold thang
Cold name, cold game ya got ta get down
'Cause if you don't then you can't represent the Pound
Now it's like a sport
And if I get caught I'm right back in court
So I gots to keep it on the DL and don't yeezell
But you know I gots tha pitbulls for seezell
So if you wanna get get one, holla at'cha boy quick
'Cause I'ma be on the lookout for the sale of 'dem pits
Ask my little homey Technique
I 'came Scarface, Corleone killers, baby boy OG
The homey Tray Deee I give him rock seat
But the rest of the pits they rollin' wit me
We're layin' low in the cut, holstered up in Chino
Scrappy-Du and the crew called the Gambinos
Ma bark and she'll spark up some shit real quick
Just last week y'know what? She bit the shit out of me
Think that bitch is a trick, I had to get coffee
To get the bitch up off me
And I can't tame her and I can't blame her
That's why I had to name her the top Dogg gamer
Man, it's a shame-uh nigga got love for y'all
But I got more love for my motherfuckin' Doggz

[Chorus]
(Sick 'em)
It's just me and my doggz (sick 'em)
Me and my doggz (sick 'em)
Me and my doggz
Beware, beware
Get your Puppy Chow (sick 'em, sick 'em)

[Verse 2]
Now when it comes to my Doggz they stay fly like geese
But as for me I'm Snoop Dogg I'm soopafly like Priest
I unleash my Doggz then I tilt my brim
I'm bout to trip off Locko 'cause he go taken my swim
I think 'cause my CREAMy low, get back to the pound
He gon' be itchin' like hell to put the bite on the clown
And when you look with the frown he gon' get like 1-2
And ain't a damn thang that your ass can do
I think it's 'cause he lost his big homey Don Killer see
Who ran the whole yard and gangbanged OP
And leave your ass red and yeah half-head
He's a damn fool, he'll jack you for pants leg
Don't beg you're dead, and don't dare show fear
Young gangsta fucked wit Scrappy and Red tore off his head
And all he could do was cry like a bitch
His life was a pit and mine's in the shit

[Chorus]
(Beware, beware)
(Sick em) It's just me and my doggz
I keep my heat in my seat, my killers in my backyard
Just in case you niggas wanna fuckin' try to act hard
....deadly serious in East Los Angeles and South Central where people
It's just me and my doggz
Encounter stray dogs on a daily basis and often bare the scars to prove it

[Jewell]
Baby Do You Smoke enough, smoke enough, smoke enough, smoke enough bud!

[Intro: DJ E-Z Dick]
That's right, that's right
Do yo' thang baby, do yo' thang huh
Ah ha ha, yeah... And it don't quit
But bitch please get yo' hand off my grip
Now that's right... and it don't stop right here on W-Ballz
Nothin' but a come up - the real Mackadosious, the real McCoy
That's right, DJ E-Z Dick
This one is strictly for the pimps, players, true money makers
Nothin' but a players ball right here on W-Ballz
Pimp fun under the sun, that's right we doin' it live
With Soopafly, Too $hort, and my main man Doggy Dogg

[Soopafly]
I had this bitch locked on to me like she was way too clever
Man, Soopafly never ever ever
Fell for the do-low, and you know I'm -
Too swift on my toes and it gives a pose
It's too much for me to be givin' to you
Uh, all I'm givin' is some dick in you
Now she agreed, I told the bitch to blaze the weed
Now she blazed it but that ain't all she blew
Hey, I got knocked off on the bar
In my room, got knocked off in the car
Gave it to me until I reached my peak
Baby flipped, talkin' 'bout lovin' me in the week
I said that's too damn quick and that's too damn fast
You've been givin' up too much cock and givin' up too much ass
Nah nah nah, you ain't gettin' me like that...
Soopafly ain't even called the bitch back
Ever since she tripped, I went on one
Stepped in the club, caught me a homerun
Baby was bad and all, she said "give me a call"
I wanted to break that bitch like a law
Picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth
Talkin' 'bout what could pop out and hit the groove
Then she said somethin' about the cost
Man, that same bus stop is where I dropped that bitch back the fuck off
You can't ride my bird, so I kicked that bitch to the curb
You best to believe...
You ain't got no trick up your sleeve that can get with your weave
You thought you had my grip
But Soopafly never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Til' I turned around and whooped yo' ass
(like a pimp, and that's for real)

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
I came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe, lookin' too cute
Tryin' to get my shoot on, so I'm a scoot on -
Over to the next bitch, say her name is Texas
She fly but she wasn't the sexiest
She had a ho with her named 'Bama, short for Alabama
A big bad mama-jamma, now look here
I like big bitches cause they large
And big bitches always take charge
Wanna grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg
Cause you like it tall, go and work it baby doll
Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of
Got a lot of cash for a little love
All they wanna do is take you down to the mall
Floss a little bit and get a t-shirt that say Ms. Snoop Dogg
I don't see a god damn thang that's stoppin' you from buyin' me that god damn ring
It'd look nice on my finger, I'ma buy you a zinger
Cause you make me feel like a real hip-hop singer
Your homegirl - bring her, cause I've been dyin' to meet her
You know I won't cheat her, don't mistreat her
She only get the dick, I'll never ever eat her
But I'll drop her ass cause you know I don't need her...
It was fun while it lasted
You know what they say, big things come in small packages baby
You thought you had my grip
But Snoop Dogg never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whooped yo' ass
Trick beyotch

[Too $hort]
I said beyotch, what are you smokin'
A big fat dick comin' from East Oakland
There must be some kind of misunderstandin'
Hit the parking lot, bitch I'll be standin' by the Benz
You think a nigga rich, bitch
Gold diggin' tramps tryin' to get with this dick
For all the wrong reasons
Niggas ain't trickin' durin' pimp season
But you still jumped your fast ass in anyway
If any other nigga picked you up it'd be payday
I rolled to my house with the bitch
(What'd you do $hort?) Introduced her mouth to my dick
Glad to meet ya, make yourself comfortable
You fuckin' with a dogg bitch, you ain't fin' to come up ho
So you might as well enjoy the ride
And serve this nigga from the Eastside
Not much for the game that I'm sellin'
Ain't no tellin' like Jack told Helen
I know sex sells but I'ma tell you though
Can't spend on shit that ain't valuable
Fucked all night, woke up the next mornin'
Told her I'm a pimp but the bitch kept on
Wantin' me to do somethin' for the time she spent
It's funny, cause now she can't find the rent money
You thought you had my grip
But Too $hort never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whooped yo' ass
(trick beyotch)

I got family members, homeboys
Motherfuckers I look out way before you...

To a place that be, call it LBC
(I'm ridin' wit'cha baby)
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!
To a place that be, call it LBC

[Verse 1]
Now if you tired of the hard work
Tears and sweat
And you breakin' your neck
And you still up in debt
Walkin' round town all strapped in
Niggas be havin' more bad times than Captain Rat did
Two strikes none left, out of breath
Livin' in the city it's a jungle yo
All this deception on top of stress
You havin' more problems than a algebra test
You can't seem to come up, wit yo' money for rent
And now yo' baby momma trippin' she want fifty percent
It's a thin line, between yours and mine
The difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime
Now I know a place where
Ya' might wanna be and I can take you there
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline

[Chorus]
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!
(Here ye, Here ye, Come one come all)
To a place that be, call it LBC
(I'm ridin' wit'cha baby)
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!
To a place that be, call it LBC

[Verse 2]
Oh your homies think you're funny?
Doin' stick ups for moneys
Just to impress the honeys (This is for the honeys)
Got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack
You got two strikes, but you right back up to bat
You all about yo' money and got something to sell
But if you bail for a robber you'll be back in the jail cell
You chillin' wit yo' feet up
Someone hated but baby without the homies and
That's when you got beat up
Because you can't be out there doin' low
And then right gather up yo' crew and roll
Ain't no rules when you out there doin' dirt
Somebody's always layin' in the cut to get ya' hurt
But see, I know a place where
You might wanna be
And I can take you there
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline

[Chorus]
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!
(Here ye, Here ye, Come one come all)
To a place that be, call it LBC

[Bridge]
Here ye, Here ye, come one, come all
To a place that be, call it LBC
(I'm ridin' wit' ya' baby)
Lemme holla to a little home boy real quick
Know what I'm sayin'?
Cuz he travelin' in the fast lane
Stop the life it seem that we are on
Time to slow your roll
Let Doggyland be your new home
Stop the life you save may be your own
Time to slow your roll
Let Doggyland be your new home

[Verse 3]
Doggyland is the town where it's goin' diz-owne
(It's goin' down)
Everything is free
And ain't no HIV. (What?)
And niggas don't kill one another
(Oh really why is that?)
Because a brother is a brother
(And what about the mothers?)
They queens
Righteous
Man
Heaven must be like this
Green aroma like the grass in the summertime
Ain't no peneteneries and ain't nobody doin' time
And oh yeah, I'm the big O-K'er
I'm smarter than the senator
Bigger than the mayor
Heaven on Earth
It's like a prayer
And you can't get in without yo' gold card you got
To be a player
Now you know a place where
You gots to be and I took you there
Pop goes the nine, we'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline

[Chorus]
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!
(Here ye, Here ye, Come one come all)
To a place that be, call it LBC
(I'm ridin' wit'cha baby)
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!
To a place that be, call it LBC

[Verse 1]
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how it's spreading throughout my crew
Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records
"Never Leave Me Alone", "Ain't No Fun", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg began
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female with fly Gucci gear
She wore a big turkish ?rope? with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about, "Baby please, you out here serving stress"
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap
And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these

[Chorus]
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

[Verse 2]
I got a little cousin that's kinda plain
He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
But back in the days he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down with his starks untied
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
They said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he would grow up to be nothing but a gangster
Or either in jail, or someone would shank him
But now he's grown up to their surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bumping Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle

[Chorus]
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

[Verse 3]
I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known to y'all as DJ Warren G
He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse
{scratching} and all that mess
I remember when we first started to rock
He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted
Said "Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted"
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homie's like straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like "Warren, welcome to my store"
Offering him a job, but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught since he busting
The vapors

[Chorus]
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

[Verse 4]
Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
But since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street and said, "Can I be down champ?"
They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected, I ain't run off the set
I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight
I ain't never love no hoes I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
"Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?
We used to see Daz back in the day"
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed

[Chorus]
You caught the vapors
You caught the vapors

[Snoop Dogg]
Brothers is wack by popular demand
Chasin fame and girls livin they life on cruise control
But tell me; what do it profit a man
To gain a whole world livin trife but then lose his soul?
I'm here to wake my peoples up from they dreamin
Kill every demon and snakes that make, even feds steamin
Even though my star gleamin man my life ain't trouble-free
Homie take it from me, Snoopy D-O-double-G

[Hook: Stevie Wonder]
It's no better people who have left the problems of today
Leavin to conclude that for their life is not the way
But every problem has an answer, and if yours you cannot find
You can talk it over to Him, He'll give you piece of mind
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood
Heyyyyyyeahhhheyyyy

[Snoop Dogg]
So much drama on the ave, the copper just laughed
Man the West is wild, that old hit was wrong
Cause out here, momma don't have, and poppa don't have
As God blessed the child that can go get his own
And we struggle hard suffer long, I'm feelin like this life is a trip
Tryin to keep our hearts pure through the sins
But the race ain't to the swift or the strong, the wise or the rich
But to them they can endure to the end and win

[Hook: Stevie Wonder]
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood... yeahhhheyyyy
{*scatting to a harmonica*}
Out here the only free psychiatrist, that's known throughout the world
Is fall in love by walks of all men and women, it's all boys and girls
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood

[Snoop Dogg]
Whether it's soldiers on the cell block or homies on the run
With God, man ain't no obstacles that you can't overcome

[Stevie Wonder]
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood

[Snoop Dogg]
You're so frustrated, worryin 'bout your bread
And some mornings, you don't even wanna get out the bed

[Stevie Wonder]
When you lose too much too baaaaaaad
Just go talk to God and prayyyyy

[Snoop Dogg]
And you's a good women, but you can't understand
Why it seems like you ain't never gon' find yourself a good man

[Stevie Wonder]
When you feel your life's too HARRR-ARRRRRD
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood

[Snoop Dogg]
Mothers on welfare or ladies that's strippin
You under so much pressure, feel like your sanity's slippin

[Hook: Stevie Wonder]
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd!
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood, hmmm
He'll never never let you down

[S.W.] You know that, don't you Snoop?

[Dogg] You know I know it Uncle Steven

[S.W.] Oh I know that too, we know it

[Dogg] Yeah we do

[S.W.] Thanks a lot man

[Dogg] Nah thank you man I appreciate that, you know I love you

[S.W.] And I love you for what you sayin

[Dogg] God bless you

[Snoop Dogg]
And you can catch me down on my knees, askin' the Lord please
Even Jes' pray, hey, with difficulty comes ease
There's disease, poverty, congestion or oppression
I'm askin' for your protection and thanking you for your blessing
Confession is good for the soul, that's how I'm tryna roll
Be one of the greats, see the Pearly Gates now that's the goal
Until then, forgive my sin if that ain't askin too much
Now that's tabernacle, chuuuch!

These streets be-
Walking down the avenue
Crazy!
From Hollywood to South Central
These streets be-
Crazy!
Long Beach to Compton
Always up to no good
Craaaa-Crazy! (Crazy)
Always up to no good
Van Nuys to Santa Ana, crazy
Crazy!

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Have a look outside and take a stroll with me
California lifestyle, you wanna roll with me?
I could take you in and out and where it's gonna be
Now as crazy as it is, you know this home for me
I wouldn't never leave it, you know that's wrong to me
I'ma stay down, you see me on the corners, G
At your local liquor store, gettin' some Optimos
And if I'm out of bounds then I gotta cock the fo'
Keep it on the low on the W-W-W-West coast
Sign some autographs and then I do get ghost
A-humph.. yeah, I love my folks
But half of y'all fools is cutthroats
On the real know the streets'll have you
Guide you, lead you, mislead you, it's fragile
Yeah, see you gradually grow
And when you walkin on my side I think you all need to know...

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
These streets be-
Walking down the avenue
Crazy!
From Hollywood to South Central
These streets be-
Crazy!
Long Beach to Compton
Always up to no good
Craaa-Crazy! (Crazy)
Always up to no good
Van Nuys to Santa Ana, crazy
Crazy!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
On the 110 freeway flow, back to the block
In the seven deuce Coupe, hoppin' hippin' the hop
Sippin on some Hen' with my nephew Infrared
Young pimp on the grind tryna line up some head
Had fun, did, done, on the West we run
Don't matter where you from, if you old or young
Seesaw we raw like ooh-la-la
Fuck the law, we don't get caught, we just do-da-da
Yeah nigga we shakin' the cops
You niggas out there just be makin' it hot
But don't trip if you fakin' a lot
I'll break you, shake you, and take yo' spot
'Cause if you think that you gon' slip through California
Without gettin banged on.. brother you're wrong

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
(Always up to no good!)
I really love my dawg, grew up together and all but he
(Always up to no good!)
Hell yeah I love, knew y'all
That's why I married the broad, but she's...
(Always up to no good!)
We can't hang no more 'cause I'm a balla y'all and he
(Always up to no good!)
Let me tell you about these streeeets
(Always up to no good!)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
These streets be...
Walking down the avenue

Wanna be like the O but you act like a ho
Gotta lot of Patron, with a shot of the malt
Wanna be's wanna beef like nine-ninety nine
You wanna battle me? You better learn how to rhyme

Aye! Aye! Baby girl you know we hit the coot a lot

Tip tiptoe out the back do' now meet me there
You can bring a buddy wit'chu bitch, I don't really care
Just make it snappy, I know you're happy
But hurry up before that white bitch come and get at me
When I first stepped foot all up in this place
You shoulda seen all the hooks that was in my face
Talkin 'bout "I can rap, you need to sign me up cuz"
Don't you know I'm in the club tryna find me some girls?
I give a fuck if you can rap nigga, you'll get shot
I ain't fuckin wit'chu wack niggas, so kick rocks
Ay baby boo, come and holla at my crew
And bring your homegirl too, now make it do what it do (do)

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Pick your money up, now pop a pose for me
Freeze (strip!) Mm, take off your clothes for me
Mm.. you're standin there lookin good
.. I see you stuck in the neighborhood
.. And I can tell that the flavor's good
.. And you should do it like I know you should (do it)
You's a go-getter, a real flame-spitter
Twenty-two hoes and all of 'em came wit her
She the baby-sitter, with the kitty litter
She need a dog in her life and D-O-dub bit her
She's so anxious, baby had to stay around
Don't even trip cause you rollin with a player now
And we gon' do it up, until you get enough
I'll get you drunk, take you home and then I'll beat it up
I'll drop you off, pick it up, I need your hair done
So I can stick it up, dick you up, you know what's up

[Chorus]

[George Clinton]
As I take another chokin' toke of icky sticky stanky
Stuff a bowl, pack a pipe, twist a blunt, roll and light a joint
Lean back and puff slow (slow, slow)

[Snoop Dogg]
Whenever I'm makin a record, I'm gettin into my character
And I'm tryin to portray somethin that I'm feelin to where the whole
World can believe it
Do anybody know my name!?
{*crowd cheers*} What's my name!?
(Snoop Dogg!) What's my name!?
(Snoop Dogg!) Hold on, I want y'all to say my name like this..
(Snoop, Snoop, Snoop, Snooooop)
There are seven wonders in the world, you're about to witness the eighth
({*Jay-Z sample*} Nigga ask about me, nigga ask about me)
You don't believe me? Motherfucker say what?
Aiyyo Cat, roll out the blue carpet cuz
Lemme C-walk on these niggas

Blue hat, blue socks, blue shoes, too cool
Blue car, blue house, blue pit, blue pool
Blue grass, blue Coupe, blue b-ball hoop
What kind of phone you on Loc? I'm on the Bluetooth
Talkin to my nephew, my nigga Boo-Hef, who?
He make pimpin on a bitch look so cool
Old school, old fools, steel on a nigga first
Run up with that punk shit and I fill up a nigga shirt
Do it to it hurt cause it hurt so bad (so bad)
Snoopy D O dub they can't touch yo' swag (yo' swag)
Hallmark ass nigga, better tuck yo' flag
Cause when my music out loco, I come to smash yo' ass
Fuck him, fuck her, and fuck all y'all too
(He wants everything to be right) Cause I'm... (Snoop Dogg)
I'm so hood, so true
And every time that you see me cuz, I'm oh so blue
(To get that you have to stay.. on top of your game)
(And learn the most specific lesson...)
That shit is dope right there cuz...

[Chorus]
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here

[Verse 1]
M.L. and 21st, where niggas worse
Quick to put one in ya first
Before they search your pockets get that china
And where they got ya that's where they gon' find ya
They rollin' out there nigga, that's that real shit
Where bein' slick can get you caught up real quick
Hold up homie, don't let this money blind ya
Cause you won't see me standin' right behind ya
Then it's time's up, that's how we talkin' if he come from the Beach
Better watch them niggas out here if they come from the East
Don't stop if I'm not out somewhere so niggas can see
Cause they don't give a fuck, you stuck if you ain't with me
My city's a beast..
You can't walk through the Beach unless you walk with a piece
You can't talk to police cause most police is like me
They get that cheddar like they want it, take yo' shit in the street

[Pre-Chorus]
They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea

[Chorus]
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here

[Verse 2]
This L.A. County nigga
If you's a bitch then get yo' ass from 'round here nigga
Before they come put bullets in yo' brain
Cause in the hood ain't nothin' really changed
They tryin' to get that paper just like Uncle Sam
And just like Sam niggas just don't give a damn
They mission is to leave yo' ass in pain
Cause they don't give a fuck about a thing
It's a cold game, that's how they talkin' if they walk on the West
Better watch yourself without this star protectin' your chest
These niggas come from nowhere, get to takin' yo' shit
You'll get beat outside the set and then sent home in your stretch
This shit is a mess..
You can't walk in them streets unless you walk with your vest
You can't talk to police cause most police ain't gon' stress
They get that cheddar like they want it with they foot in your chest

[Pre-Chorus]
They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea

[Chorus]
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here

Nah, we ain't like Kobe and Shaq
It's Magic and Kareem nigga, Showtime is back
True legends, two steppin' on you peasants
What y'all thought, y'all gon' need bout two vests'
Cause we he plug, I plug
Mixed shot with the slug, listen here cuh
When I dig dug - play slick and get stuck
But don't play tough boy, go and get it up
Hey yo Cube, tell me this
Why half of the homies gettin' worked by a bitch?
Then they fall in love and get hurt by a bitch
Nine months later cus got murked by a bitch
See I'm just a nigga that ya don't wanna
Reverse the game on her, put the bitch on a corner
Welcome to California

I'm scoopin' you up, ya rollin' or what?
I know what ya came for, I'm rollin' it up
Snoop Dogg nigga, y'all hold up
Never thought Ice Cube would show up
But I'm in the studio gettin' fucked up
With a beat from Battlecat, a nigga lucked up
I got my hustle down, look and learn
See how a hot nigga, cook and burn
A nigga earn like David Stern
Mixed with Big Worm when he off that sherm
Now - bust a u-turn, come by your hood
For motherfuckers that think I went Hollywood
Pick a Coast, it got to be the West
I live out there, from the W.S. nigga

[Verse 3: Ice Cube & Snoop Dogg]
Fell asleep on the plane, and so did he
Woke up chillin' in the LBC
I grew up in the NHC
But that ain't what I turned out to be
Understand me that I'm still a G
Who ain't never spent a day in the penitentiary
Now I'm rappin' with Snoop D-O double-G
And got the whole fuckin' world nigga lovin' me
Yep yep, they love him to death
Cause he walk under water, without gettin' wet
Roll through the neighborhood without gettin' checked
So gone and so blown, are we there yet?
You wonder why I got the S on my chest
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' vet from the Wild Wild West
I used to sing "Bennie and the Jets"
Nigga so boss now I sip Henny on my jets
From the East back to the West

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Yeah, that's right, I like that
The royal penis is clean your highness
Thank you, uh, uh
Snoop, Kells
You know how we get down

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (hey) your boy Kells (hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Let's get this party jumpin', me and Kel' gon' get it bumpin'
They humpin' like when it's over, we gon' all get into somethin'
The Dogg is fresh, Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest but these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess that in the Chi you're so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago, let me get you to this real west
It's real strong, real fat and real long
Doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown, put that shit on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it, t-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this shit crackin', Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone, you might get this dog bone

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (hey), your boy Kells (hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Dippin' low, '64, hundred spokes and chronic smoke
All these ladies on the floor cause they know what we in here for
Dogg and Kelly came to ball, get your ass up off the wall
Let that middle wiggle now make that shit fall
Not just one but all y'all, move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me, work that shit for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it, is that your crew?
Bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it, we can get this after party
Poppin' everybody, got themselves another body
Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot
Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it but now it's known
That this that shit, Kels sing that song, come on

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (hey) your boy Kells (hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
So if you think you got the bomb shit
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
And if you lookin' for some good sex
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
Girl if you ever in the 3-1-2
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
And if you're ever in the 2-1-3
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (hey) your boy Kells (hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"
Yeah man...

"You know it's easy to talk about.. doin somethin
But when it comes down to the action part, well most folks take a little light vacation"

[Snoop Dogg]
Mmmm.. I was just thinkin to myself man
Y'know this Blue Carpet Treatment record is deep to me
And I need to let my
Peoples know how deep it is to me
On some real talk like...

It's like lookin and poppin and seein whoppers and movers
Despite a Guidant, I try to be hard on the low
Nobody's guidance so I decide to sleep by the do'
Open my mind try to slip inside my grandpa's fo'
Driftin off into another stage of life
Nigga paid ya price and big homies made ya fight
Niggas ain't wanna see ya nigga be-bop, no
Toe for toe, I beat a nigga down to the flo'

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past, to move the mind
Many men were eradicated by music minds
Open ya eyes and take ya time to visualize
And once ya decide to move ya mind in due time
It's so erotic, if it ain't exotic, it's gettin naughty
Freeze and groove, get rowdy, rowdy; girl move ya body
It's melodic, I'm bein honest and modest
You done fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it

[Snoop Dogg]
Fuck that nigga, I'mma do it right
Thangs ain't movin right, I don't think that you would like
For me to be mad, saying, "Niggas can't stand me"
Sittin at home, watchin motherfuckers at the Grammy's
Wishin I was there, naw nigga I don't wish no more
I'm the big cat, fish in the bowl
Basically you hear these rappers out here using my flow
They need Snoop on they song to make they shit official though
In dismissible, police a nigga, modern day KMI
Takin my time, chronolizing my rhyme
Writing my rhyme, tryin to get intellectual
Directing the weather, makin my negative records more intellectual
Tryin to change the direction of flowin
And sayin, born sayin, "You know I get live-er when I get fluent"
Ain't been nobody to change game since King came
Same thing, same lane, hit it and ya get banged
Word to Rob Bass, just make the music dope
Thangs don't change man, it's so remarkable
And they don't know how to do it cause they don't flow that way
Go that way, roll that Jay
Roll my tape and take me back the day you were phony
You're so into what ya doin but you can't get into it
You can't talk and now ya ruined but y'know I'mma do it
And now you doin it, they booing like, "You blew it! You blew it!"
I'm dippin through the universe, make 'em move the verse
Through the Luda-verse, hit the boota first
You can never beat a ho, lemme show you how to treat a ho
If you likin me, follow me, you so believable
(So...) Got a way to get his own music out
Record executive, bounce ballin and actin bad
Take my time, with my.. great mind
Take 'em out, make mine, kicked about it
Thanks to niggas who might make it illegal
And not rival the Beatles, and rock, rockin my peoples
And fly, fly like eagles been doin the shit like liters
And hittin y'all with heaters and walkin in my Adidas
I continue to bust, then I switched up to chucks
Givin niggas a puff, still givin it up
Beanie Sigel what up? Real niggas is up
On the scheme with my team, yeah Daz and Kurupt

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
We bust 'til we buss 'em up
Lay Low, I know they told you not to fuck with us
Layin and playin, and sayin man, walkin in vain
Anxious for fame, my nigga tryin to walk in my lane
And tryin to.. walk in my shoes but they just don't fit
You couldn't spit the shit that I spit cause I'm the shit
And this is it, legit, let's split the chips
And fix, and move the work and hurt that bitch
I'm through with this! {*crowd cheers*}

[Snoop Dogg]

Beware of the big mash, you knew he wasn't finished with yo' ass

Nuthin' you can do, can't help you out
So fall down, Dr. Dre done fell back into the House (DPG)

We don't want it, you bitch it don't matter
It's all about the money, if you got it, throw that up (throw it up)
Hmm, ride along with ya' set (Eastside)
And watch us, you motherfuckers can't do that yet
I skirt out, I hit a corner on ya, fuck doin' halfway
I do it to the fullest, I'll probably catch bullets on my last day
I hope a prayer come through so I can eat
My shoes lookin' like about a buck fifty each (but I ain't trippin')
But I'mma come up, that's on my momma
Now that's on me, 'cause that's a burden on my momma
And she done suffered, the shit's gettin rougher
And when the goin' get tough, the tough get a strap
And low-ridin's on the map Snoop Dogg's number 1
The whole Pound's got snaps (nigga)
Yeah, tell me, have you seen us?

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Uhh, actin a fool, nigga done paid his dues
And got my receipt in return, so I recline the leather seats
With a trunk full of beats and
Chronic filled leafs to burn
No concern as I make a left turn on the 'Shaw ('sup nigga)
Off of Jefferson, feelin' awfully naked at the U-turn
Shit, left my gun, that's a no-no
Fuck Bernard Parks, I'm my own po'-po'
Nigga talkin' dirty after dark, startin' stuff (what's up nigga)
May have to mark up a nigga FUBU logo
Lettin off like a Ruger promo
And even though I'm about the hoes, I never doubt the dulos
You know the rule goes, where there's a ho there's a hater
(Fuck them niggas) Well there's some hoes over there
And I concentrate on the haters later (what)
Give these bitches numbers to the pager
Invite 'em to the next Dre function as party favors
Who said pimpin's hard labor?

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Bendin' corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it
However you want it, nah however you need it (we just dippin')

You've been runnin your mouth, tellin your girls how I'm fuckin you
What I got in my house, the things I don't do for you
Better be careful cause your girls wanna come too
Gave Keisha her groove back, now I’m up in you
And did you tell Tamika
I was wondering why my homie baby momma was blowing up my beeper
You's a cold thang, I told you keep it on the DL
And if I decide to hit it again it's at the motel
Tellin them broads about my furniture and jewels
Work on my table and how holding my clientel
Damn do it hit the spot
As pretty as you is no more blessins for your trot
But I might for the sake of my swipe
Hit it like it's supposed to be hit if the vibe is right tonight

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Ain't no big deal until that ho squeals
Now I got to keep my fuckin woman from around that ho
Take a fuckin rubber everywhere that I go
Keep her from her family cause her cousin know
She say she fuckin Nate but she can't prove it though
Next time you can't come if you got a loud tongue
I know I got a big dick, shouldn't loaned it to a trick
This time you act like a nigga who just did a crime
You got your ass busted now you facing time
The money's in the pack, it's on the drivers side
But nigga you was with it so when you be quiet
Now you facin twenty all by yourself
The nigga you was with man he rich as hell
Even though this story is a fairy tail
Act like you that nigga bitch and please don't tell

In the Beach, where the paper's long
But as for me
I only G when I'm buss'n rocks
Dogg Pound
(repeat)

Verse One:
Nigga, you know you gotta have heart
I told you niggas from the start
If I'm still in it, I'm in it for life
Always stay down and keep my motha fuckin' game tight
Cause ever since Elementary, or was it Pre-school Quik?
I was a motha fuckin' fool
I had to have papers it was routine
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens
I, shake niggas
Break Niggas
Make niggas, shank theyselves
For fuckin with my wealth (nigga)
And it'll catch on
Cause if it don't, it's on
And, cuzz, I ain't even slippin' when I'm all alone
Sittin' back loungin' in the Chronic Zone
Clown me ya gone
Surround me, it's on
Get the money you're gone
My niggas' paper so long
They call him Snoop Capone
So if you want me, get me, got me
Should have shot him
But now they call me Snoop Gotti
And that's all I LBC
Betta yet, that's all I DPGC
Chorus (2x)

Verse Two:
I'm slappin' bones
In front of my home
Choppin' game on the phone
Smokin' a zone
Big 6, big 5-3's with ya bitches
My girls in the kitchen, and she cookin' up some fish and
I'm blastin' at this nigga that was trippin'
Ol knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin'
But I wasn't slippin', I was on deck
I blast his ass, peck peck now his shirt's wet
Dead, gone, light's out
With no remorse, I had to take him out
I'm laughin' at this shit cause it was funny
Fuckin' with the dogg I take your life and your money
And then I dip to my spot (dip dip)
And set up shop with yo rocks (motha fucka)
And nobody gon' speak on the 8-7
Cause still, all doggs go to heaven

Chorus (2x)

Verse 3:
I'm freestylin'
C-stylin'
Snoop and Quik comin' through we fin' to take you to the island
Where the bitches and the bud come free
And everybody listen to the D-O double G
Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts
People be lovin' me because I drop cuts
That makes sense, it make big money
See Snoop is that nigga who don't hafta play funny
But I got yo honey, up under my wing
Cause she like the song that the bow-wow sing
I'll put her in a cling
I won't buy her a ring
But I'll put her on the ho-stroll to make me some green
And even if she never even saw me befo'
There's just no way that she can tell me no
You know my game's unbelievable baby (uh uh, uh uh)
And it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me
Chorus (2x)

West coast, gangsta shit

Nigga make the whole dogg world wanna holla
The way they do my life and I'm steady tryin' to do more right
So trife your life could disappear
And if you ain't careful who you fuckin' wit nigga
Now reappear come here come near so you can hear what I spit
So sick and tired of niggas standin on that "G" shit
And just because you on starz wit some khakis
And think your rap style can out rap me and now jack me
Come here nigga slap yo self
Thats probably why yo shit still sittin' on the motherfuckin shelf
And mine sold out ever since it came out
Blue carpet roll out, #1 no doubt, mo' clout, down south, mixin' it up
With dem niggas that don't never hesitate to bust
What you niggas tappin' on my front door for?
Hmm, oh you lookin' for yo ho? (you heard)

And let me let you know nigga my heat goes boom

[Chorus]
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

[Verse 2]
I'm back on the scene, chopping green, captain on the team Call me commissioner nigga so just listen up
Look like you bored and our boy's bridges
He hangin' wit dem niggas but dem niggas straight bitches
Left a nigga hangin' at the club when it was scrap time
Then a week later gave him a shot on in a rap line
Now they in a New York rap time
Rapper turned snitch, now you livin' on a main line
Money's too tight to mention but let me mention
When dem niggas in da kitchen find out he's snitchin'
They gon' get him, and when his homies find out he's snitchin
9 times out of 10 dat nigga gon be bitchin
(you know what) you know what? Transformin' is switchin'
And oh yeah informin is snitchin
But I ain't one to tell you ain't heard from me
I'm just an MC tryin to stay sucker free

[Chorus]
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

[Verse 3]
Look here fool, I know this game in and out
And quit tryin to tell me bout dem niggas down south
Don't try to slide with that west side love shit
That dove shit, eat a dick bitch
I can read you from the giddy
I read you, I took you to my home and I fed you
And led you upstairs to a room with 37 niggas
That was strapped up hatin', waitin' on you
Nigga, you the victim
We don't don't pick 'em, we just stick 'em and when once we get 'em, we got 'em
We try to rid the streets of creeps and freaks like you
For all y'all snitches and bitches we gonna do the world a big favor
Cuz niggas like y'all be fuckin' up the gangsta flavor
And oh yeah it ain't no west coast thang
Cuz niggas out of town got birds that sing

[Chorus]
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

[Verse 1: Silkk the Shocker]
Yo yo, from that DPG nigga to the CP3

If I'm lapsin you glad niggas'll get mad then, hit the flo'
Gotta bag me some dank so I, hit the sto'
In the winter it's the Hummer for the summer it's the, six-fo'
Got niggas mad at me (why?) Cause they can't get no six
Bitches upset with me (why?) Cause they can't get no dick
I'mma be on top of the game whether I'm, broke or rich
I don't stop once I'm on top I just drop mo' hits
I'm in the club with the thug, I just pop mo' Crist'
Tell Snoop to get the Coupe his new shit I just, gots to go get
Cause when I cock my shit, usually I pop my shit
Tell all you teary eyed females gettin over-offended
Cause I don't jock no chick
I'm the Boss, and I don't follow no person, I follow Jesus
Y'all blame a bunch of kids, so I gotta roll my Adidas

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
It's a gangsta gangsta ride

Mash ya, gat ya, drip-drop the hatchet
Keep the party crackin, while I'm steady rappin
This game we run, y'all know what's happenin
We back in effect, we got the heat on deck
I'm slidin down South with a blunt in my mouth
I catch a plane out East and try to make some peace
I'm hangin with my niggas in the projects
The homie's throwin a party, I gotta get back West
Oh yeah -- that's right, we are the best
No Limit DPG Southwest connects, ya feel me?

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
It's a gangsta gangsta ride

[Intro]
(Uncle Snoop Dogg.)
Yo' whassup, whassup
(Could you read us a bedtime story?)
Alright, alright
Ya'll get my ash tray, get my lighter
I'm a read ya'll a gangsta bedtime story
Come here, sit on my lap
(Okay.)
Check it out

[Verse]
Great scotts, it's hot today
He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest
He fell to the floor with his hands in the air
His vision gettin blurry but you know I didn't care
Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck
So I ran up on this nigga and I shot him in his neck
Shooting like a muthafuckin Vietnam vet
Riding on this nigga disrepectin my set
No stranger to danger ain't no warning shots
On the hood gettin hot, anybody can drop
You better have a spot up in town my nigga
Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga
Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat
Grease strikes you out with no get back
Wishing for a steak eatin on a Kit Kat
And your bitch ain't shit the little homie hit that
Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me
Let's go get a stick nigga dip with me
We can ride on some niggas for nuthin at all
Even if we cool with 'em, fuck 'em let's go get 'em
LBC in this muthafucka cuz
I had to show these niggas what time it was
We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns
We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves
Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip
Or better yet, strapped a clip
To a muthafuckin' nine millimeter for heater
And put the ride down out of G two seater
You need a nigga like me to get your game like that
Young nigga, you could get a smack for that
I'm that nigga who brought the afro back
And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack
Before I came out niggas was wearing slack
I brought the curl back and the golf hat
The black poker sack and this scandalous raps
The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks
I brought snaps to the game nigga
Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga
S-N double O-P fa sho
I do my thang way cutthroat on the down-low
Oh once upon a time in the LBC
There lived a OG from the DPG
And all the little kids looked up to him
All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him
But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel
And all they hated on him because he was way to real
I don't know why but he's just so fly
But I gotta end this story by saying goodnight

[Verse 1]
Celebrate, grab a drink and put a blunt in the sky
Worldwide, nigga it's 1999
Shit out of control, sign of the times
I ain't had this much fun since '79
I was only eight then, hadn't been to the penn'
Just a young nigga on the front of a swing
Playin' football up in Poly High
Too young to ride but it's still Eastside
Homicides didn't happen much, niggas wasn't rappin much
It's 99 nigga, shit, I know you strappin up
Hell motherfuckin yeah, nigga wanna see the end
So next year we can do it all again
Same dogg channel, same dogg time
Only the strong will survive in 99
So much drama and delusion, my conclusion is confusing
Drippin on my memories, twisted off my music
Tryin to make my people do things, oh yeah we do's it, we do's it
Here's my number baby girl don't you lose it
It's smoky in this motherfucker while we cruising
And Eastside niggas is the shadiest (shadiest)
But them Westside niggas is the craziest (craziest)
Summertime on the grind, baby let me shine, let me shine
Roll with this shit, I'm cold with this shit in my prime
Nigga done time and I never dropped a motherfucking dime

[Chorus]
Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First thing first, cuz, stop smoking cess weed
You are what you smoke, nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say
But somehow someway

[Verse 2]
Better days ahead, Freddy's dead
And Betty said Eddie's a fed
Sweaty in bed with a nine to his head
And he fuckin with this hoodrat that he met up in dance
Betty gettin mad cause Eddie wanna share
But look at how you livin for a minute then compare
I love confetti, I always stay ready
Keep some killers by my side and some riders by the telli
I'm ready to do now, who now, you now
Eddie wasn't ready when they drew that, booyow
Two down, with just one gun
My nigga, and who said killin wasn't no fun
I sit alone in the zone with a face of stone
Live the life of Al Capone or Don Corleone
Tragically casualties and fatalities
And all kinds of funny ass niggas coming after me
My grand pappy once sat me on his lap and he said
Sonny get your money 'fore you end up dead
I never really understood what he said
Until my motherfucking dogg took a slug in his head
Cold way nigga gotta learn his lesson
Slow down and go down, shit you know now

[Chorus]
Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First things first cuz, stop smokin cess weed
You are what you smoke, my nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say
But somehow someway, you got to make a better way
(Somehow someway)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(Yeah, better days ahead)
Better days ahead
(Better days ahead)
Better days ahead

[Outro]
That's real
I feel your pain nigga
I used to be just like you nigga
Before I got off in this rap shit
Shit, nigga did anything to get a dollar
You know, but one thing I never did do
I ain't never beg a nigga for nothing or ask a nigga for nothing
I went out and got my own ya feel me?
So from me to you, man to man
Better days ahead my nigga
Shit, keep the faith and get your hustle on
Cause I'm a get mine regardless
Nigga whether I'm rapping or on the streets
I gotta have it

Bangin oldies in the livin room, sippin brew
Schlitz Malt Liquor was the thing back then
My momma was my homey my daddy, and my best friend
Ask the Twinz, them my lil locos to the end
And Warren G and Nate Dogg, shit them my true friends
Time and time again, I'mma spit this rhyme again
She the queen in my life, and I'mma make sure she gon' shine again
She taught me everythang, but she didn't charge a fee
She taught me everythang, except how to see a G
For the nine months you carried, I hope you bury me
Instead of the other way around, and I put that on Dogg Pound

I love you momma.. (throught all the drama, I love my momma)

* song fades *

[Intro]
Yeah, this shit right here sound like a love song
(she was in love)
A gangsta love song, you feel me? Check it out
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, gangsta, uh-huh!
Have you ever had a pretty, young saditty
Black female with chips, from the city?
Her momma got ends, and her daddy got ends
And she liked to give me ends when I'm out with my friends
Good girl - why do good girls like bad boys? (I don't know)
When I was a kid, growin up, I never had toys
And I think that she can figure that shit out (why?)
Cause every time she came to pick a nigga up
Shit, she'd take a nigga out
Roll around town, ask the pound, they know, look
Baby was my thang, nah, she was my low-low
Bought my first Rol-o, and then we took a photo together
Man I hope this thang last forever
We been together six months, and we ain't argued yet
She lovin a nigga, steady buyin me shit
And don't say shit when I dip with my click
And understand, when I'm down and out
May need some help with some chips
Her mother approved of me, but her father he don't
He probably won't, shit Pops ain't no punk
Daddy's little girl be in a gangsta's world
Buyin me houseshoes and khaki blues, California curls
No matter what her father say, baby gon' see me
It's like a jungle sometimes, that makes me Wonder like Stevie
Believe me, when I say that baby was in love with a thug
In love with a thug

[Chorus]
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Daddy I'm in love with a gangsta
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Momma I'm in love with a gangsta
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Daddy I'm in love with a gangsta
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Momma I'm in love with a gangsta

[Verse 2]
Mm.. I'm caught up in the middle and I don't know what to do
I caught eight months in the joint, behind my crew
That I gotta do and I'mma miss you Boo
But I'mma write you every night and call you on the phone too
Whatchu gon' do? "You know I'm gon' stay true
But I'mma go ahead to college like my father want me to"
Well um, off to my cell withcha body on my mind
And I'mma call you back tomorrow round the same time
I'm on the mainline, 9500 for short
On another phoneline, holla'n at my other ho
This bitch ain't sayin SHIT, cause the bitch ain't SHIT
Old fat golddiggin-ass county check receivin BEOTCH
I bail up in the Day Room and get in a scrap
Niggas watchin Soul Train and I wouldn't turn it back (man fuck y'all)
Never caught slippin, always on strap
And now I'm back in the hole with no motherfuckin get back
Sit back and contemplate, and think about baby
And hope she don't get caught up in the world that's so crazy
But while I'm up in Wayside, and she off in college
She gettin a little mo' than a schoolgirl knowledge
Cause gangsta-ass niggas go to school nowadays
I tried to make you wait, but I can't change yo' ways
She fell in love with the local G
And now they both in the penitentiary, she didn't mention me

[Chorus]
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Daddy I'm in love with a gangsta
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Momma I'm in love with a gangsta
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Daddy I'm in love with a gangsta
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Momma I'm in love with a gangsta

[Snoop Dogg]
*inhales*
Ayyo, ayyo, ayyo Quik check this out dog
You know mothafuckers be doin' way way too mothafuckin' much
You know? That's real
Just like baby right here, she doin too much

Now if that nigga next to you got a rented car
And he actin' like it's his but you know it's not
Say he doin' too much, yeah nigga you doin' too much
And if that stuck-up bitch got the bar posted-up
She actin like that hair's hers but you know what's up
Say she doin' too much, yeah baby you doin' too much

I gave my kinfolk the keys to my Suburb
I told em "Hit the side and slide and get the herb"
But guess who's callin', Pipedream Patty
Made that nigga park my whoride beside the alley
Forget about that nigga though (fuck that nigga)
Fuck that nigga yo
But I can't forget about him 'cause he taught me everything I know
Oh no Joe, walkin' down the wrong lane
Tootin' on that cocaine, fuckin' wit that wrong thang
Niggas like that (what), get things like they want it (damn)
Then fake the funk, doggonnit
Now loc, look at this predicament
You smoked out and can't be trusted, I can't kick it wit
Niggas like you, used to be in my crew
Goddamn, they don't make niggas like they used to
I remember Marley Marl and the Juice Crew
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce-deuce
Now if you're doin' for your family and you can't stand it
'Cause you know these mothafuckers tryin' take advantage
Say they doin' too much, yeah nigga you doin' too much
And if your kinfolk broke and he smoke dope
And he need to catch a mothafuckin' different stroke
Say he doin too much, yeah Joey you doin too much

We parlay, parlay everyday DPG style
We might throw a pool party every once in a while
Now in fact we gon' do one this weekend
Let's see how many hoes me and my nigga Rose can weed in
I believe in, sharin' the cock
Also, I believe in comparin' the cock
Look, don't knock a nigga like me (why?)
'Cause she love the way I just beat up the pussy
Not just knee deep, she was totally deep
When she went down on me
She blew a nigga socks off, got a nigga rocks off
Ooh wee, baby you's a freak
Put my homie up on game like a gangsta
But my homie fell in love and he banked her
Ain't that a trip? Now we in a twist
Back in the county wit the red ribbon on his wrist

Now when a nigga hit his girl and she don't hit back
And he get his third strike wit no get back
Say he doin too much, yeah homey you doin too much
And when the homey in the pen, doin a sin
And his girlfriend fuckin wit his best friend
Say she doin too much, hell yeah she doin too much
I'm livin' up in the hills, wine sippin' wit mills
I'm havin' major type of paper, I ain't trippin' off bills (still)
Show me some respect and accept my coolness
And don't mistake my kindness to mean I'm foolish
Use this as a warning, 'cause I'm startin'
To figure it's some niggas think I'm soft as Charmin
Pardon me, 'cause I ain't mad when you get bent
But I hate when fools mistake me for U.S. ?spray?
Friends and family, gettin' after me like repo
Eat, smoke, choke then want me to throw 'em a c-note
You doin' too much when you clutchin' on my touch-tone
Callin' strays over nigga leadin' months gone
Conversate for fo' hours, wastin' mo' power
And only get to hit a cold shower
You fakin' like you're makin' more moves than Simpson
But frontin', pushin' buttons, doin nuttin' but sin

And when a nigga on yo' phone, runnin' up yo' bill
Tryin to tell some hoodrat bitch how he feel
You know he doin' too much, yeah nigga you doin' too much
And when your baby momma cryin' 'bout she need some milk
And you heard some other nigga did been at her tilt
You know she doin too much, yeah baby you doin too much
That's real

Weak rappers with titles after twelve (Ding!)
Hit a bell that's what I'll feed on!

Bringin harm, to the calm, and, come be alarmed
It's the African, oh, you wanna battle again?
I'll turn, you and your mans, to my yesterday plans
Oh, damn! Toting two pistols like Yosemite Sam
Oh, man, he grand! Loud as the Southern band

Silkk the Shocker, KLC, purple mask life, like Snoop and Dre nigga
Y'all can relay it to a label ten times
Get a label contract for MJ figures
It ain't where you from; it's where the FUCK YOU AT
N-O-L-I-M-I-T, Top Dogg, and I'm fucking with that!

These niggas be pissed off at me
Cause their old lady call me they baby
MC's pilin up and crowdin up, but I'm their FAVORITE
The type to fly buyin a Z-28 IROC
And chop you in your motherfuckin face (HIII-YAH)
Your album ain't tight, WHAT IN THE FUCK IS YOU PUSHIN?

[Chorus]
We all shinin' stars

You gotta put your mash down when you wanna get to the top
The game is stuffy like Puffy don't stop
I thought I told ya, nigga I'm a soldier
No Limit Lieutenant, yeah I did it

Won't let no bitch niggas close to me
From my head to my feet I'm protected from harm
Cause I'm a muthafucking shining star, you feel me

You party with a D.P.G

[Chorus]
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much

Now I've been waitin fo' the chance fo' me to do my thang
Cause when I GO OUT baby, I GO OUT with a bang! (bang bang)
Thursday night, 'bout to hang out at the House of Blues
Fresh attire, new shoes, plus a new, hairdo, WHOO!
I'm mesmerized by the music that they bump in the club
I see my homegirl man (whas' happenin, whas' up?)
Lookin like he need some love
And everytime I see him, he been givin me the eye
Cause he my type and I'm his type and plus we love to ride
Imagine that, off we left
Hot sweat hot sex it ain't like we just met (ahh, yeah, yeah)
Why she trust me? Since his girl went on a little trip
I made his sweat drip, he made me strip
It ain't my fault he in a fucked up relationship
That just go to show, you never know who you dealin with
Love over friendship, that's why I live my life trustless, yeah

[Chorus]
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much!
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much! Heyyy

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Hmm, I spent the night at the homie's house, shit
Slept in his livingroom, on his couch
Nigga high'n a motherfucker burnt out (shit)
Before you know it, god damn, the homie chirped out (damn!)
And he ain't said shit, he just dip in his Seville as he peel
Left me at the pad with his girl, damn, what the deal?
Now baby got a gown on, gettin her clown on
As she slid downstairs, now she takin me down home
Cheatin in the next room in the homeboy's bedroom
Am I wrong? Shit, on and on and on and on
Now what am I to do if you was me and I was you
His baby momma in my face, she shakin poo-poo, what would you do?
Trust is a motherfuckin loco, shit
And so is temptation, and I don't know what I'mma do
Come on through (come on through) so I can cum on you (cum on you)
Shit if the homey knew (if the homey knew) if the homey knew
(if the homey knew)

[Chorus]
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much

[Sylk] Hey now

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, in the L.B.C
On the Eastside, off of 2-1 Street
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, peep game
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
"We've got Fubu, and you've got rags!"
And even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows
Girls used to say, "Snoop, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit"
Welllll, one day, up the Avenue
There was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew
He said ah, "Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess"
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said, "Step-dad, may I?"
And before I could finish, "Hell no!", he replied (Cinderfella!)
My brothers were goin, they were gettin down
Even Pops was goin for a piece of the crown (Cinderfella!)
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
"We can and you can't," is what they taunted (nana-nana-nah-nah)
They all stood there, laughin in my face
And as they walked out they said, "Clean up this place!"

[Chorus]
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

[Verse 2]
Well I shrugged, I hissed, they all tried to diss
And I'd get them back if I had one wish
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, "What's up, Dogg? My name is Herb
I'm your fairy Doggfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish"
I said, "Herb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle, all the rest"
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
And I was jumpin in my body: a slick silk suit
On my feet was some white tube socks
And a fresh pair of Chucks from the Foot-lock
I showed him my sack, and don't you know
With a snap, the sack became some doe-doe
Once again his hands began to flow
Then he changed my skateboard into a six-fo' (damn!)
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, "One more thing before you leave...
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self"

[Chorus]
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

[Verse 3]
I jumped in the low-low and went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
And by the time I left the stage, the people were hyped (well alright!)
The princess was starin, while holdin a drank
Reflected from her eyes was gold tank
She waved her hands like, "Hello! Hi!"
Then gave another gesture like, "Come here, guy!"
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
The bitch was swingin from the hard knocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Chucks on one of those steps
For the six-fo' I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess screamed out, "Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!"

[Chorus]
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

[Verse 4]
I was almost home when my luck ran out
And there went my suit, my doe sack and clout
My fresh low-low, also went too
And there was no denyin that my night was through
The one All-Star, the freshest thing I sported
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded
Made it to my pad, no time at all
Went to my room, or better yet the far wall
Hid the shoe away, still feelin pleased
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's
Early the next mornin, when I awoke
I threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat
Slid into the front, my family stared at me
Sayin, "Wasn't that you? Nah, it couldn't be"
They kept askin me if I did my chores
My butt was saved by a knock at the door
"Who is it?", that's what my brothers barked
"The princess," this sweet voice remarked
She said she was lookin for a certain man
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
The family ran around with their heads in the air
Bringin her shoes from everywhere
She just shook her head, a nod of relief
And said, "No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, Chief"
I ran in the room and got my shoe
And said, "Is this the one you're referring to?"
Well she said, "Yes, and you're so cute
But where's your doe-doe and slick silk suit?"
I put on the shoe, then there came a flash of light
And I was wearin shit, from just last night
Looked out the window, saw the six-fo'
Yelled to my family, "I've GOT to go!"
We drove up the Avenue, the princess and I
And in back of me, I heard my family cry...

[Chorus]
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

Man I do it big! ... Get it in
Man I do it B-I-G, big, B-I-G, big

[Soulja Boy]
All I do is stunt, eatin rappers up for lunch
I got a million albums sold, congratulations, well done
Soulja's heatin like a drum, and I made the club go dumb
It don't matter where you from, long as you stay stuntin
I press a button in my Coupe and watch the car transform
I turn the haters on you, blast my speakers 'til they learn
I spit flames on the mic fryin you bound to get burned
After I finish stuntin then you know it's Mini-Me turn
S.O.D., is the label, on 50 rich the fable
Tryin to stunt like me, but I know that you ain't able
From internets and cable, from my hood to Asia
I hit the stunt button now watch me count my paper
I cain't, hear a hater, I cain't, be one either
Rubbin ice on my ice cause my chain got a fever
Stunt like Evel Knievel, Beanie hat no Sigel
Good over evil, I pull off in a Regal

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Soulja Boy]
My style is so different, my flow is prolific
Girls on my tip cause I'm a pro at business
And I don't be limpin, I ain't never been shot
But I will shoot any rapper who, come try to take my spot
My buzz is so hot, I got the internet locked
Ask them wannabe goons who tried to run inside my spot
I hit the stunt button and all of that stopped
In my whip hittin donuts for them hungry ass cops
Is that all that you got? Man my chain is enormous
Shittin on the beat, like the beat is a toilet
I see they tried to ignore it, but they gotta face it
A million dollars cash bitch I spent that on my bracelet

[Hook] - repeat 2X

Life, Dre, y'know
Just doin my lil' thang

[Intro]
I done seen a lot of things in my life
I've been in a lot of situations
Y'know that I just think that the world should hear my story
You know I am saying? I think I'm here for a reason
All of what I have obtained so far has been off the strength of me
Y'know grindin so hard and, and stayin so determined
And I just think that, my story has to be heard...

[Intro: Ester Dean]
What do you want from me cause I've given you everything
What do you need from me - are you not happy with anything?

[Soulja Boy]
Party like a rock star, hit 'em with the hot bars
Fast like a NASCAR, lime like my dad's car
I deserve a Grammy; will I fly away? Orlando, Miami
I don't have time to rhyme
But I do have time to grind
S.O.D. pirates, I don't need a hook
My lyrics illustrated verses taken from a book
I understand the fans, supply and demand
Crunk at command, fight and withstand
Lyrics from a true legend, livin life through God's blessing
Big papers, long acres, top flight, no security
Black ice on me, call it jewelry
Yahh trick yahh, and we call it magic
My style may change if you call it drastic
Money so long and we is the measure
I love my business and I love my pleasure
Live now, die later, internet genius
Self proclaimed he a critically acclaimed
For the fortune and fame, he'll run through the rain
For a million in change, takin over the game
18 years old with a drop top Phantom
Kidnap the world 'til they pay my ransom
DeAndre Way, look what's tatted on my face
Fo' words to say - I deserve a Grammy

[Hook: Ester Dean]
What do you want from me cause I've given you everything
What do you need from me - are you not happy with anything?
Is it not good enough?
Am I not good enough?
Have I not gave enough?
What do you want from me?

[Ester Dean]
Tell me what you want

What do you want from me cause I've given you everything
What do you need from me - are you not happy with anything?
Is it not good enough?
Am I not good enough?
Have I not gave enough?

Tell me what you want from me?

Bubble Chevy dawg, back in the day I break 'em all
Breakin all the laws, only the fools follow the rules

[Verse]
Comin' from the city where we rep them Steelers
On beats, I'm a monster, iller than Godzilla
Yeah, my skin vanilla, I'm hotter than chinchillas
Hittin' Vegas for the night and cop a villa
Get my lyrics from L, and my soul from J Dilla
Chillin' with the sour 'cause some smoke'll kill ya
I'm just me, tryna cover all these magazines
And bitches dressin' up for me like it's Halloween
A little old school flavor when it's Jerm on the drums
Thoughts to bullet points like it's words from a gun
I'm spittin' fire and it's burnin' my tongue
Bitches wanna fuck and they heard that I'm young but they still do
I'ma stick around, call me mildew
Go and stay in Bel-Air like Uncle Phil do
Get rich, gon' buy me a mansion
Then get my parents a nice crib up in the Hamptons

[Verse 1]
I've seen it and I liked it much
I told myself I had to have it
I looked, but I do not touch
Wondering why does she walk like that (that, that)
There was something in those jeans
Locked up
It was dying to be free
And it was bound to happen, oh

[Pre-Hook 1]
Didn't have a pick up line to use
I was way too cool, way too cool
And instead I hoped you're watching me too
Like I watched you

[Hook 1]
It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, I couldn't run away from you
No, I couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

[Hook 2]
That's a good look baby, baby
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look

My eyes must have been on drugs
Your color and your shape looked so crazy
I couldn't see the floor beneath you
But, baby, I could see you pacing on
Thin air, mid-air, no
Long brown hair swinging, no
Red bottoms in your high heels
Like I'm watching a Blu-Ray

[Pre-Hook 2]
You in HD baby
I didn't know what to say
I was way too cool, I’m way too cool
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
And I, you know I'm hoping you're watching me too
Oh yeah, you know it's true

[Hook 1]
It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, I couldn't run away from you
No, I couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

[Bridge]
I wanna stare at you some more
When I can feel you in my soul
I'm not looking from the outside
I could feel your hands in mine
I wanna grab on your body
Touching that booty
Feeling on your booty
Say that you love it
And you said it's all mine

[Hook 1]
It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, I couldn't run away from you
No, I couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, couldn't run away from you
No, couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

[Hook 2]
That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look
That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look

Billy Shears!

[Verse 1: Ringo Starr]
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Verse 2: Ringo Starr, John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr, John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

[Verse 3: Ringo Starr, John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr, John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

[Outro: Ringo Starr & Lennon/McCartney/Harrison]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends

[Verse 1]
Growin up wasn't easy for me
For my momma for my daddy, life just wasn't happy at all
Started up when I was eight years old
And it blew up right behind me, God just couldn't find me no way
The way I feel (I feel) just can't compare (compare)
Don't wanna be here, God take me there
Cause now I'm livin on the road, goin to do show after show
My mind free and my eyes closed, I go back to Ridge Road

[Chorus]
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
This 850 life is all I know, think I'll go back to Ridge Road
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
My big brother Sheed and Nathaniel, think I'll go back to Ridge Road

[Verse 2]
Slowin down wasn't even an option
So I chose to speed it up - yes I needed love always
You would hold me down when things got poppin
Had my back in situations, without hesitation fa sho'
The way you go (you go) is the way you know (you know)
So I guess I'll go, to the studio
And even if I'm on the road, goin to do show after show
My mind free and my eyes closed, I go back to Ridge Road

[Chorus]
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
This 850 life is all I know, think I'll go back to Ridge Road
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
My brother Nadi Black and Dilla-Oh, think I'll go back to Ridge Road

[Verse 3]
Then I'm gone and you say you miss me
Like I never paid attention, never tried to listen to you
But now I'm home and you wanna diss me
Sayin I don't have no respect, a Leon County reject, no way
The way you go (you go) is the way you know (you know)
So I guess I'll go, to the studio
Cause even if I'm on the road, goin to do show after show
My mind free and my eyes closed, I go back to Ridge Road

[Chorus]
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
This 850 life is all I know, guess I'll go back to Ridge Road
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
Can't forget about my homeboy Dough, guess I'll go back to Ridge Road

[Refrain]
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
'Bout to hit for life until I go, guess I'll go back to Ridge Road
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D

R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D

[Outro]

[Verse]
Last night I had a dream about you
In this dream, I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
The kind of feeling I've waited so long
Don't stop, come a little closer
As we jam, the rhythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong with just a little little fun
We were dancing all night long
The time is right to put my arms around you
You're feeling right, you wrap your arms around too
But suddenly I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it, this dream was all gone

[Chorus]
Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true
Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
We'll make this dream come true

[Bridge]
Why don't you play the game?
Why don't you play the game?

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Baby! I've been waitin for you to come home
Cause I done cleaned out the backseat
Cleaned the top, and put some new 24's on the Brougham
Lately! I've been waitin to try something new
Cause we done did every last one of yo' fantasies
But we ain't did nothin I wanna do
Cause we done did in in the elevator (been there, done that)
Now it's time to do it my way (I know you want that)
And pullin your hair, won't even compare
To what I'm 'bout to do to you on this highway

[Verse 3: Shawna]
Face down, ass up - that's the way I like it rough
Cloud it up, back it up - driver's seat to the passenger
Back in the back, all in the act - smack, smack, smack, smack
Shinin' like that that good old kid, hands on the window foot on the wheel
Face in the seat, wait for the beat, rockin 'n rockin 'n makin it squeak
Stop, stop, stop, stop - what'chu gon' do? Somebody might see
So make it fast, take it slow
Break it down and make it roll
Take control, make it swoll
Now one mo' time cause here we go

[Hook]

Now take it down slow, let me take it down low, let's go
So you know it's about to go down now
Speed it up baby, can't slow down now

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
You got a nigga on swole like a T-Pain show in Tallahassee
Never put that ass on hold, I'm too nasty
Don't never underestimate T-Pain
You shoulda known when I was bitin' on your belly button chain
That you 'bout to receive some of that guitar tongue
Tryin' to tell me not to do it, like you don't want none
Tryin' to sit up in the bed, tryin' to act all calm
Actin like it ain't good, tryin' to hold that cum
But you know that I'm the best, you know you Teddy Verset'
This the first ten minutes, you ain't feel shit yet
I got the whips, I got the chain, I got the handcuffs too
But ain't none of that for me, I'm 'bout to handcuff you
That's the freaky shit I keep on skeetin' shit that leave you leakin' shit
That take her ass back to the church preacher and deacon shit

[Hook: Ray Lavender]
And now I know, you didn't expect me to go low

[Verse 1]
Baby (sit down)
I got something that I need to say (right now)
Before the rumors spread and make their way (around town)
I thought I'd be a man and tell you first
But I know it's going to hurt
Baby please let me explain (let me explain)
It happened all the sudden out of control (ohhhh)
She had my heart and would not let it go (go-ohhhh)
I'm not tryin' to say that it was okay
Or that I didn't do it

[Hook]
But I gotta tell the truth (the whole truth)
With my right hand up
(Cause I don't wanna lose you) It's time to man up
(I just gotta be the one to tell you)
Baby believe me when I say
You don't wanna find out the hard way

[Verse 2]
Baby (if I) would've never seen her walkin' down the block
I probably would have not, pulled over and asked her
If she needed (a ride)
But I noticed she had makeup on her eyes
Then she started to cry
I said baby, please explain (please explain)
She said her man put his hands on her
He was outta control (outta control)
And she really need someone to hold and not let go
And then she looked into my eyes just like you do
Then I imagined she was you

[Hook]
Now I gotta tell the truth (the whole truth)
With my right hand up
(Cause I don't wanna lose you) It's time to man up
(I just gotta be the one to tell you)
Baby believe me when I say
You don't wanna find out the hard way

[Verse 3]
Baby now I wish that I, was a magician and I
Could make all of this disappear
And baby I wish that I, could go back in time
And trust me baby, we wouldn't be here (we just wouldn't be here)
But you've been so good to me, how could I do this to you?
And I never meant to hurt you, how can I prove it to you?
I'm just tryin' to say what's been on my mind
Cause it hurts you

[Hook]
I gotta tell the truth (the whole truth)
With my right hand up
(Cause I don't wanna lose you) It's time to man up
(I just gotta be the one to tell you)
Baby believe me when I say
You don't wanna find out the hard way

[Hook]

[Bridge: T-Pain]
When she was suckin on me, well I was lickin on her

When I crush rappers careers they get left inna depression
You betta stand clear when the mic's in my possession
And I bust every year cause that's my obsession

[Intro]
I wanna dedicate this to my strugglin' bro
Keep pushin' on, keep pushin' on

[Verse 1]
First of the month, check late
Got nothin' to do
I'mma roll me a blunt, got drank
Call me a ho' or two (yeah)
Now I know that it sound like I'm livin' on the edge
Only you ain't hear the worst
Got the whole house running on the generator
No good food in my frig-i-dator
And I'm late for work

[Hook]
Don't that sound bad, horrible
No inspiration, no goals
I know it sound like, I wanna die
And I know I'm so miserable
But this just so happens to be
The best day of my life

[Verse 2]
Now I don't wanna confuse you, hurtin' on the inside
But I won't let you see
That's why every little dollar, and every little penny
Goes to puttin' that outfit on me
Cause Imma stay fresh to death
Dressed to impress the rest
You know how I do it when I do it
Imma show you how to do it
So you can do it for somebody else
But I still got the house on the generator
No good food in my frig-i-dator
And I'm late for work

[Hook]
Don't that sound bad, horrible
No inspiration, no goals
I know it sound like, I wanna die
And I know I'm so miserable
But this just so happens to be
The best day of my life

[Bridge]
My life, my life
Bottle of Patron, big cup of ice
Drink, drink, drink; drink, drink, drink
Ain't talkin 'bout that bullshit
I'm talkin' like a newspaper
I'm talkin' 'bout the newspaper full of weed, like the whole thang
And Imma roll it up and smoke it
Imma let you think about you
And in the end, you gotta let me do what I do

[Hook]
Don't that sound bad, horrible
No inspiration, no goals
I know it sound like, I wanna die
And I know I'm so miserable
But this just so happens to be
The best day of my life
Don't that sound bad, horrible
No inspiration, no goals
I know it sound like, I wanna die
And I know I'm so miserable
But this just so happens to be
The best day of my life

[Intro]
(Six-pack!) Some people like thighs {ayy-yeah}
(Fo'-pack!) Some people like backs {yeahhh}
(Six-pack!) Some people like booty {ayy-yeah}
(Fo'-pack!) Ain't nothin wrong with that {yeahhh}
(Six-pack!) Ain't nothin mo' groovy
(Fo'-pack!) Then when that stomach moving, yeah
It's the reason that I'm singin this song
Because I don't got nothin else to bust a nut on
{Ohhh-hoo-ohhh-ho-hoooo}
Whoa whoa whoa whoa-ohhh, yeah!

[T-Pain]
Tight in the front, fat in the back, that's the way I like it
My fire's ignited, I love it when she ride it (ride it)
Cause I can see the part of her that I love the most (most)
I know they're feelin me from coast to coast (coast)
Cause I like that tank top, that cut off shirt
Manm I like everythang, that show that belly ring (yeah)
Them crunches just got me punchin the wall
And the pilates got that body lookin good up in them boy-short drawers (woo woo)
But that stomach (woo woo), yeah (whoahh) and you don't know

[Hook: T-Pain]
Shorty got that six-pack, fo'-pack you already know that

Six-pack, fo'-pack you already know that

It's the reason that I'm singin this song
Cause nothin else turns me on like yo' stomach
Whoa whoa whoa whoa-ohhh

[T-Pain]
Oooh I like the way it move when she do only when she dances
Got your boy thinkin 'bout gettin in them pants

She make me wanna throw some D's on her - okay~!
Mman I like that tank top, but I'm about to take it offff

Them crunches just got me punchin the wall
And the pilates got that body lookin good in the mall short drawers
But that stomach, yeah (whoahh) no, no, no!

[Hook]

[Tay Dizm]
Gal! Tay Dizm, I got it, Tay Dizm
I got a bad little roni and you already know
And I'm addicted to the way that she make her stomach roll
5'6 and she thick and lil' momma lovin this dick
And all the sex and the love that we makin it be the shhhh
She got me on that sprung, and she not on that dumb
One that I'm seriously thankin of settlin down with
But could it be my mind playing tricks on me, she got me excited
The way that she move her stomach put my mind back in Hawaii
I never been a freaky type, but yo' stomach's lookin right
Ay gal, ay gal, ay ay!

[Hook]

[Intro: T-Pain]
Oh fo sho'
Ay, Jaylil
Who that, who that, who that girl is over there?
Damn, though, she can't be a ho

Fuck that, I'm 'bout to go talk to her
OoooooWEEEEeeeee~!
That's right
Back at it mayne, okay
T-Pain, ay, ay, ay, HEY!

[T-Pain]
Man I got a thing for a girl that I don't even know
E'rybody in the hood say she's a ho
But I don't think so, I'mma tell you anyway
I can turn a ho into a housewife any day
It can even go the other way around
That's because of the pimpin from Teddy Penderazdoun
Okay here come the manipulation
I ain't tryin to please her with my money precipitation
Aviatic watch and the Aviatic piece
Yellow bracelet and the King Johnny teeth
I can be like: "Hey miss lady! I got a black and grey Mercedes
I got a Cadillac car and a Cadillac truck"
Man, but I got a feelin' she really don't give a fuck
I want to get to know her
And if I give her the keys to my crib
I'mma sit her down and show her she can

[Hook]
Lay down and let me lay wit'chu
If you stay around then Imma stay wit'chu
Ain't no way I'm leavin girl, let's talk about it
Imma gonna show you how to love somebody

[Verse 2]
She a cool, super duper down-ass bitch
If she was a cup of liquor I would down that bitch
Like (dun dun dun dun dun dah dahhhh!) Nappy Boy Queen
God damn, I done crowned that bitch
Two weeks, and we done fell into it
And ain't nobody have to tell her to do it
I'm askin the questions about befo' me
I had to make sure I knew she wasn't a ho
She just lookin fo' a nigga that can treat her like Pain
Take her to the movies, buy her brand new thangs
But niggas treat her like: OH SKEET SKRRRR!
Never heard of 'em
Ripping up a phone number
Never heard a word from 'em
But she ain't got to worry about them niggas
Live life shawty you can do without them niggas
Ay, but what can I say? Tell them kiss yo' ass
Cause at the end of the day you got a place to

[Hook]
Lay down and let me lay wit'chu
If you stay around then Imma stay wit'chu
Ain't no way I'm leavin' girl, let's talk about it
Imma gonna show you how to love somebody

[Bridge x2]
Don't listen to them, they just jealous of you and me
I care less 'bout what you did, that ain't got nothin' to do with me
I'm in love, you are too, so let's do what we do
And baby girl Imma show you how to love somebody

[Hook x2]
Lay down and let me lay wit'chu
If you stay around then Imma stay wit'chu
Ain't no way I'm leavin' girl, let's talk about it
Imma gonna show you how to love somebody

[Intro: T-Pain]
Epiphany
E-P-I-P-H-A-N-Y
Definition 1: the manifestation of a supernatural being
Definition 2: a sudden moment of insight or revelation
Marinate on the though
Tallahassee love

They thought I left, man
Yeah, T=P-A-I-N, let's go man
T-Pain, man, I'm back in this thang
You already know what it is
Hey, Tallahassee got my back, though
This how it went, aye

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I used to hit the stage with my J's on
40 brought me to the West Coast
Now it's khaki suits with my shades on
I'm on the same shit, game on
But on Sundays I'm like Diddy - grown man with one chain on
When I come back, niggas see my growth
They see my momma's two cars and both of my daddy boats
They see the Sean John coats tag
They see my wife hoppin' out the Lamborghini with the Coach bag
I'm gettin' paid for nuttin'
Sittin' back, drinkin' lemonade, chillin' in the shade; I'm stuntin'
Makin' hits when I graze the button
Go ahead and put them two baby seats in my Escalade
It's nothin', I'm gettin' money
Learned from the past and the future
Learned not to never stab a nigga that'll shoot ya
Even though my pockets gettin' fatter
I'm still gettin' Tallahassee love, and that's all that matters
Jay Lyriq get 'em

[Hook: Jay Lyriq]
I've been there, and I've been back
But somethin' here, always brings me back
So when I'm here, I get that (Tallahassee love)
If you love me, then I love you
My people love it, when I come through
So when I do, I get that (Tallahassee love)

[Outro: T-Pain]
It shouldn't have to be like this man
I don't know how I did it either, ,man
I know you haters hatin' this right here, boy
Second time around, let's go, man!

[Verse 1]
The world keeps spinnin', with or without me
And I know, that's hard to believe
And now I'm in a box, with nothin' around me
Cause I found, a girl that'll get on her knees at ease
And all the while, I'm knowin' that my homies will clown me
Cause I fucked her - and didn't have a rubber on me
It seems I had to find out the hard way
That the girl, that I found, in the crowd, she had H-I-V
And now she next to me like

[Hook]
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la (Suicide)
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la (Suicide)
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la (Suicide)
La-la-la, la-la, la, la la, la-la-la

[Verse 2]
One, two, three, four, five, six million ways
To leave, this whole wide world, so cold
Stuck on my ass, I been drinkin' for days
And I got the nerve to put that Bonneville on the road
Got that thang on me, and a couple kilos
A bag of ecstasy, and a pound of that dro
But I guess, I had to find out the hard way
Cause I done came, to the End of the Road
And now I'm in the mirror like

[Hook]
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la (Suicide)

Goin' on a trip, I'll be back home, boy I'll see you later
Goin' back to a time when I know everything was straighter
And everything's great now but back then it was greater
And I don't need no clothes I go in just what I'm wearin'
Matter fact I just go back to what I used to wear then
No matter how bad the weather, everything back then was just so better
I can dream, it's a simple thing; I'm buildin' a time machine

[Hook]
Back back back back back back back back in time
I can dream, it's a simple thing; I'm buildin' a time machine

[Verse 2]
Yeah, goin back to a time when this music shit was more than business
Back to a time when I knew my niggas was down and if they still is
And I didn't have to worry 'bout what I got on when I go outsizzide
And I didn't have to worry 'bout what kind of car I got when I rizzide
And I didn't have to have 22's, 24's or 26's
And I didn't have to be forever surrounded by a million bitches
No matter how bad my life was, I still got love no matter how mad my wife was
I can dream, it's a simple thing; I'm buildin' a time machine

[Hook]
Back back back back back back back back in time
I can dream, it's a simple thing; I'm buildin' a time machine

Anything she want for some kisses

All she doin' is actin' like she want me
She cuttin' off all my homies
Even all my other ronis

See I been thinkin' bout it lately

So we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin' what I want to
With nobody tellin' me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feelin' so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But I'm feelin' kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her
Now I'm leavin' quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well it all come down to her

[Chorus]

Forgot to mention Twista, Pimp C, Paul Wall
MJG and Too $hort? You know we had to remix this

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
She got the body of a goddess, everybody know that
Super cute face and the booty so fat
I'm in the club dropping twenty-four stacks
Because I'm in love and that's a well known fact
Like, yeah she know what she doing
If a nigga chillin' with a stripper then he never going back home
She got eyes butter pecan brown, can't leave it alone
Liking the way she break it down to the flo'
Need to get her over here and show her where
It's about to go down right now
I'm in love with a stripper

[Verse 2: Twista & (T-Pain)]
You wanna know when Twista be on fifty
T-Pain invited me to Magic City
I'm about to have some fun, 2000 ones in these pocket
All my Evisu's with me (yeah)
I like the way mama get up on the table (yeah)
I like the way she pour the honey in her naval (yeah)
I like it when she smack her fatty and open it up in front of me
I wanna touch it but I ain't able
The one leg she can shake at the top of the pole (ooh)
Look at the laffy taffy when she pop, she roll (ooh)
I wanna get her in the bed right after they close
When I do a video, you get the popular role (ooh)
In the V.I.P. they get a lil' lap dance
Come and grind on the willy of a black man
In my ear tellin' me the shit a nigga like to hear
While I nibble on ya nipple like Pac-Man (oh oh)
She freakin', she lickin', she rubbin'
Then she pulled my dick out and start suckin'
All because I be the Twista
Even though T-Pain told me shorty was a freak
I asked her can I take her home (down right now)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm in love with a stripper, she really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper, gotta get her, I, gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club
I'm in love with a stripper, she really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper, gotta get her, I, gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club, I'm in love with a stripper

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Uh, young Pimp C
I'm a P-I-M-P, trickin' ain't in my pedigree
It really ain't bout no square love, it's strictly cause she payin' me
She be wantin' to lay me but I can't do too much of that
Cause even though yo ass fat, freakin' off ain't where it's at
But I can show you how to get out there and get it
You love yo daddy, I know ya with it
That's why I got love for you
Cause you get out there and do what it do
Workin' my piece and work the pole
Break the trick, you gotta pay to roll
Get the money, break 'em off
And we in the Benz and we scratchin' off

[Verse 4: Paul Wall]
Paul Wall baby
It was love at first sight when I seen that ass shakin'
And bout fifty dollars later, it was love in our makin'
Ya simply won my heart when I saw the way ya work that pole
And when you bent over, ya had my wallet in a chokehold
I saw you in your birthday suit and and baby it was fate
When you give me a lap dance, it's like we gone on a date
But I feel like ya cheatin' on me when I see ya dancin' with other guys
I'm runnin' low on ones, I can't lie I'm in love baby

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm in love with a stripper, she really think I'm playing, I'm playing

I can't stay out this club, I'm in love with a stripper

[Verse 5: R. Kelly]
I must be the first man to ever fall in love with an ass
Gonna roll down on my knees and ask that ass to marry me
That booty makes me forget about any chick I freak with in my past
Plus we got a lot in common: she’s a stripper, I’m a freak
Make me wanna grab it, I got a habit, I gotta have it
You can call me the man of steel cause that ass is just like a magnet
Damn, you got me so in love, can’t stay away from this club
Every time I find myself rollin up on them dubs
I been around the world, see booty all the time
I never seen a booty so so purty so so fine
(Err-rr-rr-rr) Comin’ down the pole
No secret why I’m here cause girl you keep my donk on swole
When it drop drop, when it pop pop, and when it hop hop
Baby the way you doin’ that thing don’t you stop stop
I wanna stick it, wanna kiss it, if I could
I’d put my whole damn head in it, cause I’m in love with a stripper

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm in love with a stripper, she really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper, gotta get her, I, gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club, I'm in love with a stripper

[Verse 6: MJG]
I'm in love with a stripper, I need to get some stripper counselin'
Cause I'm the first one in the front row when they make a stripper announcement
I think I'm fallin' in love with the one with the most ass
Thin, lil' bitty waist, I'mma go and buy that bitch a Volkswagen
MJG, pimp tight, no mo' tippin', stop the bill
If I come in here one mo' night, I'm gon' need Dr. Phil
But I'm a G, I'll step back and tell them bitches outright
Ain't no way I can turn a stripper to a housewife

[Verse 7: Too $hort & T-Pain]
The last girl was pretty (oh) but she wasn't fine as you
She was sexy (oh) but she couldn't do the thangs you do
She could dance (oh) but nothin' like the way you move
I used to want her (oh oh) until the day I saw you (oh oh)
I'm a grown ass man I thought I seen it all
Doin' all that on the pole and didn't even fall (oh oh)
And right then, I knew exactly what it was
(What's that?) I wanna fuck the baddest bitch in the club

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm in love with a stripper, she really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper, gotta get her, I, gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club

[Verse 1]
Ooh, it's dark in here, it's hot in here
Girl, what are you doin' to me?
Baby stop, not in here
I got a presidential suite
Baby why don't we, just get out of here?
Where we can have the freedom to be
Secret lovers under covers, have no fear
'Cause

[Chorus]
I'm about to blow ya mind, blow ya mind, blow ya mind
Girl, I'm not here to waste ya time, waste ya time, waste ya time
Girl, I'm about to blow ya mind, blow ya mind, blow ya mind

Girl, I'm about to blow ya mind

[Verse 2]
Baby now we're here, what you wanna do?
I'll let you thank about it for a minute
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm here to satisfy you
Ain't gotta worry about me gettin' it in
And your mind your body and your soul comes first to me
It's time to make the temperature rise
But we had to get away, don't want nobody to see
Why?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm about to blow ya mind, blow ya mind, blow ya mind
Girl, I'm not here to waste ya time, waste ya time, waste ya time
Girl, I'm about to blow ya mind, blow ya mind, blow ya mind
Girl, I'm not here to waste ya time, waste ya time, waste ya time
Girl, I'm about to blow ya mind

[Verse 3]
Baby was it good? Satisfactory?
I got time so we can do it again
Was it good for you, like it was for me?
One is not enough, let's get this second one in
Baby I know you've been, you've been dyin' to see
If I can do your body right
If your baby could, fulfill that one fantasy
One more time

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm about to blow ya mind, blow ya mind, blow ya mind
Girl, I'm not here to waste ya time, waste ya time, waste ya time
Girl, I'm about to blow ya mind, blow ya mind, blow ya mind
Girl, I'm not here to waste ya time, waste ya time, waste ya time
Girl, I'm about to blow ya mind, blow ya mind, blow ya mind
Girl, I'm not here to waste ya time, waste ya time, waste ya time

It's time to do it

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I can't handle all these bills and payments
This stuff is overstressin' me
(But I still gotta do it)
Baby mama put me on them papers
Ain't get nothin for the baby
(But I still gotta do it)
I can't keep on workin' (keep on workin')
Seems like the whole world's ignorin' me
(But I still gotta do it)
Schemers keep on jerkin' (keep on jerkin')
Everybody's gettin' more than me
(But I still gotta do it)

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
So pass that drank (pass that drank)
Pass that 'dro (pass that 'dro)
It's my life (it's my life)
So what'cha think (what'cha think)
What'cha know? (What'cha know?)
It's alright, and I paid the price, but still

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm goin through a lot
Sittin' on the block now (through a lot)
Slangin' out my drop now (through a lot)
Nobody's helpin' me, whether they see it or not
Goin through a lot
Hittin' on the cops now (through a lot)
Wishin' they would stop now (through a lot)
Nobody's helpin' me, whether they see it or not
Goin through a lot

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
All this music got me goin' crazy
Can't even concentrate on my family
(But I still gotta do it)
Plus I gotta go through all this family hatred
I don't know why everybody's hatin' me
(But I still gotta do it)
Even one of my homeboys thinkin' that I'm bangin his lady
I don't know why he would think that out of me
(But he gotta go do it)
To all the NappyHeadz - I got you baby
We 'bout to make it, yes indeed
(And we gon' get through it)

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
So pass that drank (pass that drank)
Pass that 'dro (pass that 'dro)

It's alright, and I paid the price, but still

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm goin through a lot
Sittin' on the block now (through a lot)
Slangin' out my drop now (through a lot)
Nobody's helpin' me, whether they see it or not
Goin through a lot
Hittin' on the cops now (through a lot)
Wishin' they would stop now (through a lot)
Nobody's helpin' me, whether they see it or not
Goin through a lot

[Verse 3: Bone Crusher]
I work a 9-to-5 shawty and they think it's funny
And how they feel that my stress don't count homey
I hit the beat like a cop when I hit the block
Because my baby's gotta eat, I ain't gon' ever stop
I see them laughing at me fo' cause my pants raggedy
And my do' won't shut and my car's shaggy
But I see the future man like I'm Nostradamus
And in my heart all I see is a future star
But in my brain ain't nothin but these notes man
But y'all don't feel my stress - y'all don't understand!
The next step is the pistol and it goes down!
Mellow it out fat boy, just calm down
And sing your song.. and sing that song
Cause God gon' make a way for me to get my hustle on

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm goin through a lot
Sittin' on the block now (through a lot)
Slangin' out my drop now (through a lot)
Nobody's helpin' me, whether they see it or not
Goin through a lot
Hittin' on the cops now (through a lot)
Wishin' they would stop now (through a lot)
Nobody's helpin' me, whether they see it or not
Goin through a lot

Sittin' on the block now (through a lot)
Slangin' out my drop now (through a lot)
Nobody's helpin' me, whether they see it or not
Goin through a lot
Hittin' on the cops now (through a lot)
Wishin' they would stop now (through a lot)
Nobody's helpin' me, whe
