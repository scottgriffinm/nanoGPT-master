 hear that trumpet sound
I'm going to rise right out of the ground
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
Well, look way down the river
And what do you think I see
I see a band of angels
And they're coming after me

[Chorus]
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

[Verse 2]
Well, look down yonder, Gabriel
Put your feet on the land and sea
But Gabriel, don't you blow your trumpet
Until you hear from me

[Chorus]
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

[Verse 3]
Well meet me, Jesus, meet me
Meet me in the middle of the air
And if these wings don't fail me
I will meet you anywhere

[Chorus]
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

[Verse 4]
Well meet me, Mother and Father
Meet me down the river road
And Mama, you know that I'll be there
When I check in my load

[Chorus]
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

[Verse 1]
I've wept for those who suffer long
But how I weep for those who've gone
Into rooms of grief and questioned wrong
But keep on killing
It's in the soul to feel such things
But weak to watch without speaking
Oh what mercy sadness brings
If God be willing

[Chorus]
There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day

[Verse 2]
Fire rages in the streets
And swallows everything it meets
It's just an image often seen
On television
Come leaders, come you men of great
Let us hear you pontificate
Your many virtues laid to waste
And we aren't listening

[Chorus]
There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day

[Verse 3]
What do you have for us today
Throw us a bone but save the plate
On why we waited until so late
Was there no oil to excavate
No riches in trade for the fate
Of every person who died in hate
Throw us a bone, you men of great

[Chorus]
There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day

[Outro]
It's buried in the countryside
It's exploding in the shells at night
It's everywhere a baby cries
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

[Verse 1]
Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on, and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning

[Chorus]
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times

[Verse 2]
I'll get along, you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me

[Chorus]

[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Chorus]
Rowboat, row me to the shore
She don't wanna be my friend no more
She dug a hole in the bottom of my soul
She don't wanna be my friend no more

[Verse]
Pick me up
Give me some food to eat
In your truck
Going no place
I'll be home
Talking to nobody
You'll be strange
You'll be far away
Big fat moon
And my body's out of tune
With the burning waves
She's a billion years away
Dog food on the floor
And I've been like this before
She is all
And everything else is small
Pick me up
Give me some alcohol
In your truck
Playing the radio
I'll be home
With the gasoline
You'll be stoned
You'll be far away

[Chorus]
Rowboat, row me to the shore
She don't wanna be my friend no more
She dug a hole in the bottom of my soul
She is all, and everything else is small

[Intro]
(One, two, one, two, three four)

[Verse 1]
The lights in the harbour
Don't shine for me
I'm like a lost ship
Adrift on the sea

[Chorus]
The sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine how I wish
You were mine again, my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

[Verse 2]
Oh, how did I lose you?
Oh, where did I fail?
Why did you leave me?
Always to sail

[Chorus]
This sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine how I wish
You were mine again, my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

[Verse 3]
Oh, what I'd give just to sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more
Come to my rescue
Oh, come here to me
Take me and keep me
Away from the sea

[Chorus]
Sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine how I wish
You were mine again, my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

[Outro]
Sea of heartbreak
Sea of heartbreak
Sea of heartbreak
Keep your intentions pure don’t be scared don’t mince words
I don’t mince words
My narcissism keeps me level
Keeps me straight no curve balls
Got no curve balls stay straight here
You wish that I was less than I am
Less than I will be but I won’t
No I won’t
Kismet, serendipity
Reflections
I am him and he is me
Kismet… Serendipity

[Verse 1]
You wired me awake
And hit me with a hand of broken nails
You tied my lead and pulled my chain
To watch my blood begin to boil

[Chorus]
But I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run

[Verse 2]
Too cold to start a fire
I'm burning diesel, burning dinosaur bones
I'll take the river down to Stillwater
And ride a pack of dogs

[Chorus]
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run

[Verse 3]
When the forest burns along the road
Like God's eyes in my headlights
When the dogs are looking for their bones
And it's raining ice picks on your steel shore

[Chorus]
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run

[Verse]
So blue
Lonesome too
But still true
Rosie
Haunts me
Makes me think of you
You're the one rose that's left in my heart, dear
I love you, adore you, I do
Each night in dreamland we wander along
Telling love stories anew
When from a blue sky a black cloud came rolling
Breaking my heart in two
Oh, we ought not to part
I have said from the start
You're the one rose that's left in my heart

[Outro]
Oh, we ought not to part
I have said from the start
You're the one rose that's left in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
How many times have
You heard someone say
If I had his money
I could do things my way

[Chorus]
But little they know
That it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten
With a satisfied mind

[Verse]
Once I was winning
In fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for
To get a start in life's game
Then suddenly it happened
I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far
With a satisfied mind
Money can't buy back
Your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person
Is a pauper at times
Compared to the man
With a satisfied mind

When my life has ended
And my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones
I'll leave there's no doubt
But one thing's for certain
When it comes my time
I'll leave this old world
With a satisfied mind

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
It don't hurt anymore
All my tear drops have dried
No more walkin the floors
With that burning inside
Just to think it could be
Time has opened the door
And at last, I am free
I don't hurt anymore

[Chorus]
No yesterday night
I wanted to die
The day you said we were through
But now that i find you're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's true
I forgotten somehow
That i cared so before
And its wonderful now
I don't hurt anymore

[Verse 1]
Take one fresh and tender kiss
Add one stolen night of bliss

[Chorus 1]
One girl, one boy, some grief, some joy
Memories are made of this

[Verse 2]
Don't forget a small moonbeam
Fold it lightly with a dream

[Chorus 2]
Your lips and mine to sip the wine
Memories are made of this

[Bridge]
Then at the wedding bells
One house where lovers dwell
Three little kids for the flavor
Stir carefully through the day
See how the flavor stays
These are the dreams that we will savor

[Verse 3]
With His blessings from above
Serve it generously with love

[Chorus]
One man, one wife, one love for life
Memories are made of this
Memories are made of this
Memories are made of this

[Verse 1]
All day I've faced a barren waste
Without the taste of water, cool water
Old Dan and I with throats burnt dry
And souls that cry for water
Cool, clear, water

[Chorus]
Keep moving, Dan, don't you listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can you see that big, green tree
Where the water's running free
And it's waiting there for me and you
It's water, cool, clear water

[Verse 2]
The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water
Cool water
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water
Cool, clear, water

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
"Lord, have mercy on me"
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in Heaven looked down

[Verse 1]
I went down by an old country church
I saw the drunkard stagger and lurch
And as he reached his mother's grave
I saw that drunkard kneel and pray

[Chorus]
"Lord, have mercy on me"
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in Heaven looked down

[Verse 2]
"Bring my darling boy to me"
Was his mother's dying plea
And as he staggered through the gate
Alas, he came just one day too late
Three years have passed since she went away
Her son is sleeping beside her today
And I know that in Heaven his mother he'll see
For God has heard that drunkard's plea

[Chorus]
"Lord, have mercy on me"
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in Heaven looked down
I know that God in Heaven looked down

[Verse 1]
There's a southern accent
Where I come from
The young'uns call it country
The Yankees call it dumb

[Chorus 1]
I got my own way of talking
But everything is done
With a southern accent
Where I come from

[Verse 2]
Now that drunk-tank in Atlanta
Was just a motel room to me
I think I might go work Orlando
If them orange groves don't freeze

[Chorus 2]
I've got my own way of working
But everything is run
With a southern accent
Where I come from

[Bridge]
For just a minute there I was dreaming
For just a minute it was all so real
For just a minute she was standing there with me

[Verse 3]
There's a dream I that I keep having
Where my mama comes to me
And she kneels down over by the window
And says a prayer for me

[Chorus 3]
I got my own way of praying
And every one's begun
With a southern accent
Where I come from

[Chorus 4]
We have our own way of living
And everything is done
With a southern accent
Where I come from

[Verse 1]
I gave my woman half my money at the general store
I said, "Now buy a little groceries and don't spend no more"
But she paid ten dollars for a ten-cent hat
And bought some store-bought cat food for that mean-eyed cat

[Verse 2]
When I woke up this morning and I turned my head
There wasn't a cotton-picking thing on her side of the bed
I found a little old note where her head belonged
It said, "Dear John, honey, baby, I'm long gone"

[Verse 3]
When I heard a whistle blowing and the big wheels a-turning
I was scared as I could be
I put on my overalls and I headed for town
Gonna bring her back with me

[Verse 4]
I asked the man down at the station if he'd seen her there
I told him all about her pretty eyes and long blonde hair
He spit his tobacco and said, "I'll be dad blamed"
"I believe I did see her leaving on the eastbound train"

[Verse 5]
I bought a round-trip ticket on the eastbound train
I was broke as I could be
But when I come back, I gotta buy another ticket
Gonna bring her back with me

[Verse 6]
Well, I got off the train somewhere in Arkansas
And I worked up the guts to call my mother-in-law
She said, "I'll tell you where she is if you act right
She's working four-to-twelve at Trucker's World tonight"

[Verse 7]
Well, when I walked in, she saw me and she took off her apron
And she grabbed her going-home hat
She bought a ticket with her tips, now we're curled up on the sofa
Me and her and that mean-eyed cat

[Verse 1]
We saw houses falling from the sky
Where the mountains lean down to the sand
We saw blackbirds circling 'round an old castle keep
And I stood on the cliff and held your hand
We walked troubles brooding wind swept hills
And we loved and we laughed the pain away
At the end of the journey, when our last song is sung
Will you meet me in Heaven someday?

[Verse 2]
Can't be sure of how's it's going to be
When we walk into the light across the bar
But I'll know you and you'll know me
Out there beyond the stars
We've seen the secret things revealed by God
And we heard what the angels had to say
Should you go first, or if you follow me
Will you meet me in Heaven someday?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Living in a mansion on the streets of gold
At the corner of Grace and Rapture Way
In sweet ecstasy while the ages roll
Will you meet me in Heaven someday?

[Outro]
In sweet ecstasy while the ages roll
Will you meet in Heaven someday?

[Chorus]
I never picked cotton
Like my mother did and my brother did and my sister did
And my daddy died young
Working in a coal mine

[Verse 1]
When I was just a baby
Too little for the cotton sack
I played in the dirt while the others worked
'Til they couldn't straighten up their backs
And I made myself a promise
When I was old enough to run
That I'd never stay a single day
In that Oklahoma sun

[Chorus]
And I never picked cotton
Like my mother did and my brother did and my sister did
And my daddy died young
Working in a coal mine

[Verse 2]
Folks said that I grew up early
And the farm couldn't hold me then
So I stole ten bucks and a pickup truck
And I never went back again
And it was fast cars and whiskey
Long legged girls and fun
I had everything that money could bring
And I took it all with a gun

[Chorus]
And I never picked cotton
Like my mother did and my brother did and my sister did
And my daddy died young
Working in a coal mine

[Verse 3]
It was Saturday night in Memphis
When a redneck grabbed my shirt
And he said, "Go back to your cotton sack"
I left him lying in the dirt
And they'll take me in the morning
To the gallows just outside
And in the time I got, there ain't a hell of a lot
I can look back on with pride

[Chorus]
But I never picked cotton
Like my mother did and my brother did and my sister did
And my daddy died young
Working in a coal mine
I never picked cotton
Like my mother did and my brother did and my sister did
And my daddy died young
Working in a coal mine

[Verse 1]
I have been ungrateful
I've been unwise
Restless from the cradle
Now I realize
It's so hard to see the rainbow
Through glasses dark as these
Maybe I'll be able
From now on, on my knees

[Chorus]
Oh, I am weak
Oh, I know I am vain
Take this weight from me
Let my spirit be unchained

[Verse 2]
Old man swearing at the sidewalk
I'm overcome
Seems that we've both forgotten
Forgotten to go home
Oh, have I seen an angel?
Oh, have I seen a ghost?
Where's that rock of ages
When I need it most?

[Chorus]
Oh, I am weak
Oh, I know I am vain
Take this weight from me
Let my spirit be unchained

Better next time you gonna walk yo ass away
Get yo shit together, nigga get yo mind right
Every nigga in here smarter than Albert Einstein lookin' at it from hindsight
Hope this shit starts sankin in before it's a cell you be stankin in
No bitches, no titties, no pussy prints tell my why the fuck you wasn't thinkin' then
I said, "uhhh." The judge say, "'Uhhh' my ass!"
Tell yo people how much that you miss 'em and you love 'em talkin to 'em from behind that glass
Hello Canteen Line, I plan about five racks
Lemme get that in coffee and hygiene, stamps and bugler packs
You're mad cause I'm movin' fast, so you're usin' that
Now you're out here talkin' shit, but bitch I'm used to that
Bitch, I never give up

But judgin' from the way the ball done bounced
I might get to see my nigga Mac

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Tryna do me like a low-down dog

A mother like a one legged gimp
Or something like a four-eyed geek
Cause you up in there huffin' and puffin'
Talkin' 'bout I lie and cheat
Bitch I want you outta my house
She said I want you off these streets
Damn! Hold up, sorry baby. Ain't gotta be all that
You know how much I love you. Don't do nothin' crazy
No man, you you ain't gettin' no panties

In court, standing next the DA
My brother can't you hear me like kiss my ass
Say goodbye to those shows, and peace out to those beats
Tell 'em how I got you out the truck
Yeah nigga hand over those keys
There you go, take it baby

Turn the motherfucker sideways
Stuff that bitch where you sit on the toilet
'Scuse me speakin' in tongues
But she forgot about the Charger
I know I shouldn't have never bought the Charger
Now that bitch got me facin charges
I guess it go like that, and it be like that
Momma said knock that lightweight out
81 days you gon be right back

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bitch you tryin' to swing below the belt, ho you tryin' to hit behind the knee

Hey there mike mike mike man, now that you're my my my
Seen Daddy get off probation, when the restraining come off, I'd love to see y'all come by

Daddy gotta climb over these hoes just to make it back home to the toil
Now we know that big girls don't pout, and big boys don't cry
Y'all better not fight in this bitch and cry, y'all play nice
Do just as I say, but not as I do
In the house, you start fuckin' up, guess what? I'll whoop your lil bad ass too

Thank you all, for gettin familiar

Get Familiar

[Verse 1]
Always alone alone and blue
I've got no one to tell my troubles to
No one to care to call my own
It seems that I must always be alone

[Verse 2]
The day you left you broke my heart
I need you so but we're so far apart
You didn't care I should have known
That you would go and leave me all alone

[Verse 3]
There is no one to take your place
Each night in dreams I see your smiling face
Then I awake and find you gone
I know that I must always be alone

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Big Money Talks
There goes them folks
We all we got
Officer, I got 50 bands on me
You do the math
You ain't got to say nothing, keep my mouth shut

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci a fugitive, Style is a fugitive
Think that I’m Boosie I stay in exclusive
Fly as a stewardess, trappin' this lucrative
Think crime doesn’t pay, I think that is ludacris
Part of the city, the nucleous
When niggas are humorous, snitches are numerous
It’s hot and it’s humid and business is booming
Bogus ID because I got a warrant
I’m on the run, I got a gun
Talkin to mom, son what have you done?
Put on my Jordans 'cause I’m jumping the bond
Parking lot dead, I valet them a sign
I diss you to show you man I’m not the one
Fugitive top, I’m in love with the sun
My girl is a fugitive, brother a fugitive
Mother a fugitive, I’m on the run
(Hook x2: Gucci Mane)
El Chapo mane he a fugitive
Griselda Blanco was a fugitive (RIP)
Big Meech, he was a fugitive
Al Capone was a fugitive
Gucci Mane was a fugitive
Bugsy Siegel, fugitive
Wrist cost 10 bricks, fugitive
No serial number, my uzzi a fugitive


(Verse: Young Dolph)
Get all my money, leave town like a fugitive
Waitin on another nigga, that’s foolishness
Yo ho with me and yo botch gone
Can’t control that ho, that bitch grown
I done got down to my last five pesos, time for me to get going
Disappear for a minute, pop back up
Forty pack nigga, guarantee everything’s strong
Play with me, been off the top on shoe shit
Been turnin to a fugitive, can’t catch me cuz I’m too legit
Yo money short, you can’t go to war
I’m bustin whoever I feel like it
Yea, that’s yo bitch my nigga
But I fuck here whenever I feel like it
Yo best friend next to you, tell him I said fuck him too if he don’t like it
After I fucked that bitch
I put the girl out and told er get to hickin
Sprite was clean but you know I had to spike it
The smile on my face but I know they don’t like it
But why I got to keep that burner concealed?
I’m just like nigga you for real?
(Hook x2)

(Verse: PeeWee Longway)
I finesse the plug with a fugitive mane
3 minutes later finesse the cocaine
I heard they lookin for fugitive Longway
With yo old lady, getting fugitive brain
True, little man got a fugitive brain
Gas, molly, Rick James in my vein
Gotta be dressin me, going insane
Fugitive Boot the Versace Balmain
Exclusive the Louie, 10 wallet with chain
I smoke on no dooby, don’t fuck with no lame
Kid Cudi with Future Squad know my name
Set for the crib, fugitives on a plane
Out of here bitch like my name Martin Pine
Know that bitch here with a fugitive name
Serial killer, clique fugitive gang
My mama birth me with the top that’s so fugitive
Try Dillinger was a top it’s a fugitive
Wrist game the dopest, the talk is a fugitive
Don’t hocup pocus, turn deuces to 4
Fugitive squad tryna kick down my door
Fresh out the bed, flush the dope down commodes
Underground railroad, they call me a mole
Bonny & Clyde, fugitive with yo ho
Summertime fugitive, even in snow
(Hook x2)

[Intro: Gucci Mane & Young Scooter]

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Took my car to the babysitter cuz I had to drop my top off
Got babies, no babysitter
Hard nigga but I sell soft
Gucci Mane, Im in the booth right now and me and Young Scooter bout to go off
And I smell like yo girlfriend mouth

Gucci Mane, Im bouta lift off
Its the real Gucci, no rip-off
Dont get me mad, I get pissed off
And I just might bitch slap yo boss

From the jailhouse to the penthouse
From the movin house to the roomin house

[Bridge: Gucci Mane]
Nigga cant tell me nothing
Nigga cant tell me nothing
Check me out, you better check me out
Because a nigga cant tell me nothing
Bitches cant tell me nothing
Broke bitch what you talkin bout?
Bitches cant tell me nothing
Bitch you dont know who you talkin bout

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Young Scooter & Gucci Mane, you can call me Goldmouth

Baby take yo clothes off, she suck me til I doze out

In my house I got a vault, I dont need no bank no more
All I want is free bands, you know I dont need no hoes

Really in the dope game, this rap shit is just promotin'

[Hook]
8-8-808 Mafia!

808 Mafia!

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
A nigga just front me 10 keys
I’mma run up on a nigga on feet
Gotta get back on my feet
Choppa knock a nigga off of his feet
Jump a nigga, stomp his ass with my feet
Red bottoms on the bottom of my cleats
The only nigga in a Phantom on feets
Touch me and you’ll be 6 feet deep
Feet!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Bougie ass club, they let a crook in this bitch
Take a deuce to a fo', I put my foot in this shit!
They say that Gucci Mane be flexin' unbelievable price
And I know that life is priceless, but I pay for your life
I think I’m Dirty Harry, nigga, when I got that .45
And I can never respect a man that can’t look me in my eyes
Just as stupid as these rappers if you believe the lies
You bring a knife to a gunfight, yo' ass wanna die!
I’m not a rapper, I’m a trapper in a rapper disguise
I put the feets on ya, leave a Reebok print on ya eye
I put the feets on the plug, cause his price is too high
I’m showin' my feet, Louis flip flops, I’m way in Dubai (it’s Gucci)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Apply pressure, got they neck, I got my foot on it
(I got my foot on it)
V12 car, got my foot on it
Gucci cleats, on my feet
(On ya feet!)
Gooc and me, we run the streets
(We run the streets!)
Walk it like I talk it, play it how I got it
Ain’t a phony bone on me homie, bitch you can X-ray my toes
Good in e'er hood, we run the town
A Thousand niggas throwin' up B’s, 10 toes down
I ain’t jump off the porch, I leaped in the streets
Real street cats always land on they feet
Born a standup guy, that’s all I ever knew
You can tell a rich nigga just look at his shoes!

Tarantino!

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I have seen your colors woven in your blankets
I have heard your names on rivers and on towns
I have seen your turqoise on fine fancy ladies
And the Indian sun is rising instead of going down

[Chorus]
Navajo, Navajo
The people call the people from ten thousand years ago
Navajo, Navajo
From the land of the enchantment Navajo

[Verse 2]
I have seen your redrock canyons out of gallop
I have walked upon your Arizona hills
At crownpoint I watched an artists painting
All the secrets of your past surviving still

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I have seen your women dress in royal purple
Silver from your hills upon their hands
I don't need a signpost reading reservation
To know the minute I'm on Indian land

[Chorus]

[x2]
(Hook)
Why you painted that motherfucker? You didn't have to do it
Why you flood yo wife? You know that you didn't have to do it
It was clean fore you did it, you didn't have to do it
It was a 2013 car, man you didn't have to do it
It's Gucci Mane and Zay, you know we overdo it
They back in the Lamborghini man, they didn't have to do it
They got so much, man it's so much, influence didn't have to do it
They know that Gucci Mane stay fresh and he didn't have to do it

(Verse)
Don't need no stylist, I'm so fresh, I didn't even have to do it
My car cost half a million dollars and I didn't have to do it
I paint that bitch instantly and put them Forgies to it (Red)
I merk a nigga instantly, this shit here more than music (Dead)
As far as me, them niggas phony, that's balony music
These niggas so corny I'd be baloney if I listened to it
I paint my car soon as I get it, bitch I gotta do it
And get how many, can even a man take car paint that's on a Buick
I make a bitch feel insecure but she still listen to it
She in the car, don't know what it is but ain't like she knew
You with a nigga with a check, this a Rari not a Vette
This ain't that same little lick that he got, man this Bentley cost 3-20 man
It's Gucci, I got plenty, me and Ziggy, we be killin shit
Soon as you take drop man it's gon be trinity and it's have her 50
I have my mind on a V, I'm trappin out abandoned buildings
They say the rims on my Charger bitch are bigger than they children
(Hook)


(Verse)
I didn't have to do it but I did it, man I did it
Yo I do it when I do it, drop top Rari, yea we stupid
Got that Rollie, flooded it out with Cuban diamonds, man they ready blew this
Groupies I don't give a fuck, I'm flippin!
I pour lean and some blue Kool-Aid and now I'm feelin like Nipsey
Took my car service to Slawson, bought 10 Patriot from the 60's
Why you pass that blunt to me? Baby you know that shit too skinny
I stick my blunt and stuff my safe, I can't even close at all em 20's

(Hook)

[Verse 1]
Born to lose, I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue

[Chorus]
Born to lose, and now I'm losing you

[Verse 2]
Born to lose, it seems so hard to bear
How I long to always have you near
You've grown tired, and now you say we're through

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Born to lose, my every hope is gone
It's so hard to face that empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
There is no use to dream of happiness
All I see is only loneliness
All my life, I've always been so blue

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Rosanna you're not acting like a child
My Rosanna's going wild
Her skirt is short
Her hair is long
And the beat goes on and on and on
She's living like it's going out of style
My Rosanna's going wild
She's feeling every new sensation
Giving in to each temptation
I know she'll pay after awhile
My Friends look at her funny
She laughs and say why honey
All I ever giving was a smile
But my Rosanna's going wild
Feeling every new sensation
Giving in to all temptation
And I know she'll pay after awhile
My Friends look at her funny
She laughs and say why honey
All I ever giving was a smile
But my Rosanna's going wild
My Rosanna's going wild

[Chorus]
I've got a certain kind of hurting since you've gone

[Verse 1]
I've got a pain I can't explain and it keeps on hanging on
You were gone on morning and I held on tight
But I went all to pieces later on that night

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I've got a tear that's very near to showing through
I get too weak to speak when I think of losing you
You never got out of sight until I knew
That nothing's going to ever be right without you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've got a lonely heart that only beats for you
I hope you'll find I'm on your mind needing me like I need you
You're not leaving on a one way track
Because I'm going to come get you and I'm bringing you back

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Six foot six he stood on the ground
He weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down
To his knees by love
He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup
Because of love

[Chorus]
You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love
It can lift you up never let you down
Take your world and turn it around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found
That's stronger than love

[Verse 2]
Most men are like me, they struggle and doubt
They trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with living to worry about
A little word like love
But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I thank God that the world's been blessed
With a thing called love

[Chorus]
You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love
It can lift you up never let you down
Take your world and turn it around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found
That's stronger than love

[Verse 1]
My face is scarred
And I’m seldom lucky
And the words that He gave to me then
Much later touched me
And He was pushed but He wouldn’t push back
And He was fought but not bested
And He believes now so much more than He did yesteryear
And He won’t be bested, He won’t be bested, oh no

[Chorus]
Lord, take these hands
Give me strength to stand
Give me hope to try
And I won’t walk on by
Lord, take these hands
Give me strength to stand
And I won’t walk on by
Love is never as easy to come as we think it should be
But when it does don’t it pour down like the rain

[Verse 2]
And I won’t be pushed
Won’t be chained
Won’t be lost
And I won’t be afraid
That’s just not as easy as it should seem
So, please

[Chorus]

[x2]
Lord, take these hands
Give me strength to stand
Give me hope to try
I won’t walk on by

[Verse]
Well if you'd like to learn your ABC
Then listen very carefully to me

And very very soon, you sing alone
And you can sing your ABC's like this, here's the first State letters
Ah bos cee dah - ef fah gha hah

[Verse 1]
I was born down in the bottoms of the flat black Delta land
I grew up picking cotton in the Mississippi sand
My mama said son take that girl and go make her your wife
Or you'll be stuck here in this mud all of your life

[Chorus]
Will the water roll it all away, this secret that I hold
Will the water roll it all away, will it cleanse my aching soul
But a man's gotta make it sometime a man's gotta take a stand
Or he'll get left in the Mississippi sand

[Verse 2]
A stranger came to town with two torn shoes upon his feet
Singing songs of sadness picking girls off of the street
He made a little bit of music was a leader of a band
And they call him the muddy Mississippi band
My girl was Ruby Colter and she was in her teens
I took her out to churches to socials schools and things
She was a rose just right for picking and he nipped her in the bud
And he left her here in the Mississippi mud

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Then me and old Carl we caught him right down by the store
We choked him just a little bit and held him to the floor
We relived him of his pocketbook his blood and other things
Now the Mississippi man's no longer mean

Will the water roll it all away, this secret that I hold
Will the water roll it all away, will it cleanse my aching soul
But a man's gotta make it sometime a man's gotta make a stand
And I left him in the Mississippi sand

[Verse]
In a little cabaret in a South Texas border town
Sat a boy and his guitar
And the people came from miles around
And all the girls from there to Austin
Were slipping away from home and putting jewelery in hock
To take the trip, to go and listen
To the little dark-haired boy
That played the Tennessee flat top box
And he would play

Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle
And he never cared to make a dime
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time
And all the girls from nine to ninety
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes
And begging him don't stop
And hypnotized and fascinated
By the little dark-haired boy
That played the Tennessee flat top box
And he would play
Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him around
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town
But all the girls still dreamed about him
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked
And then one day on the Hit Parade
Was a little dark-haired boy
That played the Tennessee flat top box

[Outro]
And he would play

[Verse]
It was in the town of Griffin, the year was eighty three
It was there an old cow puncher, stepped up and said to me
How do you do young fellow and how would you like to go
And spend a pleasant summer, out in New Mexico
I'll furnish you good wages, your transportation too
If you will but go with me, one summer season through
But if you should get homesick and back to Griffin go
Then I'll furnish you no horses from the hills of Mexico
We left the town of Griffin in the merry month of May
When all the world was lovely and everything was gay
With saddles on our horses, marching over we did go
Until we reached the logging out in New Mexico
It was there our pleasures ended and our troubles they began
The first hail storm fell on us, those cattle how they ran
Through all the thorns and thistles, us cowboys had to go
While the Indians watched upon us, out in New Mexico
Well, when the drive was over, the riders would not pay
To all you happy people, this much I have to say
Go back to your friends and loved ones, tell others not to go
To the God forsaken country, they call New Mexico

[Verse 1]
The first noel, the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winters night, that was so deep

[Chorus]
Noel, noel
Noel, noel
Born is the king of israel

[Verse 2]
When they looked up, and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth, it gave great light
And so it continued both day, and night

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

(noel, noel)

[Outro]
Noel, noel
Noel, noel
Born is the king of israel
Noel, noel
Noel, noel
Born is the king of israel
Noel, noel
Noel, noel
Born is the king of israel
Noel, noel
Noel, noel
Born is the king of israel

[Verse]
Ha ha ha, Come on, bad news, ha ha
Well, bad news travels like wild fire, good news travels slow
They all call me Wildfire, ha ha, because everybody knows
I'm bad news everywhere I go

[Chorus]

[x2]
Always getting in trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go
They tried to hang me in Oakland and the did in Francisco
But I wouldn't choke, I broke their rope and they had to let me go
Because I'm bad news everywhere I go

[Outro]
Well, now I've picked peaches in Georgia, I lumber jacked in Maine
I've been hired, fired and jailed in any town you can name
Because I'm bad news everywhere I go
Always getting in trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go

[Verse]
The next in line will be someone who loves you
The next in line is me, because it's my time
Now how long will it be, till you end my misery
You better be prepared to linger, when you get to me
The time has come for you to love me, if you ever are
Come to me now, so I can make you mine
I watched them rush to you so fast
I waited so I'd be the last
It's my time, because I'm the next in line
The next in line will want your love forever
The next in line is me and here I am
Give me a day or two and I'll get through to you
You'd been my baby long ago, if you'd turned down a few
This old heart can't take much more waiting for your love
I'm tired and we're running short of time
I'll make you love me more than everyone before
It's my time to try, because I'm the next in line
I stood and watched you take their hearts
And break them one by one
My time is coming, so I waited while you had your fun
Now I'm through a-waiting way behind
It's my time, because I'm the next in line

[Verse 1]
There's an engine at the station and the whistle calls my name
It's calling, calling, calling, come and get aboard the train
My baby's gone and I'm alone to live in misery
I'm going to call and make a reservation for me

[Chorus]
Going to ride a blue train, going to ride a blue train
Going to ride a blue train, going to ride a blue train

[Verse 2]
I'm going to climb aboard and ride until I learn to smile
I'll be knocking out the blues while I'm knocking out the miles
With my guitar, beat and rhythm, to the click-clack of the wheels
I'm going to sing the blues because that's the way that I feel

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Conductor, go and tell the man to shovel on the coal
It doesn't seem half as bad as long as I can roll
Give me another ticket and I'll stay and ride with you
There's nothing left to live for in this world, we're rolling through

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
The claim we hold is as good as gold, bonanza
Hand in hand we built this land, the Ponderosa Ranch
Our birthright is this Cartwright bonanza
We here belong, and standing strong, wrong doesn't have a chance

[Chorus]
Day by day, work or play, ready side by side
Hello friend, come on in, the gate is open wide
Bound to be a fighting free bonanza
Singing pines of boundary lines for the Ponderosa Ranch

[Verse 2]
Every tree and flower is part of our bonanza
The stars at night, the morning light, water in the branch
We ride along four men strong together
Every plain and ridge is our heritage, Ponderosa Ranch

[Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[x3]
Isn't no need to worry
No need to cry
God's going to bless you by and by
You'll be blessed when the Lord gets through
I've found that if you'll take one step he'll take two

[Chorus 2]
The Lord moves in misterious ways
He's wonders throught the form
He plants his feed on every seed
And he rise on every storm

[Chorus 1]

[x2]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
Isn't no need to worry anymore

[Verse 1]
The crowd is waiting for the bullfight
Matador
My final fight the place is packed once more
Anita won't throw me a rose this fight
The one she wears is not for me tonight

[Chorus]
She's watching now with her new love I know
Walk proud and slow
Be strong and sure give the crowd their show
They want blood you know!
You're still their idol as you were before
Kill just one more!
Remind Anita, you're the greatest Matador

[Verse 2]
Walk on out, forget Anita in the stands
Be a tall and brave and noble man
Be better than you've ever been before
Make this you're greatest moment Matador

[Chorus]

[Verse]
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree

With faithful leaves unchanging
Not only green in summer's heat
But also winter's snow and sleet
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,Of all the trees most lovely

[x2]
Each year you bring to me delight Gleaming in the Christmas night
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,Of all the trees most lovely

[x2]
That hope and love and faithfulness

In summer sun or winter snow coat of green you always show
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,How lovely are your branches

[Chorus 1]

[x2]
Going to jump down

Pick a bale of cotton
Going to jump down
Spin around
Pick a bale a day

[Chorus 2]
Oh, lordy
Pick a bale of cotton
Oh, lordy
Pick a bale a day
Oh, lordy
Pick a bale of cotton
Oh, lordy

[Bridge]
I said
Me and my buddy going to pick a bale of cotton
Now
Me and my buddy going to pick a bale a day
I said
Me and my buddy going to pick a bale of cotton
Now
Me and my buddy going to pick a bale a day

[Chorus 2]

[Verse]
Portland Main is just the same as sunny Tennessee
Portland Main is just the same as sunny Tennessee
Any old place I hang my hat is Home Sweet Home to me
Went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
Went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
It read it's good times here but better on down the road
Eat my breakfast here, get my dinner in New Orleans
Eat my breakfast here, get my dinner in New Orleans
I'm going to get me a mamma, Lord I have never seen
Where were you mamma when the train left the shed?
Where were you mamma when the train left the shed?
Standing in my front door, wishing to God I was dead

[Verse]
She could never give up the homestead on the farm
Where they handed off tobacco in the big tobacco barn
And the long straight rows that ran
From the house down to the road
That runs to AP Carter's store on the logging truck she rode
She would sit and gaze at the foggy mountain top
As the swift hawk circled round the Clinch Mountain rocks
At the school down in Hiltons she would read about the world
Created to be conquered by this Poor Valley girl
Her mother was an Addington from over copper creek
Her father was of solid stock; she was royal but meek
Her laughter was infectious, her music was pure joy
She'd win the hearts of man men as she did many a boy
Her mother became famous, Maybelle and her guitar
With sisters Helen and Anita, the family was four star
June gave the world two daughters
And a son with auburn curls
And I thank God that he gave me
This sweet Poor Valley girl

[Verse 1]
Four months ago in April a day-coach she came down
And the dusty autumn winds began to blow
Should have known I couldn't hold her living out so far from town
And the nights to come are long and slow to go

[Chorus]
If I had known before we kissed
You can't keep red velvet on a bordered farm like this
Well now she's up and left me she went a walking down the line
And the dusty autumn winds began to blow
All dressed up in red velvet and her high-heel shoes so fine
And the nights to come are long and slow to go

[Verse 2]
Well I sit and count December stars while they dance around
And the dusty autumn winds began to blow
Then I'll call my dog and I'll take the truck and I'll ride on into town
And the nights to come are long and slow to go

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
Now a memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart

[Chorus]
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart

[Verse 2]
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said they make the teardrops start

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, there was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Chorus]
I'm going to take a trip
In the old gospel ship
I'm going far beyond the sky
I'm going to shout and sing
Until heavens ring
When I bidding this world goodbye

[Verse 1]
If you are ashamed of me
You have no because to be
For with Christ I am an Air
When my ship comes in
I will leave this world of sin
And go sailing through the air

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ohhh and if you look up toward the sky
You might see me passing by
There is no telling, no telling where I will be
And you will not have to wait no more
Because it is too for you I am on board
And they told me we all that is free
Ohhh I am going to take a trip
On the old gospel ship
I am going far beyond the sky
And I shout and sing
Until heavens bring
When I bid this all world goodbye
The ship will make no stops
And on board there will be no cops
We are going far beyond the sky
Hey we all jump up and down
And dance till that happy sound
Let's bid this world goodbye

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
After seven years behind these bars together
I'll miss you more than a brother when you go. when you go
If only I had not tried to escape
They'd barred me with you, I know, yes I know

Won't you tell the folks back home I'll soon be coming
And don't let them know I never will be free, be free
Sometimes write and tell me how they're doing
And send a picture of mother back to me

[Chorus]
Say hello to dad and shake his poor hardworking hand
And send a picture of mother if you can

[Verse 2]
I'm happy for you that you got your freedom
But stay with me just another minute or so, or so
After all this sweating blood together
Who'll be my fighting partner when you go, when you go
The hardest time will be on Sunday morning
Church bells will ring on Heaven Hill, Heaven Hill
Please ask Reverend Garrett to pray for me
And send a picture of mother if you will

[Chorus]
Say hello to dad and shake his poor hardworking hand
And send a picture of mother if you can

[Verse 1]
I know a land where mountain streams are running free
I know a prairie where there’s miles between each tree
I know where there’s people you would like to get to know
Come along with me and go

[Chorus]
Come along and ride this train
Come along and ride this train
Cross the mountains prairies reservations
Rivers levees plains
Come along and ride this train

[Verse 2]
I heard a story that I’d like to share with you
And I know a valley that I’d like to take you through
I will show you things that I am sure you’d like to see
Come along and go with me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I know a land where mountain streams are running free
I know a prairie where there’s miles between each tree
I know where there’s people you would like to get to know
Come along with me and go

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I heard a story that I’d like to share with you
And I know a valley that I’d like to take you through
I will show you things that I am sure you’d like to see
Come along and go with me

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
She said come in stranger

[Verse 1]
It's good to have you home
I hurried through because I knew it was you
When I saw your dog, wagging his tail
Honey, why didn't you let me know by mail
You've been gone so long

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I know you're weary from all your miles
Just sit right there in your easy chair
And tell me all about the places you've been
How long it'll be before you leave again
I hope it's a long, long while

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Everything around home is fine
I've watched and I've waited for you to get back
And I missed you all the time

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Oh how I need you when you're gone
I walk the floor and I watch the door
And when I lie awake and wonder where you can be
I'd give anything to have you here with me
I get so lonesome all alone

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And won't you listen to my plea
Stay long enough, so that the one I love
Is not a stranger to me

[Verse 1]
I'm a flag waving patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man
I love mom and apple pie and the freedoms that we all enjoy
Across this beautiful land
I worked hard and I fight hard for the old red, white and blue
And Ill die a whole lot harder if it comes to where I have to
I'm a flag waving patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I see old glory waving
I think of all the brave men
Who have fought and died for what is right and wrong

[Chorus]
And when I see old glory burning
My blood begins to churning
And I could do some fighting of my own

[Verse 2]
I don't believe in violence, I'm a God fearing man
But Id stand up for my country just as long as I can stand
Because I'm a flag waving patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man
I'm a flag waving patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man
And I enjoy the liberty of being what I want to be
And achieved in many goals that I can
I was taught to turn the other cheek, but Teddy used to say
Walk soft and pack a big stick, but never walk away
I'm a flag waving patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I see old glory waving
I think of all the brave men
Who had fought and died for what is right and wrong

[Chorus]
And when I see old glory burning
My blood begins to churning
And I could do some fighting of my own

[Verse 3]
Because I love all my brothers and we're proud of our group
We've got the greenest country here on Gods green earth
And I'm a flag waving patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man

[Chorus]
Dear, dear Mama, now that we're older
We can see the load on your tired old shoulders
Mama you're a trooper, Mama you're a soldier
Mama, you mean a lot to me

[Verse 1]
She always got me out of bed early Sunday morning
And took me out to church where I could learn about Lord
Mama tried to tell me how my life was going to be
But I was young and wild, and it was hard for me to see

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
(Mama, you always taught me right from wrong when I was growing up
And it's a pity that most people like me have to try everything for
Themselves
I realize now that you always knew just what you were talking about
And mama for all that hard work you did
And for the sacrifices you made for us
I just want to say, thanks a lot)

[Chorus]

[Intro]
(Away, away, away rolled the rebel Johnny Yuma, Johnny Yuma)

[Chorus]
Johnny Yuma was a rebel
He roamed through the West
Did Johnny Yuma, the rebel
He wandered alone

[Verse 1]
He got fighting mad this rebel lad
He packed no star as he wandered far
Where the only law was a hook and a draw
The rebel, Johnny Yuma
(Away, away, away rolled the rebel)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
He searched the land this restless lad
He was panther quick and leather tough
If he figured that he'd been pushed enough
The rebel, Johnny Yuma
(Away, away, away rolled the rebel)
(Johnny Yuma, Johnny Yuma)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Fighting mad this rebel lad
With a dream he'd hold until his dying breath
He'd search his soul and gamble with death
The rebel, Johnny Yuma
(Away, away, away rolled the rebel)
(Johnny Yuma, Johnny Yuma)

[Verse]
To love you so and still not have you will destroy me in time
So I'm going away where nobody knows me and get you off of my mind
I've packed my things a dozen times but unpack is all I do
Yes I'm still in town still around and still in love with you

[Chorus]

[x2]
I made it to the edge of town and turned around
I made it to the bridge downtown by my nerve let me down
I tried to go but how can I leave when all roads lead to you
Yes I'm still in town still around and still in love with you

[Verse 1]
Well a reading and a writing and arithmetic never did get through to me
It ain't because I'm square or thick, because I learned my ABC's
But when I graduated from the grammar school and I moved one grade above
I began to be a snook at books but I made straight A's in love

[Chorus]
Now the teacher would say to learn your algebrae but I'd bring home C's and D's
How could I make an A when there's a swinging maid
On the left and on the right and in the back and the front of me
Oh my grades are low on my card I know but they oughta give me one above
If they'd give me a mark for learning in the dark I'd have straight A's in love

[Verse 2]
Now in my senior year with graduation near I did my homework every night
And when my mama said I oughta go to bed I'd turn out all the lights
But my sweetie pie was waiting right outside she'd be a cooing like a dove
Though I did my best I failed semester test but I made straight A's in love

[Chorus]
Now the teacher would say to learn your algebrae but I'd bring home C's and D's
How could I make an A when there's a swinging maid
On the left and on the right and in the back and the front of me
Oh my grades are low on my card I know but they oughta give me one above
If they'd give me a mark for learning in the dark I'd have straight A's in love
Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Until the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal

Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
Danger is double, pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day...
(Ha ha, no laughing during this song please... It's being recorded, I know. Hell, don't you know it's being recorded?)
...Like a friend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine

And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner digging my bones

Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
Danger is double, pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
"Thank you very much, thank you very much. I'm sorry about that little interruption there, but I just want to tell you that this show is being recorded for an album release on Columbia Records and you can't say 'hell' or 'shit' or anything like that. How's that grab you, Bob?"

[Verse]
From the four winds we have come Katie Elder
Four brothers on the run Katie Elder
All your little ones have grown and we've reaped what we have sown
Yes we've reaped what we have sown Katie Elder
Oh the wind blows like the devil when it blows
And the boy grows up and like the wind he goes
So mothers teach your sons to not live by a gun
And to not live like the sons of Katie Elder

[x2]
I think you'd understand Katie Elder
That a man is just a man Katie Elder
They're bound to cut him down if he doesn't stand his ground
But they haven't cut us down yet Katie Elder
Oh the wind blows
We'll try to make it right Katie Elder
No more hiding in the night Katie Elder
I vow it on your grave by all the things we never gave
And mistakes that we all made Katie Elder

[Outro]
Oh the wind blows
And to not live like the sons of Katie Elder

[Verse]
In New York city just walking the street
Ran out of money had nothing to eat
I stopped at the Plaza, that fancy hotel
Where you can check in if you’re well to do well
The first of July and a hundred and four
I stopped at the Plaza’s front revolving door
I stepped in the door and went around for a ride
Treating myself to the cool air inside
Then I found myself in a chandeliered room
Where people were dining and I hid in the gloom
My hunger pains hurt until I thought I would break
When a waiter brought out a big strawberry cake
Oh that strawberry cake
Oh that strawberry cake
Out in California them berries were grown
And into this city them berries were flown
For making that strawberry cake
Then I thought of Oxnard, just north of LA
Where I picked strawberries for many a day
Hard work with no future for the harvest was done
And I headed eastward a-traveling by thumb
And nobody wanted me here in this town
I felt like a stray dog they all kick around
Them berries reminded me of my bad breaks
I’m hungry and I want that strawberry cake
I deserve that strawberry cake
Deserve that strawberry cake
I ran and I grabbed it then out the side door
Into Central Park through the bushes I tore
Holding my strawberry cake
I look back behind me and what do I see
The chef and headwaiter and the maître d
I had a nice helping of cake as I ran
I gobble them berries as fast as I can
They’re closing the gap as I slowed down to eat
But the cake brought a new surge of power to my feet
I hid in the bush when the lead I did take
And I quietly finished my strawberry cake
I ate all that strawberry cake
That fine fancy strawberry cake
Someone at the plaza is without dessert
But for the first time in days now my belly don’t hurt
I’m full of strawberry cake
You've cut out your dancing and you never see a show
Friends come by to pick you up and you hardly ever go
It seems your head is in the clouds above
You've got the ways of a woman in love

I walked by your house tonight and hoped that I might see
The guy who's got you in the spin I wish that guy was me
I don't know why it's you I'm dreaming of
You've got the ways of a woman in love

Many is the night I've stayed awake and cried
Now you'll never know how much you hurt my foolish pride
I recall your kisses the times I held you tight
Now when I come to see you you're sitting in the light
Missing all the things that we dreamed of
You've got the ways of a woman in love

[Outro]
Many is the night I've stayed awake and cried
You've got the ways of a woman in love

[Verse 1]
Standing in the station, I'm looking at the board
The board isn't saying nothing, that's lighten in my load

[Chorus]
Is her destination Victoria Station
Where the trains go out and the trains come in

[x2]

[Verse 2]
Her daddy's name was Casey, she lived down by the track
I know she was born to ramble but I believed she would ramble back

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Destination Victoria Station
I asked an old conductor who came in from the sea
Did you see a little lady who looked like she missed me

[Chorus]

[Verse]
She was sitting on a kisstree growing in the ground
And everytime I passed her way she'd throw her kisses down
Well, I know that I am not handsome I'm bashful as can be
I'm crazy about her kisses but I am not going to climb the tree
I love a tall man

[x2]
I'm not no small man
You're the only one for me
But I'm shy around the women I simply disappear
Because I ride all day and he sleep all night with a horse and a herd of steers
Now they say I'm not human. Though I really don't prepare
To go to be with the sixgun on and I never take off my spurs
But I love a tall man I'm not a small man my man is all man and the only one for me
One night out on the prairie the moon was shining bright
I put my arms around about her and things were going right
He talk and talk of Texas and drawed his Texas draw
When the moon went down and the sun came up nobody kissed her at all
But I love a tall man
Well I'm not a small man my man Youre the only one for me

[Chorus]
Train of love's a-coming, big black wheels a-humming
People waiting at the station, happy hearts are drumming
Trainman tell me maybe, ain't you got my baby
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

[Verse 1]
Now stop your whistle blowing, because I got ways of knowing
Your bringing other people's lovers, but my own keeps going
Train of love's deceiving, when she's not gone she's leaving
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
Train of love's now hasting, sweethearts standing waiting
Here and there and everywhere, they're going to be embracing
Trainman tell me maybe, ain't you got my baby
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

[Chorus]
Train of love's a-leaving, leaving my heart grieving
But early or late, I sit and wait, because I'm still believing
We'll walk away together, though I may wait forever
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

[Chorus]
Do Lord, O, Do Lord, O do remember me
Do Lord, O, Do Lord, O do remember me
Do Lord, O, Do Lord, O do remember me
Way beyond the blue

[Verse 1]
I've got a home in glory, land that out-shines the sun
I've got a home in glory, land that out-shines the sun
I've got a home in glory, land that out-shines the sun
Way beyond the blue

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I took Jesus as my Savior, You take Him too
I took Jesus as my Savior, You take Him too
I took Jesus as my Savior, You take Him too
Way beyond the blue

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Troublesome waters much blacker than night
Are hiding from view of the harbor's bright lights
Tossed in the turmoil of life's stormy sea I cry to my Saviour have mercy on me
Then gently I'm feeling the touch of his hands guiding my boat in safely to land
Leading the way to heaven's bright shore
Troublesome waters I'm fearing no more
Troublesome waters around me do roll they're rocking my boat and racking my soul
Loved ones are drifting and living in sin the treacherous whirlpools are pulling them in
Then gently I'm feeling
When troublesome waters are rolling so high I'll lift up my voice and to heaven I'll cry
My Lord I am trusting give guidance to me and steady my boat on life's troubled sea
Then gently I'm feeling

[Chorus]
I woke up this morning in a terrible mood
Now you talk about a woman treating a good man rude
She had me talking to myself, gazing at that mean ol' wall
She had another daddy waiting down at the end of the hall

[Verse]
She changes with the weather like the leaves I recall
She blossoms in the spring but then she's gone in the fall
A two timing woman with a heart of solid stone
She tells me that she loves me but her heart's a little undergrown
Well, she said she'd never leave me but she'd got the urge to roam
She drifts around the country like a steamboat on a foam
She never changes course, she just goes along that same old way
And I hope she keeps a drifting rolls along back home someday
Because if I ever find her going to chain her to the floor
And tell her Now sit there woman you ain't leaving no more
I'm going to tame you mama untill you're eating from my hand
It's not that I don't love you honey it's just to make you understand

[Chorus]

[Verse]
You take my hand and smile at me but I can tell you'd rather be
Alone or with somebody else you know
And when your eyes look into mine, that old time love light doesn't shine
But let me try again, don't make me go

[Chorus]
I want you, don't make me go, my heart would break I'd miss you so
Trading love for sympathy is old to me
What's this lovesick heart to do when it cries for only you
Hold me close I love you so, don't make me go

[Verse]
I'm sorry that I never knew the way to show my love for you
I took too much for granted all the time
Two hearts in love must give and take, when one heart fails, the other breaks
Don't make me go, I want to show this love of mine

[Chorus]
I want you, don't make me go, my heart would break I'd miss you so
Trading love for sympathy is old to me
What's this lovesick heart to do when it cries for only you
Hold me close I love you so, don't make me go

[Verse]
Don’t call my name out your window, I’m leaving
I won’t even turn my head
Don’t send your kinfolk to give me no talking
I’ll be gone, like I said
You’d just say the same old things
That you be saying all along
Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut
Till I’m gone
Don’t give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan
Understand your man
I'm tired of your bad mouthing
Understand your man

Now, you can give my other suit to the Salvation Army
And everything else I leave behind
I ain't taking nothing that'll slow down my traveling
While I'm untangling my mind
I ain't going to repeat what i said anymore
While I'm breathing air that ain't been breathed before
I'll be as gone to as a wild goose in winter
Then you'll understand your man
Meditate on it
Understand your man
You hear me talking now
Understand your man
Remember what i told ya
Understand your man

[Chorus]
We wish you a Merry Christmas

[x2]
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
Good tidings we bring to you and your kin
Good tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year

[Verse]
Oh, bring us a figgy pudding

[x2]
Oh, bring us a figgy pudding and a cup of good cheer
We won't go until we get some

[x2]
We won't go until we get some, so bring some out here

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[x2]
I will make you fishers of men
Fishers of men
Fishers of men
I will make you fishers of men
If you’ll follow me

[Verse]
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
Oh were you there when they crucified my Lord?
(Ohh, sometimes it causes me to tremble)
Tremble
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
Were you there when they nailed Him to the cross?
Were you there when they nailed Him to the cross?
(Ohh, sometimes it causes me to tremble)
Tremble
Were you there when they nailed Him to the cross?
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
(Ohh, sometimes it causes me to tremble)
Tremble
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
Well, were you there when the stone was rolled away?
Were you there when the stone was rolled away?
(Ohh, sometimes it causes me to tremble)
Tremble
Were you there when the stone was rolled away?

[Verse 1]
From the backdoor of your life you swept me out dear
In the bread line of your dreams I lost my place
At the table of your love I got the brush off
At the Indianapolis of your heart I lost the race

[Chorus]
I've been washed down the sink of your conscience
In the theater of your love I lost my part
And now you say you've got me out of your conscience
I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart

[Verse 2]
In the garbage disposal of your dreams I've been ground up dear
On the river of your plans I'm up the creek
Up the elevator of your future I've been shafted
On the calendar of your events I'm last week

[Chorus]
I've been washed down the sink of your conscience
In the theater of your love I lost my part
And now you say you've got me out of your conscience
I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart

[Verse]
What Child is this who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom Angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and Angels sing
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary
Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through
The cross be borne for me, for you
Hail, hail the Word made flesh
The Babe, the Son of Mary
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant, king to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

[Outro]
Raise, raise a song on high
The virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy for Christ is born
The Babe, the Son of Mary
As I walk these narrow streets where a million passing feet have throd before me
With my guitar in my hand suddenly I realize nobody knows me
Where yesterday the multitudes screamed and cried my name out for a song
Today the streets are empty and the crowds have all gone home

I pass a million houses but there is no place where I belong
All I knew to give it was song after song after song
All the truth I try to tell you were as distant to you as the moon
Born 200 years too late and 200 years too soon

I'm a child of this age locked inside the pages of your book
And when I am but dust and clay and other children stop take look
Will they marvel at the miracles I did perform and to the heights I did inspire
Or will they tear out the pages of the book to light a fire?

With the rain on my face there is no place where I belong
Did you forget the folk singer so soon?
And did you forget my song?

[Chorus 1]
Green, green, forty shades of green

[Verse 1]
I close my eyes and picture
The emerald of the sea
From the fishing boats at Dingle
To the shores of Donaghadee
I miss the river Shannon
And the folks at Skibbereen
The moorlands and the meddle
With their forty shades of green

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But most of all I miss a girl
In Tipperary town
And most of all I miss her lips
As soft as eiderdown

[Chorus 2]
Again I want to see and do
The things we've done and seen
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar
And there's forty shades of green

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
I wish that I could spend an hour
At Dublin's churching surf
I'd love to watch the farmers
Drain the bogs and spade the turf
To see again the thatching
Of the straw the women glean
I'd walk from Cork to Larne to see
The forty shades of green

[Pre-Chorus 2]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
When I'm all through if I haven't been what they think I should be
If the total isn't high enough when they figure me
When I grow old if there's no gray from worry in my hair
What do I care? What do I care?

[Chorus]
What do I care just as long as you were mine a little while?
When the road was long and weary you gave me a few good mile
What do I care if I miss a goal because I make a slip?
I'll still be satisfied because I tasted your sweet lips

[Verse 2]
What do I care if I never have much money?
And sometimes my table looks a little bare
Anything that I may miss is made up for each time we kiss
You love me and I love you, so what do I care?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
What do I care if I never have much money?
And sometimes my table looks a little bare
Anything that I may miss is made up for each time we kiss
You love me and I love you, so what do I care?

[Verse 1]
The old man turned off the radio
Said, "Where did all of the old songs go?"
"Kids sure play funny music these days!"
"They play it in the strangest ways."
Said, "It looks to me like they've all gone wild."
"It was peaceful back when I was a child"
Well, man, could it be that the girls and boys
Are trying to be heard above your noise?
And the lonely voice of youth cries

"What is truth?"

[Verse 2]
A little boy of three sitting on the floor
Looks up and says, "Daddy, what is war?"
"Son, that's when people fight and die."
The little boy of three says, "Daddy, why?"
A young man of seventeen in Sunday school
Being taught the golden rule
And by the time another year has gone around
It may be his turn to lay his life down
Can you blame the voice of youth for asking
"What is truth?"

[Verse 3]
A young man sitting on the witness stand
The man with the book says - "Raise your hand!"
"Repeat after me, I solemnly swear"
The man looked down at his long hair
And although the young man solemnly swore
Nobody seems to hear anymore
And it didn't really matter if the truth was there
It was the cut of his clothes and the length of his hair
And the lonely voice of youth cries

"What is truth?"

[Verse 4]
The young girl dancing to the latest beat
Has found new ways to move her feet
The young man speaking in the city square
Is trying to tell somebody that he cares
Yeah, the ones that you're calling wild
Are going to be the leaders in a little while
This old world's waking to a new born day
And I solemnly swear that it'll be their way
You better help the voice of youth find
What is truth?

And the lonely voice of youth cries
What is truth?

[Chorus]
When I look beyond the river
And I look beyond the sky
When I look beyond the sunset
All I can see is you and I

[Verse 1]
I believe that sweethearts up in glory
Go together everywhere
I believe the angels tell us stories
And they’ll have golden wings to wear
I believe that singers just keep on singing
In a land where no one ever cries

[Chorus]
And when I look beyond the river
And I look beyond the sky
When I’m looking at forever
All I can see is you and I

[Verse 2]
We’ve all been through our springs and summers
We learned to crawl, walk, and run
I’m looking forward to the winter
When all these earthly songs are sung

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]

[Johnny Cash]
Yesterday when I came home, I was just about ready to scream
My work’s been driving me crazy and the bills are burying me
The weight of the world was on me, I was sinking like a stone
But I have come to realize I can’t do it on my own

[Chorus]

[Johnny and Carter Family]
I’m going to put it into God’s hands, start living on God’s plans
Going to do the best I can, that’s all I can do
I’m going to put away my doubts, somehow it’ll all work out
And I can rest easy now that I've put it into God’s hands

[Verse 2]

[Johnny Cash]
My mamma always told me you can’t live by bread alone
You've got to have faith in the good Lord’s grace and keep on keeping on
Accept the things that you can’t change and change the things you can
And if you ever catch yourself worrying just put it into God’s hands

[Chorus]

[x3] 

[Johnny and Carter Family]

[Verse]
To Canaan's land I'm on my way
Where the soul (of man) never dies
My darkest night will turn to day
Where the soul (of man) never dies
No sad farewells
No tear dimmed eyes
Where all is love
And the soul never dies
Dear friends there'll be no sad farewells
There'll be no tear-dimmed eyes
Where all is peace and joy and love
And the soul of man never dies
The rose is blooming there for me
Where the soul (of man) never dies
And I will spend eternity
Where the soul (of man) never dies
The love light beams across the foam
Where the soul (of man) never dies
It shines and lights the way to home
Where the soul (of man) never dies
My life will end in deathless sleep
Where the soul (of man) never dies
And everlasting joys I'll reap
Where the soul (of man) never dies

[Outro]
I'm on my way to that fair land
Where the soul (of man) never dies
Where there will be no parting hand
Where the soul (of man) never dies

[Verse 1]
Last Saturday night I got married
Me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife are parted
Going to take another stroll downtown

[Chorus]
Irene goodnight
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I take a fool notion to jump in the river and drown

[Chorus]
Irene goodnight
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

[Verse 3]
Stop your rambling, stop your gambling
Stop staying out late at night
Go home to your wife and family
Stay there by the fireside bright

[Chorus]
Irene goodnight
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

[Verse]
I have heard of a land on the far away strand
This is a beautiful home of the soul
Built by Jesus on high, there we never shall die
This is a land where we never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old
In a land where we'll never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old
In a land where we'll never grow old
In that beautiful home where we'll never more roam
We shall be in the sweet by and by
Happy praise to the king thru eternity sing
This is a land where we never shall die
When our work here is done and the life crown is won
And out troubles and trials are o'er
All our sorrows will end and our voices will blend
With the loved ones who've gone on before

[Verse 1]
Well, you said you had enough
You said that you were leaving
I said, shove off honey, baby, I ain't grieving
Pack your bags and pull out this evening
There's a wide open road
Early this morning you where nowhere about
And so I searched the town but you had done pulled out
I looked North, East and West and then a leading South
I saw a wide open road

[Chorus]
There's a wide open road
It's leading South from my abode
If you stick around and turn your temper down
There's a wide open road

[Verse 2]
Well, the reason I was looking for you all over town
Was to tell you that your kitty cat was still around
And you left your wedding ring when you went down
That wide open road
If you going to stay away then honey let me know
How to cook hot biscuits, how to roll a dough
Every thing's gone crazy since I told you to go
Down the wide open road

[Chorus]
There's a wide open road
And baby I want you to know
You can look down south or you can turn back home
There's a wide open road

[Verse 1]
I overlooked a lot of things I knew I should have done
I did things that I'm sorry for I lived to have my fun
But now the world that once was bright is empty and bare
And if you wouldn't be ashamed of me I'd still be there
I'd be with you where I belong
And nothing they could do or say could make me think it's wrong
If all the love that made you mine could make you still care

[Chorus]
I'd be by your side I'd still be there

[Verse 2]
I'd give the world if I could only have you close to me
I'd pray the Lord to keep you safe wherever you may be
Don't let anybody share the things we used to share
If I only knew you loved me too I'd still be there
I'd be with you where I belong

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and my papa
Down the road I look, and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Verse 2]
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Chorus]
Yes, they'll all come to see me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Verse 3]
Then I awake and look around me
To the cold gray walls that surround me
And then I realize I was only dreaming
For there's a guard, and a sad old padre
Arm in arm, I walk at daybreak
Again, I'll touch the green, green grass of home

[Chorus]
Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of the old tree as they lay me
'Neath the green, green grass of home

[Spoken Outro]
Thank you very much
This next song was written by a man right here in Folsom Prison
And last night was the first time I've ever sung the song
Anyway, this song was written by our friend Glenn Shirley, and–
Um, hope we do your song justice, man
We're gonna do our best
"Thank you very much. This next song was written by a man right here in Folsom Prison. And last night was the first time I ever sung this song. Anyway, this song was written by our friend Glenn Shirley, and... (applause) I hope I do your song justice, Glenn. We'll do our best..."

[Chorus]
Inside the walls of prison my body may be
But my Lord has set my soul free

[Verse 1]
There's a grey stone chapel here at Folsom
A house of worship in this den of sin
You wouldn't think that God had a place here at Folsom
But he saved the soul of many lost men
Now this grey stone chapel here at Folsom
Stands a hundred years old made of granite rock
It takes a ring of keys to move here at Folsom
But the door to the house of God is never locked

[Chorus]
Inside the walls of prison my body may be
But my Lord has set my soul free

[Verse 2]
There are men here that don't ever worship
There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray
But I've got down on my knees in that grey stone chapel
And I've thanked the Lord for helping me each day
Now this grey stone chapel here at Folsom
It has a touch of God's hand on every stone
It's a flower of light in a field of darkness
And it's given me the strength to carry on

[Chorus]
Inside the walls of prison my body may be
But my Lord has set my soul free

[Chorus]
Hammers and nails built the country
Hammers and nails made it strong
Hammers and nails in my wagon
Come on mule roll along

[Verse 1]
The early settlers waited for
The months to go by
Listening for the peddler
And his things they might buy
Many of mother waited for
The things he would bring
They would know he was coming
When they would hear him sing
Blue ribbons for a little girls hair
Threads and needles for the ladies fair
Get along mule move down that trail
I've got tonics here that will keep you strong
Books to read when the days are long
And for the men
It's hammers and nails

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yeah there was Crockett, Houston
Boone, wild bill
Stories of men with the great iron will
But somehow some of the books now fail to mention
The drummer who help to build this great nation
I got seeds to plant for the black land farm
Guns and bullets when they must use harm
Get along mule no time to fail
Reverend Jones I know will need these bibles
He's going to hold a big revival
When they built his church with hammers and nails

[Chorus]

[Verse]
I am a pilgrim and a stranger
Traveling through this wearisome land
And I've got a home in that yonder city, good Lord
And it's not (good Lord, it's not) not made by hand
I got a mother, a sister and a brother
Who have gone to that sweet home
And I am determined to go and see them, good Lord
Over on (good Lord, over on) that distant shore
As I go down to that river Jordan
Just to bathe my weary soul
If I could touch but just the hem of His garment, good Lord
I believe (good Lord, I believe) that it would make me whole
Now when I'm dead, laying in my coffin
All of my friends all gather round
They can say that he's just laying there sleeping, good Lord
Sweet peace (Lord, sweet peace) his soul is found

[Verse 1]
I love you because you understand dear
Every little thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand dear
But most of all I love you because you're you

[Chorus]
No matter what may be the style or season
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But most of all I love you because you're you

[Verse 2]
I love you because my heart is lighter
Every time I'm walking by your side
I love you because the future's brighter
The glow to happiness you've opened wide

[Chorus]
No matter what the world may say about me
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you because you're you

[Verse]
Well lord, I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's growing in the meadow (down by the water)
I shall not be moved

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved
On my way to glory land, I will not be moved
I'm like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved

[Chorus]

[x2]
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse 1]

[Johnny Cash]
When your friends don’t call you like you thought they would
When you can’t get over me like you thought you could
When you can’t forget me the way you planned to do, remember

[June Carter]
I’ll be loving you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Johnny]
On a cold and lonely morning

[Both]
I’ll be loving you

[Johnny]
On a dark and lonely evening

[Both]
I’ll be loving you

[Chorus]

[Johnny]
One happy day you’ll be back

[Both]
Because you know that we aren't through
I’ll roll you in my arms again
I’ll be loving you

[Verse 2]

[Johnny]
When your memory of me is a heavy load
When you feel you’re traveling down a muddy road
When the new love that you’re craving don’t do like he ought to do, remember

[Both]
I’ll be loving you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
Until we gather in heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore
If we never meet again this side of heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the river of life
Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separation come no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore
Oh so often we are parted with sorrow
And action often quietens our pain
But we never shall sorrow in heaven
God be with you until we meet again

[Verse 1]
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses

[Chorus]
And he walks with me
And he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known

[Verse 2]
He speaks, and the sound of his voice
Is so sweet, the birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me
Within my heart is ringing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'll stay in the garden with him
Though the night around me be falling
And he bids me go, through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Well I saw you with another
It made me lose my mind
Shot you with my '38
And now I'm doing time
And you put me here
You put me here

[Chorus]
Well there's no way to doubt
There ain't no two ways about it
As sure as your name's Kate
You put me here

[Verse 2]
I've been trying to tell them
That I didn't do nothing wrong
Only gave you what you've been
Deserving all along
And you put me here
You put me here

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well the jury found me guilty
They wouldn't hear my plea
I listened as that judge said
Murder in the first degree
And you put me here
You put me here

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Now the warden and the preacher
They're letting me go slow
It won't be long until I'm gone
Just thirteen steps to go
And you put me here
You put me here

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
Kate, you just plain bad, you know that

[Verse 1]
Well you come home feeling
For the knob on the door
You better pick up your feet
You're going to fall on the floor
I keep on telling you
I'll tell you some more

[Chorus]
You better leave that
Junk alone
And drink water
Lord that liquor's hot
Drink water
You don't want to be a sot
You better lay down the bottle
And put on the top
And drink cool H20

[Verse 2]
Well your eyes are baggy
And bloodshot red
It's been a week or two
Since you've been in bed
You better pay attention
Now to what I said

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well now I'll forgive you
For your running around
If you just promise that
You've come unwound
I'll buy you anything
You want in town

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[John Carter Cash]
Through the lonely streets and up the hill
Past the rabid dogs whose bite would kill
To the lonely rock where time stands still
Let me help you carry the weight

[Johnny Cash]
On the road of tears where sorrow waits
Every step you take makes my heart break
Seems to me you’re moving toward hell’s gate
Let me help you carry the weight

[Chorus]

[Johnny and June Carter]
Let me help you carry the weight
Let me help you carry the weight
It’s getting dark and the hour is late
Lord, let me help you carry the weight

[Verse 2]

[June]
The sky turned black and the lightning came down
Teardrops from heaven shook the ground

[June and John Carter]
Looking at his mother I thought I heard him say

[June and Johnny Cash]
Let me help you carry the weight

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Johnny and June]

[Verse 1]
Stop loving me a little at a time, let me lose you a little at a time
Walk away slow like you don't want to go, leave me a little at a time

[Chorus]
For my benefit try to cry a little bit
For old times sake give me a slow heartbreak
I put up a fight but I'll be all right if you stop loving me a little at a time

[Verse 2]
Hurt me a little at a time, turn me away a little at a time
Walk away slow like you don't want to go, leave me, a little at a time

[Chorus]
For my benefit try to cry a little bit
For old times sake give me a slow heartbreak
I put up a fight but I'll be all right if you stop loving me a little at a time

[Verse 1]
Been in town, my baby, we just got to rock on
Yeah, darling, we just got to go home
I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop
Come on, baby, just rock, rock, rock

[Verse 2]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, honey
We've been shaking all night
Oh, darling, we just got to roll right
Aaah, ooh, my head, rock on, rock on

[Bridge]
Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe, hey babe
Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe, hey babe

[Outro]
I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop
Come on baby, just rock, rock, rock
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo

I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop
Come on baby, just rock, rock, yeah

[Laughter]

[Intro]
Yo I don't even know man
Maybe I'm the only one who sees how wack this nigga is
Like the rest of these niggas like this nigga or something you know
Fucking 33 years old trying to get respect nigga
Get a life, feed your family man god damn

[Verse]
Why the fuck would you jump to step to
A motherfucker such as myself nigga i deck you
Lay you out beat the shit out you until you confess to
Being the weakest nigga out homosexual, shit
You jock me and talk shit cause you not me
I'm cocky this faggots riding my dick, a jockey
Try me, nigga your shit's jokes you Cosby
I'm Ali, bitch I'm the king you Rodney (Get it)
How dare you try compare yourself to me
Coming at mines you embarrass yourself
So please ease off my dick, worry bout your own shit
I got the skills to pay the bills bitch you homeless
On this microphone it's no joke I'm focused
So, you provoke get throat choked and toasted
You shit is not hot man, god damn yo
You tied for the wackest nigga alive besides Van Gogh
And you hate, how i get props and u can't
Trying to rap at age 48 it's too late
You think you can fuck around but you wait
You great, son you must but slow as a Screw tape
Whats wrong with you, you all bent of shape
Sobbing like your moms whipped you cause i wouldn't do a song with you
Poor slut, washed up, still rapping
How can I call you a has been, you never have been
The most wanted, most boasts but don't want it
The flows rugged, please know I'm cold blooded
This ho done it about to get his dome crushed in
With these words I'm sick, you ain't even got a nose running
Pussy ass artificial 

[?]
Trying to brag you some kind of fucking central 

[?]
But, you don't really think that I'm impressed with that do you
I win your wack ass title and give it back to you
Cause it's nothing you still hitting me given me praise
You face me wait, nigga is your weed laced
You too old for this dawg you's a freed slave
You album and Shyne Po got the same release date
You loosing it, I'm bruising lips with this music shit
You gotta get used to it
And now I'm abusing this fucking stupid trick from Houston
Excuse my french but you's a bitch
You's predictable, you joke that I'm half white (Yeah, yeah)
That's nice still don't change the fact that you rap like
You back on the crack pipe, faggots a sad sight
Fag type, sticking flashlights up your ass pipe
You wanted beef so I'm dishing it out son
Before the bout's beginning I'm predicting the outcome
Step in the ring nigga with or without gloves
You be throwing the towel the beginning of round one
And I ain't got no sympathy for you neither
This battles a time out, I'm getting a breather
You easier than 1, 2, 3 your fucking weak raps
Just like my girlfriend, i know i can beat that

[Outro]
What Nigga?
Your whole sets blown
I fuck around and put you in a rest home
I'm professional, this shit is boot camp
I'm a 100 dollar bill you's a food stamp
Ravenous the faggot, the senior citizen with a bad back
A massive limp from his plastic hip
You never could be as nice
This nigga used to have a rap group with Jesus Christ

[Intro: Ezra Koenig]
Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Back, back, way back, I used to front like I was Don Juan
Couldn't settle down, couldn't find a girl to hold on
Used to get my roll on, hit the spots and stroll on
Now I found one with a hand I like to hold on
Every time I'm with her, dudes always wanna stare
I be staring back like, "You don't wanna go there"
Used to didn't care, now I hit you with a chair
If it just so happen, touch a string on her hair
Now me and shorty wop spending more and more time
So since she got my heart then I gotta have her spine
And if any dude try to come for what's mine
A pair of size nines where the sun don't shine
The sugar in my Kool-Aid, boo gets me through days
Swear to God, one day I might watch her throw a bouquet
Said, "Nowhere on this earth, nowhere in this world
I should ever, ever see you stepping to my girl"

[Verse 2: Heems]
That's my old girl, my old girl from college
I always think about her when the leaves turn orange
Yeah, we went to Wesleyan and she scoffed at Vassar
I met her at a wine and cheese, I looked right past her
Apparently, she would notify me right after
I smashed her the first night, the first pipe's the worst pipe
But after, I satisfied thirst like, "Mmm"
The pastor would satisfy the church like
She lived in WestCo and she studied frescoes
And head to toes, she stayed in the best clothes
I represent Queens, she would move out to Brooklyn
Never thought that she would have her precious heart took-en
By a shy, brown guy from Bellerose
That stayed in shell-toes, until Hell froze
Her freckles dance on her porcelain skin
It's like, she's got a special force within
And I been high, but ain't no higher place
Than alongside her by the fireplace

[Verse 3: Despot]
Act like you ain't even seen me standing next to her
I'll tie your kicks together if you ever try and step to her
Must be why you trippin' when I ask you, "Why you stressin' her?"
Passing notes and texting her, I'm 'bout to shoot the messenger
Used to smash, slap 'em on the ass and go away
They ask when I'mma call 'em and I hit 'em with a poker face
Coldest shoulder known to blow a load
Then leave 'em froze and skate
Magnum wrapper in the trash, I told them, "Nothing gold can stay"
Who's she? Guess I turned over a new leaf
Now I'm choosing groups 'A' through 'D' over groupies
Lose sleep, lately only counting on these two sheep
You and me, baby, skippin' town up on these coupe seats
Must've broke the mold when they made you
Probably broke a nail or two flippin' off these lame dudes
Hollerin' in plain view, on some, "What's your name, boo?"
Barely had a dollar and a dream, but it came true

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones, I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse, I can't do it alone, I can't do it alone
Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl

[Intro: Tyga]
Yeah, money comes so fast, the bitches won't last, uh

[Chorus: Tyga & Chris Brown]
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, bust it open, bitch
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, what you workin' with?
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, drop it to the floor
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, bust it on the pole
Do it, do it, babe (Ha, pop it for a real nigga), for me, for me
Do it, do it, babe (Pop it for a real nigga), for me, for me

You wanna fly, I'm floating, bitch
Do it, do it, babe (Pop it for a real nigga)
Gon' do that shit for a real nigga
Pop it on the floor and try to kill a nigga

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Hey little mama, I know you ‘bout your paper
And my money, money green, I'm in charge, no captain save her
I'ma provide everything you need, no middle man, no in-between
Girl, quit burning all of your flight miles, just get on this jet with me
Goddamn, so much money, nigga think I'm pulling credit card scams
Step up in the spot and bitches know just who I am
You call me dada, I buy my bitches Prada
Eating shrimp and lobster, after that I eat her yaya

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
If you're horny (Yeah), let's do it (Let's do it, yeah)
(What that mean? Let's do it)
Ride it, my pony (You know what that means, ooh)
My saddle (Yeah) is waiting (Just do it)
(What that mean?)
Come and

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Do it, do it, babe (Pop it for a real nigga), for me, for me
Do it, do it, babe (Pop it for a real nigga)

So just take that, take that, shake that, shake that
Do it, do it, babe (Pop it for a real nigga), for me, for me

You wanna fly, I'm floating, bitch
Do it, do it, babe (Pop it for a real nigga)
Gon' do that shit for a real nigga
Pop it on the floor and try to kill a nigga

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, that's dice game, she on the floor
She up early, that's high school
At K.O.D. and Onyx too
She takin' flights, she comfortable
She put in time, she workin' hard
But not enough to bake cakes too
If she met a nigga like me, nah, I'm spring breakin' that pussy loose
Like hunnid, hunnid dollar bills, throw ‘em in the air, air
I'ma make it back, nigga, I don't really care, care
Felt on the panties, shit was soakin'
Private room, now that pussy open (Haha)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
If you're horny, let's do it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ride it, my pony (In the air, air, air)
My saddle is waiting (Don't be scared, scared, scared)
Come and (If you don't care, care, care)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Do it, do it, babe (Pop it for a real nigga), for me, for me
Do it, do it, babe (Pop it for a real nigga)
I'm popping all these bottles
So just take that, take that, shake that, shake that

[Intro]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey

[Verse 1: Syd tha Kyd]
Going out I was on the road
To places that you never know
They asked us to put on a show
So we go, fly away

The sky went to the South of France
Switzerland to Amsterdam
Traveling across the land
Rain or snow, everyday

[Hook]
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me

[Bridge]
You go away from me
You go away from me

[Verse 2: Syd tha Kyd]
I'm sorry that I went away
Wipe the smile from your face
Soon I'll be back to save the day
This we know so don't you cry no no

I know you hate to see me go
But you should know you're not alone
I wish that you could tag along
But you know that I'm coming home

[Hook]
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me

[Hook]
Lovin you is so wonderful
Like butterflies and waterfalls
Keep me high above it all
On a cloud of our own

We ain't got to be ashamed
On what we're trying to do
This ain't no play date
It's only natural ,Ain't funny
How you make my worries fade away
Run run run
Why do you keep calling me
Takin' over all of me
Fit together perfectly
So suddenly you're all I need
How do you keep holdin' me
Suddenly controlling me
They say that you're wrong for me
But I like that you belong to me

[Hook]

They say a villain
And they might be right
They think it's too much
But they don't get high
Cause I can't help it
If you move me like the way I like to be moved
Why do you keep calling me
Takin' over all of me
Fit together perfectly
So suddenly you're all I need
How do you keep hold of me
Suddenly controlling me
They say that you're wrong for me
But I like that you belong to me

[Hook]
As I go, to the other side of Earth
I will see you again I promise
To the other side of Earth
I will see you again I promise

As I go, to the other side of Earth
I will see you again, I promise
As I go, to the other side of Earth
I will see you again, I promise

To the other side of time...

[Verse 1]
We can conquer the world
Just you and me no one else
Tell me if that’s cool
What chu wanna do
Guns drawn in an all black car
We could rob this world blind if we wanna
And maybe next time we’ll fly

[Chorus]
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me so happy

[Verse 2]
We could conquer the world
Would you be down to roll with me
Like my partner in crime
Till the end of time

[Chorus]
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me so happy

[Verse 3]
We could conquer the world
Just you and me
Mother, tell me tell me, tell me, he 

[?]
Tell me, tell me, he

[Chorus]
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me so happy

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me so happy

[Outro]
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
I'm more focused, see I'm nothing like you new 

[?]

[???] the front lines
Thinking they hot cause they homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hours, these niggas better get they bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my AC
My jewels is on and I wish one of y'all try robbing me
I shoot and have you laying between the sheets with the Isley's
We push the coupe like a high speed and the helicopters come and realize theres nothing behind us, it's behind me
Your honor, I fuck over these beats with no condom
This ain't really a rap, it's a porno, rewind it back
It's back to defining a loss, correct, they don't obey
Y'all ain't nice nigga, y'all just okay
Y'all  more than a Lil Jon phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, a modern day Issac Hayes
Fingers on the shaft, new to the theme song of your career
Study my craft, you ignorant?, I can do it without a pen and a pad
It's inspiration, something y'all have never had
If my pockets is something  you're trying to grab, see I pull out a rocket and peel you back like scab, you old news
Old dudes get out my way let the young boy come through, don't mention my age, SHIT
I'm on a mission for pay and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you're here
But actually you ain't accurate fucking with this music biz
The industry like "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, Jaws is here jump in the water
Do we really fuck with president Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Got the bidding war popping like an auction
Five or ten labels like "What he hitting for"?, seven zeros or more
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my door
Money in front of me I couldn't open the door
I'm so far ahead of my time I got people 5 years from now pressing rewind
I'm hardly impressed with y'all, I hate rappers
Where the true artists at?, if it ain't a good picture you draw don't bring it to the architect
Often y'all arguing 'bout who got next
Claiming y'all running the game niggas is barely walking yet
Hopping all over beats without going through training camp
Try studying a few greats and then maybe you'll be where I'm at
Your songwriting ain't great, your mixtape is mediocre
You recycle the same quotes, you're not
Switching your flow, your flow in the same place
Don't just rap elaborate, expand, try to be more creative perhaps
My rap friends, I ain't saying that you whack, psych
Like an invoice I'm just stating the facts, right?
The metaphors I write
In fact you've been a factor you've feared your whole life, no TV show
Don't compare me with them, that's like Jaws vs. Nemo
A gorilla to a chimp, Jordan vs. Kukoc
A Tony Montana with blow in his nose to a Nino

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby
I'm gonna bring it on home to you
I've got my ticket, I've got that load
Got up, gone higher, all aboard
I'll take my seat, right way back, ooh yeah
Watch this train roll down the track
I'm gonna bring it on home
Bring it on home to you
Watch out, watch out...

[?]

[Verse 2]
Try to tell you, baby
What you trying to do?
Trying to love me, baby
And love some other men too
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Went a little walk downtown
Messed and got back late
Found a note there waiting
It said, "Daddy, I just can't wait."
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it back home, bring it back home to me, baby

[Verse 3]
Tell you, pretty baby
You love to mess me 'round
I'm going to give you loving, baby
Going to move you out of town
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Sweetest little baby daddy ever saw
I'm going to give you loving, baby
I'm going to give you more
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home, oh, right

[Outro]
Bring it on home, bring it on home to you

[Intro]
Yeah, It's young
Rostrum Records, Heavy Hustle, Warner Bros
It's Mr. Khalifa Man, Khalifa Gang, Taylor Gang or Die
And don't swagger jack me tho, ask for it

[Verse]
Picture me south west PA, on my way to LA
Blackberry going nuts, them goes be calling all day
They know I got what you need for ya
Critics know my flow is coke, I got that Medellin for ya
And I be riding all day, in my Low Rider
I get high like elevators, but this ain't Flo-Rida
No writer can't compare, my swag on 100
I'm so fly I'm in the air, I'm like a young superhero
Wanna ride with the kid? Everything tatted
From my neck to my hands, wanna star then you got it
Gotta charm full of stones, a belt full of phones
Pockets glowing out with money, gibson linen in my home
Yeah

[Hook x2]
However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you

[Verse]
I be out of state pimping, different cities going hard
Bottles getting ordered, when you see me and my squad
Rolling weed up in cigars, you smoking that garbage
If you seen what's in my blunt, you wouldn't even wanna spark it
I'm smoking that ?, I'm high all day
Little mommy got a body I can slide in all ways
That's why I want to blaze with ya (blaze with ya)
You ain't gotta worry bout a thing you with young Khalifa

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I received a message from my brother across the water
He sat laughing as he wrote, "The end's in sight"
So I said goodbye to all my friends
And packed my hopes inside a matchbox
Because I know it's time to fly

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah, come on, meet me in the morning
Meet me in the middle of the night
Ah, yeah, the morning light is coming
Don't it make you wanna go and feel alright?
Ooh yeah, ah hah

[Verse 2]
I just jumped a train that never stops
So now somehow I know I'll never finish paying for my ride
Someone pushed a gun into my hand
Tell me I'm the type of man
To fight the fight without inquiring

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah-ha come on, meet me in the morning
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, night, yeah?
Oh, well, the morning light is coming
Don't it make you wanna go and feel alright?

[Verse 3]
Oh, mama, well, I think it's time I'm leaving
Nothing here to make me stay
Whoa, mama, well, it must be time I'm going
They're knocking down them doors
They're trying to take me away
Please, Mr. Brakeman, won't you ring your bell
And ring it loud and clear?
Please, Mr. Fireman, won't you ring your bell?
Tell the people they got to fly away from here

[Verse 4]
Ohh, I once saw a picture of a lady with a baby
Southern lady, had a very, very special smile
We are in the middle of a change in destination
When the train stops, all together we will smile

[Chorus]
Oh, come on, come on now, meet me in the morning
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, n-n-night?
Oh, oh yeah, everybody know the morning time is coming
Don't it make you wanna feel alright? Ah, ah, yeah
Make me feel alright
Fly now, baby
Get to fly, yeah
Fly now, baby
Oooh, hey hey
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Chorus]
Silent woman in the night, you came
Took my seed from my shaking frame
Same old fire, another flame
And the wheel rolls on

[Verse 1]
Silent woman through the flames, you come
From the deep behind the sun
Seems my nightmares, my loving gun
Left me barely holding on, oh

[Verse 2]
With blazing eyes you see my trembling hand
When we know the time has come
Lose my senses, lose command
Feel your healing rivers run

[Verse 3]
Is it every time I fall
That I think this is the one?
Ooh, in the darkness can you hear me call?
Another day has just begun
Another day, yeah

[Guitar Solo]
Ooooh

[Chorus]
Silent woman, my face is changed
Some know in ways to come
Feel my fire needs a brand new flame
And the wheel rolls on, rolls on
Rolls on, rolls on, babe, oooooooh

[Intro]
Well, well
Oh...

Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You said I was the only
With my lemon in your hand
Uh oh, uh oh
Exhibition is your habit
Emotion second hand
Uh oh, uh oh
Had to pull away to save me
Maybe next time around, ohh...
And she said, "Don't you want it?
Don't you want cocaine, cocaine, cocaine?"
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to
Try it, fry it, na na na na yeah

[Verse 2]
Ooooh oooh
Heard a cry for mercy
In the city of the damned
Uh oh, babe, damned
In the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground
Oh, hello, underground
Your wine and roses ain't quite over
Fate deals a losing hand
And I said, didn't mean to
Did not mean to f-fail
You didn't plan it, you over-ran it

[Verse 3]
Do you want it, do you want to
Do it when you want to
Do you want it, do you want to
Do it when you want to
When you blow it, babe
You got to blow it right
Oh baby, if you fake it, mama
Baby, fake with all your might
When you fake it, mama
Please fake it right for yourself, babe
When you fake it, baby
You're faking it for your life, for your life
For your life, for your life
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you wanna
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you wanna

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Oh, I can have you, baby
But I don't know what to do, yeah
Sometime, baby, nothing I could do, yeah
On the balance of a crystal
Paying through the nose 

[Snort]
And when they couldn't resist you
I thought you'd go with the flow
And now your stage is empty
Bring down the curtain, baby, please
Fold up your show
Hadn't planned to
Could not stand to fry in it
I hadn't planned it
I over-ran it, frying
For your life, for your life

[Chorus]
One-time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick, be careful how you choose it
Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite
Feel it bite

[Verse 1]
A man I know went down to Louisiana
Had himself a bad, bad fight
And when the sun peeked through
John Cameron with Suzanna
He kissed the whiskers, left and right
Whiskers

[Verse 2]
Now, now, now, fright subsides
At a hotel in the quarter
Our friends check in to pass the night
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water
Poor whiskers set that room alight

[Guitar solo]
Whiskers

[Verse 3]
Down on Bourbon Street, you know it's right
You can see my friend
They run around all through the night
Most everywhere
Until the closet's bare
Run for the razor burn
Doin' up my hair
New Orleans queens
Sure know how to schmooze it
Maybe for some that seems all right
When I step out
Strut down with my sugar
She'd best not talk like Barry White!

[Chorus]
Now one-time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick, be careful how you choose it
Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite

[Intro: Dialogue]
"Shall we roll it, Jimmy?"
("We're rolling on, what, one?")
("No, one again?")
(Airplane heard flying overhead - "Got to get this airplane off.")
("Naw, leave it, yeah.")

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
You didn't have to tell me that you love me so
You didn't have to love me, mama, let me go
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
You didn't have to make me a total disgrace
You didn't have to leave me with that beer in my face
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
That's alright, it's awful dog-gone clear

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, baby, why you treat me mean?
Oh, oh, baby, why you treat me mean?
You didn't have to crucify me like you did
You didn't have to tell me I was just your kid
Hey, hey, mama, why'd you treat me mean?
You didn't have say you'd always be by my side
You didn't have to tell me you'd be my blushing bride
Hey, hey, mama, why you treat me mean?
But that's alright, I know your sisters, too

[Verse 3]
You didn't have to tell me that you love me so
You didn't have to leave me, mama, let me go
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you?
You didn't have to leave me like a total disgrace
You didn't have to leave me with that beer on my face
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you?
Oh, but that's alright, I'd be the same way, too

[Harmonica solo]
Oh yeah, oh
Oooh, yeah
Oooh

[Verse 4]
Now now now, you didn't have to crucify me like you did
You didn't have to tell me I was just your kid
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
You didn't have to tell me you would be my own
You didn't have to tell me, baby, let me go
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you?
That's alright, I know your sister, too

Ooh, yeah yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh, yeah yeah
Ooh, yeah yeah
Ooh yeah
Oh

[Outro]
What's the matter with you, mama?

[Verse 1]
From the window of your rented limousine
I caught your pretty blue eyes
One day soon you're gonna reach sixteen
Painted lady in the city of lies

[Chorus]
Oh, do you know my name?
Do I look the same?
You know I'm the one you want, babe
I must be the one you need, yeah

[Verse 2]
Clutching pages from your teenage dream
In the lobby of the Hotel Paradise
Through the circus of the L.A. queens
How fast you learn the downhill slide

[Chorus]
Oh, how you like my face?
Still don't know your name
You know I'm the one you want, babe, ooh yes
I must be the one you need, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, you got me feeling...

[Guitar solo]
Just a bit, just a bit

[Verse 3]
Lips like cherries and the brow of a queen
Come on, flash it, flash it in my eyes
Said you dug me since you were thirteen
Then you giggle as you heave and sigh

[Chorus]
Oh, do you know my name?
Do I look the same?
Baby, I gotta tell you, I'm the one you want
And everybody know I'm the one you need, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, give it to me, come on now
Come on now
Come on now

[Verse 4]
Hours, hours, and the moments in between
Oh, baby, I couldn't count the times
The fun of coming, oh, the pain in leaving
Baby, dry those silver eyes

[Chorus]
Oh, do you know my name?
Do I look the same?
You know I'm the one you want, ooh yes
I'm the one you need, yeah

[Outro]
Ooh, that's right
Ooh, yeah, that's right
Ooh, that's right
That's right
That's right
Ooh yeah, that's right
That's right
Aahh

[repeat]

[*cough*]

[Verse 1]
Well
Oh baby baby, don't you want a man like me?
Oh baby baby, I'm just as sweet as anybody could be
Oh baby baby, I want to look to your eyes of blue
Oh baby baby, it's more than anybody else could do

[Verse 2]
Well
Oh baby baby, you know when I see you walking down the street
Oh baby baby, well you looking good enough to eat
Oh baby baby, I don't believe I've tasted this before
Oh baby baby, I want it now and every mouthful more of you

[Hook]
Talk about you, talk about you, talk about you

[Verse 3]
Oh baby baby, you know that I wanted it more
Oh baby baby, I'm about to kiss goodbye to this store
Oh baby baby, it ain't the wrapping that sells the goods
Oh baby baby, I got a sweet tooth when my mouth is full of you

[Hook]
Talk about you, talk about you, talk about you
Talk about you, talk about you, talk about you

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, oh
Baby it's alright, it's alright
Ooh
Baby it's alright, it's alright

[Verse 4]
Well
Oh baby, baby, oh you sting like a bee
Oh baby, baby, I like your honey and it sure likes me
Oh baby, baby, I got my spoon inside your jar
Oh baby, baby, don't give me too much, don't make me starve

[Verse 5]
Oh baby, baby, sugar sister on a silver plate
Oh baby, baby, I need a mouthful and I just can't wait
Oh baby, baby, see the shaking in my hand
Oh baby, baby, don't mean to fumble but it tastes so grand
Tastes so grand, tastes so grand
Tastes so grand, tastes so grand

[Chorus]
Ooh
Baby it's alright, oh it's alright
Ooh
Baby it's alright, oh it's alright
Ooh, ooh
It's alright, oh it's alright
Ooh, ooh
It's alright, yeah it's alright
Ooh, ooh
It's alright, it's alright
Ooh, ooh
It's alright, it's alright
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
It's alright, it's alright
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
I was burned in the heat of the moment
Though it could've been the heat of the day
When I learned how my time had been wasted
Tear fell as I turned away

[Verse 2]
Now, I've got friends who will give me their shoulder
When I should happen to fall
The time and his bride growing older
I've got friends who will give me fuck all

[Hook]
Lalalalala, yeah
Lalalalala lala, my baby
Lalalalala, yeah
Lalalalala

[Verse 3]
Corner of Bleecker and nowhere
In the land of not-quite-day
A shiver runs down my backbone
Face in the mirror turns grey

[Verse 4]
So looked round to hitch up the reindeer
Searching hard trying to brighten the day
I turned around to look for the snowman
To my surprise he'd melted away, yeah

[Hook]
Lalalalala, yeah
Lalalalala, my baby
Lalalalala, yeah
Lalalalala

[Verse 5]
The moon and the stars call the order
Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
While the hope in my hands turns to clay

[Verse 6]
I don't ask that my field's full of clover
I don't moan at opportunity's door
And if you ask my advice, take it slower
Then your story'd be your finest reward

[Hook]
Lalalalala, yeah
Lalalalala lala, my baby
Lalalalala, yeah
Lalalalala, now do it

[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 7]
Lost on the path to attainment
Search in the eyes of the wise
When I bled from the heart of the matter
I started bleeding without a disguise

[Verse 8]
Now that everything's fine under heaven
Now and then you've got to take time to pause
When you're down on the ground, don't be messing around
Or you'll land in a boat without oars

[Hook]
Lalalalala, yeah
Lalalalala lala, my baby
Lalalalala, yeah
Lalalalala

[Outro]
Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe
I lost my way
Hey babe, hey babe
I really, really do now
Hey babe, hey babe
I don't know where I'm going to find it
Hey babe, hey babe
Do you want to know?
Do you really, really, want to help me, yeah?

Let me tell you now, babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right
Now my babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right
Now my babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so, feels so, feels so, feels so good
So good, so good, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
In the evening
When the day is done
I'm looking for a woman
But the girl don't come
So don't let her
Play you for a fool
She don't show no pity baby
She don't make no rules

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I just got to have

[Verse 2]
So don't you let her
Oh, get under your skin
It's only bad luck and trouble
From the day that you begin
I hear you crying in the darkness
Don't ask nobody's help
Ain't no pockets full of mercy baby
Because you can only blame yourself

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I got to have

[Verse 3]
Oh it's simple
All the pain that you go through
You can turn away from fortune, fortune
Because that's all that's left to you
It's lonely at the bottom
Man, it's dizzy at the top
But if you're standing in the middle
Ain't no way you're gonna stop

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
I got to have

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Oh whatever
That your days may bring
No use hiding in a corner
Because that won't change a thing
If you're dancing in the doldrums
One day soon, it's got to stop, it's got to stop
When you're the master of the off-chance
When you don't expect a lot

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I got to have, I got to have
I got to have your love
I got to have
Babe, I got to have your love
I got to have your love
Just got to

[Verse 1]
Baby, when you walk that sweet walk
Oh, you walk it good, yes, you walk it good
Baby, when you talk that sweet talk
It sounds so good, oh so good

[Chorus]
With a little bit of concentration
And a little bit of helping hands, yeah
And a little bit of raving madness, hey
You know it makes me feel, baby
Both my feet are back on the ground

[Verse 2]
And when the rhythm takes me
It feels so good, oh so good
Baby, if it keeps a-shaking
It will do you good, oh so much good

[Chorus]
With a little bit of stop-a-shaking, shaking
And a little bit of fly right down
Woo, just a little bit of sweet con-carne, yeah
It makes me feel, makes me feel
I got my feet on the ground

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Ooh, now baby, when you move, it makes me, yeah
Really feel so good, oh so good
And I'm so glad, so glad, so glad, so glad
And I'm good, oh so good

[Chorus]
With a little bit of, oh, concentration
Just a little bit of helping hands, yeah
With a little bit of, oh way, I like this
It makes me feel, oh, it makes me feel
I'm back on the ground
Oh yes, it sure does
It makes me feel, hey yeah, back on the ground
Suarez! Suarez!
Baby, baby, you're back on the ground, yeah!
I'm feeling good, child
I'm feeling good, child, hey
I'm feeling good, child
I'm feeling good, child, yeah
Down on the ground
Sha la la la....

[repeat]
I'm feeling good, child....

[repeat]
Suarez! Suarez!....

[Intro]
Oh, baby

[Verse 1]
Well. there's a light in your eye that keeps shining
Like a star that can't wait for the night
I hate to think I've been blinded, baby
Why can't I see you tonight?
And the warmth of your smile starts a-burning
And the thrill of your touch gives me fright
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning
Why don't you show up, make it all right?
Yeah, it's all right

[Verse 2]
And if you promised you'd love so completely
And you said you would always be true
You swore that you never would leave me, baby
What ever happened to you?
And you thought it was only in movies
As you wish all your dreams would come true
It ain’t the first time believe me, baby
I'm standing here feeling blue
Yeah I'm blue

[Verse 3]
Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes no longer
And then I'm turning around
The clock on the wall's moving slower
My heart it sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Clouds the light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Oh, that I found

[Bridge]
Hey, babe!
Ooh! Hands on the clock
Just don’t seem to stop when I’m thinking it over
Ooh! Tired of the light
I just don’t seem to find
Gotta get away, get away
Ooh! I see it in my dreams
But I just don’t seem to be
I’ve got to get all, gotta get it all
Gotta get it all, I’ve got to get it all

[Verse 4]
Now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet
I've got no reason to doubt you, baby
It's all a terrible mess
And I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless
When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey
The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless
I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh yeah

[Outro]
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I
Light of the love that I found
Light of the, hey, eh, light of the, hey, eh
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found

[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4

Oh, hot dog!

[Verse 1]
Well-a-well-a, I just got into town today
To find my girl who's gone away
She took the Greyhound at the general store
I searched myself, I searched the town
When I finally did sit down
I find myself no wiser than before

[Verse 2]
She said we couldn't do no wrong
No other love could be so strong
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer
Now she took my heart, she took my keys
From in my old blue dungarees
And I'll never go to Texas anymore

[Chorus]
Now my baby's gone, I don't know what to do
She took my love and walked right out the door
And if I ever find that girl, I know one thing for sure
I'm going to give her something like she's never had before

[Verse 3]
I took her love at seventeen
A little late these days, it seems
But they said heaven'ss well worth waiting for
I took her word, I took it all
Beneath the sign that said "U-Haul"
She left angels hanging round for more
Ah, oh!

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Well
Now my baby's gone, I don't know what to do
She took my love and walked right out the door
And if I ever find that girl, I know one thing for sure
I'm going to give her something like she's never had before

[Verse 4]
I thought I had it all sewn up
Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck
But folks said she was after something more
I never did quite understand
All that talk about rocking bands
But they just rolled my doll right out the door
Oh yeah, they just rolled my doll right out the door
Why, well, they just rolled my doll right out the door!

[Part I]

[Verse 1]
Sisters of the wayside bide their time in quiet peace
Await their place within the ring of calm
Still stand to turn in seconds of release
Await the call they know may never come
In times of brightness, no intruder dared upon
To jeopardize the course, upset the run
And all was joy, and hands were raised toward the sun
As love in the halls of plenty overrun

[Refrain]
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast
Unending dances shadowed on the day
Within the wall, their daunting formless keep
Preserved their joy that kept their doubts at bay
Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep
Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray
And everything is soon, no sooner thought than deed
But no one seemed to question in any way

[Refrain]
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 3]
How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land
To seek the unsuspecting and the weak
And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand
Toward the foe that threatened from the deep
Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand
Adrift upon a sea of futile speech?
And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan'
But no one there had heaven within their reach

[Refrain]
I said yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh
Oh oh, oh
Oh

[Part II]

[Verse 4]
Where was your word, where did you go?
Where was your helping, where was your bow, bow?
Oh

[Verse 5]
Dull is the armour, cold is the day
Hard was the journey, dark was the way, way

[Verse 6]
I heard the word, I couldn't stay, oh
I couldn't stand it another day, another day
Another day, another day
Another day

[Part III]

[Verse 7]
Touched by the timely coming
Roused from the keeper's sleep
Release the grip
Throw down the key

[Verse 8]
Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the peace
Take of the fruit
But guard the seed

They had to stay!

[Verse 9]
Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the beat
Take of the fruit
But guard the seed
Oh, take of the fruit
But guard the seed

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

[Verse 2]
For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

[Chorus]
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now

[Verse 3]
The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Arianne one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin

[Chorus]
Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love for you now
All of my love, all of my love, yes
All of my love to you, child

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind

[Outro]
Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now
All of my love, oh yes
All of my love to you
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love!
Sometimes, sometimes
Hey hey hey hey, ooooh yeah
It's all all all
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
I get a little bit lonely
Just a little, just a little
Just a little bit lonely
Just a little bit lonely

[Verse 1]
Oh she's my baby
Let me tell you why
Hey, she drives me crazy
She's the apple of my eye

[Verse 2]
Because she is my girl
And she can never do wrong
If I dream too much at night
Somebody please bring me down

[Verse 3]
Hey, I love that little lady
I got to be her fool
Ain't no other like my baby
I can break the golden rule

[Verse 4]
Cause I get down on my knees
Oh, I pray that love won't die
And if I always try to please
I don't know the reason why, yeah

[Bridge]
If she would come back, only stay with me
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit of my love, I give to you girl
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit, every, every little bit of my love

[Solo]
Hit me!

[Verse 5]
I don't have to go by plane
I ain't gotta go by car
I don't care just where my darling is
People, I just don't care how far

[Verse 6]
I'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna crawl, now
I don't care if I got to go back home
I don't care what I got to stand again, babe

[Verse 7]
I'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna crawl
Ah, woohoo
I don't wanna go, baby

[Verse 8]
Hey, she give me good loving
She give me good loving
She give me good loving
She give me good loving
My baby give me good loving

[Outro]
Yes I love her
I guess I love her
Yes I love her
I wanna crawl

[Verse 1]
Purple and scarred
It's the color that will be on my heart, my heart, my heart
When you are done and dusted with me
I fall apart when I wash your touches off of my skin, my skin, my skin
I know you're tired of sticking to me

[Chorus]
Why am I deep in black roses?
Dateless doses
I'm falling victim to black roses

[Verse 2]
You've got a diamond desire
Gonna step into the blue fire
Touching your lips with my skin
I'm on another level
I can't let go
Sat in the garden of sin, like an angel with the dirty wings
Tainted by tastes of the soul, this is another level
I need to know

[Chorus]
Why am I deep in black roses?
Dateless doses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses
I'm falling victim to black roses

[Bridge]
You're turning me off
Out of phase and into focus you keep turning me on
You're turning me on, you're turning me off

[Breakdown]
Black roses, going down down down
Black roses, going down down down
Black roses, going down down down
Black roses, black roses

[Chorus]
Deep in black roses
Dateless doses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses, black roses

[Verse 1]
Hear my baby comin' down the track
Betcha my baby's comin' back
Someday she get back to me
Whoa, we're gonna raise a family

[Chorus]
We gonna groove, yeah groove
And we're gonna groove, whoa, whoa, my baby
We're gonna love, love, love
Till the break of day

Sweet as sweet as sweet can be
You don't know whatcha do to me

You just set my soul on fire

[Chorus]
We're gonna groove, yeah groove
And we're gonna groove, baby, baby, baby
We're gonna love, love, love, love
Till the break of day

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Sweet as sweet as sweet can be

You just set my soul on fire
Woman, you know you're my one desire
My one desire, my one

[Chorus]
We're gonna groove, whoa, we're gonna groove

And we're gonna love, love, love
Till the break of day

[Outro]
We're gonna groove, yeah groove

[Intro]
Here's a tale of Tom
Who worked the railroads long
His wife would cook his meal
As he would change the wheel

[Chorus]
Poor Tom, seventh son
Always knew what was going on
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

[Verse 1]
Worked for thirty years
Sharing hopes and fears
Dreaming of the day
He could turn and say

[Chorus]
Poor Tom, work is done
Been lazing out in the noonday sun
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

[Verse 2]
His wife was Annie Mae
With any man a game she would play
When Tom was out of town
She couldn't keep her dresses down

[Chorus]
Poor Tom, seventh son
Always knew what was going on
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

[Verse 3]
And so it was one day
People got to Annie Mae
Tom stood, a gun in his hand
And stopped her running around

[Chorus]
Poor Tom, seventh son
Gotta die for what you have done
All those years of work are thrown away
To ease your mind is that all you can say?

[Outro]
But what about that grandson on your knee?
Them railroad songs, Tom would sing to me
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Hey
Keep-a truckin'
Keep-a truckin'

[Intro: J Cole.]
Yeah yeah yeah. Therapist, uh yeah, check it yo. What's the reasons? Yeah, hey, yo listen. Not yet, yeah yeah. Fayettnam forever, listen yo yo yo hey

[Verse 1: J Cole}
I lean back like the incense and relax
Well try to relax, but gotta be ready to react
To anything, many things, anyone
When it comes to drama i done seen plenty dawg ain't even 21
Remember counting pennies up as a bright kid
Now I'm dreaming to put my mother up in a nice crib
But we all on this wild goose chase for big checks
You hate and disrespect, and I ain't even rich yet
Imagine when I'll be there, beware
For these nigga's that so broke, that there's no hope for repair
And prepare for these stares, iced grills don't ever be scared
They breathe air just like you, gotta see clear cause
Money will blind you shit in front of your eyes
You will see it all, until you ain't breathing dawg
Cause then it's too late, i must say, im trying to stay on earth
I pray to god, he told me "Yo you gotta stay alert to stay alive"

[Outro:Bobwire]
Yo you best believe we out here grinding motherfuckers
This ain't no joke, save the party and bullshit for later
Right now we trying to make this paper
Chicago PA, DT, BA, Maryland and DC
Niggas out here trying to hussle and all terrains gonna eat

[Verse]
Whoa, the girl I love, she got long black wavy hair
I do declare!
The girl I love, yeah, she got long black wavy hair
Ah yeah
Her Mother and her Father, Lord
They sure do not, sure do not allow me there
Well I, I am going back to my baby, Lord I
I swear I would not lie, yeah
I never saw that sweet woman yeah in-a
A-five long years gone by, yeah
Well I am going home, I am going home
Cause she is a sweet little darling, ah
I said I been away, ahh-far too long

Take it Jimmy!
Well, my baby when
She shakes just like a willow tree

My baby, when she walks, you know
She shakes like a willow tree, yeah
Ah-that mean, mistreating baby she know she
Harps, harps all over me
Oh

[Outro]
Yeah!
Alright!
Harps over me

[Verse 1]
Oh, know I feel so strange looking out the door
Ah, trying hard to change and can't let it go
Oh, crying tears of pain, hurting more and more
Oh, every day's the same as you walk the floor

[Bridge]
I'm walking the floor over you
I'm walking the floor

[Verse 2]
Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold
Oh, to the hand that takes your dreamless soul
Oh, is it long to wait, is there much to pay?
Oh, sometimes it's hard waiting for the day

[Chorus]
You know it's hard, I said it's hard
You know it's true
I said it's hard, you know it's hard
Still know it's true

[Verse 3]
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call, can you count the cost?
As you stand alone, do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?

[Verse 4]
Every love that's changed, spend it fully
In the eyes of the night, was it hard to see?
If it never fails in spite of it all
So you hide the tears, enter Walter's walk

[Chorus]
You know it's true now
You know it's true now
Ooh, yeah

[Solo]

[Bridge]
I am walking the floor over you
I am walking the floor

[Verse 3]
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call, can you count the cost?
As you stand alone, do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?

[Outro]
Does it matter now?
Does it, now does it matter?
Does it matter?

Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah

Ooh, little baby, don't you know
Every tear that falls, does it matter now?
Does it matter now?
Oh yeah
Oh yes
Oh yes
Oh yeah

Darlene
Ooh, Darlene

Darlene
Oh, oh, Darlene
Oh, oh, oh, Darlene
Ooh, come on, baby give me, me some

Ooh, baby baby, Darlene
Ooh, be my baby, Darlene
Ooh, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, my babe
Darlene
Ooh, Darlene
Hey hey, Darlene
Oh oh, come back and be my sweet little girl

When I see you on the street
It makes my heart go flitter
I see you walking with all those guys
It makes me feel so sick

[Guitar solo]

Now I don't care what people say
And I don't care what they do
Sweet child, I gotta make you mine
You're the only thing that I want: you, yeah

And, baby baby, when you walk down the block
See the people walk by
Woo, child, y'know you drive me wild!
I got to do it with you, come on, try

Ooh baby, I got my car
I will take you where it's fine
I'm going to take you every place
Do you wanna boogie-woogie-woogie-woogie-woogie? That's fine
I'm going to boogie, Darlene
I'm going to make you my girl
I'm going to boogie, Darlene
I'm going to send you in another world

'Cause I love you, Darlene
And I love you, yes, I do
I've been saving all my money
I've been working all day long
I gotta give it all back to you

Oh, but I love you, Darlene
'Cause I love you, yes, I do
I've been working, it's true
I've been working everyday
I've been trying to get it home for you

And I love you, Darlene
Yes I love you, I do
I got a pink carnation and a pickup truck
Saving it all for you
Oh, I love you

Go
Go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 1]
There was a time I used to call you on my very own
We were so happy, woman, talking for hours and hours on the telephone
Then one day I set you up to walk right out of my life
Leaving me all by myself, all alone, to cry every night

[Chorus]
(Babe, babe, babe)
Oooh, I want you to come back home, yeah
(Come on home, oooh yeah) Sweet little girl (Been gone too long)
Been away so long

[Verse 2]
Now listen to me: I said I made up my mind
Woman, when you left me there, oh
I was going to find another sweet lover
Who is going to feel all of my, all of my, all of my cares
So I met a sweet little girl, just about as nice as she could be, oh
I fell in love with that woman, but she turned around
And did the same thing again to me, ooh

[Chorus]
(Babe, babe, babe, come on home)
Oh, baby, baby, please come home, oh, yeah, darling
(Oh yeah, you been gone too long)
I know, been away so long
(Babe, babe, babe, come on home)
I want you to please come home, oh
(Oh yeah, you been gone too long)

[Verse 3]
So I made up my mind, I'm going to crawl right back to you, woman
I'm going to plead and plead and plead, yeah, till you're here by my side
I can't even walk down the same old streets we used to walk down
Because I keep thinking about all the good times
Keep thinking about it, I want to make you mine

[Chorus]
Oh, babe, babe, babe, please come home, yeah (Come on home)
(Oh yeah, you been gone too long)
I want you to, ahhhh
(Babe, babe, babe, come on home)
I want you to come back right at home to me, woman
(Oh yeah, you been gone too long)
I want you to think about when we walk through the trees together
You know, we had such a real good time, whoa
Here we go, ...leaves always falling
(Babe, babe, babe, come on home)
You feel a brown leaf against your face
You want to sing and shout
(Oh yeah, you been gone too long)
Baby, baby, baby

[Verse 1]
Want to tell you about the girl I love
My, she looks so fine
She's the only one that I been dreaming of
Maybe someday she will be all mine
I want to tell her that I love her so
I thrill with her every touch
I need to tell her she's the only one I really love

[Chorus]
I got a woman, want to ball all day
I got a woman, she won't be true, no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said, I got a little woman, and she won't be true

[Verse 2]
On Sunday morning, when we go down to church
See the menfolk standing in line
Say they come to pray to the Lord
But when my little girl looks so fine
In the evening, when the sun is sinking low
Everybody's with the one they love
I walk the town
Keep a-searching all around
Looking for my street-corner girl

[Chorus]
I got a woman, want to ball all day, yeah
I got a woman, she won't be true, no, no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said, I got a little woman, and she won't be true

[Verse 3]
In the bars, with the men who play guitars
Singing, drinking, and remembering the times
My little lover does a midnight shift
She followed around all of the time
I guess there's just one thing a-left for me to do
Going to pack my bags and move on my way
'Cause I got a worried mind
Sharing what I thought was mine
Going to leave her where the guitars play

[Chorus]
I got a woman, she won't be true, no, no
I got a woman, want to ball all day, yeah, yeah, naw, naw
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I got a little woman, and she won't be true

[Outro]
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
I said she won't be true, naw
Yeah, no, yeah, no
(No, no, what can I say?)
Yeah, no, yeah, no
Awwwww
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
(No, no, what can I say?)
She wanna ball
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
Oh, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, yeah-yeah
(No, no, what can I say?)
I boogie, I boogie too, I boogie, I boogie too
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
Aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
(No, no, what can I say?)
Hey, hey, what can I do? I got a woman, she won't be true
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
Ohohohoh, hear what I say, I got a woman, wanna ball all day
(No, no, what can I say?)
Keep on, keep on, ooooh-ho-ho-ho-ho
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
Oooohh...

[Intro]
Pretty girl, I wanna talk to you
Slammin'!
There's only one thing that I want you to know
And that is I'm not the average guy
Sit down

[Verse 1]
They say that you don't love me
They can tell by the way you play me to the Left?
You wanna drive in my Mercedes
And wear my gold chains 'round your neck, well I'm simply not havin' it

[Pre-Hook]
I'm not the average guy
Won't you tell me why

[Hook]
Why you wanna play me? (Like a fool)
Said that you would always treat me right (Treat me right)
Why you wanna play me?
Baby tell me why

[Verse 2]
Now you said that we would never part
And baby I agreed
You said that you would never break my heart
Well tell me is this BS you're feeding me?

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Break]
Okay, I can explain what this is
No you listen
Do I look like a donut?
No you don't look like a donut
Then why you wanna glaze me?
Listen to me, please
I don't wanna hear it, I don't wanna hear it
No, now you listen to this

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3]
Why you wanna play me?
Diss me and glaze me like a donut
Yo was it somethin' that I said, I don't know what
Could make you turn against me
Yo was it the Benz or the Ferrari?
It seems, you're only with me for material things
Yo, I bet your friends call you static cling, get off me
What are you trynna do to me?
Play me for my money? Do I look like Robin Leach?
Here's the situation, yo I'm very simple
I'm not gonna let you bust my pockets open like a pimple
Play me for a fool, you think I cannot see?
Girl, all I wanna know is why you wanna play me

[Outro]
Fellas (Yeah!)
Did she play R Kelly? (Yeah!)
Did she diss R Kelly? (Yeah!)
Did she glaze him like a donut? (Hell yeah!)
You're Own Be Cool When He's Play My Brother (Ain't That They Going On!!!)
No no no no no
No no no no no no

[Intro]
What a night for a dance, you know I'm a dancing machine
With a fire in my bones and the sweet taste of kerosene
I get lost in the night so high I don't want to come down
To face the loss of the good thing that I've found

[Verse 1]
In the dark of the night I could hear you calling my name
With the hardest of hearts I still feel full of pain
So I drink and I smoke and I ask you if you're ever around
Even though it was me who drove us right in the ground

[Chorus]
See the time we shared it was precious to me
But all the while I was dreaming of revelry

[Verse 2]
Born to run, baby run like a stream down a mountainside
With the wind in my back I don't ever even bat an eye
Just know it was you all along who had a hold of my heart
But the demon and me were the best of friends from the start

[Chorus]
So the time we shared it was precious to me
All the while I was dreaming of revelry
Dreaming of revelry

[Verse 3]
And I told myself boy away you go, it rained so hard it felt like snow
Everything came tumbling down on me
In the back of the woods in the dark of the night
Paleness of the old moonlight everything just felt so incomplete

[Outro]
Dreaming of revelry
Dreaming of revelry
Dreaming of revelry
Dreaming of revelry
Now everybody sing that shit

[Sampled from "The Game – The City"]

[Verse 1 - Kendrick Lamar]
Johnny always lock a nigga down
Knowing damn well we don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao

[Intro: Eric Holljes]
I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That after all these years I'd still be calling you
To try to sell you on the thought of coming back to me

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Baby girl, yeah, you were my first
But you've always been my favorite girl
And I just so happened to break up with my latest girl
So I think you should come over and be my latest girl
Latest girl
All I know is I still feel the same way
That I felt so long ago
And even though I fuck other girls
Now I don't want them, so
We can pretend that were right back in 2000 you
2000 you, hey, hey

[Hook: Eric Holljes]
Everybody knows I'm still not over you
Not over you
And every time I lose a girlfriend
I call you, yeah, I call you

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Walk with me, I made a few more beats
Since the last time you done talk to me
I got a few more connects in the game
But that's not all I need
Remember back in the day
You had a monster phone bill
From calling me
Why you stop calling me?
Remember, babe
I wrote you all those love notes in 7th grade
And I hope you threw those out
When we went out separate ways
Cause I don't want to see them up for sale on eBay
Don't put them on eBay, hey, hey

[Hook: Eric Holljes]

[Bridge: Mike Posner]

You were my first girl
So won't you be my last girl?
Hey, first girl
Won't you be my last girl?

Losing It 

[x2]

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Walking around
Looking for a way
But no one tells me which way to go
There's people around
People say my name
But some how I'm still all alone
Hand me a cigarette
Don't care bout no cancer
Call up my girl friend
She doesn't answer
So I'm own my own now
Green in this bowl now
Pedal to floor now
I need to slow down

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
You've got your head in the clouds
The stars in your eyes
Everyone can see it but you
And I don't know how
You believe your own lies
No one wants to tell you the truth

[Hook: Mike Posner]
It's just a matter of time
Before this all comes crashing down
The harder you try
The more we can see the real you
The real, real you

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
So you're gonna be a big star
They told you you're the next big thing
Everybody's gonna love you
Everybody's gonna know your name

[Hook: Mike Posner]
So push your problems in your impending fame
And push 'em away, push 'em away
Keep your head up, baby, wait for the day
They'll see that you're larger than life

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
You know that you're special
You probably hear it everyday
You know you don't belong here
With normal people doing normal things

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Verse 1: AJ]
If I could right
The wrongs that made you cry
Girl, would you promise not to say goodbye?
Oh-oh, 'cause I'm holding on
With a love so strong
And I can't take the day without you by my side

[Pre-Chorus 1: Brian]
Girl, if I could change
If I could change your mind
Maybe you could help me
Wipe these tears from my eyes

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Girl, don't stop (don't stop)
The sun from shining down on me
(Oh shining down on me, yeah)
'Cause I can't face another day
Without your smile (your smile)
And if you take away the loving arms
That surround me
Then I might break down and cry
Just like a child

[Verse 2: Brian & All]
Girl, I can't belong and I won't be free
If I fail to bring your loving back to me
Oh back to me (oooh)
So I'm pressing on, I hope you understand
That there's a broken heart
That lies within your hands

[Pre-Chorus 2: AJ & Brian]
So if I could change
(So if I could change)
And it won't hurt your pride
(And it won't hurt your pride)
Baby you can help me
Stop these tears from my cries

[Chorus: All, AJ & Brian]
Girl, don't stop
The sun from shining down on me
(Shining down on me)
'Cause I can't face another day
Without your smile (your pretty smile)
And if you take away the loving arms
That surround me
Then I might break down and cry
Just like a child

[Bridge: All, AJ & Brian]
Like a child, just like a child
With the spirits running free
She drove me wild, oh she did
Like a child, just like a child
Think of what our love could be
If our hearts could set us free
Like a child, yeah

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Girl, don't stop
The sun from shining down on me
(Shining down on me)
'Cause I can't face another day
Without your smile (your pretty smile)
And if you take away the loving arms
That surround me
Then I might break down and cry
Just like a child
Girl, don't stop (oh!)
The sun from shining down on me
(Shining down on me, yeah)
'Cause I can't face another day
Without your smile (oh your pretty smile)
And if you take away the loving arms
That surround me
Then I might break down and cry
Just like a child

[Outro: Brian & AJ]
Baby, our love will last forever
I know that we will stay together
'Cause I love you so much
I need you so much
You're my love, we'll last forever
Baby, our love will last forever
I know that we will stay together
'Cause I love you so much
I need you so much
You're my love, we'll last forever

[Intro: AJ & Girl]
"Hello"
"Hi, it's me. Wassup baby?
I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight
So, don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"W-Wait? Say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really dropping out. I think my battery must be low
Listen, if you can hear me, we're going to a place nearby, alright? Gotta go!"

[Verse 1: AJ with All]
Let me tell you the story
'Bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home
When there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should've said, "No, someone's waiting for me"
But I called my girl up and said

[Chorus: All]
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

[Verse 2: Nick with Howie]
Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out
That she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside
That she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

[Chorus: All]
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

[Interlude: All]
Listen baby I'm sorry (hello?)
Listen baby I'm sorry (hello?)
Gotta go

[Break: All]
Oh (oh-oh-oh)
Oh (oh-oh-oh)
Oh (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh (oh-oh-oh)
Oh (oh-oh-oh)

[Reprise: Nick with Howie, AJ]
Let me tell you the story
'Bout the call that changed my destiny

Gotta go, oh-oh-oh!

[Chorus: All & AJ]

Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you (anything)
Anything you want me to
Oooh-ooh-oooh-ooh-ooh
(Oooh-ooh-ooh-oooh) Hey baby

[Verse 1: Brian & Nick]
I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
The sun, the stars, the moon
As long as your love's there to lead me
I won't lose my way, believe me
Even through the darkest night, you know

[Chorus: All & Brian]
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure
I know it's true (I know it's true)
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you (for you)

[Verse 2: Brian & Nick]
I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole wide world
To know

[Chorus: All, Brian & Nick]
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love as far as I can see (see yeah)
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure
I know it's true (I know it's true)
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you

Hey baby, (hey!) hey baby
Hey baby (oh yeah)

There's one thing for sure
I know it's true (I know it's true, I know it's true)
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you

Anywhere you ask me to (I'll do anything)
I'd do anything for you (oh, whatever you want me to)
Anything you want me to (oh baby, yeah!)
Your love as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need

[Outro: Nick & Brian]
There's one thing for sure
I know it's true
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you

[Intro: Kevin]
Baby, I know you're hurting
Right now you feel like
You could never love again
Now all I ask is for a chance
To prove that I love you

[Verse 1: AJ & Brian]
From the first day
That I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would be
Together, forever, oh, oh, oh
Oooh, when I asked you out
You said "no", but I found out
Darling, that you'd been hurt
You thought that you'd never love again

[Pre-Chorus: Brian & AJ]
I deserve a try honey just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me

[Chorus: All & Brian]
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me (give you all of me)
Honey, that's no lie (that's no lie)
I'll never break your heart
(I'll never break your heart, baby)
I'll never make you cry
(I never wanna see you cry)
I'd rather die than live without you
(No, no, live without you)
I'll give you all of me, honey, that's no lie

[Verse 2: AJ, Brian & All]
As time goes by you will get
To know me a little more better
Girl, that's the way love goes baby, baby
And I, I know you're afraid (know you're afraid)
To let your feelings show (feelings show)
And I understand
Girl, it's time to let go, ooh
Girl, it's time to let go because

[Pre-Chorus: Brian, AJ & All]
I deserve a try honey, just once
Give me a chance
And I'll prove this all wrong (wrong you walked)
You walked in
You were so quick to judge (quick to judge)
But honey he's nothing like me
Darling, why can't you see

[Chorus: All, AJ & Brian]
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry (make you cry)
I'd rather die (I'd rather die)
Than live without you (than live without you, girl)
I'll give you all of me (give you all of me, baby)
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry (I'll never make you cry)
I'd rather die than live without you
(Die, can't live without you)
I'll give you all of me, honey, that's no lie

[Bridge: Brian, AJ & All]
I'll never break your heart
(I'll never break your heart)
No way, know how
Girl, I'll never break your heart
No way, make you cry
I swear, oh believe me
I swear, I swear, honey, I swear
No way, know how
I'll do your right
Girl, I'll never break your heart
'Cause I know how!

[Chorus: All, AJ & Brian]
I'll never break your heart
(I would never do that to you, baby)
I'll never make you cry (oh, just give me a chance)
(To show you show much I love you)
I'd rather die (I would die, rather die)
Than live without you (than live without you)
I'll give you all of me (I would give you the world)
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart (I'll never, I'll never, I'll never, I'll never)
I'll never make you cry (I'll never, no, I won't)
I'd rather die than live without you (baby, honey, I'd never)
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie (I want you, I need you)

[Intro: Brian]
Baby, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Brian]
Even in my heart, I see
You're not being true to me
Deep within my soul, I feel
Nothing's like it used to be

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

[Chorus: Brian & All]
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart (With my heart)
Before you tear us apart (My heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
I should have known from the start
You know you have got to stop (From my heart)
You are tearing us apart (My heart)
Quit playing games with my heart

[Verse 2: Nick]
I live my life the way
To keep you coming back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see

[Pre-Chorus: Nick, Nick & Brian]
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
You better …

[Chorus: Brian & All]
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart (With my heart)
Before you tear us apart (My heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
I should have known from the start
You know you have got to stop (From my heart)
You are tearing us apart (My heart)
Quit playing games

[Bridge: AJ, AJ & Kevin]
Baby, baby!
The love that we had was so strong
Don't leave me hanging here forever
Oh baby, baby, this is not right
Let's stop this tonight

[Interlude: Brian & All]
Baby, oh-oh, quit playing games

You've got something
So incredible in my eyes
And my heart (and my heart)
It starts pumpin' (pumpin')
Whenever you're around
My whole world's upside down baby

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
But I try to get closer
And you always push me away
You tell me it's much too soon
But I just can't help it
I always gotta make a play

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Boys will be boys (hey, hey)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, baby, boys will be boys

[Verse 2: AJ & Nick]
All my senses go right into overdrive
Oh, my defenses are never gonna hold
I always got to lose control

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
And I hear you say
That you think that we should wait
And I can't hold on anymore
My body's calling for you
So please don't hesitate

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I like to know what's in your mind
It's not easy to see
I know now what I feel

[Intro: AJ]
Every time I close my eyes
Every time I close my eyes

[Verse 1: AJ]
Listen, girl
I don't know where to start
But every word I say
Comes straight from the heart
I've been so wrong
I never meant to hurt you
Oh, girl, I'm sorry
For what I put you through

[Pre-Chorus 1: Brian]
Girl, I'd do anything
For one more chance (one more chance)
'Cause I want you back again (want you back)

[Chorus: AJ with All]
'Cause every time I close my eyes
I see your face and I wonder
When you close your eyes
Do you think about me?
Now I realize, I want you girl and no other
Every time I close my eyes, you're all that I see

[Verse 2: AJ & Brian]
You and I shared a life together
Each other was all we'd ever need (all we'd ever need)
I thought that you would stay with me forever
But I took for granted the love you gave to me

[Pre-Chorus 2: AJ]
I keep on trying (keep on trying)
Until the end ('till the end)
Baby, I need you back with me again
(I need you back)

[Chorus: Brian & All]
'Cause every time I close my eyes
I see your face and I wonder
When you close your eyes
Do you think about me?
Now I realize, I want you girl and no other
Every time I close my eyes, you're all that I see

[Bridge: Brian]
And girl, I'm going out of my mind
I miss you so much
I don't know what to do (what to do)
Please say it's just a matter of time
Until I feel your touch
Until you let me come back to you

[Verse 3: Kevin]
I think about you girl every-night
I'm in love with you and it feels so right
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain
I was just caught up in that lying game
But now those days are over
I've changed my ways
And now I'm counting the minutes
I'm counting the days
Until you let me come back
Until you let me start
To find a new way to get back into your heart

[Pre-Chorus 1: Brian]
Girl, I'd do anything
For one more chance (one more chance)
'Cause I want you, I want you back again

[Chorus: AJ, Brian & All]
Every time I close my eyes
I see your face and I wonder
When you close your eyes
Do you think about me?
Now that I realize
I want you girl and no other
Every time I close my eyes
You're all that I see

[Outro: AJ, Brian & All]
Every time I close my eyes
All I can see is you loving me
Close your eyes
You're all that I need, baby, yeah (realize)
Oh, now I realize that every time I close my eyes
Close my eyes
I see me holding and kissing you, baby, yeah
Every time I close my eyes
I see your face and I wonder
I wonder, baby, yeah (close your eyes)
When you close your eyes
Do you think about me?
Now I realize (I realize)
I want you girl and no other

[Intro: Kevin]
Baby, can I talk to you?
I know something's wrong
Things just are not the same
But deep down inside, I know you still care
So tell me what to do to get things back
The way they used to be

[Verse 1: Brian]
If your words had meaning
If you really cared about me
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart?
If you were my lover
A constant friend to me
Tell me why would you turn away from my love?

[Chorus: All & Brian]
So darlin', tell me what to do
To make things right
Darlin', tell me what to do to make things right
Darlin', tell me what to do
To make things right for love
Tell me what to do to make things right for love

[Verse 2: Brian]
If your words have reason
When they won't turn away from me
They're trying hard to hide all truth they might say
If you listen to me girl
If you know how I'm feeling inside
Then maybe you wouldn't shut me out your life, baby

[Chorus: All & Brian]
So darlin', tell me what to do
To make things right
Darlin', tell me what to do to make things right
Darlin', tell me what to do
To make things right for love
Tell me what to do to make things right
For love (for love)

[Bridge: Brian & All]
Can't you see?
All I'm asking for is a chance to let me love you
Can't you see?
Girl, you know this is where you should be
And if by chance we should find
That it can be for you and I
Then, girl, I'll try
I'll try, oh, baby

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Darlin', tell me what to do
To make things right
Darlin', tell me what to do
To make things right, darlin', yeah
Tell me what to do to make things right for love
Tell me what to do to you for love
I'd give anything for your love
Tell me how can I make it right

[Interlude: Kevin]
Girl, you should know how I feel by now
There's so many ways to love
So just open your heart
And I'll find the way

[Reprise: Brian & All]
Can't you see?
All I'm asking for is a chance to let me love you
Can't you see?
Girl, you know this is where you should be
And if by chance that we should find
That it can be for you and I
Then, girl, I'll try
I'll try, oh, baby

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Darlin'
Tell me what to do to make things right
I need to know, darlin'
Tell me what to do to make things right
I wanna know
Just how to make things a little better
Darlin', tell me what to do
To make things right for love
Tell me what to do for love
Tell me what to do to you for love
I'll do anything, oh yeah

I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car to get to you
I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

[Chorus: Brian & All]
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give (give)

When you talk (when you talk)
Does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave (does he leave)
When you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby, please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

All of our time spent
In flashes of light

You keep on doing all the things I like
You got me hypnotized
But that's the way I like it

Now I see you're just somebody
Who wastes all my time and money
What a lie, you and I

[Chorus: All]
What about your
Your 10,000 promises
That you gave to me?
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

[Verse 2: AJ]
Once I could handle the truth
When the truth was you and I, mmmh
But time after time
All the promises turned out to be all lies
And now...

Now I see you're just somebody
Who wasted my time and money

[Chorus: All & AJ]
What about your
Your 10,000 promises

You say I'll take you back
But I closed the door
'Cause I don't want 10,000 more

Hmm, mmmh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Brian with Howie]
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here, don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man
That I've become, oh yeah

[Chorus: All]
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

[Verse 2: AJ with Kevin & Howie]
Sadness is beautiful
Loneliness that's tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark (in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

[Bridge: Nick]
I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

[Chorus: All, Brian, (AJ) & Nick]
I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark (keep you in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart (heart!)
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (trying to be someone)
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of...

[Outro: AJ]
Show you the shape of my heart

[Intro: All]
Ah, Backstreet
One time, here we go
Yes, yes, one time, yes, yes

[Verse 1: AJ]
I could tell when I stepped in the room
And I saw you standing there
Caught in a vibe by the way that you moved
I couldn't help the way I stared
There was some mysterious force
Leading me here to you
Lead me to you (lead me to you)

[Pre-Chorus: AJ & All]
So I stood there watching
And I was hypnotized
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside your world with you
Oohh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Hey, Mr. DJ keep playing this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms she's got to be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long, Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Play it, play it for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: AJ]
Now it feels like it could be romance
As we dance across the floor
Every move that your body makes
Only makes me want you more
And it seems like time's moving fast
How can we make it last?
Make it last now (make it last somehow)

[Pre-Chorus: AJ & All]
As we keep on dancing
I am hypnotized
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
I was lost inside your world with you (with you)
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Hey, Mr. DJ keep playing this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms she's got to be
Oh, let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long, Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Oh, play it, play it, play it for me

[Bridge: AJ & All]
Close your eyes (close your eyes)
And imagine us alone (just imagine)
Let the music put you in a zone
Let the music put you in a zone, oh yeah
I get lost (I get lost)
Lost inside a groove with you (lost inside a groove)
When you do the dance you do
Come on and work your body, work your body

[Interlude: All]
Hey, Mr. DJ
Jam all night long
Hey, Mr. DJ
Play that song for me
Hey, Mr. DJ
Jam all night long
Hey, Mr. DJ
Play that song for me

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Hey, Mr. DJ keep playing this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms she's got to be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long, Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Play it, DJ, ooh
Hey, Mr. DJ keep playing this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms
She's got to be, she's got to be
Oh, let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long, Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Oh, play it, play it, play it for me, DJ

[Outro: All]
Keep it going Mr. DJ, keep it going Mr. DJ
Keep it going Mr. DJ, keep it going Mr. DJ
Keep it going Mr. DJ, keep it going Mr. DJ
Keep it going Mr. DJ, keep it going Mr. DJ
Keep it going Mr. DJ, keep it going Mr. DJ
Keep it going Mr. DJ, keep it going Mr. DJ

[Intro: AJ]
Get another boyfriend
Backstreet
Check it, huh!
Hey!

[Verse 1: AJ]
Let's talk about one, baby
You gotta hear me out
Do you really wanna be the last to know
What it's all about?
Let's talk about two
You say he's the essence of your life
But he'll eat you up from inside slow
And then he doesn't wanna know

[Pre-Chorus 1: Brian]
I'm telling you, he'll eat you up from inside
And then he doesn't wanna know

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
He's just another playa'
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end (come to an end)
Get another boyfriend

[Verse 2: Nick & All]
Let's talk about what ('bout what)
He's done (he's done) to become your number one
Or was it all the promises of diamonds
Pearls or party dresses that turned you on?
I've seen it before, don't take anymore
Free too, you're through for sure
Just go get on with your life
STOP acting like you're giving up

[Pre-Chorus 2: Brian]
I'm telling you, go get on with your life
Stop acting like you're giving up

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
He's just another playa'
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
(Must come to an end!)
Get another boyfriend (get another boyfriend)

[Break: AJ & All]
W-W-W-Why? (yeah)
W-W-W-Why? (get another boyfriend)
W-W-W-Why?
W-W-Why?, STOP!
Hey-yeah-hey-ah!

[Bridge: All, Brian & AJ]
Hear me out, you must know
(You must know)
What it's all about (baby)
He's just a player in love (oh-oh-oh-oh)
This must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

[Chorus: All, Brian & AJ]
Listen, I mean it (I mean it)
There's nothing that he's worthy of
(Ain't nothing that he's worthy of)
He's just another playa'
Playing in the name of love (of love!)
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
(Get another, get another boyfriend)
Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
He's just another playa'
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end (come to an end)
Get another boyfriend (get another boyfriend)

[Verse 1: AJ & Brian]
Here we are, seven days
And seven nights of empty tries
It's ritual, habitual
But it's never gonna work this time
We're to the point of no return
And along the way the only thing
We learned is how to hurt each other
I'm looking back and wondering why
It took so long to realize
That nothing's changed, it never will
All these years of standing still
And still we stay in all this pain
And nothing's gonna make it go away
Yeah-yeah, yeah!

[Chorus: Nick with All, Nick & Brian]
I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know

[Verse 2: AJ & Nick]
So save your voice, don't waste your breath
Can't you see we're at the end
And this goodbye is permanent
So wish me well and try to forget (mmmh)
And all the fights and all the ways
We almost made it but we never did
And it's finally come to this

[Chorus: Nick with All, Nick]
I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be (used to be)
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go (let me go!)
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know!

[Bridge: AJ with All, AJ & All]
We cannot hide what we've become
So sick and tired of being numb
It's done, it's done (oh-oh-oh!)
It's done (oh-oh-oh!)

[Chorus: All, Nick & Brian]
I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be (what we used to be)
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute
(Wait another minute!) To hear
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know (oh-whoa!)
Something that I already know...
(I know, I know, I know)

[Outro: Brian]
I know, 'cause I know

[Intro: All]
Show me the meaning of being lonely

[Verse 1: Brian & AJ]
So many words for the broken heart
It is hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

[Chorus: All]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can't be there where you are?
There is something missing in my heart

[Verse 2: Kevin & Nick]
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There is no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

[Chorus: All, AJ & Brian]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with (tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are?
There is something missing in my heart (heart!)

[Bridge: Howie, All, AJ]
There is nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you are asking me
To feel the things you never show?
(Show-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh!)

[Interlude: Brian]
You are missing in my heart
Tell me why can't I be there where you are?

[Chorus: All, (AJ), Brian & Nick]
Show me the meaning of being lonely (being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with (tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are? (where you are)
There is something missing in my heart
(You are missing from my heart)
Show me the meaning of being lonely (being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are? (where you are)
There is something missing in my heart

[Intro: AJ]
Memory's bliss

[Verse 1: Brian & AJ]
The candle plays the hourglass
The days go and all I do is
Think of you and wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
Every smile, and even all the reasons why you say
I pushed you out of my life

[Chorus: AJ]
Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

[Verse 2: Brian, AJ & All]
Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life (ever had in life)
Bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are
Baby, will you be there when the morning comes?
(Baby, will you be there?)
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life baby)
Baby, will you be there when I open my eyes?
After all the time I've spent, wishing

[Chorus: AJ & Brian]
Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

[Verse 3: AJ & Brian]
Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind flies and carelessly
Imagines that you're happy with your life right now
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things that I can never have

[Chorus: Brian & AJ]
Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss
Baby you set me

[Outro: AJ & Brian]
So come on now
I know this much is true
I know this much is true

[Intro: Nick & All]
Baby, it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop
It's gotta be you
Uh-huh uh-huh, yeah!

[Verse 1: AJ]
I can't control it anymore
I've never felt like this before
You really made me lose my head
My hungry heart must be fed

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Baby, it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop

[Chorus: All, (Nick) & Brian]

Now I know why I was born
You feel my feelings one by one
Can't see the world I'm walking through
'Cause baby, I see only you

Oh-oh yeah
Baby, it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy

And you know

You're all that I ever wanted (yeah)
It's gotta be you, I will be true, yeah
It's only you

[Chorus: All & Brian]

Angels everywhere (they're everywhere)
Every time you're near
You will always be my baby (huh! huh!)

[Verse 1: AJ & All]
Baby, when you do the things you do
I wanna get close to you
Kissing me to feel your every move
Oh, oh! Baby I can never say how much

Baby, you're as close as close can get
And baby you know I let
Every single part of me be yours, ooh-yeah
It doesn't matter if the phone might ring

(I), when I'm in your arms

[Pre-Chorus: AJ & All]
'Cause you know ('cause you know)
What to do to turn me on, oh baby

[Chorus: All & AJ]

Every time you're near
You will always be my baby (my baby, yeah)

[Bridge: All, Nick & Rodney Jerkins]
I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
'Cause you are doing everything so right
Oh-oh baby (what? what?)
I've never been so satisfied
With anything in my entire life
'Cause you are doing everything so right
(Oh-oh baby) Darkchild, Backstreet Boys, c'mon

[Intro: Brian]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, hmmm!

[Verse 1: Brian]
There are people
That say what you wanna hear
Even on a raining day
They'll tell you the sky is clear
When you really really love someone
Am I right when I say that you want them near?
And if you can't even
Tell them things that they wanna hear

[Chorus: Brian]
Always forever, all things she said
Never say never
Those simple lies that she fed
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had
But can you blame me, no
Because that's what she said
That's what she said
She told me we'd see forever
That's what she said, she said, yeah

[Verse 2: Brian]
And there are people
That say what they really mean
She said she'd always be there
She said she'd always care
But just when you think that you can
Trust that someone you love
Tell me why, or do you know
How stars can fall from above?

[Chorus: Brian]
Always forever, all things she said
Never say never
Those simple lies that she fed
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had
But can you blame me, no
Because that's what she said
That's what she said
She told me we'd see forever
That's what she said
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
That's what she said
She told me we be together
That's what she said, she said

[Bridge: Brian]
'Cause you made promises
That you couldn't keep
But you're not hurting yourself
You're only hurting me (you're only hurting me)
Why would you say things that
You really didn't mean? (you really mean)
Oh, how can I make you see
Just what you did to me?

[Verse 3: Brian]
Oh-oh, you said how much you really cared
Just when I thought I was in love
Girl, how could you dare?
If I were you I could not lie even once
To the face of the one
That I love so much

[Chorus: Brian]
Always forever, all things she said
Never say never
Those simple lies that she fed
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had
But can you blame me, no
Because that's what she said
That's what she said
She told me we'd see forever
That's what she said
Oh, oh yeah, that's what she said
She told me we'd be together
That's what she said, she said

[Intro: Nick]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick]
Open up your heart to me
And say what's on your mind, oh yes
I know that we have been through so much pain
But I still need you in my life, this time

[Chorus: Nick]
And I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
I really need you tonight

[Verse 2: Nick]
I figured out what to say to you
Sometimes the words they, they come out so wrong
(Always they do)
And I know in time that you will understand
That what we have is so right, this time

[Chorus: Nick]
And I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right

[Verse 3: Nick]
All those endless times
We tried to make it last forever more
And baby I know
I need you (oh oh, yeah)
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
I really need you, oh

[Outro: Nick]
I need you tonight (I need you, oh I need you baby)
I need you right now (It's got to be this, it's got to be this)
I know deep within my heart
No, it doesn't matter if it's wrong or it's right
All I know is baby
I really need you tonight
Ooh

[Verse 1: Brian]
It's in the silences
The words you never say
I see it in your eyes
It always starts the same way
It seems like everyone we know
Is breaking up, oh
Does anybody ever stay in love
Anymore, oh, oh?

[Chorus: All & Brian]
I promise you
From the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

[Verse 2: Nick]
Oooh, oooh, oooh
I see you look at me
When you think I’m not aware
You’re searching for clues
Of just how deep my feelings are
How do you prove the sky is blue
The oceans wide?
All I know is how I feel
When I look into your eyes

[Chorus: All & Nick]
I promise you (I promise you)
From the bottom of my heart
(From the bottom of my heart, baby)
I will love you till death do us part
(Sugar, darling, I promise, yeah)
I promise you (I promise you)
As a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything that I am, ooh

[Brigde: AJ]
Oh, there are no guarantees
That's what you always say to me
But late at night I feel the tremble
In your touch, baby (oh, yeah)
Oh, what I'm trying to say to you
I never said to anyone, I promise...

[Chorus: All, (AJ), Nick & Brian]
I promise you (you, you, you, you)
From the bottom of my heart (from the bottom of my heart)
I will love you till death do us part
(Oh, sugar, darling, I promise, yeah)
I promise you (I promise you)
As a lover and a friend (as a lover and a friend)
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am
I promise you (with everything I am)
From the bottom of my heart (from the bottom of my heart)
I will love you till death do us part

I promise you (I promise you, babe)
As a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am (you're everything I am)

Oh, yeah, with everything I am...

Everything's gone a bit wrong

I know you've been hurt
But you really need to give us a chance

[Chorus: All]
You need love
Please don't change the way you are
Soon you'll live within my heart
You deserve it, you know it
You've been searching for it all of your life
You need love
Don't be scared to try again
You can rest upon my chest
And I'll hold you, I'll save you
You've been searching for it all of your life
(You need love, you need love)

[Verse 2: Howie & AJ]
I need to know
Can I be the one you trust?
Be your friend, I'll give you all
All of the things you dream of
Tell me, can I be your man?
Hole in your heart (your heart)
There's a wound I wanna heal
If you're willing, I'll be here
Here to fix the broken
Let me change the life you live, oh-oh!

[Chorus: All & AJ]
You need love
Please don't change the way you are
Soon you'll live within my heart (oh!)
You deserve it, you know it
You've been searching for it all of your life

Don't be scared to try again
You can rest upon my chest
And I'll hold you, I'll save you
You've been searching for it all of your life
(You need love, need love)

[Bridge: Nick & Brian]
You've been searching for it
All of your life, yeah
(You need love, you need love)
You've been searching for it
All of your life, oh, oh, oh, oh!
You need love, you need love
Don't change the way you are
You need love
Searching for it all of your life

[Chorus: All, Brian, Nick & AJ]
You need love
Please don't change the way you are
Soon you'll live within my heart
You deserve it, you know it
You've been searching for it all of your life
(You need love), you need love
Don't be scared to try again (try again)
You can rest upon my chest (oh-yeah)
And I'll hold you, I'll save you
You've been searching for it all of your life

You've been searching for it all of your life
(You need love, you need love)

[Intro: AJ]
(Do-don't want you back)
Hey-yeah, oh-yeah

[Verse 1: AJ & Nick]
You hit me faster than a shark attack
You saw my picture on the Backstreet's Back, alright
And you were more than just a pretty face
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed babe
But I should've known that I would be
Another victim of your sexuality
But now we're done and over with
(Do-don't want you back)

[Chorus: All]
Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me, I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty, but you gotta go
I-I don't want you back

[Verse 2: AJ]
You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blinded so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize
(Realize, hey-yeah!)
Like all the hundred-, no, a thousand lies

[Chorus: All, Brian & AJ]
Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me, I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty, but you gotta go (yeah-hey!)
I-I don't want you back (back, no!)
I-I don't want you back (that's right)

[Bridge: Brian, Nick & All]
Baby, don't bother telling me your reasons why
Just let us sing this story 'bout you and I
Don't you back, that's all I know
(Don't want you back, don't want you back)
All I can say, don't want you back
You know you gotta go (oh-oh-oh!)

[Chorus: All, Nick & AJ]
Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me, I know
(Don't want you back)
That's all I can say (don't want you back)
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty, but you gotta go
(Oh, gotta go, oh-oh-oh)
I-I don't want you back

[Outro: All, Brian & Nick]
Don't want you back, that's all I know
Back (oh-no), back
That's all I can say
Don't want you back (back, no!)
Don't want you back
You know you gotta go
I-I don't want you back

[Verse 1: AJ]
Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you within me, I can't find no rest
Where I’m going is anybody’s guess

[Chorus: Nick with Howie]
I tried to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is
Incomplete!

[Verse 2: AJ with Howie & All]
Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby, it’s written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

[Chorus: Nick with Howie, All]
I tried to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is
Incomplete!

[Bridge: AJ & All]
I don’t mean to drag it on
But I can’t seem to let you go
I don’t want to make you
Face this world alone
I wanna let you go
Alone, oh-oh-oh-oh!

[Chorus: Nick with Howie, AJ & All]
I tried to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is...
(Going to be is)

[Outro: Nick]
Incomplete, incomplete

[Verse 1: Nick]
Looking at your picture
From when we first met
You gave me a smile that I could never forget
And nothing I could do
Could protect me from you that night
Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind
The days would blend
'Cause we stayed up all night
Yeah you and I were everything, everything to me

[Chorus: All & Nick]
I just want you to know
That I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe
That there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

[Verse 2: AJ with Howie & Brian, AJ with Brian]
All the doors are closing
I'm trying to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day
The day you slipped away

[Chorus: All]
I just want you to know
That I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe
That there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

[Bridge: AJ with Kevin & All]
That since I lost you, I lost myself
No I can't fake it, there's no one else

[Chorus: Nick with Kevin, (AJ) & All]
I just want you to know
That I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe
That there's a day you'll come back to me (back to me)
But still I have to say, I have to say!
I would do it all again (again!)
Just want you to know

[Outro: All & Nick]
'Cause I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe
That there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

[Intro: AJ]
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Nick & All]
I never thought that I would lose my mind
That I could control this
Never thought that I'd be left behind
That I was stronger than you (baby)
Girl, if only I knew what I've done
You know, so why don't you tell me
(And I) I would bring down the moon and the sun
To show how much I care

[Chorus: All]
Don't wanna lose you now
Baby, I know we can win this
Don't wanna lose you now
No-no, or ever again

[Verse 2: Brian with Kevin, All]
I've got this feeling you're not gonna stay
It's burning within me
The fear or losing of slipping away
It just keeps getting closer (baby)
Whatever reason to leave that I've had
My place was always beside you
And I wish that I didn't need you so bad
You're face just won't go away

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Don't wanna lose you now
(Don't wanna lose you now)
Baby, I know we can win this
Don't wanna lose you now
(Don't wanna lose you now)
No-no, or ever again
Don't wanna lose you now
(Don't wanna lose you now)

[Bridge: AJ, Nick & All]
I never thought that I would lose my mind
That I could control this, yes
Never thought that I'd be left behind
That I was stronger than you, oh-oh!
Don't wanna lose to loneliness
Girl, I know we can win
Don't wanna lose to emptiness
(Oh-no) never again

[Chorus: All, Brian & Nick]
Don't wanna lose you now (no way)
Baby, I know we can win this
Don't wanna lose you now
No-no, or ever again (we just begun this)

[Outro: AJ & All]
Don't want to lose you now
Oh I know we can this
(Don't wanna lose you now)
Don't want to lose you now
No-no, or ever again
Don't wanna lose you now

[Verse 1: Brian with Howie]
Everybody knows
That I was such a fool to ever let go of you
But baby, I was wrong
Yeah, I know I said, "we'd be better off alone"
It was time that we moved on
I know I broke your heart
I didn't mean to break your heart
But baby, here I am

[Chorus: AJ with All]
Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised
And I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth
And now I'm crawling back to you

[Verse 2: Nick with AJ, (Howie), Nick with Brian]
I know you're in there
And you can make me wait
But I'm not going away
It's the least that I can do
Just to tell you face to face
I was lying to myself (lying to myself)
Now I'm dying in this hell (dying in this hell)
Girl, I know you're mad
I can't blame you for being mad
But baby, here I am

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised
And now I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in? (let me in)
I was running from the truth
And now I'm crawling back to you

[Bridge: All & Nick]
If you could see these tears I'm crying
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking
Hear my heart that's barely breathing
You will see a different man

[Reprise: AJ & All]
But baby, here I am
Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised
And I'm crawling back to you

[Chorus: All, Nick, (Brian) & AJ]
(Come on) Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in? (let me in)
I was running from the truth (oh, no-no)
And now I'm crawling back to you (darling)
Banging on your front door (darling)
My pride spilled on the floor (darling, yeah!)
My hands and knees are bruised
Now I'm crawling back to you (yeah!)

[Outro: Nick, Howie, (Brian) & Kevin]
Now I'm crawling back to you
Crawling back to you
(Crawling back to you)
Crawling back to you

[Intro: Howie & All]
Weird world, weird world
Hey hey hey

[Verse 1: Nick]
The sun is over the city
But it's an orange day
There is reason for looking up
But I'm feeling down
You see I've got to catch a plane
Won't buy a ticket
'Cause it's hard to just stop
When you're spinning around

[Chorus: Nick, AJ with Howie, All]
It's a weird world
Don't you know it?
It's a weird world
And it won't slow down
It's a weird world
No matter how you roll it
Hey hey hey
Sweet baby
There's a way
To stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it
Wear out your love

[Interlude: AJ]
It's a weird world, yeah

[Verse 2: Nick with Kevin]
Send a message
To a G.I. in the desert
Said, "thank you man
For bringing  another dawn"
Back here it's her and me
And we're having our first baby
He's out there taking them on

[Chorus: Nick, AJ, (AJ with Howie) & All]
It's a weird world
And I know you know it
It's a weird world
And it won't slow down
It's a weird world
No matter how you roll it
Hey hey hey
Sweet baby
There's a way
To stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it
Wear out (your love)

[Bridge: Nick with All]
I'm closing my eyes
But I'm starting to see
While he's looking at you
She was looking at me
The only thing it does
Is just keep me away from you
Sure, part of this place
Would cheer if I die
But don't let it take away
Your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile

[Chorus: All, AJ, Nick & AJ]
Hey hey hey
Sweet baby
There's a way
To stand up and fight it
(Hey hey hey!)
Hey hey hey
Sweet baby
There's a way
For you to decide it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it
Wear out your love!

[Outro: Nick & All]
Hey hey hey
It's a weird world
Don't you know it?
Hey hey hey
It's a weird world
Don't you know it?
Hey hey hey
It's a weird world
Don't you know it?
Hey hey hey

[Intro: All]
I'll be the one

[Verse 1: AJ]
I guess you were lost when I met you
Still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more than mysteries and lies

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
There you are, wild and free
Reaching out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

[Chorus: All]
I'll be the one (I'll be the one)
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light (I'll be the light)
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

[Verse 2: Nick]
To hold you
And make sure that you'll be alright
'Cause my faith is gone
And I want to take you from darkness to light

[Pre-Chorus: AJ]
There you are, wild and free
Reaching out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

[Chorus: All]
I'll be the one (I'll be the one)
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light (I'll be the light)
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

[Refrain: Nick]
To hold you
And make sure that you'll be alright

[Bridge: Brian]
You need me like I need you
We can share our dreams coming true
I can show you what true love means
Just take me hand, baby please

[Middle 8: All]
I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it alright
I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run

[Chorus: All]
I'll be the one (I'll be the one)
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light (I'll be the light)
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

[Middle 8: All]
I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it alright
I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it alright
I'll be the one

[Refrain: Nick]
To hold you
And make sure that you will be alright

[Outro: AJ]
I'll be the one

[Verse 1: Brian]
Who are you now?
Are you still the same or
Did you change somehow?
What do you do at this very moment
When I think of you
And when I'm looking back
How we were young and stupid
Do you remember that?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick]
No matter how I fight it, can't deny it
Just can't let you go

[Chorus: All]
I still need you, I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

[Verse 2: AJ, Howie with AJ, Howie]
Now look at me
Instead of moving on I refuse to see
That I keep coming back
Yeah, I'm stuck in a moment
That wasn't meant to last (to last!)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick with AJ & Howie]
I try to fight it, can't deny it
You don't even know

[Chorus: All, Brian & AJ]
That I still need you, I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel (feel you) like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you (no, no!)

[Bridge: Kevin with AJ, Kevin & All]
I wish I could find you
Just like you found me
Then I would never let you go, oh-oh-oh!
(Me go, I care about you)

[Chorus: All, Nick & Brian]
Though everything's been said and done (yeah!)
I still feel you (I still feel ya)
Like I'm right beside you (like I'm right here beside you)
But still no (still no word) word from you

[Intro: AJ]
Hmmm-mmh
Oh-oh-oh yeah

[Verse 1: AJ & Nick]
It's not that I can't live without you
It's just that I don't even want to try
Every night I dream about you
Ever since the day we said goodbye
If I wasn't such a fool
Right now I'd be holding you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Baby if I only knew

[Chorus: Brian with All]
The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart?

[Interlude: AJ]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, hmmm

[Verse 2: Brian & Nick]
I don't know how it got so crazy
But I'll do anything to set things right
'Cause you're love is so amazing
Baby you're the best thing in my life
Let me prove my love is real
And make you feel the way I feel
I promise I would give the world
If only if you tell me girl

[Chorus: Brian with All]
The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart?

[Bridge: Brian, AJ & All]
Give me one more chance
(Give me one more chance)
To give my love to you
(To give you my love, my love)
'Cause no one on this Earth
Loves you like I do
Tell me...

[Chorus: Brian with All, AJ & Brian]
The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you (get to you)
And find a way back to your heart? (heart!)
I turn back time
To make you mine
And find a way back to your heart
(Help me find a way back to your heart)
I beg and plead
Fall to my knees (my knees)
To find a way back to your heart

[Countermelody: All, Brian & Kevin]
The words to say (these arms of mine)
The road to take (are open wide)
To find a way back to your heart
(From now until the end of time)
What can I do (you are my world)
To get to you (what can I do?)
And find a way back to your heart?
(This heart of mine belongs to you)

[Outro: AJ]
Hmmm, back to your heart

[Verse 1: Howie]
Here we are in the arms of one another
And we still go on searching for each other
Knowing that hate is wrong
And love is right for us tonight
When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

[Chorus: Brian]
It's a place I have never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me
That I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to
Look into your Spanish eyes

[Verse 2: Nick]
Let it be (let it be)
If we are nothing more than dreamers
Who believe that we see no one between us
How can they be in my heart (in my heart)
And in my mind? (in my mind)
When all I can find
When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

[Chorus: Brian]
It's a place I have never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me
That I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to
Look into your Spanish eyes

[Bridge: AJ]
I loved you from a distance
Thought I couldn't reach that far
I can't believe how close that we are
When I look into your Spanish eyes
And the world is so beautiful tonight

[Chorus: Brian]
It's a place I have never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me
That I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to
Look into your Spanish eyes

[Intro: AJ]
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1: AJ & Nick with Brian]
Jodie was a long way from home
She could make alone look pretty
Her attitude made a part of the landscape
Riding her bike through Alphabet City
She likes to party in the backseat
Under the bridge on the Brooklyn side
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow
Taking bets that the sun won't rise

[Pre-Chorus 1: AJ with Nick & Howie]
She said
"What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
She can lick her lips and smile
And make you wanna believe

[Chorus: All]
That the consequences of your actions
Really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction
Taking you day by day
She says, "nothing's forever in this crazy world"
Still I'm falling in love
With the right now poster girl

[Interlude: AJ, Nick & All]
Right now, right now
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh (oh, oh-oh)

[Verse 2: AJ & Nick with Brian, Howie]
Jodie like to shoplift in stores
Ride alongside the rich and famous
Get in elevators, press emergency stops
And make love on the floor 'til the camera made us
And no woman in the world
Ever made me feel like my heart's on fire
Where she'd walk, I followed (followed)
When she left, I cried

[Pre-Chorus 2: AJ & Nick with Brian, AJ with Howie]
What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?
And I was wrapped around her finger
And I began to believe

[Chorus: All & AJ]
That the consequences of your actions
Really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction
Taking you day by day
She says, "nothing's forever in this crazy world"
Still I'm falling in love
With the right now poster girl
That the consequences of your actions
Really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction
Taking you day by day (day by day)
She says, "nothing's forever in this crazy world" (crazy world)
Still I'm falling in love
With the right now poster girl

[Break: Nick & Kevin, AJ & All]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
(La-la-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
(La-la-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la-la (oh!)

[Bridge: All with AJ, AJ with Brian]
Tell me what you want from me
I've got everything you need
It's getting hard for me to breathe
Let me be your guarantee, oh-oh!

[Chorus: All & AJ]
That the consequences of your actions
Really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction
Taking you day by day (day by day)
She says, "nothing's forever (forever) in this crazy world"
Still I'm falling in love
With the right now poster girl (poster girl)
That the consequences of your actions
Really are just a game (a game)
That your life is just a chain reaction
Taking you day by day (day by day!)
She says, "nothing's forever (forever)
In this crazy world" (crazy world)
Still I'm falling in love
With the right now poster girl

[Outro: AJ & Nick]
Right now, right now
Right now, oh, oh-oh
Poster girl, poster girl yeah
C'mon, c'mon

[Intro: AJ]
Oh, oh-no, mmmh, yeah

[Verse 1: AJ with Brian]
When we turn down the lights
The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
And girl, you know that
I would never ever let another's touch
Come between the two of us
'Cause no one else will ever take your place

[Chorus: AJ with Kevin]
No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch, you can do so much
No one else come close

[Interlude: All & AJ]
Mmmh-mmh-eh, mmh-mmh
(No one else comes close)
Mmmh-mmh, mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmmh-mmh-eh, mmh-mmh (oh-oh)
Mmmh-mmh-mmh-mmh

[Verse 2: Nick with Brian]
And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder
You're my dream come true, oh yeah
Girl, you know I'll always treasure
Every kiss and everyday
I love you girl in every way
And I always will, 'cause in my eyes, oh baby!

[Chorus: Nick, AJ with All]
No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch, you can do so much
Girl, can't you see that no one else comes close
No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You’re so special girl to me
And you’ll always be eternally (baby)
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch, you can do so much
No one else comes close

[Reprise: All & AJ]
Mmmh-mmh-eh, mmh-mmh
(No one else comes close)
Mmmh-mmh, mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh (oh girl)
Mmmh-mmh-eh, mmh-mmh (oh-oh-oh)

[Outro: AJ]
No one else comes close
Damn, I love you

[Intro: Nick]
Oh-no, oh

[Verse 1: Nick with Brian]
Take what you need
'Cause I can't hold my breath
Say what you feel
'Cause I got nothing left, oh
I made a promise to myself last night
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right

[Chorus: All & Nick]
And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
And it's so wonderful
It's a chance I take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all
Wouldn't matter anyway

[Verse 2: Kevin with Howie, Kevin with Brian]
Don't change a thing
You're perfect as you are
Time has a way, time is all I got
If my heart should shatter watching you
That'd be one less thing I'd have to prove

[Chorus: All & AJ]
And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
And it's so wonderful
It's a chance I take even if I break
And I lose it all (lose it all)
If I lose it all (lose it all, oh!)

[Bridge: AJ with Howie]
Heaven will be waiting
When I fall into your open arms
I'll believe you'll find me there
You'll find me there

[Chorus: All, AJ & Nick]
And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall (take the fall)
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
And it's so wonderful (yeah-yeah)
It's a chance I take even if I break
And I lose it all, (lose it all) if I lose it all
And if I lose it all (hey, yeah-yeah!)
There'll be nothing left to lose (no-no!)
And I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
(Knowing you are out there breathing)
And it's so wonderful (so wonderful)
It's a chance I take even if I break
And I lose it all (lose it all) if I lose it all
Wouldn't matter anyway

[Intro]
PDA, yeah
Printz Board on the beat
PDA

[Verse 1: Nick & Howie]
Intimate scenes
Fresh from my dreams
Over triple X movie screen
I could care less about being seen
High self esteem with you and me
(Ain't that the way it's s'posed to be?)
I say, baby, do you think?
Sugar so sweet, should'a rot my teeth
Instead it just rottens me, spoiled crazy

[Pre-Chorus: AJ]
Public display of affection
(Gotta make 'em)
Pointin' in our direction
(Watch 'em, watch 'em)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way

[Chorus: All & (AJ)]
We be at the club, the restaurant
The grocery store, the movies
Kissing and touching
With my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)

[Verse 2: Nick, Brian & AJ]
Remember at the beach, we brought the sheets
And we were harassed by police?
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we be the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach, yeah, yeah
Baby your suspense can be intense
It's got me convinced, oh yeah
You're the fingers to my instrument

[Pre-Chorus: AJ]
Public display of affection
(Gotta make them)
Pointin' in our direction
(Watch 'em, watch 'em)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way

[Chorus: All & (AJ)]
We be at the club, the restaurant
The grocery store, the movies
Kissing and touching
With my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
(I want your PDA)

[Bridge: AJ]
From the lobby to the patio
(Boy you so crazy)
And we're so compatible
From the Starbucks to the Navajo
(Hmm, you nasty)
And we're so compatible

[Chorus: All, (AJ) & Brian]
We be at the club, the restaurant
The grocery store, the movies
Kissing and touching
With my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your PDA, ey, ey (I want your PDA)
Your PDA, ey, ey (I want your PDA)
(PDA, hey yeah!)
Your PDA, ey, ey (I want your PDA)
Your PDA, ey, ey, your PDA, ey, ey
(I want your PDA)

[Outro: Howie & AJ]
I wanna rub (I want your PDA)
All over your body (I, I, I want your PDA)
I wanna rub (I want your PDA)
All over your body (I, I, I want your PDA)
I want your PDA (that's right)
Public display of affection
I want your PDA

[Verse 1: Brian, Howie & AJ]
It takes a lot to know what is love
It's not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayer to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

[Chorus: AJ, Brian & All]
You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should to know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

[Verse 2: Kevin, Brian & Howie]
God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years or grace
And it flatters me when I see
A smile on your face
I wanna thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
And be the perfect son

[Chorus: All & Brian]
You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should to know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

[Bridge: All, AJ & Brian]
You showed me how to love
(You showed me how to love)
You showed me how to care
(You showed me how to care)
And you showed me that
You will always (always) be there (be there)
I wanna thank you for that time
And I'm proud to say you're mine

[Chorus: All, AJ & Brian]
You showed me (you showed me!)
When I was young just how to grow (to grow)
You showed me
Everything that I should to know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

[Outro: Brian, Kevin, (AJ) & Howie]
'Cause mom you always were
Mom you always were
(Mom you always were)
You know you always were
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan
I love you, mom

[Intro: Brian]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick]
You see me sitting here, a smile upon my face
The time has come
But you know that it's not too late
There's been too many things
Together we have seen
It's not that hard if we start to believe

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
And we're not going to take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain?
So please...

[Chorus: All]
Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight?
We'll find, the answer to our life

[Verse 2: AJ]
This world is not at ease
We seem to hide the truth
Thinking there's only
So much we can really do
It's up to you and me to face our destiny
The jury's here so let's take the stand

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
And we're not going to take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain?
So please...

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
(We fall out of line)
Is it today or is it tonight?
We'll find (we will find)
The answer to our life

[Bridge: Howie & Brian]
So, tell me why we have to cry (and not try)
When there's so many things we can do
To help this troubled world start a new
I need a reason, I need a sign
There's no turning back I'm here by your side
Is it today or maybe tonight?
We'll find the answer to our life

[Chorus: All, Nick, (AJ) & Brian]
Show me the way, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today? Is it tonight?
The answer to our life
Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight?
We will find, the answer to our life
Show me a reason, give me a sign (oh yeah)
Tell me the way we, fall out of line (fall out of line)
Is it today or is it tonight? (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We'll find, the answer to our life

[Intro: All & AJ]
Oooh, ooh, oooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah
Oooh, ooh, oooh, ooh
Oh, ooh, ooh
Oooh, ooh, oooh, ooh
Oh, oh, oooh
Oooh, ooh, oooh, ooh

[Verse: AJ & All]
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
Sunday afternoon

[Verse 1: Brian]
We've been through days of thunder
Some people said we don't belong
They try to pull us under
But here we stand together
And we're million's strong

[Pre-Chorus: All, Nick & Brian]
Let's get on with the show
(Let's get started)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are
And this one goes out to...

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Everyone, everyone, everyone
So this one goes out to you, everyone (yeah)
We're standing strong 'cause of what you've done
And this one goes out to you

[Verse 2: AJ]
We've been inside the circus
We took the pleasure with the pain
I guess there's something about us
Whatever comes around
We'll always stay the same, oh-yeah

[Pre-Chorus: All, Brian, (Nick) & AJ]
Let's get on with the show
(Oh, let's get started, yeah)
Turn the lights down low
(Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start
(You were there)
We know who you are
(We know who you are)

[Chorus: All, AJ & Nick]
Everyone (everyone), everyone, everyone
And this one goes out to everyone (hey-yeah)
We're standing strong 'cause of what you've done
And this one goes out to you

[Bridge: AJ, Brian & All]
Now we're minutes away till it's time to play
Our heartbeats are rising, they're letting you in
Time for the show to begin
Here, we're standing strong 'cause of what you've done
This one goes out to you-you-you
You make us feel like we've just begun
And this one goes to you, yeah!

[Chorus: All, AJ & Brian]
Everyone, everyone (oh-yeah), everyone
Say this one goes out to everyone (oh-yeah)
We're standing strong 'cause of what you've done
And this one goes out to you, ooh
Everyone, everyone (yeah-yeah-hey!), everyone
Say this one goes out to everyone
We're standing strong 'cause of what you've done
And this one goes out to you

[Verse 1: Brian & AJ]
I can see that you've been crying
You can't hide it with a lie
What's the use in you denying
That what you have is wrong?
I heard him promise you forever
But forever's come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines

[Chorus: All & Nick]
Oh, I will love you more than that
I won't say the words, then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that

[Verse 2: Nick]
Baby, you deserve much better
What's the use in holding on?
Don't you see it's now or never
'Cause I just can't be friends
Baby, knowing in the end

[Chorus: All & Brian]
That I will love you more than that
I won't say the words, then take them back
(Can't take them back)
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say (hey!)

[Bridge: All, AJ & Brian]
There's not a day that passes by
I don't wonder why we haven't tried
It's not too late to change your mind
So take my hand, don't say goodbye
I will love you more than that
I won't say the words, then take them back

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Oh, I will love you more than that
I won't say the words, (no-no) then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that
Oh, I will love you more than that (more than that)
I won't say the words, then take them back (back)
Don't give loneliness a chance (a chance)
Baby, listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that

[Verse 1: Brian]
Close your eyes, make a wish
This could last forever
If only you could stay with me now
So tell me what it is
That keeps us from each other now
Yeah, it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

[Chorus: All]
No, I can't let you go
You're apart of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls
'Cause I miss you

[Verse 2: Brian with AJ, AJ]
Take my hand, take my life
Just don't take forever
And let me feel your pain kept inside
(Oh-yeah) There's gotta be a way
For you and I together now
Yeah-yeah, it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

[Chorus: All]
No, I can't let you go
You're apart of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls
'Cause I miss you

[Bridge: Howie with Kevin & AJ]
It's an illusion
How can I feel this way
If I can't have you?
It's an illusion
Nothing is real this way
If I can't have you

[Chorus: All, AJ, (Nick), AJ & Nick]
No, I can't let you go
You're apart of me now (now!)
Caught by the taste of your kiss
(I don't wanna know!)
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
(I'm climbing the walls)
Now I'm climbing the walls
'Cause I miss you, ooh-ooh!

[Outro: All, Brian & AJ, AJ]
I can't let you go now!
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this (no!)
Now I'm climbing the walls
'Cause I miss (I miss you)

[Verse 1: Nick & Brian]
I close the door
Like so many times, so many times before
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
I wanna let you walk away tonight
Without a word
I try to sleep, yeah
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
A thousand more regrets unraveling, oh!
If you were here right now
I swear I'd tell you this

[Chorus: All]
Baby, I don't wanna waste another day
Keeping it inside is killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted
Comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby, I would tell you
Every time you leave I'm inconsolable

[Verse 2: AJ]
I climb the walls, yeah
I can see the edge, but I can't take the fall, no
I've memorized the number
So why can't I make the call?
Maybe 'cause I know you will always be with me
In the possibility, oh-oh-oh!

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Baby, I don't wanna waste another day
(Another day)
Keeping it inside is killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted
Comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby, I would tell you
Every time you leave I'm inconsolable
(Oh-no, no-no!)

[Bridge: Howie & Nick]
I don't wanna be like this
I just wanna let you now
That everything that I hold in
Is everything I can't let go
Oh-oh, oh! I can't let go

[Chorus: All, Brian, (AJ) & Nick]
Yeah, 'cause baby
I don't wanna waste another day (waste another day)
Keeping it inside is killing me (is killing me 'cause)
'Cause all I ever wanted (all I ever wanted)
Comes right down
To you (to you), to you (to you)
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby, I would tell you
Every time you leave I'm inconsolable
(No-no-no)

[Interlude: Howie, Nick, (Brian) & All]
Don't you know it baby
I don't wanna waste another day
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby, I would tell you
Every time you leave I'm inconsolable
Yeah-yeah (yeah-yeah-yeah!)

[Outro: Nick & AJ]
Oh, I'm inconsolable
Whoa, yeah, oh-oh
I'm inconsolable (yeah)

[Intro: AJ]
Oh-no-no baby
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick, AJ with Kevin, All]
How can I begin to
Tell you what you do to
Me every time I hear ya
More willing to wanna see ya
I know that there's no use in
Tryin' to explain my confusion
But still I'm not complainin'
'Bout my situation
Let's not talk about a possible ending
The very first time that I
Was looking to be your fella
I found my inspiration
Hiding in your expression
And so I put myself forward
For your consideration
Yeah-yeah-yeah!

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Let's not talk about a possible ending
Let's not think about it everyday
And I know I'm so in love with you
I'm finding it harder and harder to breathe
Every time I hear my beautiful woman, yeah

[Verse 2: Nick with Brian, AJ with All]
And so we put the top down
To take you drivin' downtown
I guess we'll know just what to do
When we're looking to fool around
It's too late to stop me
I know we're gonna get down
Get down, oh-no, no-no!

[Chorus: All, AJ & Nick]
Let's not talk about a possible ending (baby!)
Let's not think about it everyday (oh!)
And I know (I know) I'm so (I'm so)
In love (in love) with you (with you, baby)
I'm finding it harder and harder to breathe
Every time I hear my beautiful woman
(My beautiful woman)
My beautiful woman
(Yes you are, yes you are, yes you are)
My beautiful woman
(Anything that you want me to, I'll do)
(Now) my beautiful woman (my beautiful)

[Bridge: All, AJ & Nick]
B is for beautiful as the sunshine (sunshine)
E tells me everything is feeling alright
A goes to
U and me swinging it down (swinging it)
T is two
I want you, you've got me acting like a
Fool

[Chorus: All, Nick & AJ]
Let's not talk about a possible ending (oh yeah-yeah!)
Let's not think about it everyday (everyday)
And I know (I know) I'm so
In love with you (baby)
I'm finding it harder and harder to breathe
Every time I hear...
Let's not talk about a possible ending (possible ending)
Let's not think about it everyday (yeah-yeah-yeah)
And I know I'm so (I'm so in love)
In love with you (you)
I'm finding it harder and harder to breathe (ooh-ooh)
Every time I hear my beautiful woman
(My beautiful woman)
My beautiful woman
(Yes you are, yes you are, girl you are)
My beautiful woman
(You're so beautiful)
My beautiful woman
(My beautiful woman)

[Verse 1: Brian]
I know that I, I can't believe
Just what the past has brought me
To the man I want to be
I know that we have had some times
That we can't forget the struggle
'Cause we have so far to go

[Pre-Chorus: AJ]
I know we've changed
But change can be so good
So, let's not forget
Why it's understood that...

[Chorus: All]
Time, look where we are
And what we've been through
Time, sharing our dreams
(Every little bit of lit with you)
Time, goes on and on everyday, baby
Time is what it is
Come what may (come what may)

[Verse 2: Nick]
I remember when, mom used to say
That things are getting better
And you'll soon be on your way
Remember those days
When we would sing at the drop of a dime
Way back when nothing mattered
Mmmm, mmm, mm

[Pre-Chorus: Brian & AJ]
Oh, I know we've changed
But change can be so good
Oh, so let's not forget
Why it's understood that

[Chorus: All, AJ & Nick]
Time, look where we are
And what we've been through
(Look where we are)
Time, sharing our dreams
(Dreams, dreams, dreams, oh yeah)
Time, (goes on and on)
Goes on and on everyday (everyday)
Time is what it is (oh)
Come what may (come what may)

[Bridge: AJ & All]
So here we are (here we are)
And we'll always stay together
And through it all you know
We owe it all to you, you, you, you
Time goes on and stops

[Chorus: All, Brian, (Nick) & AJ]
Time, look where we are
And what we've been through, baby
Time, sharing our dreams
(I wanna let you know how much we care)
Time, goes on and on everyday (everyday)
(On and on and on and on)
Time is what it is (time is what it is)
Time, look where we are
And what we've been through, baby
Time, sharing our dreams (sharing our dreams)
(Every little bit of life)
Time, goes on and on everyday
Time is what it is
Come what may (come what may)

[Outro: Brian]
Time, goes on and on everyday
Time is what it is
Come what may, come what may

[Intro: Brian]
Yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Brian & Howie]
It seems like yesterday when I said, "I do"
And after all this time
My heart still burns for you
If you don't know by now that you're my only one
Then take a look inside me
And watch my heartstrings come undone
I know I promised you forever
Is there no stronger word I can use
To reassure you when the storm
Is raging outside
You're my safest place to hide

[Chorus: Brian & All]
Can you see me, here I am (here I am)
I need you like I needed you then
When I feel like giving up
I climb inside your heart and still find (you're my)
You're my safest place to hide

[Verse 2: Nick & AJ]
You see colors no one else can see
In every breath you hear a symphony
You understand me like nobody can
I feel my soul unfolding
Like a flower blooming
When this whole world gets too crazy
And there's nowhere left to go
I know you give me sanctuary
You're the only truth I know
You're the road back home

[Chorus: AJ with All, AJ]
Can you see me, here I am
Standing here where I've always been
And when words are not enough
I climb inside your heart and still find
You're my safest place to hide
(My safest place to hide)

[Bridge: Kevin]
I know I promised you forever
Is there no stronger word I can use
To reassure you when the storm
Is raging outside
You're my safest place to hide

[Chorus: Nick with All, (AJ), Brian & Nick]
Oh! Can you see me (see me)
Here I am (here I am)
Standing here where I've always been
(Where I've always been)
When I feel like giving up (oh-oh)
I climb inside your heart and still find
Yeah-yeah
You're my safest place to hide, oh yeah
You're my safest place to hide

[Intro: AJ]
Oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: AJ]
She keeps her secrets in her eyes
She wraps the truth inside her lies
Just when I can't say what she's done to me
She comes to me
And leads me back to paradise
She's so hard to hold
But I can't let go

[Chorus: Nick with All, Nick & Howie]
I'm a house of cards in a hurricane
A reckless ride in the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel
She'll dance away just like a child
She drives me crazy, drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles
Oh when she smiles, she smiles

[Verse 2: Brian & All]
Maybe I'd fight it if I could
(Maybe I'd fight it if I could)
It hurts so bad but feels so good
She opens up just like a rose to me
When she's close to me (ah-ah)
Anything she'd ask me to, I would
It's out of control
But I can't let go

[Chorus: Nick with All, Nick]
I'm a house of cards in a hurricane
A reckless ride in the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel
She'll dance away just like a child
She drives me crazy, drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles
Oh-no, when she smiles

[Bridge: Howie, AJ & All]
When she looks at me
(When she looks at me)
I get so weak

[Chorus: All, Nick, (AJ) & Howie]
I'm a house of cards in a hurricane
A reckless ride in the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel
She'll dance away just like a child
She drives me crazy, drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles
Oh when she smiles
When she smiles
She smiles (when she smiles)

[Outro: Nick & Howie]
When she smiles
Oh when she smiles
When she smiles

[Intro: Brian]
Yeah, mmh-mm (no no, no no)

[Verse 1: Brian, AJ & Nick]
I was looking for something
On the crime scene
Where you're in too deep
I found a note with his number
It's just another clue (that leads to you)
I got a little suspicious
I got a feeling that you ain't true to me
I should've known better
That to buy your lies (your sweet disguise)

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
That you're not for me, babe

[Chorus: All, Nick, Brian & AJ]
No no, uh uh!
Things will never be the same again with you
No no, uh uh!
And now I know what it's coming to
No no, uh uh!
'Cause if you think that it's the way that love should be
Let me tell you it's not for me (no no no)

[Verse 2: AJ & Nick]
I don't wanna be part of your screenplay
Just tell me, did you rehearse on me?
Just tell me the story
Baby who's to win? (Me or him?)
Caught in the middle
And I'm tired of your games of hide and seek
I'm getting the feeling
That it's time for me to leave

[Pre-Chorus: Brian & AJ]
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see (eyes to see)
That you're not for me, baby!

[Chorus: All, AJ, Brian & Nick]
No no, uh uh! (yeah, yeah)
Things will never be the same again with you
No no, uh uh!
And now I know what it's coming to
No no, uh uh!
'Cause if you think that it's the way that love should be
Let me tell you it's not for me

[Interlude: Brian, AJ & All]
Yeah, yeah!
I said no no! (no way)
No no, no no

[Bridge: All & AJ]
I had enough of your talk, your games
And they won't go away (won't go away)
Justify my reasons to say (say, reasons to say!)

[Chorus: All, AJ, Brian & Nick]
No no, uh uh! (uh uh, yeah yeah)
Let me hear you say no no uh uh!
No no
Let me tell you it's not for me
I said no no, uh uh!
'Cause if you think that it's the way that love should be
Well let me tell you it's not for me!
No no, uh uh!
Things will never be the same again with you
No no, uh uh! (yeah)
And now I know what it's coming to
No no, uh uh! (mmh, mmh)
'Cause if you think that it's the way that love should be
Well let me tell you it's not for me!

[Verse 1: Brian]
"When you come back, I won't be here"
She said, and gently pulled me near
"If you want to talk you can call
And no, it's not your fault"
I just smiled and said, "let go of me"
Now there's something I've just got to know
Did someone else steal my part?
She said, "it's not my fault"

[Chorus: Brian with Howie & AJ, All]
Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

[Verse 2: AJ]
I was drifted in between
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah-yeah
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been, oh then my heart...

[Chorus: All with Nick, AJ]
Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true (true)
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious (mysterious)
When the one you want doesn't want you (want you)

[Bridge: AJ with Kevin & Howie, Brian]
I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind
In your head
When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
"If you want to talk, give me a call"

[Chorus: All, AJ, Nick, (Kevin) & Brian]
Heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
(Oh yeah-yeah-yeah-hey-hey!)
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
(All so dark and mysterious)
When the one you want doesn't want you too
(When the one that you want doesn't want you)
Then my heart did time in Siberia (Siberia...)
(Hey yeah-eh!)
Was waiting for the lie to come true
(I've waited, I've waited!)
Cause it's all so dark and mysterious (mysterious)
When the one you want doesn't want you too
(When the one you want doesn't want you too, ooh-ooh!)

[Outro: Kevin & All]
Siberia, Siberia
When the one you want doesn't want you too

[Intro: Brian & All]
Yeah-yeah, yeah
(Oooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1: Brian]
I open my eyes, I see your face
I cannot hide, I can't erase
The way you make me feel inside
You complete me girl, that's why
Something about you makes me feel
Baby my heart wants to reveal
I'm down on my knees, I'm asking you
Say these three words I wanna hear from you

[Chorus: Brian & All]
Yes I will
Take your hand and walk with you
Yes I will
Say these three words that promise to
Yes I will
Give you everything you need
And something start a family with you
Yes I will
Take your hand and walk with you, yeah
Yes I will
Baby I promise you
Yes I will
Give you everything you need
And someday start a family with you

[Interlude: Brian & AJ]
Oh yes I will (oh babe, baby)

[Verse 2: AJ & Kevin]
This is no ordinary love
And I can never have enough
(I can't get enough of)
Of all the things you've given to me
You're my heart (my heart)
My soul (my soul), my everything (my everything)
Every night I thank you Lord (I thank you Lord)
For giving me the strength to love her more and more
Each day I promise her
As long as I hear those three words

[Chorus: Brian & All]
Yes I will
Take your hand and walk with you
Yes I will
Say these three words that promise to
Yes I will
Give you everything you need
And something start a family with you
Yes I will
Take your hand and walk with you, yeah
Yes I will
Baby I promise you
Yes I will
Give you everything you need
And someday start a family with you

[Bridge: AJ, Nick & All]
I stand beside you
In everything you do, baby
(Yes I will)
Wherever you go, whatever you do
Baby I'll be there, oh baby I'll be there
(I will be there)
As God as my witness I will carry this through
'Til death do us part I promise to you

[Chorus: Brian, AJ, (Nick) & All]
Yes I will (oh-oh!)
Take your hand and walk with you
Yes I will
Baby, I promise you (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Yes I will
Give you everything you need
And something start a family with you
Yes I will (oh I will)
Yes I will (ooh-yeah)
Yes I will
Oh-oh, I promise you, babe
Everything's gonna be alright (it's gonna be alright)

[Outro: Kevin & AJ]
I, I, I, I will (I will)

[Verse 1: Brian]
The things we did, the things we said
Keep coming back to me
And make me smile again
You showed me how to face the truth
Everything that's good in me I owe to you

[Pre-Chorus 1: Howie]
Though the distance that's between us
Now may seem to be too far
It will never separate us
Deep inside I know you are...

[Chorus: Nick with All, Nick & Brian]
Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
Always close, everyday
Every step along the way
Even though for now
We've got to say goodbye
I know you will be forever in my life
(In my life, yeah) Never gone

[Verse 2: Brian]
No, no, no!
I walk alone these empty streets
There is not a second you're not here with me
The love you gave, the grace you've shown
Will always give me strength
And be my cornerstone

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick & All]
(Somehow)
Somehow you found a way
To see the best I have in me
As long as time goes on
I swear to you that you will be...

[Chorus: AJ with All, AJ & Kevin, (AJ), Kevin with All]
Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
Always close (always close)
Everyday (everyday, yeah!)
Every step along the way
Even though for now
We've got to say goodbye
I know you will be forever in my life
(In my life, yeah!)

[Bridge: Brian, AJ & All]
Never gone from me (gone from me)
If there's one thing I believe (I believe)
I will see you somewhere down the road again

[Chorus: All, AJ & Brian]
Never gone, (never gone!) never far
In my heart is where you are
Always close (always close), everyday (everyday)
Every step along the way (way)
Even though for now
We've got to say goodbye (yeah yeah)
I know you will be forever in my life (in my life)
Never gone, (never gone!) never far
In my heart is where you are
(In my heart is where you are)
Always close, everyday
Every step along the way

[Outro: Brian]
Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are

[Verse 1: Brian]
Even a lover
Makes a mistake sometimes
Like any other
Fall out and lose his mind
And I’m sorry, for the things I did
For your teardrops, over words I said
Can you forgive me
And open your heart once again?
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: All & Brian]
It's true, I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true
Without you I would fall apart
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: AJ & Nick]
Whatever happened
I know that I was wrong, oh yes
Can you believe me?
Maybe your faith is gone, oh, yes it is
But I love you and I always will
So I wonder if you want me still
Can you forgive me
And open your heart once again?
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: All, (AJ) & Nick]
It's true (yes, it's true)
I mean it (yeah, yeah)
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true (it's true)
Without you I would fall apart
Oooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge: Brian]
I'd do anything to make it up to you
So please understand (please understand)
And open your heart once again

[Chorus: All, (Nick), Brian & AJ]
It's true, I mean it (oh, oh, oh)
From the bottom of my heart (from the bottom of my heart)
Yeah, it's true (yeah, yeah)
Without you I would fall apart (apart)
It's true (you know it's true, babe)
I mean it (you know I mean it)
From the bottom of my heart (from the bottom of my heart)
Yeah, it's true (I mean it)
Without you I would fall apart

[Outro: Brian]
Oh, oh, yeah, it's true

[Intro: AJ]
Hey-yeah-yeah-yeah, hey
Oooh-ah!

[Verse 1: Brian & Nick]
This one's for the mothers
Who have lost a child
And this one's for the gypsies
Who left their hearts behind
This is for the strangers
Sleeping in my heart
Who take what they want (yeah)
And leave while it's still dark

[Pre-Chorus 1: AJ & Brian, AJ & Howie, Brian]
No one is glamorously lonely
All by themselves (all by themselves)

[Chorus: All & Brian]
This is a song for the unloved
This is the music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will
Help me leave the past behind
It's a song for the unloved
The unloved...

[Verse 2: Brian, Nick with Howie]
This one's for the bridesmaid
Never the bride
And this one's for the dreamers
Who locked their faith inside
And this for the widows
Who think there's only one
For the dying fathers
That never told their sons

[Pre-Chorus 2: AJ & Brian, Brian & AJ]
"No one is glamorously lonely
Follow your heart!" (follow your heart)

[Chorus: All, AJ & Brian]
This is a song for the unloved (loved)
This is the music for one last cry (one last cry)
This is a prayer that tomorrow will
(That tomorrow will)
Help me leave the past behind (behind)
It's a song for the unloved (unloved)
The unloved...

[Bridge: Nick, Brian & AJ]
Tomorrow the sun will shine
And dry the tears in your eyes
Suddenly love comes alive
(Suddenly love comes alive)

[Interlude: AJ & Nick]
For one last cry
Just one last cry, oh-oh

[Reprise: AJ with Brian]
This is a song for the unloved
This is the music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will
Help me leave the past behind!

[Chorus: All, AJ, (Nick) & Brian]
This is a song for the unloved (loved)
This is the music for one last cry (for one last cry)
This is a prayer that tomorrow will (that tomorrow will)
Help me leave the past behind
(This is, this is) This is a song for the unloved
This is the music for one last cry
(This is the music for one last cry)
This is a prayer that tomorrow will (that tomorrow will)
Help me leave the past behind
It's a song for the unloved (song for the unloved)
The unloved...

[Verse 1: Brian & Howie]
Remember when
We never needed each other
The best of friends
Like sister and brother
We understood
We'd never be alone
Those days are gone
Now I want you so much
The night is long
And I need your touch
Don't know what to say
Never meant to feel this way
Don't wanna be
Alone tonight

[Chorus: Howie & Brian, All]
What can I do
To make you mine?
Falling so hard
So fast this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall
In love with you?

[Interlude: Nick]
Oooh-ooh yeah, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Brian & Howie]
I hear your voice
And I start to tremble
Brings back the child
That I resemble
I cannot pretend
That we can still be friends
Don't wanna be
Alone tonight

[Chorus: Howie & Brian, All]
What can I do
To make you mine?
Falling so hard
So fast this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall
In love with you?

[Bridge: Brian & Howie]
Oh, I wanna say this right
And it has to be tonight
Just need you to know, oh-oh
I don't wanna live this life
I don't wanna say goodbye
With you I wanna spend
The rest of my life

[Chorus: Howie & Brian, All]
What can I do
To make you mine?
Falling so hard
So fast this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall
In love with you?
What can I do
To make you mine?
Falling so hard
So fast this time

[Outro: Howie]
Everything's changed
We never knew
How did I fall in love with you?

[Verse 1: Brian]
You washed away my sad face
And flooded all my empty space
You take away life's heartbreak
And I know with you it's gonna be okay

[Chorus: AJ & All]
You're rushing through me
Like water from heaven
I feel it moving through me
Like sand in the sea
And now I feel so alive
I know that there must be something here
So alive
'Cause you're in the air of my atmosphere
Finally I feel complete
'Cause you are rushed over me yeah!
(Over me, over me, over me)

[Verse 2: Nick with Howie]
There's no more blindness
'Cause when I cry, I'm smiling
You kept me from dying
And I know with you I'll keep on living

[Chorus: AJ & All]
You're rushing through me
Like water from heaven
I feel it moving through me
Like sand in the sea
And now I feel so alive
I know that there must be something here
So alive
'Cause you're in the air of my atmosphere
Finally I feel complete
'Cause you are rushed over me

[Bridge: AJ with Howie, Nick, AJ with Nick]
It's not enough (not enough)
Just holding on (holding on)
Before I met you, I was lost
Now that you're standing here
I don't want you to go
'Cause I know that you're love keeps me alive

[Chorus: AJ, Nick & All]
You're rushing through me
Like water from heaven
I feel it moving through me (oh-oh-oh!)
Like sand in the sea
And now I feel so alive
I know that there must be something here
So alive
'Cause you're in the air of my atmosphere
Finally I feel complete (I feel)
'Cause you are rushed over me
You're rushing through me
Like water from heaven (I feel you moving)
I feel it moving through me
Like sand in the sea
Oh! And now I feel so alive
I know that there must be something here
So alive
'Cause you're in the air of my atmosphere
Finally I feel complete
'Cause you are rushed over me...

[Verse 1: Howie]
Only one life to live in
We're trying our best to make it through
(We're trying our best to make it through)
There's no mistakes just lessons
It's all about what they mean to you, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: AJ, Brian & All]
No matter what you've gone through
You can pick up the pieces move on with your life
Because we had to accept the wrongs
And try to make them right
It may be hard to look at yourself and see the truth
Baby, you've got to realize it takes time to become you

[Chorus: Nick & All]
So just get to moving' on
We're moving on
We're moving on
Living day by day everything must change
But in a way everything stays the same
Moving on, moving on

[Verse 2: Brian]
We'll take what you've been given
Got to take a chance while we can
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
To find our place in our world
We had to understand the plan

[Pre-Chorus: AJ, Brian & All]
Just put the past behind you
Pick up the pieces move on with your life
Because we had to accept the wrongs
And try to make them right
Oh, oh, oh, you can
Look at yourself and see the truth
Realize it takes time to become you

[Chorus: AJ, Nick & All]
Oh, just get to moving' on
We're moving on (keep on moving on)
We're moving on
Living day by day everything must change
But in a way it's gonna stays the same
Always, never gonna change, moving on

[Bridge: AJ & All]
We know we've changed
But we're still the same
Getting closer to what we're supposed to be
As life goes on, you'll have your time
Because everything's meant to be
Oh, oh, oh, moving on
Moving on, moving on
Everything must change
But we're still the same, baby

[Chorus: All & (AJ)]
Moving' on
We're moving on, we're moving on
Living day by day, everything must change
But in a way everything stays the same
(Stays the same)
Moving on, moving on

[Outro: All]
Moving on, moving on
Everything must change
But we're still the same

[Intro: Brian]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-yeah-yeah

[Verse 1: Howie & Brian]
You don't run with the crowd
You go your own way
You don't play after dark
You light up my day
Got your own kind of style
That sets you apart
Baby, that's why you capture my heart
I know sometimes you feel
Like you don't fit in
And this world doesn't know
What you have within
When I look at you, I see something rare
A rose that can grow anywhere
And there's no one I know that can compare

[Chorus: Brian, Howie & All]
What makes you different (alright)
Makes you beautiful (alright)
What's there inside you (alright)
Shines through to me
In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need
(You're all I need, oh girl)
What makes you different
Makes you beautiful to me

[Verse 2: Howie & Brian]
You got something so real
You touch me so deep (touched me so deep)
You see, material things don't matter to me
So come as you are, you got nothing to prove
You won me with all that you do
And I wanna take this chance to say to you

[Chorus: Brian, Howie & All]
What makes you different (alright)
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Makes you beautiful (alright)
What's there inside you (alright)
Shines through to me
In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need
(You're all I need, oh girl)
What makes you different (mmmh)
Makes you beautiful

[Bridge: AJ with Nick, (Kevin) & Howie]
You don't know (you don't know)
How you touched my life (touched my life)
Oh, in so many ways (so many ways)
I just can't describe
You taught me what love is suppose to be
You saw the little things
That make you beautiful to me (so beautiful)
Yeah-yeah-yeah

[Chorus: Brian, Howie & All]
What makes you...
What makes you different (what makes you different)
Makes you beautiful
What's there inside you (there inside you)
Shines through to me
In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need
(You're all I need, oh girl)
What makes you different
Makes you beautiful to me

[Interlude: All & Howie]
Everything you do is beautiful (so beautiful)
Love you give shines right through me
(Shines right through to me)
Everything you do is beautiful
(Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooh)

[Outro: Brian & Howie]
Oh, you're beautiful to me, to me...

[Intro: Nick]
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh!

[Verse 1: Nick, Brian & AJ]
It's 3 AM, I can't sleep
Too late to call, this is not like me
But I'm still lifted from the tattoo
On the small of your back
The angle of your chin
When you were looking back
See God, your beautiful
And I'm still coming down
I'd like a one night stand
That had to stick around
But I'm still floating from the perfume
You left on my sheets
I haven't changed a thing
Since your goodbye to me
Tonight, I stare out the window
Knowing I'll never again be alone

[Chorus: All]
Last night you changed my life
And I'm stuck in the moment
That you kiss me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
You saved my life
Last night you saved my life

[Verse 2: Nick, Brian, (AJ), & Howie]
Your fingernails running down my spine
All day I hear your voice
Like velvet in my mind
It's like I knew you all my life
Even though we just met
All day I hear your voice
Something you don't expect
I had to stop myself from calling all day long
I'm glad you called me first, I wanted to be strong
But you were laughing
'Cause I answered after just one ring
(I tried to play if off, but you knew everything)

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Last night you changed my life
(Changed my life)
And I'm stuck in the moment
That you kiss me the first time (first time)
Last night you saved my life with your love
You saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you saved my life with your love
(Love, love, love, love)

[Interlude: Nick & AJ]
Last night you saved my life
(Saved my life)
Last night you saved my life
(Oh yeah)

[Bridge: AJ with All]
I stare at the sky
Looking for the morning sun
Can't wait to tell you
"You're the only one"

[Chorus: All, Nick & AJ]
Last night you saved my life
And I'm stuck in the moment
That you kiss me the first time (first time)
Last night you saved my life with your love
You saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you changed my life
And I'm stuck in the moment
That you kiss me the first time
Last night (last night)
You saved my life with your love (love, love, love)
You saved my life (you saved my life)
Last night you changed my life (you saved my life, yeah-yeah)
And I'm stuck in the moment
That you kiss me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love

[Intro: Brian]
Oooh, oh-whoa!

[Verse 1: Brian & Nick]
In the heart of the night
When it's dark in the light
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor, oh-oh, oh-oh
I looked down
And my shirt's turning red
I'm spinning around
Felt her lips on my neck
And her voice in my ear
Like I missed you, want you tonight

[Chorus: All]
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding, oh, oh!
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it, oh, oh!
No I can't resist and I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)

[Verse 2: Howie & AJ]
Thought I moved more than on
Thought I could fool her charm
I really wanna go
But I can't leave her alone, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hear the sound of a love so loud
I just can't, I just can't ignore this feeling
Said she misses me
And she wants me, wants me tonight

[Chorus: All]
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding, oh, oh!
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it, oh, oh!
No I can't resist and I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)

[Bridge: Nick]
In the heart of the night, when it's dark
In the lights, I heard the loudest voice
A gunshot on the floor
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding, oh, oh!
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
(Solider down, solider down)
I just can't believe it, oh, oh!
No I can't resist and I can't be hit (no I can't, yeah)
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)

[Verse 1: Brian]
First off, I can't keep a promise
I'm no one to count on at all
Add on that I'm a coward
Too scared to return your call

[Chorus: Nick with All, All]
But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger
(La la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la)
You're still here
You're feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger than me
(La la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la)

[Verse 2: AJ with Howie]
It's known that I'm a liar
Often I'm blacker than white
Add on my uncanny ego
No one's less humble than I

[Chorus: Nick with All, All]
But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger than me
(La la la la la la la, la la la la la la la)
You're still here
You're feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger than me <(la la la la la la la)

[Bridge: Brian with AJ, Howie & All]
All the messed up things I do
Yet I swear I'll make 'em up to you
(Whoo-ooh-oooh-ooh!)
Before you go and have enough
Just let me make it better
I'll try and measure up
I'll try and measure up to you, oh yeah!

[Interlude: Brian]
I'll make 'em up to you
Oh yeah-eh-eh!

[Chorus: Nick with All, Brian, (AJ), All]
But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger than me
(La la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la)
You're still here (you're still here)
You're feet stuck to the ground (to the ground)
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger than me
(La la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la)

[Outro: Nick]
Just bigger than me

[Intro: Howie]
Yeah, yeah, oh-oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick]
You should be right here, laying next to me
But baby, you chose to love the hard way
You should be right here, getting the best of me
But baby, you decided he was your man

[Pre-Chorus: Howie]
And now that you're finding out
He's playing little games, you're calling me again
You say you want me around
But I'm not sure now if I wanna be down, so...

[Chorus: All & Nick]
I think I wanna stay single
Maybe we're better apart
See I don't wanna girl that
Only wanna comeback
'Cause some other man broke her heart
So bye bye love, bye love
So bye bye love (bye love, oh-oh)
Bye love, yeah

[Verse 2: Nick]
Crazy how the tables turn
It wasn't long ago that you turned your back, no
Saying, "there's no way that we can work"
And you were quick to move on to the next thing, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
And now that you're finding out
He's playing little games, you're calling me again
You say you want me around
But I'm not sure now if I wanna be down, so...

[Chorus: All & AJ]
I think I wanna stay single
Maybe we're better apart
See I don't wanna girl that
Only wanna comeback
'Cause some other man broke her heart
So bye bye love, bye love
So bye bye love (bye bye, bye bye love)
Bye love, yeah (bye bye, bye bye love)

[Bridge: AJ & All]
I can't take you back when I know
(When I know)
I'm not the one you really wanted before
Sorry that I let you go
(Let you go)
This time I think it's best to do it alone

[Interlude: Howie, AJ & Nick]
Oooh, ooh-oooh, yeah!
(Say goodbye to you, love)
Oooh-oooh
Let it go, let it go
(Say goodbye to you, love)
Bye bye, bye bye love!

[Chorus: All, Howie, (Nick) & AJ]
I think I wanna stay single (I think I wanna stay)
Maybe we're better apart (maybe we're better apart)
See I don't wanna girl that
Only wanna comeback
'Cause some other man broke her heart
So bye bye love (said bye bye love)
Bye love (said bye bye love)
So bye bye love (bye bye bye bye girl)
Bye love, yeah (oh, bye bye love)

Maybe we're better apart (maybe we're better apart)
See I don't wanna girl that
Only wanna comeback (oh, no!)
'Cause some other man broke her heart
So bye bye love (said bye bye love)
Bye love (bye bye bye bye love)
So bye bye love (said bye bye love, oh!)

[Intro: Nick]
Oh-oh!

[Verse 1: AJ]
Life should be like a game of cards
You make a mistake
Shuffle the deck and start over (start over)
It should be just like driving in your car
Gets lost and your navigation system
Gets you closer (closer)

[Pre-Chorus: AJ]
But there ain't no handbook
You're own your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
'Cause once you do something
Can't be undone
Wish I could take back
Letting you go

[Chorus: All]
If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn’t have said
"I don’t need you around"
Alone in this mess
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (what I know now)
What I know now (what I know now)
What I know now (what I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now

[Verse 2: Nick]
Life should come with remote controls
Then I could rewind it to the time it was better
It should have a restart button so
I could travel right back to the day that I met her

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
But there ain't no handbook
You're own your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
'Cause once you do something (oh!)
Can't be undone (oh!)
Wish I could take back
Letting you go, yeah

[Chorus: All, Nick & Howie]
If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn’t have said
"I don’t need you around"
(I don't need you around)
Alone in this mess
Silence is so loud (silence is so loud)
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (what I know now)
What I know now (what I know now)
What I know now (what I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best (the best)
Baby if I knew then (if I knew then)
What I know now

[Bridge: Howie, Brian, Both]
Oh! Oh-oh, oh-oh yeah (oh-oh)
'Cause there ain't no handbook (handbook)
You're own your own (your own)
Got no instructions (instructions)
When it comes to love (to love)
See once you do something (you do)
Can't be undone (undone)
Wish I could take back
Letting you go, oh-oh-oh!

[Chorus: All, Nick & Howie]
If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn’t have said
"I don’t need you around"
Alone in this mess
Silence is so loud (so loud)
So I would treat you the best (the best)
Baby if I knew then (if I knew then)
What I know now (what I know now)
(What I know now)
What I know now (what I know now)

(I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best (oh!)
Baby if I knew then
What I know now

[Verse 1: Brian & Howie]
Got a million reasons to run and hide
I don't blame you for being scared
For being scared, no
'Bout a novel long all the pain that he's caused you
Baby I'm fully aware, I'm fully aware
If I could change the story's ending to me and you
Don't know the meaning of pretending of what to do

[Chorus: All & Nick]
I could be the one
Give you all the love
Forget what he has done to you
I'm here now
Open up to me
Love will set you free
If ever you believe it
Please believe in me
This is us, this is us
This is us, this is us
This is love, this is love
Let the world know, baby this is us
This is us, this is us
This is us, this is us
This is love, this is love
Let the world know, baby this is us

[Verse 2: AJ & Nick]
I know everything isn't meant to last
Box up all those photographs
You're moving on, yeah
I could flip back over that hourglass
And refill the better half
The better half
And it's a miracle how broken hearts can mend
So won't you dry up all those teardrops and start again, hey yeah!

[Chorus: All & Nick]
I could be the one
Give you all the love
Forget what he has done to you
I'm here now
Open up to me
Love will set you free
If ever you believe it
Please believe in me
This is us, this is us
This is us, this is us
This is love, this is love
Let the world know, baby this is us
This is us, this is us
This is us, this is us
This is love, this is love
Let the world know, baby this is us

[Bridge: Nick]
If I could show you
There's no risk of being left alone
Would you let your past go?
I'll take it slow
'Cause there's no need to rush
When I know

[Chorus: All & Nick]
I could be the one
Give you all the love
(I could be the one)
Forget what he has done to you
(Oh I know, I know)
I'm here now
Open up to me
Love will set you free
If ever you believe it
Please believe in me (believe in me)
This is us, this is us
This is us, this is us
This is love, this is love
Let the world know, baby this is us
This is us, this is us (believe in me)
This is us, this is us
This is love, this is love
Let the world know, baby this is us

[Verse 1]
The right stuff
The right stuff
First time was a great time
Second time was a blast
Third time I fell in love
Now I hope it lasts
I can see it in your walk
Tell 'em when you talk
See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts

[Chorus]
You got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on
You got the right stuff, baby
You're the reason why I sing this song
All that I needed was you
Oh girl, you're so right
Said all that I wanted was you
You made all my dreams come true

[Bridge]

[x2]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The right stuff

[Verse 2]
Your first kiss was a sweet kiss
Second kiss had a twist
Third and your fourth kiss
I don't want to miss
I can see it in your walk
Tell 'em when you talk
See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 3]
The right stuff, girl, yeah baby, yeah
You know you got the right stuff
And girl, yeah, baby
You know, you know you got it, girl

[Outro]
In my life, you're so right
You made all you know what you did

[Intro: Nick]
Backstreet
Listen up

[Verse 1: Nick]
This scene's so hypnotic
Smoke and mirrors, lights and magic
Paper faces in gold
The soldier boys, beauty queens
Everyone's a mystery
It's got me losing control

[Pre-Chorus 1: Howie]
Yearning, I'm yearning
For the one to steal my eyes
Wanna play in this game of disguise

[Chorus: All]
It's a masquerade, a love parade
So won't you stay and dance with me
All through the night and day?
My masquerade, I need you baby
To stay with me tonight...
Masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade

[Verse 2: AJ & Nick]
Just like a perfect dream
I don't ever wanna leave
A thousand freaks in a show (oh yeah)
One's a tiger, one's a lynx
One's a king that's suffering
Moving high, moving low, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick]
Burning, I'm burning
Can't you see it in my eyes?
Wanna play in this game of disguise

[Chorus: All]
It's a masquerade, a love parade
So won't you stay and dance with me
All through the night and day?
My masquerade, I need you baby
To stay with me tonight...
Masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade

[Bridge: Nick & Brian]
I gotta know (I gotta know, yeah)
The girl behind the mask
Let me in, where you been? Don't pretend
Dreamed that I had her alone
Show your face to me, we could be everything

[Chorus: All, AJ & Nick]
It's a masquerade  a love parade (masquerade, oh-oh)
So won't you stay and dance with me
All through the night and day?
My masquerade, I need you, baby
To stay....
It's a masquerade  a love parade (masquerade, yeah-yeah)
So won't you stay and dance with me
All through the night and day?
My masquerade, I need you, baby
To stay with me tonight...
Masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade

[Intro: Nick]
Oh-oh, oh-oh yeah
Oh-no, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick & All]
Shorty ain't got cable (cable)
She ain't even got a radio ('dio)
Way more than able (able)
What kind of girl should I take her for?
The perfect kind, just what I like (like)
Exactly what I had in my mind
A dream, she's a dream yeah
Shorty don't know I'm on the red carpet
Almost every night ('vry night)
And when I'm outta town to go and do work
I'm first class every flight ('vry flight)
If she takes the time to open her eyes (eyes)
She can realize that she's a dream
'Cause she knows me

[Chorus: Nick with All]
'Cause shorty don't know who I am
She don't know I'm a celebrity
'Cause when I let her meet my fam
Ain't nobody mention my pedigree
'Cause every time I take her out
We always in the VIP
'Cause shorty don't know who I am
But she knows me ('cause she's a dream)
That's why I make her say, "oooh"
Make her say, "aah"
Make her say, "oooh"
Make her say, "aah" ('cause she's a dream)

[Interlude: Nick]
Shorty don't know who I am

[Verse 2: Brian & All]
And I'm cool with that if she says so (says so)
I ain't even gotta lie to her (to her)
And when I'm out making pesos (pesos)
Ain't nobody treat her like I do her
'Cause I'm the one that she thinks about
The only one on her mind
She's a dream 'cause she's knows me
Shorty don't know that I'm on the stage
Like 3 or 4 times a week (a week)
She don't even know I've been around the world
And all the different girls I meet (I meet)
But there's just one face that I see (see)
She's a dream
'Cause she knows me (she knows me)

[Chorus: Nick, Brian with All]
'Cause shorty don't know who I am (oh-oh!)
She don't know I'm a celebrity
'Cause when I let her meet my fam
Ain't nobody mention my pedigree (my pedigree)
'Cause every time I take her out
We always in the VIP
'Cause shorty don't know who I am (who I am)
But she knows me ('cause she's a dream)
Oh, that's why I make her say, "oooh"
Make her say, "aah"
Make her say, "oooh"
Make her say, "aah" ('cause she's a dream)

[Bridge: Howie, All & AJ]
See shorty don't know who I am
That's not good for us (us)
'Cause I know it's not good to fuss (fuss)
And I know she loves me for me
And I love her for her
But it wouldn't work
If she ever gave a damn 'bout who I am
But she knows me

[Chorus: Nick with All, AJ]
'Cause shorty don't know who I am
She don't know I'm a celebrity (celebrity, oh-oh!)
'Cause when I let her meet my fam
Ain't nobody mention my pedigree
'Cause every time I take her out (her out)
We always in the VIP (VIP, oh-oh!)
'Cause shorty don't know who I am
But she knows me (she knows me, oh-oh!)
('Cause she's a dream)
"Oooh"
Make her say, "aah"
Make her say, "oooh" (ooh-ooh)
Make her say, "aah" ('cause she's a dream)

[Verse 1: Nick & AJ]
Excuse me, can I have your attention?
There's something I would like to say
The way that your body moves is crazy
Drives me insane
You lick your lips and you got me wishing
Could I be your fantasy?
The thought of you and me together
Oh, it's like a dream to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
You got me running for cover
Looking over my shoulder
Jumping in an ice cold bath
Thinking of something entirely different
Other than your fine (whoa)
You got me looking for the exit
'Cause there's no way to fake this
You've got me tripping and falling all over myself

[Chorus: Nick & All]
'Cause you're so
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
I said baby you're so
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

[Verse 2: Howie]
Sweeter than candy in the kitchen
You're the dessert I'd like to taste
I know I don't know that much about you
But I think I'm in love with you, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Howie]
You got me running for cover
Looking over my shoulder
Jumping in an ice cold bath
Thinking of something entirely different
Other than your fine (whoa)
You got me looking for the exit
'cause there's no way to fake this
You've got me tripping and falling all over myself

[Chorus: Howie & All]
'Cause baby you're so
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Baby you're so
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You're the finest thing

[Bridge: Brian & Kevin]
I know it's gonna hurt me
The heat from your love
But I'd rather burn from you
Than die all alone at home
My undivided attention
Is all on you (all on you)
My best ain't good enough
It's got me acting like a fool

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
You got me running for cover
Looking over my shoulder
Jumping in an ice cold bath
Thinking of something entirely different
Other than your fine (whoa)
You got me looking for the exit
'cause there's no way to fake this
You've got me tripping and falling all over myself

[Chorus: AJ, Nick & All]
Oh, 'cause baby you're so
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Girl, you're looking fine, looking fine, looking fine
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Sing it, AJ, oh, oh
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Baby you look so fine
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Touch you, baby
Oh, you got it going on, you got it going on

[Outro: All, AJ & Nick]
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Baby you're so hot, baby you're so hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Baby, you're so...
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Driving me so crazy, driving me so crazy
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
I can't take no more, ow
(Baby you're so)

[Verse 1]
We've been together for a long time, baby
Do you have to leave?
Please don't go girl
I just can't live without you
Please don't go girl
So listen to me (Don't go, girl)
Please don't go girl
You would ruin my whole world

[Chorus]
Tell me you'll stay
Never ever go away
I love you (I love you)
I guess I always will
Girl, you're my best friend
Girl, you're my love within
I just want you to know
That I will always love you
Ooh, baby

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
(Please don't go girl)
I'm gonna always love you girl
I'm gonna love you girl until the end of time
Tell me girl
You're gonna always be mine
Please don't go girl
You would ruin my whole world
Tell me you'll stay
Never ever go away
I love you (I love you)
I guess I always will
Girl, you're my best friend
Girl, you're my love within
I just want you to know
That I will always love you
Ooh, baby

[Outro]
(Please don't go girl)
(Please don't go girl)
Please don't go girl
(Please don't go girl)
Please don't go, baby

Please don't go, baby, no

[Intro: Nick]
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh

[Verse 1: AJ]
So empty, can't feel no more
As I'm left with my tears on the floor
I wait for my heart to mend
But you keep tearing a hole, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
Oh! Inside, I am so lost
In the middle of my heart
It's a battlefield of love
I've been fighting far too long

[Chorus: Brian, Nick & All]
And now I'm shattered
From you chipping my heart
Kept taking it till it broke
Oh how it hurts
Felt it slip from your hands
Hit the ground and now it's shattered
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe you hurt me, ah-ah-ah-ah)
So shattered
(Can't believe you left me, I'm so shattered)
Shattered, cut from with-inside

[Verse 2: Nick]
Oh! What am I still here for?
Could it be that I'm just waiting?
Hoping you'd rescue me
And put the pieces together again

[Pre-Chorus: Howie]
Inside, I am so lost
In the middle of my heart
It's a battlefield of love
I've been fighting far too long

[Chorus: Brian, Nick with Howie, (AJ) & All]
And now I'm shattered (oh!)
From you chipping my heart
Kept taking it till it broke
Oh how it hurts
Felt it slip from your hands (your hands)
Hit the ground and now it's shattered
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe you hurt me, ah-ah-ah-ah)
So shattered
(Can't believe you left me, I'm so shattered)
Shattered, cut from with-inside

[Bridge: Nick & Howie]
Tell me what you're really here for
If you never really loved me
I gave my all but it still wasn't enough
'Cause all you had to say was that you ain't
Looking for commitment
Instead of telling me what I wanted to hear, oh-oh!
You took my emotions
And scattered them on the ground
So hard to just pick up
And move on with life again

[Chorus: Brian, Nick, (AJ) & All]
And now I'm shattered (oh-oh-oh!)
From you chipping my heart
Kept taking it till it broke
Oh how it hurts
Felt it slip from your hands
Hit the ground and now it's shattered
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe you hurt me, ah-ah-ah-ah)
So shattered
(Can't believe you left me, I'm so shattered)
Shattered, cut from with-inside

[Outro: AJ & Brian]
So shattered (oh yes)
I can't believe you left me so shattered

I know we haven't been getting along, long at all
I don't think that it's time
You and I can give in just call, call it off
I don't wanna say goodbye
Cause just when I think we're through

[Pre-Chorus]
The memories come flooding back
It's like instantly I love you like that
I was on fire for you
We could get it back again
If you don't say it's the end, the end

[Chorus]
So don't turn out the lights now, lights now, lights now

[Verse 2]
I'mma give you a minute to clear, clear your head

Baby, you'll change your mind
Cause just when I think we're through

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

Leave a light, leave a light on
Leave a light, leave a light on
(Leave a light on)
Leave a light, leave a light on
Leave a light, leave a light on
Leave a light, leave a light on

[Verse 1: Nick]
It happened in a blink, blink, blink of a night
I guess it was the wrong, wrong side of goodbye
You caught me on the blind, blind, the blind side
You didn't even stop once to think twice

[Pre-Chorus: Nick & All]
Drove through the pouring rain
Weaved in and out of pain
Wanted to turn around (turn around)
Wish I'd have done it now

[Chorus: AJ with All, Brian]
I still remember how we left it that night
Said, "it was better we if both just move along"
But if you're telling me it's not the last time
I'll keep a light, I'll leave a light, light on
(Leave a light on)
I'll leave a light on (leave a light on)
A light on (leave a light on)
I'll leave a light on (leave a light on)

[Verse 2: Nick with Howie]
We didn't lose the beat, beat, beat in our hearts
After falling in so deep, so hard
So if you're running 'round, 'round, 'round in the dark
I found a way to reignite the spark

[Pre-Chorus: Nick with Howie, All]
Drove through the pouring rain
Weaved in and out of pain
Wanted to turn around (turn around)
Wish I'd have done it now

[Chorus: AJ with All, Brian]
I still remember how we left it that night
Said, "it was better we if both just move along"
But if you're telling me it's not the last time
I'll keep a light, I'll leave a light, light on
(Leave a light on)
I'll leave a light on (leave a light on)
A light on (leave a light on)
I'll leave a light on (leave a light on)

[Bridge: Kevin & Brian with Howie]
So if you ever feel the need
Jump in your car and just drive back to me
Wherever you are
I will always leave a light on...
So if you ever feel the need
Jump in your car and just drive back to me
Wherever you are
I will always leave a light on... (a light on)

[Verse 1: Nick]
Out in the darkest place
Where there's a thousand shades of blue
Everyone looks the same
And then your light came into view

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
You stop my heart and got me saying
"Where did you come from?"
It's like you fell above of the sky to save me
An angel from the sun

[Chorus: All]
I could live forever
In your arms, in your arms
Baby, we can fly together
To the stars, back to Mars
Wherever you wanna go
My future's with you for tonight
I could live forever
In your arms, in your arms

[Verse 2: AJ]
And when I touch your face
It's shows me worlds I never known
Frozen in time and space
Don't want to let this moment go

[Pre-Chorus: Howie]
You stop my heart and got me saying
"Where did you come from?"
It's like you fell above of the sky to save me
An angel from the sun

[Chorus: All]
I could live forever
In your arms, in your arms
Baby, we can fly together
To the stars, back to Mars
Wherever you wanna go
My future's with you for tonight
I could live forever
In your arms, in your arms

[Bridge: Howie with Nick]
Stay with me, come stay with me
Forever and ever
Taking me, you're taking me
To heaven, to heaven

[Reprise: Kevin]
I could live forever
In your arms, in your arms
Baby, we could fly together
To the stars, back to Mars

[Chorus: All]
I could live forever
In your arms, in your arms
Baby, we can fly together
To the stars, back to Mars
Wherever you wanna go
My future's with you for tonight
I could live forever
In your arms, in your arms

It's alive, it's moving
It's alive, oh it's alive
It's alive, it's alive
It's alive in the name of god
Now I know what it feels like to be god

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm not a newcomer, I'm a new wonder elite

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
K-Dizzle
I rap with a Pyrex in the projects
I'm crack in a pot, I'm a prospect
I'm a pirate on a dock full of dope
I can dissect any rapper
You could vote for the Lochness
You cannot test no key in the Tesla

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch I ride like a freight train parked outside
And my young niggas came with the extras

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
It's alive

[Verse 1]
Little Miss Lover
Where have you been in this world for so long?
Well, I love a lover
That feels like you, would you like to tag along?
Well, I really don't need any help little girl
But I think you could help me out anyway
Aw, sucker today

[Verse 2]
Would you believe baby
I've been looking for a soul that feels like you
For some time
Excuse me while I see
If the gypsy in me is right
If you don't mind
Well, he signals me ok
So I think it's safe to say
I'm going to make a play
Aw, yeah

[Bridge]
You see me walk towards you baby
Hey, aw yeah
Aw, give it to her!
Oh, get into it

[Outro]
Hey, hey, little miss lover
Well now, there's so much
You and me can discover
And I think we should start
(Hey, little miss lover)
See we should start right now, baby, hey, hey
(Hey, little miss lover)
Little miss, little miss, little miss lover
(Hey, little miss lover)
Oh baby, oh, look at me and say
(Hey, little miss lover)
So good, little miss lover
(Hey, little miss lover)
Hey baby
(Hey, little miss lover)
Go, it is very man good
(Hey, little miss lover)
Hey, lover

[Verse 1: AJ]
Your words burn, they're melting
What we have and I'm breaking down
No reason, no warning
No love lost and you might as well

[Pre-Chorus: AJ & Howie]
Take our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more
I don't wanna feel you no more
Take our memories, throw them all aside
I hope you finally get what you want
Now you know

[Chorus: Brian & All]
I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love without ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone
I can't feel without ya
You know I can't deal without ya
And now I got a life without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

[Verse 2: Nick]
This constant echoing in my head
I'm spinning 'round
You seem so unaffected (unaffected)
While I go on in this hell

[Pre-Chorus: Nick & Howie]
Take our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more
I don't wanna feel you no more
Take our memories, throw them all aside
I hope you finally get what you want
Now you know, yeah

[Chorus: Brian & All]
I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love without ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone
I can't feel without ya
You know I can't deal without ya
And now I got a life without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

[Interlude: Brian]
Oh-oh-ooh-ooh
We can be undone

[Bridge: All & Nick]
You're talking now
And I'm hearing everything that you say
And "I'm holding on" is a real phrase
And it's dragging me along to my grave
(No, it's dragging me to my grave)
You're talking now
And I'm hearing everything that you say
(Say oh-no!)
And "I'm holding on" is a real phrase
And it's dragging me along to my grave

[Chorus: Brian & All]
I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love without ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone
I can't feel without ya
You know I can't deal without ya
And now I got a life without ya
Now it's killing me
That we can be undone

[Countermelody: All & Brian]
You're talking now
And I'm hearing everything that you say
(Love without ya)
And "I'm holding on" is a real phrase
(I used to think I'd die without ya)
And it's dragging me along to my grave
(Now it's killing me)
You're talking now
(I can't feel without ya)
And I'm hearing everything that you say
(You know I can't deal without ya)
And "I'm holding on" is a real phrase
(And now I got a life without ya)
And it's dragging me along to my grave
(Now it's killing me)

[Outro: All]
We can be undone

[Verse 1: Nick]
I, I've waiting all my life
To step out from the light
And see the shadows fading
You, you've always stood so tall
I've never thought you'd fall (fall)
But now it's you that's fading

[Pre-Chorus: Howie with Brian]
I know that inside you're delicate
Though you say that
You don't need someone to take care of you, but...

[Chorus: AJ & All]
I'll
Take care of
You
Take care of
I'll
Take care of you
You
Take care of you, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Kevin & AJ]
So you run, there's no need to run
Stand up face to face
The stakes are high but we'll reach higher
I won't tell a soul if you cry
I can hold you while you cry, you know

[Pre-Chorus: Howie with Brian]
I know that inside you're delicate
Though you say that
You don't need someone to take care of you, but...

[Chorus: AJ & All]
I'll
Take care of
You
Take care of you
I'll
Take care of you
You
Take care of you

[Interlude: AJ]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Take care of you

[Reprise: Howie]
I know that inside you're delicate
And I...

[Chorus: AJ, Nick & All]
I'll
Take care of you
You
(Baby, baby, baby)
I'll (I'll take care of, take, I'll take care of)
Take care of you (baby)
You (I'll take care of, I'll take care of, I'll take care of)
Take care of you

[Intro: All]
Away! Internationally
Away, eh! Away

[Chorus: All]
I just wanna take you everywhere that I go
Girl, I want you on a plane in a seat
Right next to mine, yeah
Get with you right after my shows
Baby, I could give you wings
Come on girl, let's fly away internationally

[Verse 1: Nick]
Now I don't usually meet
Under these circumstances, but
You're like the perfect girl
With the perfect skin, so
And just 'cause they don't know about you
Don't mean I'mma go without you, girl
You can call me your man

[Pre-Chorus 1: Brian, Howie & All]
Because I know
This ain't the kind of love
That could just take one night
And then it's over
Girl, I know
I ain't never fell in love so quickly
Baby, please come with me
All you need is my love in a bag
'Cause I just wanna...

[Chorus: All & Howie]
I just wanna take you everywhere that I go

Girl, I want you on a plane in a seat
Right next to mine, yeah (right next to mine)
Get with you right after my shows

Baby, I could give you wings
Come on girl, let's fly away (let's fly away) internationally

[Verse 2: AJ]
Girl, I can think of only one
And no one else compares to you, yeah
We're like the perfect team
No matter where I go, you gotta roll
And that they don't know about you
I'm not okay without you, girl
And I don't need to read your mind

[Pre-Chorus 2: AJ & All]
'Cause I know
That you wanna see the world
And I can take you
(All I need is one night)
And we'll be closer
And I know
I ain't never fell in love so quickly
Baby, please come with me
All you need is my love in a bag
'Cause I just wanna...

[Chorus: All, AJ & Howie]
I just wanna take you everywhere that I go (oh-oh)
Girl, I want you on a plane in a seat

Baby, I could give you wings
Come on girl, let's fly away (fly away) internationally

[Bridge: Nick, Howie & All]
Girl, we're in London
Eating Japanese food with the chopsticks, girl
Buy yourself a little something
Hundred grand in your pocket in Dubai shopping, yeah
African safari
We'll go riding by the lions, yeah
Come back in the Maserati (internationally)

[Chorus: All, Howie & Brian]
I just wanna take you everywhere that I go
(I just wanna take you there)
Girl, I want you on a plane in a seat
Right next to mine, yeah (right next to mine)
Get with you right after my shows
(Right after my show)
Baby, I could give you wings
Come on girl, let's fly away internationally (yeah)

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I'm not that kind of guy who can take a broken heart
So don't ever leave
I don't want to see us part
The very thought of losing you means
That everything
Would go down under

[Chorus]
I'll be loving you forever
Just as long as you want me to be
I'll be loving you forever
All this love's for you and me, yeah
(I'll be loving you)
I'll be
(I'll be loving you)
Loving you
(The things you do)
Yeah, it's forever
(I'll be loving you)
I'll be
(I'll be loving you)
Loving you, yeah

[Verse 2]
I count the blessings that keep our love new
There's one for me
And a million for you
There's just so much that I want to say
But when I look at you
All my thoughts get in the way

[Chorus ]

[Verse 3]
We've learned to fall to every turn by now
This love will last forever
I can see it all now

[Chorus]
(I'll be loving you)
I'll be
(I'll be loving you)
Loving you
(The things you do)
Yeah, it's forever
(I'll be loving you)
I'll be
(I'll be loving you)
Loving only you, girl
Oh girl
I'll be loving only you
(I'll be loving you)
(I'll be loving you)
Be loving you girl

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Listen up everybody if you want to take a chance

[Rap:] Just get on the floor and do the New Kids' dance
Don't worry about nothing because it won't take long

[Rap:] We're going to put you in a trance with a funky song, because you got to be

[Chorus]
Hanging tough, hanging tough, hanging tough

[Rap:] We're rough

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Everybody's always talking about who's on top

[Rap:] Don't cross our path because you're going to get stomped
We aren’t going to give anybody any slack

[Rap:] And if you try to keep us down we're going to come right back
And you know we're

[Chorus]
Hanging tough, hanging tough, hanging tough

[Rap:] Are you tough enough?
Hanging tough, hanging tough, hanging tough

[Rap:] We're rough

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[x2]
Get loose everybody because we're going to do our thing

[Rap:] Because you know it isn’t over until the fat lady sings

[Chorus]
Hanging tough, hanging tough, hanging tough

[Rap:] Are you tough enough?
Hanging tough, hanging tough, hanging tough

[Outro]

[Rap:] We're rough
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, just hanging tough, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hanging tough

[repeat & fade]

[Verse 1: Nick & AJ]
There you go, caught you crashing my dreams again
Just when I'm trying to get over you
I tell my heart but I can't seem to comprehend
A day without you
Now you've carved out a life, but I wear the scars
Reminding me by the hour
That it's time to accept it's way the things are
I wish I could but...

[Chorus: All]
I can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why it can't be any other way
Any other way

[Verse 2: Brian]
Since you drained all the color out of the sky
How am I supposed to feel?
It's like I'm living in somebody else's life
Tell me, it's not real

[Chorus: All]
I can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why it can't be any other way
I can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why it can't be any other way

[Bridge: Howie]
Like we never had a falling out
Like the tears had never hit the ground
Like you're still here, you're still here

[Interlude: Brian]
Since you drained all the color out of the sky

[Chorus: All]
I can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why it can't be any other way
I can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why it can't be any other way

[Verse 1: Brian]
Walking along the sky
Chasing a glimpse of you
Painting a world with stars I found
Inside your eyes
Up here above the haze
Everything looks so clear
Wondering what it would be like
If you were here

[Pre-Chorus: Nick & Howie]
And time takes time (takes time)
But I can't wait to tell you how I feel

[Chorus: All & Nick]
Oh, oh-oh!
You're the calm when my world is crashing
Oh, oh-oh!
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why? (why?), tell me why? (why?)
You're everything but mine
Oh, oh-oh!
I hold you close when it all goes crazy
Oh, oh-oh!
And through it all, you'll be my lady
Why? (why?), tell me why? (why?)
You're everything, everything but mine

[Verse 2: AJ]
You don't have to be afraid
Of somebody else's touch
Just give me a chance to prove
Just how you should be loved

[Pre-Chorus: Nick & Howie]
And time takes time (takes time)
It's not too late to tell you how I feel

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Oh, oh-oh!
You're the calm when my world is crashing
Oh, oh-oh!
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why? (why?), tell me why? (why?)
You're everything but mine
(Everything but mine, oh-oh!)
Oh, oh-oh!
I hold you close when it all goes crazy
Oh, oh-oh!
And through it all, you'll be my lady
Why? (why?), tell me why? (why?)
You're everything, everything but mine

[Interlude: All & AJ]
Oooh-ooh-oooh-ooh
(Everything but mine, oh!)
Oooh-ooh-oooh-ooh
(Mine, oh-no)
Oooh-ooh-oooh-ooh
Oooh, oooh (oh-oh, baby)

[Bridge: AJ & Howie]
Someday you'll come around
I'm gonna leave a light on
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
(I won't let you down)

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Oh, oh-oh!
You're the calm when my world is crashing
Oh, oh-oh!
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why? (why?), tell me why? (why?)
You're everything but mine
(Everything but mine, oh-oh!)
Oh, oh-oh!
I hold you close when it all goes crazy (crazy)
Oh, oh-oh!
And through it all, you'll be my lady
Why? (why?), tell me why? (why?)
You're everything (everything)
Everything but mine (everything)

[Outro: AJ]
You're everything but mine
You're everything but mine, yeah, oh!
You're the sun, you're the star
You're the moon, you're the rain
Love your lips, love your eyes
Driving me insane, oh baby, baby
Oh, you're everything but mine
You're everything but mine

[Intro: AJ]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!

[Verse 1: AJ with Howie, (Brian) & All]
She wakes up with the sun (the sun)
She throws on her clothes (her clothes)
Hoping her car will start
The second time around (she)
The day has begun (begun)
The line's out the door (the door)
Serving up fraps
Until she can't take anymore
I see it in her broken smile, oh I...

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Wish I could tell her
"You're one in a million
You're going the distance, babe
You're gonna work it out someday"
I wish I could tell her
"You're one in a million
But you never even look my way", yeah!

[Interlude 1: Howie]
No, she never looks my way
She never, ever, ever looks my way

[Verse 2: Nick with Howie, (Brian) & All]
(She), she ties up her hair (her hair)
Her makeup is smeared (is smeared)
Wiping the tears that she wants no one to see
(She), she screams on the pain
I hear every word
Why don't you know how beautiful you are?
Just see it in my broken smile?
Oh I...

[Chorus: All]
Wish I could tell her
"You're one in a million
You're going the distance, babe
You're gonna work it out someday"
I wish I could tell her
"You're one in a million
But you never even look my way"

[Bridge: Brian with All]
If I could be the light
To guide you through the darkness, baby
If I could be the one
To change the ending to your story
I'd be one in a million, yeah
I'd be one in a million

[Interlude 2: Howie with All]
Someday I would tell her
"You're gonna work it out someday!"

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Wish I could tell her
"You're one in a million
You're going the distance, babe
(Going the distance, babe)
You're gonna work it out someday"
I wish I could tell her (wish I could tell her)
"You're one in a million
(She never even looks my way, yeah!)
But you never even look my way"
(Hey-yeah-hey!)
You're going the distance, babe
(You're going the distance)
You're gonna work it out someday"
I wish I could tell her (hey!)
"You're one in a million
But you never even look my way", yeah!

[Verse]
Tonight I saw an eclipse of your smile
Within my own reflection on you look
So beautiful then
A tear ran down my face
And all my memories erase
Oh, why you have to leave my side
Oh why do all the rivers flow into the ocean
And why does all the love in the world
Comes strait from the heart
And why does all the pain I feel
Come from deep inside
Oh all those questions
I could have answered
If you were were by my side
Something made me look at you
Something made me do what I had to do, girl
Something made me talk to you
Something made me do what I should do
I want you by my side

[X3]
Now everyday the pain I feel
Slowly fades away
And all the memories of you and me
Are always here to stay
What I'm asking girl is one more chance
To let me in your life
Oh could if you give me one more chance
Than I could be right by your side

[Intro: Brian]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Brian & Howie]
Some say that love isn't fair
But they don't know you and me
And when they tell me that
Love doesn't last that long
That's when I look at you

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
And it's all right
Just let me lead you

[Chorus: All & Brian]
It's okay if you close your eyes
I'll be standing by your side
I'm gonna love you the best that I can
You're my heart and you're my best friend
And promise 'til the end (yeah)
I'm gonna love you the best that I can
(That I can)

[Verse 2: Nick, Brian & AJ]
Time cannot tear us apart (no-no-no)
We're stronger than yesterday (yeah)
And though we've traveled so far
You're still close to me
Love changes everything

[Pre-Chorus: Brian & Nick]
And I know that it's all right
Just let me lead you (let me lead you)

[Chorus: All, Brian & AJ]
It's okay if you close your eyes (it's okay)
I'll be standing by your side
I'm gonna love you the best that I can
You're my heart and you're my best friend
And promise 'til the end (yeah)
I'm gonna love you (gonna love you)
The best that I can

[Bridge: Howie, Nick, (Brian) & AJ]
Through the peaks and the valleys
You're not alone
And when the world's upside down
You know I'm there
(And anytime I feel afraid)
That's when I look at you, ooh-ooh
(Through the best that I can)

[Interlude: All, Brian, (Nick) & AJ]
I will love you (I will love you)
The very best that I can (the best that I can)
(With every breath I take)
From this moment 'til the very end
I'm gonna love you (gonna love you)
The best that I can (the best that I can)

[Chorus: All & Brian]
It's okay if you close your eyes
I'll be standing by your side
I'm gonna love you the best that I can
You're my heart and you're my best friend
And promise 'til the end (yeah)
I'm gonna love you the best that I can

[Outro: Brian & Nick]
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you the best that I can

[Intro: Nick]
Go, stop and go
Stop and go, stop and go
Stop and go, stop and...

[Verse 1: Nick & Brian]
Go, stop and go
I just hear static
I used to read you loud and clear
Not like this, it's so erratic
And I'm not rational
When I see you around
Your inconsistency
And you know it's dragging me down
Your so conflicted baby

[Chorus: All & Nick]
You're always walking away
One step and everything's over
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
I'm already dead (I already said)
I already said I'm sorry

[Verse 2: Nick, Brian & All]
I've made mistakes
I've been an addict, a blind fanatic
Don't you know
You're not immune to the panic
When somebody turns on you
When the snow hits your skin (ooh)
The cold don't last forever
But you'll live it again (ooh-ooh)
If you don't let seasons change

[Chorus: All, Brian & Nick]
You're always walking away
(You're always walking away)
One step and everything's over
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
I'm already dead (I already said)
I already said I'm sorry

[Bridge: AJ]
How many times do I have to say it
Before you believe me?

[Break: Howie & All]
Oh oh oh (yeah, yeah)
Oh oh oh (PANIC)

[Chorus: All, Brian & Nick]
You're always walking away
(You're always walking away)
One step and everything's over
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
(Take me in or just take me out)
I'm already dead, I already said

[Outro: Nick & All]
I'm already dead (already dead)
I already said (I already said) I'm sorry

[Verse]
There's a spark of magic in your eyes
And Candyland appears each time you smile
Never thought that fairytales came true
But they come true, when I'm near you
Your a genie in disguise
Full of wonder and surprise
And, Betcha by golly Wow!
Your the one that I've been waiting for forever
Forever will my love for you keep growing strong
Keep growing strong
Ladies, sometimes a man can't find the words
To express all he feels inside
But ever just so often
The words of another, who's truly in love
Seem to work our just fine

[Bridge]
To say I love you
To say
I love you

[Outro]
Keep growing strong

[x2]

[Verse 1: Brian & Nick]
I can't cry no more girl, my eyes are empty
Can't think of nothing but you
You are the reason I wake up in the morning
Lately, I'm sleeping till 2
Sometimes I swear that you're lying here beside me
I reach for you girl and you're not there
Still got the smell of your body on the pillow
Still finding strings of your hair
Tell me, can we try, baby?

[Chorus: Howie with All]
Can we get back to love again?
Seems like I'm losing my best friend
Can you rescue me from the rain
And be my sunshine again?
Can I make it up to you?
I promise that I'll do anything for us
'Cause baby I love you
I mean it, I need you
Let's go back to love again

[Verse 2: Brian & Nick]
I don't wanna go on without you, baby
Don't wanna hurt anymore
Ain't nothing right and my world is going crazy
Ain't nothing left to live for
And I try but I can't stop loving you
Wishing you were here
Baby, you are my life, I just want my baby girl, so...

[Chorus: All]
Can we get back to love again?
Seems like I'm losing my best friend
Can you rescue me from the rain
And be my sunshine again?
Can I make it up to you
I promise that I'll do anything for us
'Cause baby I love you
I mean it, I need you
Let's get back to love again

[Bridge: AJ & Nick]
Give me one more night to change your mind
And girl, I swear
Tonight will be the night I'm gonna take you there
I have to risk my last chance, girl
I don't care if I die trying to get you back, baby
I love you, you're my lady
I'll be on the daily, weekly, oh, oh!

[Chorus: All, (Nick) & AJ]
Can we get back to love again? (get back to love)
Seems like I'm losing my best friend (my best friend)
Can you rescue me from the rain (ooh, baby)
And be my sunshine again? (be my sunshine)
Can I make it up to you
I promise that I'll do anything for us (anything, anything)
'Cause baby I love you (you know I love you, baby)
I mean it, I need you (I love you)
Let's get back to love again
Can we get back to love again?
Seems like I'm losing my best friend
Can you rescue me from the rain
And be my sunshine again?
Can I make it up to you
I promise that I'll do anything for us
'Cause baby I love you
I mean it, I need you
Let's get back to love again

[Verse 1: AJ with Brian]
I can see in your eyes
Broken windows, falling skies
Baby baby, what you hiding from?
The light that followed you around
Lately, nowhere to be found
Don't you know that I'm your place to run?

[Chorus: Brian with All, Howie]
You've been holding on so long
Tryna' make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
And there ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know
That you can let go

[Verse 2: AJ with Brian, (Brian) & Howie]
Sifting through the shattered dreams
Living in the in-between
Baby baby, it's gonna be alright (alright)
(You can let go)
And when you're lost, let down
Disappointed and jerked around in this cold
I will always be by your side
Oh-oh-oh-oh!

[Chorus: Nick with All, Howie]
You've been holding on so long
Tryna' make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
There ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know
That you can let go

[Bridge: Howie with All, Brian]
Don't be afraid when you're falling apart
Don't hesitate, I'll be right where you are
Open your eyes, there's a crack in the dark
Never let me see you cry
You locked it somewhere deep inside
Baby baby, let me hold you tight
Make it alright

[Interlude: All & Brian]
Baby baby, it's gonna be alright
'Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you
Yeah-yeah (I won't turn against you)
Baby baby, it's gonna be alright
'Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you
Yeah-yeah (I won't turn against you)
You can let go

[Chorus: Nick with All, AJ]
You've been holding on so long
Tryna' make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show (said you can let go)
There ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know

[Intro: Howie]
Mmm-hmmm, yeah

[Verse 1: Howie]
How come you never know what you got
Until it’s gone?
Too bad ‘cause I never felt so good with anyone
How fooled was I
Into thinking I was gonna be alright
Okay, fine

[Pre-Chorus 1: Howie]
So everyday I try
A little harder to forget her
Lie here convince myself
Tomorrow will be better

[Chorus: All & AJ]
The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone? (yeah)
The trouble is there's a part of me
That still can't let go of the memories
And now I know what it is
Love is what the trouble is
(Love is what the trouble is)

[Verse 2: AJ]
How come she said, "you never wear your heart"
Where I can see
Too bad, 'cause now I'm the one who's sorry
How stupid was I
Into thinking I was gonna be alright
Okay, fine

[Pre-Chorus 2: AJ]
So everyday I find
A little something to remind me
No matter how I try
I can't put the past behind me

[Chorus: All & AJ]
The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me
Now she's gone? (she's gone, oh)
The trouble is there's a part of me
That still can't let go of the memories
And now I know what it is

[Bridge: AJ]
Love has left me lonely
I'm alright, I'm okay
I'll be fine, give it time

[Chorus: All, Nick, (Howie) & AJ]
But the only
Trouble is I can't get her out of my mind
When I close my eyes at night (oh-no, no-no)
Who's gonna save me (oh-oh-oh)
Now she's gone? (oh, she's gone)
The trouble is there's a part of me
That still can't let go of the memories (I just can't)
And now I know what it is (yes I do)
(Now I know) And now I know what it is
'Cause love is what the trouble is

[Outro: AJ & Brian]
The trouble, love
Love is what the trouble is
Hey-hey

[Verse 1]
This goes out to all the children
All over the world
This one's for the children
Children of the world
Come a little closer now
So you can see the children's eyes
There's no use in trying
When you're dealing with the dying
So let me have a talk with you
And hope that you believe it too
There's so many ways to help
Laughter you can bring

[Chorus]
Come closer now
See the children's eyes
See the children's eyes
You just have to give them a helping hand

[Verse 2]
With a little bit of love
And a little bit of time
You can help the children of the world
Just a little bit of love
And a little bit of hope
There're a lot of things to do
To help the children of the world
R'n'G is about to take control
The only thing you got to do is set yourself free
We got to help each other that's how it has to be
2-4 Fam. Here to lend a helping hand
Come a little closer now
See it in their eyes
We've got to keep on trying
To stop the children crying

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We just have to understand
They all need a helping hand
With a little bit of love
A little bit of love
Lots of things to do
Hope you know it, too
We just want to give them a little hope

[Chorus (until fade)]

[Outro]
Help the children of the world

[Intro: Brian]
Oooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Brian, Nick & AJ]
There is something special
About this time of year
The Christmas feeling's everywhere
I just got home to join you
I've been away too long (been away too long)
But now I'm back to share my love
Friends are reunited
One big family filled with love
To last throughout the year

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Christmas time
Time to share our love
Come and join
The tidings to the world
Christmas time
The best time of the year
Yes, it's Christmas time
(Oh, Christmas time)

[Verse 2: Nick & Brian]
You and me together
Sleigh Ride in the Park
Loving kissing (straight from the heart)
Straight from my heart
Snowflakes falling gently
A smell of chestnuts in the air
And the Christmas lights
They gleam across the sky
Oh-oh, it's Christmas time

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Christmas time
Time to share our love
Come and join
The tidings to the world (world)
Christmas time (it's Christmas time)
The best time of the year (the best time)
Yes, it's Christmas time (oh yeah)

[Bridge: AJ & Brian]
Do you remember?
Everything felt so nice
When I held you close to me
Do you remember
Those cold Christmas nights?
When we saw the world in harmony

[Chorus: All, Brian & AJ]
Christmas time (Christmas time)
Time to share our love
(Time to share our love)
Come and join the tidings to the world
(The tidings to the world)
Christmas time, (it's Christmas time)
The best time of the year
(Always the best time)
Yes, it's Christmas time (Christmas time)
(All around the world)
It's Christmas time (all the boys and girls)

[Outro: All]
Christmas time
Time to share our love
Come and join
The tidings to the world
Christmas time
Time to share our love
Christmas time
Time to share our love
Come and join
The tidings to the world
Christmas time
Time to share our love

[Verse 1: AJ & All]
The first night that we met
I will never forget
Baby, you were a star (a star)
Oh-oh, from that point in time
It was always you & I shining so beautiful
When we're out with your friends
You treat me like I'm dead
It was like I'm invisible

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick & All]
(I can't let it go)
That was unforgivable
(I can't let it go)
I just wanna let you know
(I can't let it go)
Situation's unlivable
(I can't let it go)
I can't let it go

[Chorus: All]
So tell me why you say that you love me
When all you ever do girl, is push all my buttons?
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around, you say that you love me
Make me say, "oh-no", I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around and treat me right

[Verse 2: Brian]
You got me twisted
Oh, you got me twisted
I'm not someone you can't just disrespect
Oh-oh-oh-oh! How would you feel
If you were in my shoes?
Feeling used with a heart bruised

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick & All]
(I can't let it go)
The situation's critical
(I can't let it go)
Relationship is pitiful
(I can't let it go)
Everything's falling apart
(I can't let it go)
'Cause you're so hypocritical

[Chorus: All, AJ & Brian]
So tell me why you say that you love me
When all you ever do girl, is push all my buttons?
You always bring me down (bring me down)
In public (in public)
When nobody's around, you say that you love me
Make me say, "oh-no", I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around and treat me right (oh!)

[Break]
Y-Y-You're just no good for me
You're no good for me
You're just no good for me
I know you're no good for me

[Bridge: Howie]
You know it's wrong to treat me cold
I have no one to hold
One day I'm gonna say goodbye
What's it gonna be?
'Cause girl, I'm gonna leave
Unless you turn around and treat me right

[Chorus: All, Brian, (AJ), & Nick]
(Hey-hey) So tell me why (tell me why?)
You say that you love me (oh-oh-oh)
When all you ever do girl, is push all my buttons?
You always bring me down in public (in public)
When nobody's around, you say that you love me
Make me say, "oh-no", I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around and treat me right (treat me right)
I see you all alone (alone)
I'm halfway out the door (the door)
Unless you turn around and treat me right

[Interlude: Howie, AJ & Brian]
Just treat me right (oh!)
Just treat me right
(You say that you want me)
Just treat me right (oh-oh-oh)
Just treat me right

[Chorus: All, Brian, (AJ) & Nick]
So tell me why you say that you love me
(Oh, hey-hey, yeah!)
When all you ever do girl, is push all my buttons?
You always bring me down in public (in public)
When nobody's around, you say that you love me
Make me say, "oh-no", I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door (oh-oh-oh)
Unless you turn around (no) and treat me right (treat me right)
I see you all alone (yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around and treat me right

[Verse 1: AJ]
My feet on the ground but I can't run
Drowning the noise inside my head
Who is this man that I've become?
It's killing me to see myself
How do you learn how to forgive
When deep down inside you can't forget?
With all that I regret
And I pray for the first time in a long time
The lies fade away

[Chorus: Nick, AJ & All]
Finally I'm waking up
I feel like I can let you go
Say everything I wanted to say
I'm okay with being alone
When I close my eyes
When I close my eyes I'm alive

[Verse 2: AJ]
I never was sure but now I am
This was a choice I had to make
Maybe I'll never understand
Sometimes you've gotta make mistakes

[Chorus: Nick, AJ & All]
Finally I'm waking up
I feel like I can let you go
Say everything I wanted to say
I'm okay with being alone
Finally I've faced enough
I feel like I can let it show
I know I can walk away
I'm okay with being alone
When I close my eyes
(Close my eyes, close my eyes)
When I close my eyes
(Close my eyes, close my eyes)

[Interlude: AJ & All]
When I close my eyes
How do you know where to go when you're nowhere?
When I close my eyes
How do you know that you know when it's over?

[Bridge: Brian]
I see for the first time in a long time
Believe me when I say

[Chorus: Nick, AJ & All]
Finally I'm waking up
I feel like I can let you go
Say everything I wanted to say
I'm okay with being alone
Finally I've faced enough
I feel like I can let it show
I know I can walk away
I'm okay with being alone
When I close my eyes
(Close my eyes, close my eyes)
When I close my eyes
(Close my eyes, close my eyes)
I'm alive (I'm alive)

[Verse 1: Brian & Nick]
I won't tell nobody
I'll just scream it in my mind
Nothing good in life is scripted
It's not like we predicted
That the one you want
Is gonna be the one you thought
I won't tell nobody
But I won't live like a prisoner
Nothing has to be so perfect
Can you tell me was it worth it?
'Cause her heart can't lie
And even though her face may try
Love will keep you up all night

[Chorus: Nick with Howie]
'Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You gotta taste the sweet divine
It took you to the other side
Love will keep you up all night

[Verse 2: Brian, AJ & All]
If I don't tell a living soul
Still everyone would know
Yes they would
It's always 3 AM somewhere
You know it when you get there
Some people try to cover it up
Some people think it's never enough
(Never enough)

[Chorus: AJ with All, Nick]
Oh, love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day, you're all alone
The next, you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You gotta taste the sweet divine
Took you to the other side (oh)
Love will keep you up all night, oh-oh!

[Bridge: Nick]
I don't mean to scare you
But everybody has a first time
One day when you're old and gray
Don't look back and never say
You should've tried staying up all night

[Chorus: Nick, AJ with All]
Love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can't decide
One day you're all alone
The next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You gotta taste the sweet divine
It took you to the other side
To the other side (oh-oh!)
Love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can't decide
One day you're all alone
Next you're crying, you're crying
Love will keep you up all night (all night)
You gotta taste the sweet divine
It took you to the other side
Love will keep you up all night

[Outro: AJ with Nick]
Love will keep you up all night
Love will keep you up all night

[Chorus: All]
Don't leave me 'cause you need me
I never wanna be without you
Don't leave me 'cause you need me
I never wanna be without you

[Verse 1: AJ]
I woke up this mornin'
From a dream
That you were sayin' goodbye
We had simple argument
But not enough to keep out
Each other's lives

[Pre-Chorus: Brian, AJ & Nick]
I wanna be happy
But I can't be happy
If I can't be with you
'Cause you're my baby
My sweet honey
And no other girl will do

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Don't leave me 'cause you need me
I never wanna be without you
Don't leave me 'cause you need me
I never wanna be without you
(I never wanna be without you)

[Verse 2: AJ]
I can't seem to figure out
Just what went wrong with us
You must have thought I was selfish
But everything I did, I did for us

[Pre-Chorus: Brian, AJ & Nick]
I wanna be happy
But I can't be happy
If I can't be with you
'Cause you're my baby (my baby)
My sweet honey (honey)
And no other girl will do

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Don't leave me 'cause you need me
(Baby don't go)
I never wanna be without you
(Don't want you leaving)
Don't leave me 'cause you need me
I never wanna be without..
I never wanna be without you

[Bridge: Nick]
I can't eat or even sleep
'Til I have you
Back inside my world
My life won't be complete
Unless you stay my girl

[Chorus: All, Brian & AJ]
Don't leave me 'cause you need me
I never wanna be without you
(I don't want you leaving)
Don't leave me 'cause you need me
(Don't you leave)
I never wanna be without you

[Interlude: AJ]
Come on, girl, let me break it down

[Break: All]
Don't leave me girl
Don't leave me, don't go
Don't leave me girl
Don't leave me, don't go
Don't leave me girl
Don't leave me, don't go
Don't leave me girl
Don't leave me, ooh (don't leave)
Don't leave me girl
Don't leave me, don't go
Don't leave me girl
Don't leave me, ooh (don't leave)

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Don't leave me  (I don't wanna let you go)
'Cause you need me (I don't wanna be alone)
I never wanna be without you
(I never wanna be alone)
Don't leave me 'cause you need me
I never wanna be without you
Don't leave...

[Reprise: All]
Don't leave me girl
Don't leave me, don't go
Don't leave me girl
Don't leave me, don't go
Don't leave me girl
Don't leave me, don't go
Don't leave me girl
Don't leave me, ooh (don't leave)
Don't leave me girl
Don't leave me, don't go
Don't leave me girl
Don't leave me, ooh (don't leave)

[Intro: AJ]
Oh, oh, no

[Verse 1: Brian, Kevin & Nick]
Everybody needs affection
Looking for a deep connection
So put a little bit of love in my life today
Everybody needs some shelter
Let's spend a little time together
Come into my arms
Let them tell you what I wanna say

[Chorus: All, Kevin & Nick]
Color my world, draw on my heart
Take a picture of what you think of love
Looks like in your imagination
Write on my soul everything you know
Use every word you ever heard
To color my world

[Verse 2: Nick & AJ]
Yeah, yeah
I've had enough of not believing
Living life without a meaning
I want something real
And I feel it when I'm next to you
Let's vow to have some love and devotion
Winner to my heart's emotions
Until the very end
It's the place I'm gonna keep you in
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: All & Nick]
Color my world, draw on my heart
Take a picture of what you think of love
Looks like in your imagination
Write on my soul everything you know
Use every word you ever heard
To color my world

[Bridge: AJ, Brian & Nick]
Color my world, yeah
Let's make a world for you and me, yeah
Oh, that we're never gonna leave
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: All, (Nick), Kevin & AJ]
Color my world, draw on my heart
(Why won't you color my world?)
Take a picture of what you think of love
Looks like in your imagination
Write on my soul (write on my soul)
Everything you know
Use every word you ever heard
To color my world

[Interlude: All, Nick & AJ]
Oooh ooh (oh, no, no)
Won't you do it?
Won't you color my world?
Oooh, ooh (ooh, ooh)
Oooh, ooh (ooh, ooh)
Use every word you ever heard
To color my world

[Outro: Brian & Nick]
Everybody needs affection
Looking for a deep connection
Oh, color my world

[Verse 1: Brian]
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace
You could be anyone today
And maybe I would recognize
You on a crowded street

[Pre-Chorus 1: AJ]
Maybe you'll take me by surprise
Will you be the one I had in mind?

[Chorus: AJ & All]
There'll come a day
When you walk out of my dreams
Face to face
Like I'm imagining
Baby, how can I be sure
That you're the one I'm waiting for?
Will you be unmistakable?

[Verse 2: Nick]
People say we're watching life
Through a glass
Desperately waiting on a chance
I know you're out there
Holding on, holding out for me

[Pre-Chorus 2: AJ]
How're we gonna know the time is right?
What if you're here and I'm just blind?

[Chorus: Nick & All]
There'll come a day
When you walk out of my dreams
Face to face
Like I'm imagining
Baby, how can I be sure
That you're the one I'm waiting for?
Will you be unmistakable?

[Bridge: Nick, AJ  & All]
How can I know a song I never heard?
How will I know your voice
When you haven't said a word?
How do I know how this will end
Before we begin?
Before we begin?

[Chorus: All, Howie, (Brian) & Nick]
There'll come a day
When you walk out of my dreams
Face to face (face to face)
Like I'm imagining (like I'm imagining)
Baby, how can I be sure (how can I be sure)
That you're the one I'm waiting for?
(You're the one I'm waiting for?)
Will you be (will you be, will you be)
Will you be (will you be)

[Outro: AJ]
Unmistakable?
Unmistakable?

[Verse 1: AJ & Nick]
Brothers fighting brothers
Lovers fighting lovers
People barely caring anymore
Nations hating nations (oh-oh)
Love is lost in the equation (yeah-yeah)
Wondering why there is still so many wars
It's like this whole world's caught in
Some crazy storm

[Chorus: Howie with All, Nick]
We could use some
Divine intervention
God, if you're listening
Won't you help us
Find a solution
To all this confusion?
('Fusion, yeah-yeah)

[Verse 2: AJ, Brian & Nick]
Lives in desperation
A world of devastation
No one knowing where it's gonna go
(No one knowing where it's gonna go)
We got too many too hungry
It's time to stop this suffering (time to stop this)
And I do not think we can do it on our own
(Oh-no-no-no)
And right now we need something
To save our souls

[Chorus: Nick with All, Brian with All, All]
We could use some
Divine intervention
God, if you're listening
Won't you help us
Find a solution
To all this confusion?

[Interlude: Nick & AJ]
We sure could use some
Yeah yeah yeah, show us!

[Bridge: AJ with All]
Show us that our change is gonna come
Help us to replace the hate with love
Overflow our hearts with kindness
Help us lift the clouds out of our way

[Chorus: All, Nick, (Brian) & AJ]
We could use some
Divine intervention
God, if you're listening
(God, if you're listening)
Won't you help us
(Yes God, if you're listening)
Find a solution (oh-oh)
To all this confusion?
We could use some (we could use some)
Divine intervention
God, if you're listening (oh yeah-yeah)
Won't you help us (please won't you help us?)
(Won't you help us, yeah-yeah-yeah)

[Break: All, Brian & AJ]
I gotta find a way, I gotta find a way
I gotta find a way, (way) I gotta find a way
(Find a way)
I gotta find a way, I gotta find a way
I gotta find a way, (find a way) I gotta find a way

[Outro: AJ, Brian & Nick]
God, if you're listening
Won't you help us?
Divine intervention
If you found a way right now
Please won't you help us?
It's all we need

[Verse 1: Brian]
How come I was the last to know?
Took the stage then you stole the show
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
I was captured by that stare
Now I'm shattered but I don't care
And the people walking by don't have a clue

[Chorus: Brian with AJ]
That I kissed your face
Till the sun was in our eyes
Till the afternoon arrived
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon

[Verse 2: Nick]
Monday is a funny thing
Still waiting for the phone to ring
Will my imagination take it slow?
Oh-yeah, after Saturday, my life is changed
In a moment it was rearranged
Strange how easy it is letting go

[Chorus: Nick with AJ, Nick with Brian]
And I miss your face
Like the sun was in my eyes
And now I am running blind
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon

[Interlude: All & AJ]
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Oh-oh, oh-yeah)

[Bridge: Brian with Nick]
This sweet relief, unexpected things
Is this the end or only the beginning?

[Chorus: All, Howie, (Nick) & Brian]
I miss your face
Like the sun was in my eyes (like the afternoon)
And now I'm running blind (running blind)
I can't explain (can't explain)

[Outro: AJ]
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love that's made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon

[Intro: Brian]
Oh yeah-yeah

[Verse 1: Brian]
I've been walking 'round inside a haze
Between the lines of reason
Hiding from the ghost of yesterday
Feels like I’m barely breathing

[Chorus: Brian with All, Brian & AJ]
I, I wanna feel the rain again
I, I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
(Na na na na na na, na na na na na na)
Feel the rain
(Na na na na na na na na na)

[Verse 2: Howie & Nick]
I've been losing days
The shades pulled down
I still can't face the sun
But I, I'm going crazy
I can't stay here
I've gone completely numb
I just wanna need someone

[Chorus: Nick with All, AJ & Nick]
I, I wanna feel the rain again
(Feel the rain again)
I, I wanna feel the water on my skin
(Water on my skin)
And let it all just wash away
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Feel the rain

[Bridge: AJ]
Oh-no, oh-oh-oh
I thought you were the only one
But now I think I was wrong
'Cause life goes on

[Interlude: All]
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na

[Reprise: Brian]
I've been walking 'round inside a haze

[Chorus: All, Nick, Howie, (AJ) & Brian]
Oh I! I wanna feel the rain again
I, I wanna feel the water on my skin
And let it all just wash away
In a downpour (downpour!)
I wanna feel the rain (I wanna feel the rain)
I, I wanna feel the rain again (oh-oh)
I, I wanna feel the water on my skin (water on my skin)
And let it all just wash away
In a downpour (in a downpour)
I wanna feel the rain

[Outro: Nick, AJ & All]
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
In a downpour
Feel the rain, oh-oh
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
I wanna feel the rain

[Verse 1: Nick, All & Brian]
So I lie awake another hour
Just like the one before
The shadows play a game with my head
I can't take this anymore
I hear the sound
Of my own breathing
It makes me miss you more

[Chorus: AJ with All, Brian]
Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Just leave me here in pieces
In pieces

[Verse 2: Nick, All & Brian]
I can't take the chance
Of running into
You running into me
So lock the door
And close the window
I just wanna see
Until the day
Inside my future
Where I'll be on my feet

[Chorus: AJ with All, Brian]
Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
When the damage has all been done
(The damage is done)
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Just leave me here in pieces
In pieces

[Bridge: AJ]
If you want you can find me
On the dark side of the sun
Babe I don't wanna see
What we've become...
The damage has all been done

[Chorus: All, AJ, (Nick) & Brian]
Wake me up when it's over (wake me up)
After the ending (when it's over)
When the damage has all been done
(The damage is done)
I don't wanna be somewhere (somewhere)
(I don't wanna be somewhere)
Where you can watch me as I bleed
(Where you feel me bleeding)
Just leave me here in pieces
(Just leave me in pieces)
In pieces (just leave me in pieces)

[Outro: AJ & All]
Wake me up when it's over yeah (in pieces)
Just wake me up when it's over yeah

[Verse 1: Nick]
Looking for beauty in a certain
Finding the strength inside a gray
Maybe I'm heading for a breakdown
And maybe that's okay
Could be I'm hanging on for dear life
Maybe I need to get a grip
'Cause you're the only one
That makes me feel like this, so...

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Save me, I'm falling again
Keep me from breaking in a million pieces
In the end no matter what I do
There's nowhere, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go but you

[Verse 2: Brian & Howie]
Yeah-yeah (yeah-yeah)
Tryna' make nothing outta something
Promised myself I wouldn't care
Baby you're making me a liar
'Cause I'm standing here
You're finally cracking my resistance
And found a way to wear me down
Yeah, I just look at you
And there's no way out, so...

[Chorus: All, Nick & Brian]
Save me, I'm falling again (yeah)
Keep me from breaking in a million pieces (in the end)
In the end no matter what I do (oh, no-no)
There's nowhere (nowhere)
Nowhere to go (nowhere to go)
(Oh!) Nowhere to go but...

[Bridge: AJ & All]
Every single road I take (it's you)
Asleep or wide awake (I know it's you)
And it's too late for anyone to save me

[Chorus: All, Brian, Howie, (AJ) & Nick]
I'm falling again
Keep me from breaking in a million pieces
In the end (in the end) no matter what I do
There's nowhere (nowhere)
Nowhere to go (nowhere, yeah-yeah)
Nowhere to go but...
Save me (save me, yeah-yeah)
I'm falling again (falling again)
Keep me from breaking in a million pieces
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
In the end no matter what I do (what I do)
There's nowhere, nowhere to go
(Nowhere to go but you, yeah)

[Outro: Howie]
Nowhere to go but you

[Verse 1: Brian]
Can I have a talk with you?
Let me walk you home from school
I got something that's on my mind
And I don't know just what to do
See girl I've been watching you
And I think I'm a little sprung
Can't seem to get my mind off it
I'm thinking about you
I think that you're the one

[Pre-Chorus: AJ]
So won't you just listen to me
There's so much I wanna say
Girl, I got this love for you
You can have it your way everyday
I will treat you right, I will never lie
Girl I promise to you that I won't make you cry
Girl be straight for me
Tell me your feeling the way that I do

[Chorus: All]
Girl give me your love, I'll give you my heart
Lets put them together see what we can start

You wanna be with me
I wanna be with you
Girl give me your love, I'll give you my heart
Lets put them together see what we can start
I wanna be with you
You wanna be with me
I wanna be with you

[Verse 2: Brian]
All those people they talk about
It's only a puppy love
They say our feelings could not be real
We know the deal yeah
I just don't know what to do
Cause girl I'm so crazy 'bout you
And I know its not wrong
Because I wanna be everything that you need
(Shoo-do-do-opp)

[Pre-Chorus: AJ]
Girl wanna walk you home from school
Wanna help you do your homework, homework
And when you a kiss I'll show I'll be the one
I wanna be the one
Girl if you say yes to me
I promise that I'll not
No I'll never leave I'll be right by your side
With my love for you I can fly high

[Chorus: All]
Girl give me your love, I'll give you my heart
Lets put them together see what we can start

[Bridge: Kevin & AJ]
Girl, I wanna be everything that you need
'Cause I aim to please
And that's the way it is
My hearts on the line
Don't take your time
You're still free

[Chorus: All]
Girl give me your love, I'll give you my heart
Lets put them together see what we can start
I wanna be with you
You wanna be with me

[Verse 1: Brian & Howie]
There's me looking down at my shoes
The one that's smiling like the sun, that's you
What were you thinking?
What was the song inside your head?
There's us going on about a band
Working out how we'd play our hands
I lay there dreaming
Later all alone in my bed

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick]
If I was stupid, maybe careless
So were you

[Chorus: Nick]
Not everything is supposed to come true
Some words are best unsaid
Some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough, there's us

[Verse 2: AJ]
Freeze frame, I'm not about to cry
It's too late for us to change, why try?
I've got a camera
Tucked away inside my heart

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick]
If I'm a loser or just unlucky
So are you

[Chorus: All & Nick]
Not everything is supposed to come true
Some words are best unsaid
Some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough, there's us

[Bridge: AJ & Nick]
Somewhere between then and now
I looked away
When you said we'll never change, hey-yeah!
And if you think what might have been
You'll lose today
We got songs to play (songs to play, oh-oh!)

[Chorus: All, Nick, AJ, (Howie) & Brian]
Not everything is supposed to come true
(Oh, not everything can ever, ever come true)
Some words are best unsaid (unsaid, unsaid)
Some love is not really love at all (love at all)
I'll keep everything I shared with you (with you, no-no-no)
(That is enough)
And that's enough, there's us (oh-ah!)
Not everything is supposed to come true (oh-no!)
Some words are best unsaid (unsaid)
Some love is not really love at all (love at all!)
I'll keep everything I shared with you (oh-oh-oh-oh!)
And that's enough (that's enough)

[Outro: AJ, Brian, (Howie) & Nick]
There's us
Some love is not really love at all
(There's us)
Some love is not really love at all
There's us

[Intro: AJ]
Oh-oh yeah

[Verse 1: Brian]
Don't pretend you're sorry
I know you're not
You know you got the power
To make me weak inside
And girl you leave me breathless
But it's okay
'Cause you are my survival
Now hear me say

[Pre-Chorus: Howie]
I can't imagine
Life without your love
And even forever
Don't seem like long enough

[Chorus: All & Brian]
'Cause every time I breathe I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
And every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You keep drowning in your love

[Verse 2: AJ with Nick & All]
Maybe I'm a drifter
Maybe not
'Cause I have known the safety
Of floating freely in your arms
And I don't need another lifeline
It's not for me
'Cause only you can save me
Oh-oh, can't you see

[Pre-Chorus: Nick with Howie, Brian]
I can't imagine
Life without your love
And even forever
Don't seem like long enough
(Don't seem like long enough, yeah)

[Chorus: All & AJ]
'Cause every time I breathe I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
And every time I try to rise above (rise above)
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

[Bridge: Kevin with AJ]
Go on and pull me under
Cover me with dreams, yeah
Love me mouth to mouth now
You know I can't resist
'Cause you're the air that I breathe

[Chorus: All, Brian & AJ]
Every time I breathe I take you in
('Cause every time I breathe, yeah)
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it (baby I can't help it)
You keep me drowning in your love
And every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love (by love)
Baby I can't help it (can't help it)
You keep me drowning in your love (love, yeah-yeah)

[Interlude: All, Nick & AJ]
Baby I can't help it
(Keep me drowning in your love)
Got me drowning (oh-oh-oh)
Got me drowning
(Keep me drowning in your love)
Baby I can't help it
(Can't help it, can't help it, no-no)
Got me drowning

[Chorus: All, AJ & Brian]
'Cause every time I breathe I take you in (I do)
And my heart beats again (oh-yeah!)
Baby I can't help it (baby I can't help it)
You keep me drowning in your love
And every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it

[Outro: AJ]
You keep me drowning in your love

[Verse 1: Brian]
Here I am again
Waiting on the moment you decide
To leave me stranded on the edge of nowhere
I've been so close to you so many times
I feel like I could drown
I wish that I could fly away from here

[Chorus: All & AJ]
But I'm still coming down
From the last time
That you came around
In the starlight
Now I am pulled into your gravity
Spinning helplessly
I'm falling through the night
Like a lonely satellite (like a lonely satellite)

[Verse 2: Nick with Howie]
Walked on Jupiter
Flew around the Moon a time or two
Left a mark on every star we could find
But now I'm burning like a meteor
That never hits the ground
Wish that I could fly away from you

[Chorus: All & AJ]
But I'm still coming down
From the last time
That you came around
In the starlight
Now I am pulled into your gravity
Spinning helplessly
I'm falling through the night
Like a lonely satellite

[Bridge: Nick & Howie]
Love is poisoning the atmosphere
Is keeping everything unclear to me
There's something in your eyes
Never satisfies
I'm feeling so alone, tonight

[Chorus: All, AJ & Nick]
But I'm still coming down (still coming down)
From the last time (the last time)
That you came around (you came around)
In the starlight (the starlight)
Now I'm pulled into your gravity
Spinning helplessly
I'm falling through the night
(Falling through the night)
Yes, I'm falling through the night
(Falling through the night)
Like a lonely satellite (like a lonely satellite)

[Intro: AJ]
(I wanna know)
Yeah, I wanna know
(I wanna know)
I wanna know

[Verse 1: AJ]
You had me fooled
You were so good at that
I'm so unglued
Too many pieces to put back
You were the best by far
How did we end up like this, yeah?
Don't even know who you are
I can't believe it's like this
I wanna know

[Chorus: All & Nick]
How does it feel to be a fallen angel?
Your wings are lying on the ground
How does it feel to be a fallen angel?
Forever is a long way down
You were everything that I thought I wanted to be
But everything has disappeared from me
So how does it feel?
How does it feel to be a fallen angel of love?

[Interlude: AJ]
(I wanna know)
Oh-ooh-ooh-oh
(I wanna know)

[Verse 2: Brian & Howie]
I followed you
To the deepest part of love
And how do you
Destroy the life we built for us?
And this is a mystery
You played the part so well, yeah
Now this is history
Was I the last to tell?
I wanna know

[Chorus: All & AJ with Nick]
How does it feel to be a fallen angel?
Your wings are lying on the ground
How does it feel to be a fallen angel?
Forever is a long way down
You were everything that I thought I wanted to be
But everything has disappeared from me
So how does it feel?
How does it feel to be a fallen angel of love?

[Bridge: Nick]
The only thing that’s worse than emptiness
Is when your heart’s lost
And the only thing that’s worth the pain
Is the price of what love costs
Just when you think it’s all in your hands
That’s when it’s gone
And you’re thinking you’re invincible
Believe me, you’re so wrong
Tell me how does it feel

[Chorus: All, AJ & Brian]
How does it feel to be a fallen angel?
Your wings are lying on the ground (on the ground)
How does it feel to be a fallen angel? (fallen angel)
Forever is a long way down
You were everything that I thought I wanted to be
But everything has disappeared from me
So how does it feel?
How does it feel to be a fallen angel of love?

[Outro: Brian]
Tell me how does it feel, yeah?
Tell me how does it feel?
I wanna know how it feels

[Intro: Brian]
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Brian]
"I don't think I want this anymore"
As she drops her ring to the floor
She says to herself, "you've left before
This time you will stay gone that's for sure"

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
Yeah, and he shattered something as
She dragged her suitcase down the path
To the driveway
She had never gone that far
Normally, this would be the time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
But this time, without crying
As she got into her car, she said

[Chorus: All]
No, happily never after
That just ain't for me, because finally
I know, I deserve better after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall

[Verse 2: AJ]
Fall, oh, oh, oh
As she drove away
She starts to smile, yeah
Realized she hadn't for a while
No destination, she drove for miles
Wondering why she stayed in such denial

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
She was laughing about the way
He shattered something as
She dragged her suitcase down the path
To the driveway (to the driveway)
She had never gone that far (no, no)
Normally this would be the time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
But this time, without crying
As she got into her car, she said

[Chorus: All & (Nick)]
No, happily never after
That just ain't me (that just ain't for me)
Because finally, I know
I deserve better after all (that just ain't for me, yeah)
I'll never let another teardrop fall

[Bridge: All & Howie]
I'm done, I'm done
Said I'm so done, so done, yeah
I'm free, I'm free (so free)
Free to feel the way I feel, yeah
She inhales a breath
She never breathed before
Don't want no drama no more

[Interlude: Brian]
Cause she says no
Happily never after (after)
That just ain't for me (oh, oh)

[Chorus: All, (Howie) & AJ]
I know, I deserve better after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall
No, happily never after
That just is not for me (that just ain't for me)
Because finally
I know I deserve better after all (oh, oh, oh)
I'll never let another tear drop fall

[Outro: All & Brian]
I'm done, I'm done
I'm done, so done, I'm done, so done
Said I'm done, I'm done, I'm done

[Intro: Brian]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah!

[Verse 1: Brian & Nick]
You had me waiting
Even on a second date
I picked you up
I took you to your favorite place
I saw you flirting
But I looked the other way
Away, away, away, hey!
You pulled me up
And said you had a place to go
Just grab my keys
You took my car and stole my phone
I knew I shouldn't
But I let you get away
Away, away, away

[Chorus: All & AJ]
But I'm not a player, I'm not a clown
I won't be a puppet just hanging around
You need another man
To put diamonds on your hands
And let you take his car
I found out who you are
I finally figured you out! (oh-no)

[Verse 2: AJ]
I should've seen it coming
You were just pretend
Used up my credit card
And maxed it 'til the end
I wish I'd known
Before I hit the ATM
Oh-no, it happened again
Hey-yeah-hey-ah!

[Chorus: All, Brian & AJ]
'Cause I'm not a player, I'm not a clown
I won't be a puppet just hanging around
You need another man
To put diamonds on your hands
And let you take his car
I found out who you are
I finally figured (I figured you out)
I finally figured (I figured you out)
I finally figured (oh yeah!) you out!

[Bridge: All & Howie]
I'm going away, far, far away
I'm going away, so far away
I'm going away, far, far away
I'm gonna pack your bags and kick you out
I'm sorry but I figured you out

[Interlude: AJ & Nick]
Figured you out, hey!
So long, so long, farewell

[Chorus: All, Brian & AJ]
'Cause I'm not a player, I'm not a clown
(I won't be a puppet)
I won't be a puppet just hanging around
You need another man
To put diamonds on your hands
(Diamonds on your hands)
And let you take his car
I found out who you are
'Cause I'm not a player, I'm not a clown
(Player, hey-ah!)
I won't be a puppet just hanging around
You need another man
To put diamonds on your hands
And let you take his car
I found out who you are
I finally figured (I figured you out)
I finally figured (I figured you out)
I finally figured (oh yeah!) you out!

[Intro: Nick]
Oh, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick]
I've been on the run
Slept under the sun
Feeding off the clouds
And eating them like ice cream
I've been all around
Never left this town
Blisters on my eyelids
Like it's spring in Paris
I've seen everything
I've dreamt every dream
I am every human
Oh I'm not even finished

[Chorus: All & Nick]
Look how I go, impeccable flow
Wind in my face, it hardly ever rains
Always on top, I'm coming up
I'm everything and I am everything
I know it all, don't know a thing
I am changing, still the same
I'm every color, I'm every color
I am evergreen

[Interlude: Nick]
Oooh, no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no

[Verse 2: Nick, AJ, (Howie) & Brian]
I've been on the side
Always stayed ahead
I'm so very fast
Give me a speeding ticket
Me you cannot teach
I just wanna know
I'm the tallest man
But I will never grow
(I've seen everything)
I've dreamt every dream
I am every human
No I'm not even finished, oh-oh!

[Chorus: All, Brian, (AJ) & Nick]
Look how I go, impeccable flow
Wind in my face, it hardly ever rains
Always on top (always on top)
I'm coming up
I'm everything and I am everything
I know it all, don't know a thing
I am changing, still the same
I'm every color (yeah)
I'm every color
I am evergreen

[Bridge: AJ & All]
The truth is stranger than fiction
When you're a walking contradiction
When you're evergreen
You're always walking in
You're the first one last
But you're back again
Don't be afraid to ask
But don't ask again
We'll forever last
When you're evergreen

[Chorus: All, Nick & AJ]
(Oooh no-no-no, yeah-yeah, oh-oh!)
Look how I go, impeccable flow
Wind in my face, it hardly ever rains
Always on top (always on top)
I'm coming up (I'm coming up)
I'm everything
And I am everything (I am everything)
I know it all
Don't know a thing (don't know a thing)
I am changing, still the same (still the same)
I'm every color (I'm every color)
I'm every color (I'm every color)
I'm every color (oh, I'm every color)
I'm every color (color)
I am evergreen

[Outro: AJ & Nick]
Yeah I'm evergreen (oh no-no)
Yeah, I am evergreen

[Intro: AJ]
Oh-oh, yeah-eh-eh

[Verse 1: Brian]
Opposites attract, chemicals react
But when I look at you
Deserts need the rain, fires feed the flame
We can't deny what's true

[Pre-Chorus: Nick & All]
I can't help the way I feel
'Cause you got me yeah
All these elements are real
They come from deep within me

[Chorus: All]
I would move heaven and earth for this fire
For this ocean, I'd fight for you
Let this emotional wind take us higher
Where there's nothing we can do
I love you, I love you
This power is greater
Than the forces of nature

[Verse 2: Brian & AJ]
We don't have no walls
The beauty of it all (beauty of it all)
Is waiting in your eyes
Breathing on my skin, just let me take it in
Under an open sky

[Pre-Chorus: Nick & All]
I can't help the way I feel
'Cause you got me yeah
Oh you know I can't
All these elements are real
They come from deep within me

[Chorus: All & AJ]
I would move heaven and earth for this fire
For this ocean, I'd fight for you
Let this emotional wind take us higher
Where there's nothing we can do
I love you (oh I love you) I love you
This power is greater
Than the forces of nature

[Bridge: AJ with All, Brian & Howie]
Nothing is greater
Than the energy I get from loving you
Sooner or later
It'll take us to forever (forever, oh-oh-ah!)

[Chorus: All & AJ]
I would move heaven and earth for this fire (fire)
For this ocean, I'd fight for you (for you, oh-oh-oh-oh yeah)
Let this emotional wind take us higher
Where there's nothing we can do
(Nothing, nothing we can do)
I would move heaven and earth (I would move heaven)
For this fire (for this fire)
For this ocean, I'd fight for you (I'd fight for you)
Let this emotional wind (let this emotional wind)
Take us higher
Where there's nothing we can do (nothing we can do)
I love you (I love you baby)
I love you (I love you baby)
This power is greater
Than the forces of nature (oh-oh)

[Intro: Nick]
I'm so sorry that I called you
I'm trying to pick up the pieces of my life
I forgot that we were over
Tell me what went wrong, wrong, wrong
Wrong....yeah

[Verse 1: Nick]
Twelve days, four hours, twenty minutes
I'm stuck and you know you've got me in it
Broken glass on the floor
From the picture frame (shame, shame, shame)
We had it all, this love so strong
Now everything we had is gone
If you could read my mind
You'd know I've crossed that line

[Chorus: All]
'Cause I'm as sick as my secrets
Yeah, it's killing me, you know that I mean it
I need you next to me
There's nowhere to run, girl, I can't let you go
And it is twisted I know
But I just can't take it no more

[Verse 2: Nick]
Six miles, twelve lights till your front door
I'm on my way just like I have so many times before
Does he know that it's me
You have been talking to? (shame, shame, shame)
If you could read my mind
I'm going to fight to get you back this time

[Chorus: All]
'Cause I'm as sick as my secrets
Yeah, it's killing me, you know that I mean it
I need you next to me
There's nowhere to run, girl, I can't let you go
And it is twisted I know
But I just can't take it no more

[Bridge: Nick]
I'm tired of all these lies
There is nothing but regret behind these eyes
All this love I could never show
I don't care anymore give a damn, who knows

[Chorus: Nick & All]
'Cause I'm as sick as my secrets
Yeah, it's killing me, you know that I mean it
I need you back with me
There's nowhere to run, girl, I can't let you go
And it is twisted I know
But I just can't take it no more
Sick as my secrets
Yeah, it's killing me, you know that I mean it
I need you next to me
There's nowhere to run (nowhere to run)
Girl, I can't let you go (nowhere to hide)
And it is twisted I know
But I just can't take it no more

[Outro: Nick & All]
Yeah, I just can't leave you alone
Yeah, yeah, cause I'm as sick as my secrets
Oh, tired of all the lies (shame, shame, shame)
Oh, baby, you have got me stripped of my pride
'Cause I'm as sick as my secrets
Gonna shout it from a mountain top (shame, shame, shame)
Yeah, drain the oceans from the tears we have cried
'Cause I'm as sick as my secrets
Gonna break down these walls (shame, shame, shame)
Gonna stand tall, gonna be your man
'Cause I'm as sick as my secrets
Hope you understand, oh
'Cause I'm as sick as my secrets
That I will never let you go
Yo, we made this joint, we was like, "We gotta get Preemo to scratch on this shit, seriously." Cause, that's one of my idols, just a legend in the game, a living legend. And then, plus, he, he like porn a lot, so I relate to him with that, you know. And he been to the AVN's, you know. I been to the Grammy's, he been to the AVN's, you know. I'm, and, actu- I'm envious of him, cause Rick Rubin, he actually asked me to go to the AVN's, and I was like, "Man, I can't do it. I just made 'Jesus Walks'. They gon' see me, and they gon' take away my NAACP award." So I was, uh, you know, I have to watch pornos in the privacy of my own home, you know? I really want to go AVN's, but, you know, I can't do it, cause they'll take me off the cover of Jet, and then what? Now I won't make it on the cover of Essence. But one day, one day I'll be there. I'ma have one on of them BAPE hoodies zipped-up with the eyes cut out and some, some gloves with the fingers cut off so I could feel, too, so I could touch. You know they let celebrities touch. That's how it be whenever you go to the strip club, "No touching!  Except for you, 'Ye, you can do whatever you want."

[Verse 1: Brian & Howie]
I-I-I gotta make-make my way-way-way
Through all these people
I done paid-paid all this money
Just so-so I-I can see you
I'm 'bout to act a doggone fool
Unleash the dog on you
I'm about to bum-bum chicka bum-bum-bum
Run it back (previous line reversed)
And I got technology, x-ray vision
Any game I can see through
I get static every time you speak
Frequency gotta be equal
I'm tired of playing
Can't even hear the stuff you saying
'Cause it's like round, round
Round, round, round, round, round

[Chorus: Brian, Nick & All]
Hologram
I'm pushing up close
But it's hard to get to ya
Hologram
There's a glitch in a system
Tell me what I gotta do now?

[Verse 2: Nick & AJ]
You want me to flip the switch so-so I-I
Can be your victim
I ain't gonna slip up like going outside in the rain
With no umbrella
What the hell you take me for?
I'mma take a different route
I'm about to bum-bum chicka bum-bum-bum you
Run it back (previous line reversed)
Bang, bang, choo-choo train, baby
Put that thing on me
You'd rather see my mainframe, not the cage
And see another side of me
And she be like, "T-minus 7 before my system shuts down"
Matter of fact
I think I'm 'bout to shut it down right now

[Chorus: Nick & All]
Hologram
I'm pushing up close
But it's hard to get to ya

[Bridge: Brian]
I'm tired of playing with you
Right now I think you're time's up
Giving mixed signals

I'm losing my mind
Perfect model before my time
Download to my instant data
Give me a socket I can plug in

[Chorus: AJ, Brian & All]

[Chorus]
Last night on the road with my head spin-spinning speeding heading for a dead end but I turned it around
You
I did it for you
You

[X4]

[Verse 1]
Never thought for once that it would end up like this before, always thought I'd be the one driving
Pay no attention to caution signs I'm running through traffic lights completely out of control
I put my hands on the steering wheel proceeded to give it gas that's when I ran into you
And girl you turned my life around I know I was going South where would I be without you?
Probably lost

[Chorus]
I did it for you
You

[X4]

[Verse 2]
I had my bags packed thinking that life wasn't fair I drove so far 'till nothing' was there
I swear this pain is killing me like no one's in love with me
I had to take a backseat down a backstreet just to realize the world didn't revolve around me
I was a speed demon how could you ever love a speed demon
Girl I was so lost

[Chorus]
I did it for you
You

[X4]

[Verse 3]
Girl I know that everything is true
It's all about you it's all about you
Be honest I just couldn't breathe I had to turn around
Be honest I just couldn't breathe I had to turn around
Girl I know that everything is true
It's all about you it's all about you
Be honest I just couldn't breathe I had to turn around
Be honest I just couldn't breathe I had to turn around

[Chorus]
I did it for you
You

[X4]
(Verse 1)
What I care about a river rat
Old maggot pussy alley ho
Punk bitch, you better stay in line there, don't come off your patio
Catch me out in Cali, ho, ask a ratchet how they do that
Get wrong with me, don't do that
Bitch, I'm throwed I thought you knew that
Got an ounce with me a two gats
So anybody wig get blew back
No exaggeration, true fact, I will set fire to where you at

[Intro]
Get it
I got to get it, I really need you love
Get it, Get it

[X8]

[Chorus]
I got to get it, I really need you love
I got to get it, from you baby
I got to get it
I got to get it, I really need you love
I got to get it, tell me baby

[Verse 1]
There alone with that look in your eyes (awwh baby)
Can't help myself, cause you've got me so mesmerized
I wanna know you name but there's something
That is keeping me away from you
I wanna take you away and there's nothing
I wouldn't give to be with you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
How can it be
Your eyes take control over me (awwh baby)
The way you move (move, move)
Your body is talking to me (awwh babe)
I wanna know you name but there's something
That is keeping me away from you
I wanna take you away and there's nothing
I wouldn't give to be with you (ooh)

[Chorus 1]
I got to get it
I got to get it, I really need you love
I got to get it, from you baby

[Verse 3]
I wanna know you name but there's something
That is keeping me away from you, ohhh
I wanna take you away and there's nothing
I wouldn't give to be with you, oh tonight

[Chorus 1]

[Intro: AJ]
Oh yeah, hey

[Verse 1: AJ]
It's 7 AM, thinking about you
Wondering if the thoughts I'm feeling
You're feeling too
Like a newborn child, soft to the touch
Baby is it possible
To love someone so much?

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
I wish I may, I wish I might
Be that certain someone you wish for every night

[Chorus: AJ, Brian & All]
If you knew what I knew
You wouldn't say what you said (say what you said)
If you knew what I knew
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart (breaking my heart)
Over things that aren't true
My lady yes (my lady, yes my lady)
If you knew what I knew

[Interlude: AJ with All]
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2: Brian & All]
Time passes by, the only tears I cry
Are filled with disillusion of fears I have inside
Like a lost soul
I feel like I'm all alone (all alone)
If only I could feel your pain
Within your heart of stone, oh-oh!

[Pre-Chorus: Howie]
I wish I may, I wish I might
Be that certain someone you wish for every night

[Chorus: AJ, Brian & All]
If you knew what I knew
You wouldn't say what you said (say what you said)
If you knew what I knew
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart (breaking my heart)
Over things that aren't true
My lady yes
If you knew what I knew

[Bridge: AJ]
Then you wouldn't have to go away
If you knew what I knew
Then you would be here
To stay right by side always

[Chorus: AJ & All]
If you knew what I knew
You wouldn't say what you said (say what you said)
If you knew what I knew
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart (breaking my heart)
Over things that aren't true
My lady yes (my lady, yes my lady)

[Break: Brian]
If you knew what I knew my baby
You would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby
We would be together instead
If you knew what I knew my baby
You would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby
We would be together instead

[Outro: Brian, AJ & All]
Girl if you knew (say what you said)
If you only knew
Girl if you knew (loving you, oh-oh)
Girl if you knew (say what you said)
Girl if you knew (say what you said)

[Verse 1: Brian & Nick]
I'm yours completely
I feel so deeply
You're my first thought every day
And I want it that way
My life is for you
And I adore you
I love you more everyday
And I want it that way

[Chorus: Nick, All]
No goodbyes
Ain't nothing but a heartache
No more lies
Ain't nothing but a mistake
That is why
I love it when I hear you say
I want it that way

[Verse 2: AJ]
My heart is on fire
Such a strong desire
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way

[Chorus: AJ, All, Brian]
No goodbyes
Ain't nothing but a heartache
No more lies
Ain't nothing but a mistake
That is why
I love it when I hear you say
I want it that way

[Bridge: Kevin]
I gave you my heart
Baby right from the start
And that's the way it will always be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

[Interlude: Howie]
You are my fire
The one desire
You are (you are, you are, you are)

[Nick]
Don't want to hear you say

[Chorus (w/ Nick)]
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Ain't nothing but a mistake (I wanna hear you say)
I love it when I hear you say (oh yeah)
You want it that way

[Chorus (w/AJ, Brian & Nick)]
(No goodbyes)
Ain't nothing but a heartache
(No more lies)
Ain't nothing but a mistake
That is why
I love it when I hear you say
(I wanna hear you say)
I want it that way

[Chorus (w/Brian & AJ)]
(No goodbyes)

[Chorus]
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Ain't nothing but a mistake
That is why
I love it when I hear you say
(Love it when I hear you say)
I want it that way

[Outro: AJ]
'Cause I want it that way

[Verse 1]
I'm only one step ahead of heartbreak
One step ahead of misery
One step is all I'd have to take backwards
To be the same old fool for you I used to be

[Verse 2]
I'm only one step ahead of your arms
One kiss away from your sweet lips
I know I can't afford to stop for one moment
'Cause I'm just out of reach of your fingertips

[Bridge]
Your warm breath on my shoulder
Keeps reminding me
That it's too soon to forget you
It's too late to be free, can't you see?

[Verse 3]
I'm only one step ahead of your love
I try and yet I can't take two
Seems like I'll have to take that one step backwards
'Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
'Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
Just one step ahead is a step too far away from you

[Intro: Brian]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Brian]
Don't say a word, I understand
You wanna know if I'm still your man
Girl, can't you tell by the touch of my hand
I'm gonna please you every way that I can

[Pre-Chorus: Brian & All]
I'll hold you (hold you)
Love you (love you)
I'll never let your love go (let you go, let you go)
For always (for always)
I'll stay (I'll stay)
Just look in my eyes and you'll know

[Chorus: All]
Baby, I'll be there for you
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
Girl, I've got forever inside
For all of my life
I'll be there for you

[Verse 2: Brian & All]
Don't ever doubt your trust in me
I'll give you my heart so honestly
Deep in my soul
Baby, you'll find a dream
I'll never change, girl, I promise you

[Pre-Chorus: Brian & All]
I'll hold you (hold you baby)
Love you (love you, lady)
I'll never let you go (never let you go, let you go)
For always (for always)
I'll stay (I'll stay)
Just look in my eyes and you'll know

[Chorus: All]
Baby, I'll be there for you
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
Girl, I've got forever inside
For all of my life
I'll be there for you

[Bridge: Brian & All]
Nothing and no one
Can tear us apart (tear us apart)
You'll always be here
Inside of my heart (inside my heart)
And just as sure as the stars shine above
No matter what happens
You can count on my love

[Chorus: All]
Baby, I'll be there for you
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
Girl, I've got forever inside
For all of my life
I'll be there for you

[Intro: Brian & Kevin]
Oh, I'll never find....
I'll never find someone like you

[Verse 1: AJ & Brian]
Girl, you take my breath away
And when I'm with someone new
I rather be here with you, baby, forever
Oooh, my heart belongs to you
Girl I think about you all the time
I know my love is true, when we're together
I played around girl and I made you cry
When I looked up, you were saying goodbye
I'm begging you please, I need you so bad
Don't leave me now, you're the best that I've had

[Chorus: All & Brian]
I'll never
I'll never find someone like you (no, I'll never)
I promise it's true, no, I'll never
I'll never find someone like you (ooh, baby)
'Cause I love the way that you are
And girl, I won't, no, I won't let you go
No one could ever do, love you like I love you

[Verse 2: AJ, Brian & Nick]
All I have is just my heart
And my feelings I give to you
That's all that I can do girl, baby forever
Oh, you don't know that you're hurting me
'Cause it's not just a sexual thing
I wanna share my dreams, baby, together
Girl I'm afraid just to give you the burn
My heart telling me to hold on to my love
But when you get close, I want you to know
I start to get weak and I can't let you go

[Chorus: All & Brian]
I'll never
I'll never find someone like you (no, I'll never)
I promise it's true, no, I'll never
(Promise I'll never, promise I'll never, baby)
I'll never find someone like you (ooh, baby)
'Cause I love the way that you are
And girl, I won't, no, I won't let you go
No one could ever do, love you like I love you

[Bridge: All, (Kevin), Howie & Brian]
Just your smile (that's all I need)
Tenderness
Girl, I won't let you down
Girl, I will never find no one that
Compares to you, oooh

[Chorus: All & Brian]
I'll never (oh!)
I'll never find someone like you
(I'll never find someone like you, baby)
I promise it's true (there's nobody like you baby)
I'll never find someone like you (no, no, nobody)
'Cause I love the way that you are
(The way that you are)
And girl I won't, I won't let you go
'Cause no one could ever do and I promise to honor you
I'll never (no way)
I'll never find someone like you
I'll never find someone like you (girl, you're the only one)
I promise it's true
No, I'll never find someone like you (nobody)
'Cause I love the way that you are
(The way that you are)
And girl I won't, I won't let you go
'Cause no one could ever do

[Outro: All]
I'll never find someone like you

To be happy
You are all I need to make me happy
'Cause every time you're near
All the tears inside are raindrops
All the sadness in my lifetime goes away
Just believe in me
All I need is someone who believes in me
You're the good luck charm
You're the reason for the rainbows
God knows I'd hate to see you go away
Baby don't leave me this way

All the clouds inside my garden roll away
Baby they roll away

If you stay
If you stay I'll do anything you want
(I'll do anything you want)

So much stack, I wanna thank your mama
And everybody know why
Too much that both hands can't grab
But best believe I'm gon' try
Got 5 percent on my window
No seeing into my ride
Don't think too hard, girl, let's go
Give me your thoughts while I drive
Come on, baby, tell me, baby, tell me right now
We can make that back seat to 'tel right now
Adjust the rear view, oh, that's the clear view
Girl, I hope you're ready, hope you're ready right now
And dance is a hobby, oh, good lordy
Nothing get the Porches, but she's a Bugatti
Break push start it, break push start it
Baby, don't hurt nobody

Girl I like that, crack in my mirror
Give me bad luck like that hourglass figure
Ringing my wing 'til that thing get bigger
Curve like a trigger, wanna cut you like a scissor
That's it, baby, nearer, I love your hind side
From the back, you're a winner
Thick skirts, thick, get it feda prime dinner
Get it, twerk it, shake it 'til my knee cap shiver, yeah
Don't I like what's below that spine?
Both cheeks shaking at the same damn time
Shorty be my lady, can't replace that wine
Presidential status on my Rollie face shine
See, when that jiggle it's official, call it 808
Some toilet tissue, you know the shit, let that marinade
Like something, bitch, you wanna yum-bum celebrate
You know it's real when I say—

[Chorus: August Alsina]
Baby, pump your breaks

[Intro: AJ]
Hey, hey, oh yes
Baby, yeah

[Verse 1: AJ]
Something about the way you moved
That caught my eye
I really did have to try it, yes
I can't deny it
The way your body swayed
As I watched you from behind
That got me so excited
How could I fight it
Baby let me be the one to hold you
To give you the things I know you need
You know that we could wait another lifetime
And we can never find a love just like this

[Chorus: All & AJ]
If you lay down, lay down beside me
You can get all inside me
And I can get all inside you too
If you lay down, lay down beside me
You can wake up beside me, forever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever, baby

[Verse 2: AJ]
Let's take this chance
To get to know each other better
Baby we will discover
That we can be more than lovers
I'll give you what you need
Just come to me and get it
Baby you won't regret it
No, no, no baby
Baby move a little closer, yeah
I wanna feel your body next to mine
And before this night is over
You will know what it means
To make love until you scream

[Chorus: All & AJ]
If you lay down, lay down beside me
You can get all inside me
And I can get all inside you too
If you lay down, lay down beside me
You can wake up beside me, forever
Forever and ever

Tonight, (tonight) we'll find
Find just what, what we've been looking for
Good, good loving and a whole lot more
So hold on, hold on real tight
Hold me and don't you let go
Not till I tell you to, yeah

[Chorus: All & AJ]
If you lay down, lay down beside me
You can get all inside me
And I can get all inside you too
If you lay down, lay down beside me
You can wake up beside me
You can wake up beside me
Forever and ever
If you lay down, lay down beside me
You can get all inside me
And I can get all inside you too
Let me inside you
If you lay down, lay down beside me
You can wake up beside me
Forever and ever

[Verse 1]
Oh if someone writes a song with a simple rhyme
Just a song where is feeling show
And if someone feels the same about the simple song
Oh sometimes you can hear them sing
Music gives you happiness or sadness
But it also, it also heals your soul

[Chorus]
Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music give you the power to move any mountain

[Verse 2]
Oh if someone plays piano with some simple chords
So melodic and endearing too
And oh if someone plays guitar with the old piano
And maybe you can hear them sing
Music gives you happiness or sadness
But it also heals your soul

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
Let the music heal you soul
Let the music take control
Let the music heal you soul
Oh, oh yes

[Outro]
Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control

When I'm down on my luck
And I'm searching for my soul
When I'm feeling too much
And I start to lose control
When I'm down so low
That even enemies don't wanna know
You still care for me
Say a prayer for me, and I know

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
Oooh, I like you hanging around
Because you lift me up when I am upside down
Oooh, you are my favorite sound
Because you're always down for...

[Chorus: All, (Nick)]
Lifting me up
Like an angel when I hit the ground
Feel your arms all around me
When I'm feeling down
Lift me up
Like an angel when I hit my low
When your arms are around me
I don't wanna let you go
(Let you go)

[Verse 2: AJ]
When I'm lost along the way
And I can't face another day
And if I stumble on the road
And if I can't carry the load
And if I lose my faith, and kindness, and generosity
Would you hold my hand?
Say you understand my pain

[Pre-Chorus: AJ]
Oooh, I like you hanging around
Because you lift me up when I am upside down
Oooh, you are my favorite sound
Because you're always down for...

[Chorus: All]
Lifting me up
Like an angel when I hit the ground
Feel your arms all around me
When I'm feeling down
Lift me up
Like an angel when I hit my low
When your arms are around me
I don't wanna let you go

[Bridge: Howie, Nick]
It's been a long hard road
And it's only just begun, my friend
And this I know
You helped me carry the load
Because you're always down for...

[Chorus: All]
Lifting me up
Like an angel when I hit the ground
Feel your arms all around me
When I'm feeling down
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low
Well, you're always around
You're my favorite sound
Lifting me up
Like an angel when I hit the ground
Feel your arms all around me
When I'm feeling down
Lift me up
Like an angel when I hit my low
When your arms are around me
I don't wanna let you go

[Outro: Nick, AJ]
I don't want to let you go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're my favorite sound
Lift me up now
You lift me up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Lift me up now
Yeah, you're always around
You're my favorite sound
Lift me up

[Intro: AJ]
Hey-yeah, oh-mmh, oh-mmh
Yeah-yeah, ooh

[Verse 1: Brian]
Once there was a time love was just a myth
It just wasn't for real, it didn't exist
'Til the day you came into my life
You forced me to think twice
I didn't have too much, no I wasn't rich
You gave me belief someday I'd be more than this
That's why until this day I'm still your man
'Cause you made me understand that...

[Chorus: All & Nick]
Love is
Kisses in a beanbag chair
The two of us but no one there
Love is
The moment that I climb the stairs
To hold you in my arms after we make love
Love is
Waking up to see your face
While kissing in the morning rain (morning rain)
Love is
The only thing that keeps me sane
At the end of the day is that I've got you

[Verse 2: Nick & AJ]
You're my secret place where I can be myself
You connect with me like nobody else
Even though our circumstances changed
Our love still remains (remains)
Meet me on the ground, still you help me fly
You taught me to be patient, I thought you to rely
So no matter what tomorrow brings
We got the simple things (no-oh-oh!) 'cause...

[Chorus: All, Nick & AJ]
Love is
Kisses in a beanbag chair (beanbag chair)
The two of us but no one there (no one there)
Love is
The moment that I climb the stairs (oh)
To hold you in my arms after we make love
Love is (love is)
Waking up to see your face (oh-oh)
While kissing in the morning rain (morning rain)
Love is
The only thing that keeps me sane (oh)
At the end of the day is that I've got you

[Bridge: All, Howie, (Kevin) & AJ]
Love is
A Sunday morning with the blanket
Wrapped around your waist
Love is
The way your lips seem to curve
When you say my name (say my name oh-oh)
(Say my name)
Love is
And when I'm stressing
Like the world's turning upside down
Girl it all makes sense when you're around, oh!

[Chorus: All, AJ, (Nick) & Brian]
Love is (love is)
Kisses in a beanbag chair (yeah!)
The two of us but no one there (making love)
Love is
The moment that I climb the stairs
To hold you in my arms after we make love
Love is (yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Waking up to see your face
While kissing in the morning rain
Love is (love is)
The only thing that keeps me sane (I'm gonna keep you baby)
At the end of the day is that I've got you
Love is (love is)
Kisses in a beanbag chair (bag chair)
The two of us but no one there (no one there)
Love is
The moment that I climb the stairs (the stairs)
To hold you in my arms after we make love (we make love)
Love is
Waking up to see your face (I've got you baby)
While kissing in the morning rain
Love is (baby)
The only thing that keeps me sane
At the end of the day is that I've got you (I've got you)
Love is

[Outro: Brian & AJ]
Waking up to see your face (I've got you)
While kissing in the morning rain
At the end of the day is that I've got you

[Verse 1: Nick]
You make me say it to you
25 times a day
You make me feel
You don't believe the words I say
What is a man to do
To prove his love for you?
You make me feel like
I'm just giving free love away

[Pre-Chorus 1: AJ]
I can send flowers tomorrow
But it doesn't mean a thing
If your heart rejects
The message from mine
It's a waste of time

[Chorus: Howie with All, AJ & Howie]
Baby love (oh-oh!) knows I love you (mmh-yeah)
Baby love knows the truth (baby love knows)
Baby love (love) knows the feeling that is in here
Resting in my heart
From the very start
I loved you, hmm-mm
Resting in my heart
From the very start
I loved you (yeah-yeah)

[Verse 2: Brian]
I look at you and know
I never loved anyone more
You make me feel like
A child in a candy store
What can I do to prove
That you're a dream come true?
And in this dream there's a pulse
From my heart to yours

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick]
I can send daisies daily
But it never would penetrate
If your heart rejects
The best from mine
It's a waste of time

[Chorus: All with Brian, Brian]
Baby love knows I love you (I really do baby)
Baby love (baby love knows) knows the truth
(Baby knows the truth, yeah!)
Baby love (baby love knows) knows
The feeling that is in here
Resting in my heart
From the very start
I loved you, I really do baby!
Resting in my heart
From the very start
I loved you

[Bridge: Nick]
Baby I'm looking for Cupid
Can I tie him in a ball and chain
To see if he can say to you
The words that make me feel
My love is real, oh-oh-oh!

[Chorus: All, Nick & AJ]
Baby love (that's right) knows I love you
(You know I love you baby girl)
Baby love knows the truth (knows the truth)
(I gotta know the truth)
Baby love (love, you know I love you) knows
The feeling that is in here
Resting in my heart (in my heart)
From the very start
I loved you, yeah-eh, yeah
Resting in my heart
From the very start
I love you, yeah, eh-eh!

[Chorus: Brian & Howie]
I love how loving you makes me feel
And I love how loving you feels so real
Through the good, through the bad
When I'm happy or sad
I'd rather be loving you
Than anything else in the world (oh-whoa)
Loving you than anything else

[Verse 1: Brian]
All my life I dreamed of a princess
All dressed in white
Standing there to be my bride
And then there's you, a sending from heaven
Right before my eyes
Letting me know that there's a God somewhere
And oh, many people
Think they found love in the world
But this kind of love isn't found
It finds you, it takes you

[Chorus: All & Brian]
I love how loving you makes me feel (oh yeah)
And I love how loving you feels so real (so real baby)
Through the good, through the bad
When I'm happy or sad
I'd rather be loving you
Than anything else in the world (oh-oh)
Loving you than anything else in the world (in the world)

[Verse 2: AJ]
All my life I've wondered if I hear
All the bells and whistles
If the one should come my way
And then there's you
Like the wind that makes the Earth shake
Making me a believer
There must be a God somewhere
And oh, many people
Think they found love in the world
But this kind of love isn't found
It finds you, it takes you

[Bridge: AJ & All]
This kind of love
Doesn't come from just a touch
Nor does it comes
From anything you can't pay for
It's so pure
If we just let love be love
I wouldn't trade for all in the world

[Chorus: All, Brian & AJ]
(Because) I love (I love)
How loving you makes me feel (me feel yeah)
And I love how loving you feels so real
(How it feels so real)
Through the good (through the good)
Through the bad (bad, through the bad)
When I'm happy or sad (oh baby)
I'd rather be loving you
Than anything else (oh-oh-oh-oh!)
I love how loving you (oh-whoa!)
Makes me feel (makes me feel)
(It makes me feel baby)
And I love how loving you feels so real
(It's feel so real to love)
Through the good, through the bad (good and the bad)
When I'm happy or sad
I'd rather be loving you (I'd rather be loving you baby)
Than anything else in the world (I'd rather be loving you)
I'd rather be loving you
Than anything else in the world (loving you)
I'd rather be loving you
Than anything else in the world (in the world)
(Anything else in the world)

[Verse 1: Howie & Brian]
Memories
The love I left behind
I still think about it all the time
Nothing stays the same
Maybe I'm to blame
Oh I, I'd do it all again
Through these eyes
I've seen a thousand lies
And it's taken years to realize
That nothing stays the same
And no one is to blame
But I, I'd do it all again

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Does it really matter if you got it right?
Does it really matter who was wrong or right? (yeah)
All I know, yes I know
That I can make it through
What about you?

[Interlude: Nick & All]
Oooh my my
But ain't no way it's gonna change me
(Oh you wanna know)
Oh-oh, 'cause all the fear I've left behind
(Where you gonna go?)
Yeah yeah, and only time will tell you
What is meant to be

[Verse 2: AJ]
There's a place I can't let go
Holding on the dreams I used to know
I wish it was the same
I guess no one's to blame
But I, I'd do it all again, yeah yeah!

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Does it really matter if you got it right?
(Does it really matter?)
Does it really matter who was wrong or right?
(Who was wrong or right yeah)
Looking at my life today and I'm alright (I'm alright)
Yes I'm okay (I'm okay)
Now I see the world in a better way
(So much better now)
And I know yes I know that I can make it through (yeah)

[Bridge: Kevin, AJ & Howie]
Memories
The love I left behind
I wish it was the same
I guess no one's to blame
No no, nothing stays the same
And everything must change
Oh I, I'd do it all again

[Break: All, Howie & AJ]
Again, again, again
(Oooh again)
Again, again, again (no-no)

[Outro: Howie]
Again...

[Chorus: All]
Oh baby, I'm missing you
We used to love so strong
Tell me, where did we go wrong?
Oh baby, I'm missing you
They say I'll learn to forget
But it sure ain't happened yet

[Verse 1: AJ & Nick]
Been checking all the places
Where we used to go (used to go)
Been looking for your face inside the crowd
I've been talking to the people that we used to know
But nobody wants to say, where you hang out
And when I call your phone
Seems like your never, ever home
And you don't return my calls (return my calls)
It tears me apart (it tears me apart)
It's breaking up my heart (it's breaking up my heart)

[Chorus: All]
Oh baby, I'm missing you
We used to love so strong
Tell me, where did we go wrong?
Oh baby, I'm missing you
They say I'll learn to forget
But it sure ain't happened yet

[Verse 2: AJ & Brian]
I still have your pictures
Hung around my room (around my room)
They're the only thing that's left of you and me
Girl, what can I do to make you come back soon
And make it just the way it used to be?
Oh, is there someone new?
Could never go on without you
Girl I don't wanna think about it (think about it)
I can't sleep at night (can't sleep at night)
No, this can't be right (this can't be right)
Come back into my life (come back, baby come back)

[Chorus: All]
Oh baby, I'm missing you
We used to love so strong
Tell me where did we go wrong
Oh baby, I'm missing you
They say I'll learn to forget
But it sure ain't happened yet

[Bridge: Brian]
I know there's a chance for you and I
And I believe there's no way our love could die
So no matter how long it takes, I'll wait for you
And whatever it takes I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there

[Chorus: All]
Oh baby, I'm missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
We used to love so strong
Tell me, where did we go wrong?
Oh baby, I'm missing you
They say I'll learn to forget
But it sure ain't happened yet

[Verse 1: AJ & Nick]
When I step into the club
Everybody shouts hooray (a)
Walking down the street
They're throwing me my own parade
And when I close my eyes
I see everyone looking at me
Don't ask me why, never have to try, so

[Chorus: All]
Let me introduce you
To the coolest guy I know
You'll go (hello hello)
I'm unstoppable (hello hello)
So damn lovable
Even if you think you'll find someone
He'll never be just like me
Hello, hello, I am Mr. A

[Verse 2: Nick & AJ]
They would think that you're insane
Not to wanna know my name
After looking in my eyes
You will never be the same, no
What exactly do you think
You'll find on the other side?
So go ahead and try
'Cause I am that guy, so

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Let me introduce you
To the coolest guy I know (that's me, baby)
You'll go (hello hello)
I'm unstoppable, I'm unstoppable (hello hello)
So damn lovable (so damn lovable)
Even if you think you'll find someone
He'll never be just like me
Hello, hello, I am Mr. A

[Bridge: AJ, Brian & All]
I'm everything, you can't stop me
I look so good, I look so fine
I know you would, you'd cross this line
I am Mr. A, I am Mr. A

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Let me introduce you
To the coolest guy I know
You'll go (hello hello)
I'm unstoppable, I'm unstoppable (hello hello)
So damn lovable (so damn lovable)
Even if you think you'll find someone
He'll never be just like me
Hello, hello, I am Mr. A

[Outro: Nick]
I look so good, I look so fine
I know you would, you'd cross this line

[Intro: Howie]
You know, sometimes being on the road is rough
Especially loneliness

[Verse 1: Howie]
Girl I miss you and it's only been one day
Since I went away and already I say
I long to kiss you and hold you in my arms
The nights are much too long when you're gone
Baby, that's why

[Chorus: All & (Howie)]
Wherever I go
Girl, my heart stays with you
My heart stays with you
After every show
I want to rush over to you
(Over to you)
My heart stays with you

[Verse 2: Howie]
Trust me, when we are apart
I won't break your heart
Wherever you are, I know you feel me
Baby, cause I can feel you too
No matter what you do
I think of you

[Chorus: All & (Howie)]
Wherever I go
Girl, my heart stays with you
(Everywhere I go)
My heart stays with you
After every show
I want to rush over to you
(I wanna rush to you)
My heart stays with you

[Bridge: All, Howie, AJ]
Baby, yeah
When I'm leaving town
Girl it hurts me too, but I've got a job to do
Baby, yeah, I'll be back around
To feel your sweet face, your dear embrace
No one can take your place
I want you to know

[Interlude: Howie & AJ]
Wherever I go, wherever I go
Oh baby, I'll be rushing over to you
Wherever I go

[Chorus: All, (Howie), AJ]
Wherever I go
Girl, my heart stays with you
My heart stays with you
(My heart stays with you)
After every show (wherever I go)
I want to rush over to you
My heart stays with you
Wherever I go
Girl, my heart stays with you
(Wherever I go)
My heart stays with you
(Girl, my heart stays with you)
After every show (wherever I go)
I want to rush over to you
My heart stays with you
(My heart stays with you)

[Outro: Howie & All]
Wherever I go
Where I stop the most
My heart stays with you
Whatever I do
I'm gonna rush over to you
My heart stays with you

[Intro: Brian]
Oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: AJ]
She stayed with her mom
But you got your own place
She made me wait too long
But you let me hit the second date, yeah
She's always asking me for mine
But girl you got your own
I'm always tryna' teach you things
But your tricks are full grown, mmmh oh!

[Pre-Chorus 1: All & AJ]
She didn't stick around
But now you hold me down
I've been there and I tell you now girl
She's my every don't
But your my every want
That's why she used to be...

[Chorus: All & AJ]
She used to be the one I'd fight for
But not no more
She used to be the one I would cry for
But not no more
'Cause girl now you're the one I would die for
And that's for sure
I thought I had everything
Still something was missing
But not no more (not no more)

[Verse 2: Nick]
When she'd work my last nerve
You made it all good
She wouldn't do the things I like
But I always know you would

[Pre-Chorus 2: All & Nick]
I couldn't let you go
Couldn't keep it on the low
'Cause I never had nothing like this before
I had to let you know
You're so incredible
That's why I'm telling you baby

[Chorus: All & Nick]
She used to be the one I'd fight for (oh-oh)
But not no more
She used to be the one I would cry for (cry for)
But not no more
'Cause girl now you're the one I would die for
And that's for sure
I thought I had everything
Still something was missing
But not no more (not no more)

[Bridge: AJ]
No more wondering just where we stand
No more feeling like I'm the other man
Girl I need to know if you're down to stay
No more should've, would've, could've been
'Cause I'm through with yesterday oh-oh!

[Chorus: All & AJ]
She used to be the one I'd fight for (whoo!)
But not no more
She used to be the one I would cry for (I would cry for)
But not no more (not no more baby!)
'Cause girl now you're the one I would die for
And that's for sure (for sure yeah)
I thought I had everything (thought I had everything)
Still something was missing
But not no more

[Outro: Howie, Nick & All]
Used to fight for her (no no no)
But not no more
Used to cry for her (no no no)
But not no more, ooh baby
Thought I'd die for her (no no no)
I was tripping but not no more
I thought I had everything (everything)
Still something was missing
But not no more
Used to fight for her (no no no)
But not no more
Used to cry for her (no no no)
But not no more
Thought I'd die for her (no no no)
But not no more

[Verse 1: AJ & Howie]
I see your shadow
Even when your not standing there
I feel you when I close my eyes
I've been through it all
And made it out alive
It's only just a matter of time
I won't be (hopeless)
I was so (devoted)
Pieces will come together
I was so (blinded)
My heart is flat (lining)

[Chorus: AJ, AJ & Howie, (Brian) & Nick]
And I promise you, baby
That I've tried
But I can't try no more
And I've cried
But I can't cry no more, oh yeah
And I've tried
But I can't try no more
And I've cried
But I can't cry no more
It's just so impossible going on without you
On without you, no I can't
It's impossible going on without you (going)
On without you, no I can't

[Verse 2: Nick & Howie]
Mmmmh, no!
I hear you walking through the halls
And I know you're not home
The thought of you is all that remains
Wondering if I call
Would you pick up the phone
And tell me that you're feeling the same?
There's nothing left (in me)
My day gets so (empty)
The pieces will come together
I tell myself (blindly)
If I'm wrong, (why me?)

[Chorus: Nick, AJ & Howie, (AJ) & Brian]
And I'm not giving up, baby
But I've tried
But I can't try no more (no more, baby)
And I've cried
But I can't cry no more (oh yeah)
And I've tried
But I can't try no more
And I've cried (oh-no)
But I can't cry no more (it's impossible!)
It's just so impossible going on without you
On without you, no I can't
It's impossible going on without you (going)
On without you, no I can't
It's just so impossible...

[Bridge: Brian & AJ]
I've got an empty bed on my right side
I'm missing you now for a lifetime
I tell myself I'm fine
But I'm lying, I'm lying (yeah)

[Chorus: AJ, AJ & Howie, (Brian) & Nick]
And I promise you, baby
That I've tried
But I can't try no more
And I've cried
But I can't cry no more
No more (I'm trying, baby)
And I've tried, yeah-hey!
But I can't try no more
And I've cried
But I can't cry no more
It's just so impossible going on without you
On without you, no I can't
It's just so impossible going..
It's impossible going on without you (going)
On without you, no I can't

[Outro: Nick & Brian]
It's just so impossible going...
On without you, on without you, no I can't
It's just so impossible going...
It's impossible going on without you (going)
On without you, no I can't
It's just so impossible going...

[Intro: Brian & All]
You know I been trying to figure out
Just what's going on
Am I over her?
I been doing a lot of thinking lately
Am I over her?
And I'm really missing you

[Verse 1: Brian]
It's been 3 months, 3 hours, 3 days
Since the last time I seen your pretty face
My decision to bring this to an end
And I'm caught up in reminiscing
Having faithful visions of long walks, long talks
Play fights, late nights
It's been on my mind since Valentine's
Cause I had your heart and I let it slide

[Pre-Chorus: Howie & All]
I ask myself time and time again
Again, I'm trying to comprehend that
Unanswered questions still
Things to be are meant to end

[Chorus: All]
Am I over her? (am I over her?)
Am I over her?
Am I over her?
Tell me am I really over my, my love (am I over her?)
I can't think straight
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her
Am I really over my love?

[Verse 2: Nick]
I was going through some things that I couldn't explain
Now my situation's taking a big change
They say the grass is greener on the other side of town
Now I'm kinda wishing you would come back around
Is she sad or is she mad?
Does she have a new man, does she have it like that?
It's been so long, thought I would've moved on
Could've been strong and picked up the telephone

[Pre-Chorus: Howie & All]
I ask myself time and time again
Again, I'm trying to comprehend that
Unanswered questions still
Things to be are meant to end

[Chorus: All]
Am I over her? (am I over her?)
Am I over her? Am I over her?
Tell me am I really over my, my love (am I over her?)
I can't think straight
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her
Am I really over my love?

[Bridge: AJ & All]
It's water under the bridge
But I can't seem to forget
All the plans we made, all the time we spent
Makes me reminisce
I still see your face, all this love I can't replace
Am I over (am I over)
Am I over her? (her now)

[Chorus: All, (AJ) & Nick]
Am I over her?
Am I over her? (am I?)
Am I over her? (am I over?)
Tell me am I really over my my love (my love, my love)
I can't think straight (my love)
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her (never gonna be over her)
Am I really over my love? (never gonna be)

[Interlude: AJ & Nick]
No, am I over her? (am I over her?)
No, not over her, no
Oh, ho, ho, ho!
Am I over her?

[Chorus: All & (AJ)]
Am I over her? (over her?)
Am I over her? Am I over her?
Tell me am I really over my, my love (am I over her?)
I can't think straight (am I over her?)
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her (I'm not over her)
Am I really over my love?

[Outro: AJ]
I'm not over my, my, my love
I'm not over my, my, my love
I'm not over my, my, my love
I'm not over my, my, my love

[Verse 1: Nick & Brian]
Oooh, how many times am I gon' let you
Walk right past?
I swear sometimes I think I'm moving too fast
You never know if it's gonna last
But I guess that's what scares me sometimes
Oooh, I know it ain't right
But I don't wanna let me care
I wanna know love but I'm a little scared
You never know what you gon' get
And that is what scares me sometimes, times

[Chorus: All & Nick]
The next time love comes my way
I gonna let it happen, happen baby
If ever I make, made a mistake
I've been a rebel too long
A rebel too long, a rebel too long
(A rebel too long)

[Verse 2: AJ]
I don't hurt people
That don't hurt me back yeah
I turned to war
And I'm so tired of that
I'm letting now all my guards down
I'm done playing tough guy
For now, for now
Everybody deserves second chances
And that only flies in certain circumstances
Can't keep running away from these feelings
Everybody needs someone
Sometimes, sometimes

[Chorus: All & Nick]
The next time love comes my way
I gonna let it happen, happen baby
If ever I make, made a mistake
I've been a rebel too long
A rebel too long, a rebel too long
(A rebel too long)

[Bridge: Howie]
And before this moment fades away
I wanted you to know I've made mistakes
But even if there's no more words to say
I tried to be better without you

[Chorus: All & Nick]
The next time love comes my way (oh yeah)
I gonna let it happen, happen baby
If ever I make, made a mistake (mistake)
I've been a rebel too long
A rebel too long, a rebel too long (oh)
(A rebel too long)
The next time love comes my way (oh yeah)
I gonna let it happen, happen baby
If ever I make, made a mistake (mistake)
I've been a rebel too long
A rebel too long, a rebel too long (oh)
(A rebel too long)

[Verse 1: Howie]
So, staring at the wall
Feeling ten feet small
It's like the world is on your shoulders
Now, nothing's making sense
You just wanna quit
You run away, but you just don't know
How to feel, what is real
You're not alone

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Everybody falls, everybody cries
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes
You get up again, give it one more try
Everybody's got what it takes on the inside
Story of your life (story of your life)
It's the story of my life

[Verse 2: Nick]
Then, sometimes you got to crawl
Before you start to walk
I'll be there, I've had my rainy days
You try to keep up a smile
You go the extra mile
You run the race no matter where your place
You know which way to go
So, turn the page

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Everybody falls, everybody cries
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes
You get up again, give it one more try
Everybody's got what it takes on the inside
Story of your life (story of your life)
It's the story of my life

[Bridge: Brian]
It's hard to be strong
No right seems wrong
And nobody hears what you say
So, don't be afraid
Hold on to your faith
I swear to you there will be better days

[Interlude: Nick]
So, staring at the wall
Feeling ten feet small
It's like the world is on your shoulders

[Chorus: All, AJ & Nick]
Everybody falls, everybody cries
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes
You get up again, give it one more try
Everybody's got what it takes on the inside
Everybody falls (everybody falls)
Everybody cries (and everybody cries)
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes
You get up again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Give it one more try
Everybody's got what it takes on the inside
Story of your life (story of your life)
It's the story of my life

[Intro: All]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm dreaming

[Verse 1: AJ & Nick]
You had me thinking right from the start
That our feeling will never keep us apart
You had me thinking that I was the one
But I never knew it was only for fun

[Chorus: All]
Tell me that I'm dreaming
Say you're never leaving
Don't you wanna be with me
(Don't you wanna be with)
Tell me that I'm dreaming
Say you're never leaving
Your heart will be safe you see, oh

[Verse 2: Howie & Kevin]
Isn't it true that my love for you
Is here to stay, it'll never go away
Isn't it true that my love for you
Is here to stay baby
There will always be that day, yeah

[Chorus: All, AJ & Kevin]
Tell me that I'm dreaming
(Say you're never leaving me)
Say you're never leaving
Don't you wanna be with me
(Don't you wanna be with me)
Tell me that I'm dreaming
Say you're never leaving
Your heart will be safe you see, oh

[Bridge: AJ & Brian]
Oh how can I know that
Summer days are getting lonely
(Ah, aah, aaah)
Oh, how can I know that my
Love is getting stronger, stronger...

[Interlude: Kevin & Brian]
Girl, if you only knew (if you only knew)
Just how much I really love you
I think about you night and day
My love for you will always stay
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I never knew it was only for fun
You had me thinking that I was the one

[Chorus: All]
Tell me that I'm dreaming
Say you're never leaving
Don't you wanna be with me
(Don't you wanna be with)
Tell me that I'm dreaming
Say you're never leaving
Your heart will be safe you see, oh

[Outro: All]
Come on now
You and me girl we were meant to be
Together, forever in harmony
You and me girl we were meant to be
Together, forever in harmony
You and me girl we were meant to be
Together forever in harmony

[Intro: Nick]
Oh yeah, mmmh

[Verse 1: Nick, (Brian) & AJ]
She (she, she)
She like to model for me (me, me)
The way she wear it is dangerous
She walk around me like a predator
And I'm something to eat (eat, eat)
Nothing to her but a treat (treat, treat)
Something she play with and leave alone
And I can't help it but to let her use me

[Chorus: Nick]
Every little thing about her
Says she's trouble (trouble)
And every little thing she do
Just makes me want her more
More and more

[Verse 2: AJ, Nick & Brian]
She melts, melts herself all over me (me, me)
A sexy candle but so much hotter
Pain is just pleasure with the volume up
I want it louder, oh!
I'm spending all my money on her
No matter where I go, there she is
Half-naked waiting for me (waiting for me)
Waiting for me (waiting for me)

[Chorus: Nick]
Every little thing about her
Says she's trouble (trouble)
And every little thing she do
Just makes me want her more

[Interlude: AJ & Brian]
More and more (ooooh-ah!)
More and more (ooooh-ah!)
More and more (ooooh-ah!)
More and more and more, yeah
More and more (ooooh-ah!)

[Chorus: Nick, Brian, Nick & Brian]
Every little thing about her
Says she's trouble (trouble)
(Trouble, yeah)
And every little thing she do
Just makes me want her more (more, oh!)
Every little thing about her
Says she's trouble, yeah (trouble)
Oh, and every little thing she do
Just makes me want her more

[Outro: Howie & Brian, Brian & Howie]
More and more (ooooh-ah!)
More and more (ooooh-ah!)
More and more, more and more
More and more, more and more
More and more (ooooh-ah!)
More and more (ooooh-ah!)

[Verse 1]
I tried to pick the pieces up
And I can't think of starting over
We used to share the stars above
I don't wanna think it changed
And now I gotta move on
I've gotta catch up to the world
Even though I gave you my life
As wrong as it seems I know it's right
But is there a place that I can go away
To escape the love that I will forever know

[Chorus]
Where can we go from here
All I know is that I love you still
Sometimes we do things against our will
I know I cry lonely tears
Where can we go from here

[Verse 2]
Why, why do I cry inside
When love is gone away
And how,How can I carry on
When I know all the love is gone
Where can I go to get away
From the pain of loving you
Tell me where

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: AJ & Brian]
I know he's driving a fancy car
When you're with him, you're feeling like a star
But when I'm home alone I think only of you
So what do you know? How does it go?
So, how can he buy a love that's not for sale?
If you two were so in love I couldn't tell, baby
Girl, but when I'm home alone
I hear your heart, it spells
You gotta know, and how does it go?

[Chorus: All, Brian & AJ]
Who do you love? Who do you love?
Girl I know that you are torn between
What was and what could be
I wanna know, gotta know
Wanna know, gotta know
Who do you love? Who do you love?

[Verse 2: Brian & (AJ)]
So let's take some time out to find a way
Cuz there are just so many things I need to say
(So many things I need to say)
Cause when the lights are down and love is in the air
And I need to know, do you really care?
(Do you really care, baby?)

[Chorus]

[Bridge: AJ, Brian & All]
Girl I find just I can't leave you alone
Ain't nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong
I promise I will make it back home
And if you're ever in need
Put your full trust in me
And I will never leave you at home

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Nick]
When I first met you, my life turned a page
Chapter one was how true love was made
You taught me with your kiss
Things about romance I missed
You knew everything from A to Z
What pleases you and what pleases me
Girl, when you touched me
I began to understand
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Nick]
Oh, you
You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
I wanna read every word
So I know everything about you
Oh, you
You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
Girl, I just can't get enough of your love
I know, you wrote the book on love

[Interlude: Nick]
Oh Brian, help me sing

[Verse 2: Brian]
Each time I hold you I find something new
'Cause I know what I love about you
Girl, I discovered you bring out
The lover in me, yeah, yeah
You're like a fire that burns in my soul
Like a volcano I'm ready to blow
'Cause every time I look at you
I feel love I can't explain
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Brian]
Oh, you
You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
I wanna read every word
'Til I know everything about you
Oh, you
You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
Girl, I just can't get enough of you
Oh you wrote the book on love, on love

[Bridge: Brian]
I hear what your heart is saying to me (saying to me)
I see the picture so clearly
I'm thirsty for the knowledge true love brings
When you're near me
Yeah, yeah

[Reprise: Brian]
You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
Girl, I just can't get enough of you
Oh, you wrote the book
Oh, you
You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
And I wanna read every word
'cause you, Baby, you wrote the book

[Chorus: Brian]
Oh, you
You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
I wanna read every word
'Til I know everything about you
Oh, you
You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
Girl, I just can't get enough of you
Oh you wrote the book on love, on love

[Verse 1]
See the great white scar
Over Battery Park
Then a flare glides over
But I won't look at that scar
Oh, my nuclear baby
(We'll discover a star)
Oh, my idiot trance
All my idiot questions
(Like the stars in your eyes)
Let's face the music and dance

[Refrain]
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never say I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you

[Pre-Chorus]
All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now

[Chorus]
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
A new killer star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
The stars in your eyes
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go

[Verse 2]
See my life in a comic
Like the way they did the Bible
With the bubbles and action
The little details in color
First a horseback bomber
(We'll discover a star)
Just a small thin chance
Like seeing Jesus on Dateline
(Like the stars in your eyes)
Let's face the music and dance

[Refrain]
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you

[Pre-Chorus]
All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now

[Chorus]
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
A new killer star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
The stars in your eyes
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
Oooh oo
I got a better way
Ready, set, go

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Around a fire doing a thunder dance
You know what's a funny word? Underpants
Let's go to Syria and have a war
Stop fucking calling me Macklemore
That's not my name
Well, kind of, it's kind of my name (Little bit louder)
Yeah, so

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I sold the mansion and moved in my mom's attic (Yeah)
Life was a blockbuster but now it's a cult classic (Yup)
Smoke 'til I'm asthmatic, embracing my bad habits
Travelling down the hole, I'm chasing a fast rabbit (Fall)
Well that's acid, still weird from my last tablet
I love like a folk singer, but fuck like a crack addict
Practicing black magic and watching some car crashes
Snapchattin' a dick pic, sent it to Bob Saget (I'm a faggot)
Word (Word,) the aliens have landed (Aliens have landed)
I don't panic in my fortress made of granite (Woo!)
Take life for granted, probably won't when it end
Thank God I'm sober again

[Chorus: Treejay]
Run away
Run away
Run, run, run away
Oh my...

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Who let the dogs out?
Stop what you're doing and put 'em back in the doghouse
I was a human, I'm feeling like I'm a god now (Aaah)
But most of the time I don't even know what I'm talking 'bout
Bitch, I'm a walking, talking crocodile (What?)
Take a picture with my mom and crop her out
Go to her house, coked up, and lock her out
(I was high man, I was just fuckin' high man, I don't know) (Sorry about that) Yeah
I'm possibly a phony, don't believe me
You can't tell that I'm so lonely from the TV (Yah)
I hate myself 'cause I'm a white rapper (Corny)
I hate white rappers (Corny,) but an industry of kike masters made me rich (I'll take it)
Short shorts and high socks
I feel like chalk without a sidewalk
Back in the 'Burgh I'ma eat at my favorite Thai spot (Pusadee's, what up?)
And smile as the hungry eyes watch

[Chorus: Treejay & Mac Miller]
Run away
Run away
Run, run, run away (Yo, shoutout that Gangster Jeff outro)
Oh my...

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Still having sex with blind people (Feel good)
They say my pussy smell like pine needles (As it should)
Bust a nut in the poultry section at Giant Eagle
Stare a chicken in the face like, "Bitch, I'ma eat you" (Wassup?!)
Yeah, I'm all kinds of evil
Eating mushrooms out in London tryna find the Beatles (Fuck's John Lennon at?)
I'm still sick of people
Go back to St. Bede, chief and kick it with Mr. Roedel
(That was my English teacher) Retina display on my Macintosh
That's high definition jacking off
Out in LA tryna get me an acting job
'Cause my idol David Hasselhoff (That's the boss)

[Interlude: Mac Miller]
Man, Germans love David Hasselhoff
I hear they like David Hasselhoff more than they like Jews
And they love Jews out there

[Outro: Treejay]
Run away, catch a plane
On my dick, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Run away, run away, run away
Ooh, ooh
Girl, run away
Yeah, yeah, ha
You better run away

[Verse 1]
Hey, wake up, your eyes weren't open wide
For the last couple of miles you've been swerving from side to side
You're going to make me spill my beer
If you don't learn how to steer

[Chorus]
Passenger side, passenger side
I don't like riding on the passenger side

[Verse 2]
Roll another number for the road
You're the only sober person I know
Won't you let me make you a deal
Just get behind the wheel

[Chorus]

Should've been the driver, could've been the one
I should've been your lover, but I hadn't seen

[Verse 3]
Can you take me to the store, then the bank?
I've got five dollars we can put in the tank
I've got a court date coming this June
I'll be driving soon

[Chorus]

[Intro: Mike Posner] 

[x3]
Uh

[Hook:The Knocks']
Passed out waiting for your rescue
Last night had me in the best mood
You say we had a conversation
All I remember is

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
My friends took my cell phone
And drunk dialed Miley Cyrus
I don't know what they said to her
She's rich, she'll get over it
Hello strange lady
I'm not sure if we banged
You look fine in the sunlight
Please don't ask me your name
All I remember is

[Hook: The Knocks'] 

[x2]

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
You said you were an actress
But I didn't believe you
I guess you need a practice
Cause I didn't believe you
Hello strange lady
I don't know if we banged
You look fine in the sunlight
Just please don't ask me your name
All I remember is

[Hook (x2)]

[Bridge: Mike Posner] 

[x3]
Red, red cups

All I remember is

[Hook: Mike Posner & The Knock's]
Passed out waiting for your rescue
Last night had me in the best mood
You say we had a conversation
But all I remember is
Dash 7 in the air
Propped to the sun alone
Jets hum

I wish that I was still there
Props, not a jet, alone
Where the sun doesn't come down

Because I've found the way those engines sound
Will make you kiss the ground
When you touch down

Dash 7 pointed down
The captain's announcement
Doesn't make a sound

Because I've found the way those engines sound
Will make you kiss the ground
I found the way those engines sound
Will make you kiss the ground
When you touch down
You've got a blue-eyed soul
And if you don't let it show
It'll leave you, you won't even know
Without your blue-eyed soul
Can you keep it simple? Can you let the snare crack?
Can you let it move without holding back?
Are you afraid to let it go
Without your blue-eyed soul?

You're gonna lose control
You're gonna lose control
Without your blue-eyed soul
Without your blue-eyed soul
Without your blue-eyed soul
You came to meet me out on the line
You couldn't believe I was feeling fine
When I really needed you, you were gone
So long

We were too far apart
Right from the start
I couldn't be any closer to you now

Is it really punk rock, like the party line?
Do you have to think about that?
Can I give you some time?
'Cause when I really needed you, you were gone
So long

We were too far apart
Right from the start
I couldn't be any closer to you now

Too far apart
Right from the start
And I couldn't be any closer to you now

[Verse 1]
My momma wouldn't say you were a nice guy
But you're under 40 and you have a job
My momma wouldn't say you was a good boy
But you're making money and you're working hard, so

[Chorus]
I'm gonna take you on
I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

[Verse 2]
My momma, she would say your hair was too long
But your hair's exactly what I like the best
And my momma, she would say you was a hoodlum
But I'd done known a hoodlum and you don't pass the test

[Chorus]

Oh Baby, you're standing so close, I can't back down
You're smiling and I know I'm over and done now
I am done now

[Verse 3]
My momma would say that it was wrong to see you
I lied just to meet you, I lied to get in
My momma, she would say that I deceived you
But that's the only way I knew how to begin

So maybe you've got your own problems, who doesn't?
I'm crazy, you're addicted, we are all of a sudden

[Verse 4]
My momma, she would love you like I love you
If she ever met you, if she ever knew
My momma, she would fall right on top of you
If she ever saw you, she'd be smitten too

I'll never take you home
I want you all for my own
Don't let my momma hear your pretty song
I'm gonna take you on
I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm standing here freezing
Inside your golden garden
I got my ladder leaned
Up against your wall
Tonight's the night we planned
To run away together
Come on Dolly Mae, there's no time to stall
But now you're telling me...

[Chorus]
I think we better wait till tomorrow
Yeah, yeah, hey
(I think we better wait till tomorrow)
Girl, what you're talking 'bout?
(I think we better wait till tomorrow)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Gotta make sure it's right
So until tomorrow, goodnight
Oh, what a drag

[Verse 2]
Oh, Dolly Mae, how can you
Hang me up this way?
On the phone you said you wanted
To run off with me today
Now I'm standing here
Like some turned-down serenading fool
Hearing strange words stutter
From the mixed-up mind of you
And you keep telling me, that, uh...

[Chorus]
I think we better wait till tomorrow
What you're talking 'bout?
(I think we better wait till tomorrow)
No, can't wait that long
(I think we better wait 'til tomorrow)
Oh, no
Gotta make sure it's right
Until tomorrow, goodnight, oh no
See if I can talk to this girl a little bit here

[Verse 3]
Oh, Dolly Mae girl, you must be insane
So unsure of yourself leaning
From your unsure window pane
Do I see a silhouette of somebody
Pointing something from a tree?
Click, bang!
What a hang
Your daddy just shot poor me
And I hear you say, as I fade away...

[Chorus]
We don't have to wait till tomorrow, hey!
We don't have to wait till tomorrow
What'd you say?
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
It must not have been right
So forever, goodnight
Listen at you

[Outro]
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Ah, do I have to wait? Don't have to wait
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
It's a drag on my part
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Don't have to wait, uh, hmm, oh no
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Don't have to wait, don't have to wait, yeah
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Don't have to wait, don't have to wait
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Oh no, I won't be around tomorrow, yeah!
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Don't have to wait
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Bye, bye bye!
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Oh, what a mix up
Crazy, ah!
We don't have to wait till tomorrow

[Verse]
She was marrying a matador and he was with the weather girl
A very clever girl who stood out amongst several ones
A terrible dilemma and forever he'll regret the day
He didn't make the rescue from the bullring
Sulking won't get you nowhere, son
There's blood on your chin where you've bitten your tongue
Smitten, but might not be smitten for long
If you're still sitting, she'll soon be smitten and gone

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Too hot to handle, Too dope to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Your seats, we going to Cloud 9 and we
Coming back in a week, and the weak good
Riddance, only the strong permitted to ride
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a
Kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters I tell em hi, enemies I don't tell em shit
But booya click booya click, click

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Ooh, ya'll done stumbled on a fortune
The rebirth of hip hop since they got abortions
And I rock like Mt. Rushmore, grab your thesaurus
So you can find a synonym of a nigga that been gem
Diamond in the rough
Sheriffs wanna see me cuffed like the links of a button up
Book em down! Fuck is up?
Mind of a Vietnam Vet when a nigga rhyme
A nigga shine, like I'm seeing signs in a different light
I'm on my grind, see it right? Real starving artist
Finna blow like a Mario Game cartridge, standing on my own two
Me and Dave like Big and Puff before shiny suits
Welcome to the Compton Zoo, lying with a lion on Rosecrans Avenue
A tiger on Central
Arms so soar beating up these instrumentals Sounwave give me
More, after that find a morgue with a mortice, because we..

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Too hot to handle, Too dope to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Your seats, we going to Cloud 9 and we
Coming back in a week, and the weak good
Riddance, only the strong permitted to ride
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a
Kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters I tell em hi, enemies I don't tell em shit
But booya click booya click, click

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Ooh, and I'm back up on my bullshit, shooting to the top with a hollow
Tip full clip
Analogy is like a pit bull on the pulpit, I drool I don't really
Spit, mad dog in this bitch, foaming at the mouth, is you a man or a mouse?
Sipping Mickey's, while you looking like Mickey trapping it out
That's not a diss, that's really a dope line, and in order to see my vision you
Probably would go blind
I'm chilling with a blonde, she dumb as fuck, but she can suck a bowling ball
Through a straw, that make you tell your mom
I'm just a little nigga trying to make my city proud, I used to watch Doug and wear
My cousins hand-me-downs
Now I'm grown up, unemployed, sipping Henny, pissing throuh a cup, and still get
The job done, 2DopeBoyz I said what up, tell your listeners to have some frost
Bitten gloves cause

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Too hot to handle, Too dope to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Your seats, we going to Cloud 9 and we
Coming back in a week, and the weak good
Riddance, only the strong permitted to ride
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a
Kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters I tell em hi, enemies I don't tell em shit
But booya click booya click, click
Theologians don't know nothing
About my soul
About my soul

I'm an ocean
And this emotion
Slow motion, slow motion

Illiterati lumen fidei
God is with us everyday
That illiterate light
Is with us every night

Theologians they don't know nothing
About my soul
Oh they don't know

They thin my heart with little things
And my life with change
Oh in so many ways
I find more missing every day
Theologians

I'm going away
Where you will look for me
Where I'm going you cannot come
No one's ever gonna take my life from me
I lay it down
A ghost is born
A ghost is born
A ghost is born

I am a notion
I am all emotion
I am a cherry ghost
Cherry ghost

Hey I'm a cherry ghost
A cherry ghost

25th., September 1967

Dear Sandra,

When I called in this, my manager's office, a few moments ago I was handed my very first American fan letter - and it was from you. I was so pleased that I had to sit down and type an immediate reply, even though Ken is shouting at me to get on with a script he badly needs. That can wiat (wi-at? That's a new English word which means wait).

I've been waiting for some reaction to the album from American listeners. There were reviews in Billboard and Cash Box, but they were by professional critics and they rarely reflect the opinions of the public. The critics were very flattering however. They even liked the single "Love You Till Tuesday". I've got a copy of the American album and they've printed the picture a little yellow. I'm really not that blond. I think the picture on the back is more 'me'. Hope you like those enclosed.

In answer to your questions, my real name is David Jones and I don't have to tell you why I changed it. "Nobody's going to make a monkey out of you" said my manager. My birthday is January 8th and I guess I'm 5'10". There is a Fan Club here in England, but if things go well in the States then we'll have one there I suppose. It's a little early to even think about it.

I hope one day to get to America. My manager tells me lots about it as he has been there many times with other acts he manages. I was watching an old film on TV the other night called "No Down Payment" a great film, but rather depressing if it is a true reflection of The American Way Of Life. However, shortly after that they showed a documentary about Robert Frost the American poet, filmed mainly at his home in Vermont, and that evened the score. I am sure that that is nearer the real America. I made my first movie last week. Just a fifteen minutes short, but it gave me some good experience for a full length deal I have starting in January.

Thankyou for being so kind as to write to me and do please write again and let me know some more about yourself.

Yours sincerely,

David Bowie
I'm up here to celebrate the life of a young man, who's path I crossed I say about a little over a year ago and the story Doc told was 99.9 percent accurate. I'm a tell you what happened from where he left off. I get a call. Doc say "you gotta meet my cousin, he on his way up to see you." I said "alright man, tell him to meet me over here at 

[?]. I was at 

[?], I think 

[?]'s mall, 

[?] plaze or something. So me, Doe, Frank White. And Frank said to me "alright, what we need to do to get out of Montgomery, Alabama. I say "well a...if you look around man you'll see that you already done made it out of Montgomery, Alabama. We ain't 

[?] enough man. You guys done did a pretty good job so far, already

We sat here man, you know, we sat here for about an hour. Then we went out to the truck man, Doe playing some unreleased music so. I sat there and I said, "so y'all really got something huh?" From that day forward, I admire Doe because as a young man, the age that he was he always presented himself to be more mature. It’s very rare that you find somebody at the age of 20, 21 and sit them down, in front of you know, someone I guess, they aspire to be like. And they are as composed, they're poised and posture like and looking, eye with this person, like you know, I got the same ability and the same talent, and the same potential to be on the level that you are right now. It's very rare that you find that somebody the age of 20, 21 and you could walk them into a room with a Nelly, or you could walk them into a room with a Timbaland or Jay Z, and they not lose their cool, they’re composed, postured, with the morals, the standards, and the principles that were instilled in him from his family: his mom, his dad, grand-mama, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles. He walked like these people are watching him all the time. You know what I'm saying? Like he had people to answer to, so he can't carry himself nothing less than. Know what I'm saying? And I saw that in him day one, off the top, and that is what drew me to him even more so beyond the music

Over here at Hustle Gang, we have a host of artists. All of them know that I tell them ‘listen, your talent is only going to get you so far’. It’s the things that you learn, the things that you are able to do outside of the booth, is what's going to separate you from the rest. I said the same thing to Glen. He never left the studio… he said ‘I’d rather be here than the club, simply because I know this is going to pay off.' Remarks like that man, it was extremely rare to hear a man, at a young age, speak in that manner. Over here man, a lot of people look at us like a record company. A lot of people look at us like a entertainment house. To be honest with you, this is a family, this is a family business. I will never let his life be lived in vain. All of my resources, all of my relationships, all of my efforts, all of my energy will be put forth to make sure that his dream lives on. And I speak on behalf of myself, I speak on behalf of the entire Grand Hustle, Hustle Gang family. I speak on behalf of Blueprint. I speak on behalf of anybody who got any love for me. Show some love for Doe B. Love

[Verse : kaythenum]
Picking up words i might be a nerd/ perverse suffering riding on a surf/ thirst of blood
In a fucking church And fuck Bruno Mars this is Earth

[Verse 1]
Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you'll walk out through your door I'll wave my flag and shout

[Chorus 1]
Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday

[Verse 2]
Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool

[Chorus 2]
Oh, beatiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday

[Verse 3]
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always watch you until my love runs dry

[Chorus 3]
Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's a flame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday

[Outro]
Well, I might stretch it till Wednesday

[Verse]
Go easy on me for the night has been long
I’m not quite as strong as you see me
I came here alone and I’ll leave on my own
The next stop is home so go easy on me

Oh, I don’t need your truth
Or a good talking-to from your mountain
No, I don’t know your name and I won’t take the blame
Don’t know what you need, so go easy on me

Go easy on me, for I mean you no harm
It’s possible charm is in order
But you make it so hard when you throw up your guard
I’m not here to spar so go easy on me

Oh, the clanging of swords
And the war of the words doesn’t move me
See, my heart barely works and it’s covered in dirt
It still kind of hurts, so go easy on me
Oh, I see in your eyes
You don’t realize what you’re doing
So, here’s some advice, never hurts to be nice
If you’re not going to be, then go easy on me
Go easy on me, go easy on me

[Verse 1]
I don't need no doctor
Because I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor
Because I know what's ailing me
I've been too long away from my baby, yeah
I'm coming down with a misery

[Chorus]
I don't need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)

[Verse 2]
No, no, no, I don't need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled, yeah
Only my baby's arms could ever
Could ever take away this chill

Now the doctor say I need rest
For I need is her tenderness
He put me on the critical list
When all I need is her sweet kiss
He gave me a medicated lotion
But it didn't soothe my emotion, yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro]
All I need is my baby, please!
Won't you please just come on home?
Come on home

[Verse 1]
She's a good girl, loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, crazy about Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too
Yeah, yeah
It's a long day living in Reseda
There's a freeway running through the yard
I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breaking her heart

[Chorus]
And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'

[Verse 2]
All the vampires walking through the valley
They move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts

[Chorus]
And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'

[Post-Chorus]
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin'

[Verse 3]
I want to glide down over Mulholland
I want to write her, her name in the sky
I want to free fall out into nothing
Oh, I'm gonna leave this, this world for a while

[Chorus]
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'

[Outro]
Free fallin', fallin'
Free fallin', fallin'
Free fallin', fallin'
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Six numbers, one more to dial
Before I'm before you
I tried to call
Been busy all night
Gave up waiting at daylight

[Pre-Chorus]
Excuse Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is that I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side

[Verse 2]
One of the many
One of the few
To stand back and wait for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Excuse Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is that I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me

[Chorus]
Oh, I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
Life as the man on the side

[Verse 3]
I fell in love with a dream that I built of you
Playing the part of the Queen
Taking my own advice, I'm giving up tonight
Good luck to you and the king

[Pre-Chorus]
Excuse Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is that I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me

[Chorus]
I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man
You know, life as the man
Living life as the man on the side

[Verse 1]
Just cast away
And I am lost at sea
Another lonely day
And no one here but me
More loneliness
Than any man could bear
Rescue me
Before I fall into despair

[Chorus]
I send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle

[Verse 2]
A year has passed since
I wrote my note
I should have known it
Right from the start
Only hope can
Keep me together
Love can mend your life but
Love can break your heart

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Walked out this morning
I don't believe what I saw
A hundred billion bottles
Washed up on the shore
It seems I'm not alone at
Being alone
A hundred million castaways
All looking for a home

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I wish that I was the weather
You'd bring me up in conversation forever
And when it rained, I'd be the talk of the day

Oh, sometimes I wish that I was a cold beer
I'd rest assured that you would hold me near
I'd be guaranteed to be just what you need

[Chorus]
And there could be no other way, because you're so, you're so lame
Your tired words are all, they're all the same
Yeah, I would walk and I'd surely walk away
If I wasn't such a sucker for you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I wish that I was a bong hit
You'd let me in and you would love every minute
And tell the room the things I did to you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I see your world with rosy colored glasses on
Want to right what I see wrong
I could never have that power over you

Someday, I'm got to pack up and leave this town
I'm got to get my own things going on
And when I do, I'll forget, I'll forget

[Outro]
I'll forget about how, how you're so, you're so lame
Your tired words are all, your tired words are all the same
And I would walk, you know I'd, I'd walk away
If I wasn't such a sucker for you
I wasn't such a sucker for you
I wasn't such a sucker for you

You'll be breathless when she calls your name
Oh, I'll bet that you can hear the rain

[Intro]
Yo, what's going on? This is Drake
And I'ma let you know what you about to witness
This right here is a Drake and DJ Smallz collaboration
So I'm from Canada, my man's from down South
Ya understand, the number one DJ in the South to be exact
You heard that in the VMAs, you heard that wherever he goes
My man Smalls is out there, down south
Same time, reppin' for Toronto, Canada
Ya know what I mean?
So this right here, listening to right now is the official Southern Smoke Special Edition
I call it the "Room For Improvement" mixtape, cause I'm not perfect
And I bet neither are you if you listening
So you need to just accept what's there, know what I mean?
But look, you need to just let this play out
From track one, to track whatever, however-many-I-put-on-here
You need to just listen to this cause look man, this is the first time
Canadian, down south, my man, Smallz, your boy, Drake
You know what it is man, so just tune in nigga
Thank you Ms. Graham for coming today. You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding, haha

“Where's the ground? Where’s the earth? Where's mom?”

She left

And now we're headed somewhere. Moment to moment. But we don’t know where and we can’t stop living. The Internet, our new earth, moves forward only leaving behind a curated record

Because the Internet was made to be the soundtrack to this new coding. The reworking of our humanity. Trying to find 

[each other/ourselves] again after the big bang. Every soul looking for each other like every drop of water looks for the Ocean

The rules of the Internet are the rules of our new universal language like the Bible, like the Constitution, we make rules to break later and be better. Pushing forward until we are all just a bodiless conscious, buzzing through the air trading information, conversing, testing ideas without fear or violence. Free from limit. This is the moment we decide if we want to be the kid pouring salt on a worker’s head at the sit in, or the kids sitting calmly in the face of what everyone else identifies as futility

… Or we can be the kid sitting back, just trying to eat. Ignoring what’s happening in front of them. Not having an opinion until the acceptable choice is handed to you by people you don’t know

We have reached a moment where there is no “real” because we don’t care anymore we can curate what’s real every day our timeline or feed. The boundary of what’s real and what we want to be real is as volatile as the worth of our bitcoin or human heartbeat

This is an important moment

But be

[a]ware that we are all making it up as we go. Together

Our human collective unconscious

Our deep web

Girl, I can't hold it down much longer
These waves are thrusting, they get stronger
Girl, I wonder if I should ponder, or just
Let it out, pour it all out
See I'm bathed in doubt
Just the wincing down
Let it out, pour it all out
Yeah, I'm bathed in doubt
Girl, I'm bringing you down

Girl, I was never there
Laying fully clothed and you lay bare

Man, looks like I might descend again
Broken down, I lost my friend again
Fucked her brains out and then she might pretend
To see above, to be in love, to be in love
To be in love, to be in love, to be in love
I'll be above, I'll be above, I've seen above

Know, girl, what's in store
It's nothing that I'd be hatin'
Is negotiatin' degradin'
And you were just a long time ago
I met a girl where I know where I'll go
(Maybe for a little while)
Girl, I can't hold it down much longer
(Maybe for a little while)
(Maybe for a little while)
(Can you make me feel a little wild?)
The wind is calling, getting stronger
(Maybe for a little while)
(Can you make me feel a little wild?)
And, girl, I ponder over little things
(Maybe for a little while)
Over little, little things
(Can you make me feel a little wild?)
(Maybe for a little while)
(Maybe for a little while)
(Maybe for a little while)
(Can you make me feel a little wild?)
(Maybe for a little while)
(Oh, can you baby for a little while?)
(Maybe for a little while)
(Maybe for a little while)
(Maybe for a little while)
(Can you make me feel a little wild?)
(Maybe for a little while)

[Verse 1]
By the look in your eye
I can tell you're going to cry
Is it over me?
If it is
Save your tears for I'm not worth it, you see

[Chorus]
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam
Wherever I lay my hat
That's my home
I'm telling you that's my home

[Verse 2]
You had romance
Did you break it by chance over me?
If it's so
I'd like for you to know that I'm not worth it, you see

[Chorus]
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam
Mhm, wherever I lay my hat
That's my home
Mhm, that's my home

[Bridge]
Oh, you keep telling me
You keep telling me I'm your man
What do I have to do to make you understand?

For I'm the type of guy who gives girl the eye
Everybody knows
But I love them and I leave them
Break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go

[Chorus]
Don't you know that I'm the type of man who is always on the roam?
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home
Wherever I lay my hat
Oh oh, that's my home
Mhm, yeah
That's my home and I like it that way

(Verse)
Got a bad bitch that get money
So her bag cost fifty five hunnid
Spend a cool mill on her condo so she parked her Jag in front it
75 bags she stuntin
Click of bad bitch she runnin
On Rodeo Drive call Channel 5 cause it's homicide how she stunting
Need a handicap stick cuz the car she drive, man I swear that bitch retarded
At the Heat game with them red bottoms, she go hard all night, we puntin
And I don't know what you heard bout her but my little ho getting money
Just me and her, no entourage
Bout to walk in & close down Onyx
Walk in, I'm too spiffy
Yea I got my 4-50
That corn bread, that real Jiffy
I turn yo man to a damn memory
I'm the biggest baller of this damn century
Let me refresh yo damn memory
Me and Waka Flocka, baby back to Benzes
Yall pussy ass niggas better pay attention
(Hook)

(Verse)
One thing I don't care about
Is asking bout another ho whereabouts
I'm caked up, no care at all
Ball so hard gotta me carry me out
I'm across the border, they bring it to me
So when I give an order better carry it out
Fuck more hoes than Wilt Chamberlain
So no ho wanna marry me now
She a bad bitch, she get real gwala
Nigga can't fuck her for $100
Got a tax service and a beauty parlor
And she go to school, she a role scholar
To a young girl she a role model
If you sick she suck the cold out ya
Ride the dick like a porn model
Catch her in the club with a gold bottle
Got old heads them old hunnids
She a young ho with old money
Too fine, too loyal
Ain't nothing that she won't do for ya
All my home boys tryna fuck
But that's just my crew for ya
And that pussy's so good
I wish there it was two of ya
(Hook)
(Hook: Guwop)

I drop the top and now I got it buttnaked
I flash a couple ones and now she buttnaked!
I took the diamonds out and now it’s buttnaked
It’s worth a hundred thousand and it’s buttnaked!

(Verse 1: Guwop)
My money doin' cartwheels and summersaults
Don’t blame it on my car, it’s the summer fault
I’m poppin' out the sunroof, peek-a-boo
Your swag was last seen on the local news
And I’m a nice guy but my wrist rude
Bitches wanna tie me up like new shoes
The necklace on my chest cost me 300 bonds
200 thousand dollars, plus another one
50 thou, I blew that shit
Look how quick I ran through that shit
Walkin' in the club like, "Who that clique?"
Look how far I threw that shit
Baby girl, let’s do it quick
Damn I forgot I knew that chick
Pound of weed, I blew that shit
With the niggas that I make music with
Lil' mama come slide through
Tell your girlfriend she can ride too
I live in a igloo, a condo with a side view
Don't get it confused, ain’t no regular dude
Them 21’s and 22’s
It’s a Transformer, it’s a robot
It do everything I tell it to

[Hook 2x]

(Verse 2: Guwop)

It’s codeine mixed with Sprite but still we call it juice
Isn’t it ironic that I’m smoking fruits?
I’m coolin' in my cutlass, the guts baby blue
Them 24’s look like it got on Daisy Duke’s
And even though these bitches say I’m brand new
I fuck 'em then I go get something brand new
I cut it off the top like a barber do
And every day my crew gon' throw a barbecue
Open up the door, you get a better view
I make it look real good but that’s what cheddar do
I’m bankin' out on purpose like I’m shootin' pool
I’m fresher than a lil' kid on the first day of school
And cash rules everything around me
If you ain’t getting money get from 'round me
Yellow black forgislike a bumblebee
And if she ain’t a dime she ain’t my cup of tea!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 1]
I will bathe myself
Then I'll wear you for the night
Colours fading, frayed at the sides
(You're changing in the light)
Oh why is your face so pale and white?

[Chorus]
There's a lot of words to come out
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
Down when the walls start shaking
I'm ready for you to find out
Ah-ooo-ooo
To find out
Ah-ooo-ooo

[Verse 2]
Now the night has fled
Just like everything I'd said
When the moon was out instead
(Now the sun glows soft and red)
You burn through my mind
Again and again, again, again
And again and again

[Chorus]
There's a lot of words to come out
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
Down when the walls start shaking
I'm ready for you to find out
Ah-ooo-ooo
To find out
Ah-ooo-ooo

[Chorus]
There's a lot of words to come out
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
Down when the walls start shaking
I'm ready for you to find out
Ah-ooo-ooo
To find out
Ah-ooo-ooo

[Verse 1]
Waterfall
Nothing can harm me at all
My worries seem so very small
With my waterfall

[Verse 2]
I can see
My rainbow calling me
Through the misty breeze
Of my waterfall

[Bridge]
Some people say
Daydreaming's for all the, huh
Lazy minded fools
With nothing else to do
So let them laugh, laugh at me
So just as long as I have you
To see me through
I have nothing to lose
Long as I have you

[Verse 3]
Waterfall
Don't ever change your ways
Fall with me for a million days
Oh, my waterfall

[Outro: Guitar solo]

[Intro]
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
But I know for sure
I don't live today

[Verse]
No sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
No sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
I wish you'd hurry up and execute me
So I can be on my miserable way

[Chorus]
I don't
Live today!
Maybe tomorrow
I just can't say; but, uh
I don't
Live today!

[Interlude]
It's such a shame to
Waste your time away like this

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Well, I don't
Live today!
Maybe tomorrow
I just can't tell you, baby; but, uh
I don't
Live today!

[Interlude]
It's such a shame to
Spend the time away like this
Existing

[Interlude]
Yeah!
Ow!
Yeah!
Oh, no

[Instrumental]

[Interlude]
Oh, there ain't no life nowhere
Uh-huh, hmm

[Outro]
Are you experienced?
Get experienced
Get experienced
Are you experienced?

[Spoken Intro]
Star fleet to scout ship, please give your position
Over
I am in orbit around the third planet from the star called the sun
Over
May this be Earth?
Over
Positive. It is known to have some form of intelligent species
Over
I think we should take a look

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Strange beautiful grass of green
With your majestic silver seas
Your mysterious mountains I'd wish to see closer
May I land my kinky machine?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Although your world wonders me
With your majestic and superior cackling hen
Your pickle I do not understand
So to you I shall put an end
Then you'll never hear surf music again

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
You know you're a cute little heartbreaker
Foxy
And you know you're a sweet little lovemaker
Foxy

[Chorus]
I want to take you home, yeah
I won't do you no harm, no
You've got to be all mine, all mine
Ooh, foxy lady

[Verse 2]
Now I see you, heh, are down on the scene
Foxy
You make me want to get up and scream

[Verse 1]
For fifty years they've been married
And they can't wait for their fifty-first to roll around
Yeah, roll around
Thirty years they've been married
And now they're old and happy and they settle down
Settle down, yeah
Twenty years they've been married
And they did everything that could be done
You know they're having fun

[Chorus]
And then you come along and talk about
So you, you say you wanna be married
I'm gonna change your mind
Oh! Got to change
That was the good side, baby
Here comes the bad side

[Verse 2]
Ten years they've been married
A thousand kids run around hungry
'Cause their mother's a louse
Daddy's down at the whiskey house
That ain't all
For three years they've been married
They don't get along so good
They're tired of each other, you know how that goes
She got another lover, same old thing
So now you're seventeen
Running around, hanging out, and having your fun
Life for you has just begun, baby

[Chorus]
And then you come saying
So you, you say you want to be married
Oh baby, trying to put me on a chain
Ain't that some shame?
You must be losing your, weak little mind
I ain't ready yet, baby, I ain't ready
I'm gonna change your mind!
Oh, look out, baby

[Outro]
Ow!
I ain't ready to get tied down
I ain't ready
I ain't ready now
Let me live a little while longer
Let me live!
Let me live a little while longer, oh
So if you're finished talking
Let me get back in my groove

[Verse 1]
Yeah, his guitar slung across his back
His dusty boots is his Cadillac
Flamin' hair just a blowin' in the wind
Ain't seen a bed in so long it's a sin

He left home when he was seventeen
The rest of the world he had longed to see
But everybody knows the boss
A rolling stone who gathers no moss

But you'd probably call him a tramp
But it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now some people say he had a girl back home
Who messed around and did him pretty wrong
They tell me it kinda hurt him bad
Kinda made him feel pretty sad
I couldn't say what went through his mind
Anyway, he left the world behind
But everybody knows the same old story
In love and war you can't lose the glory

Now you'd probably call him a tramp
But I know it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Walk on brother, yeah
One more brother

His old guitar slung across his back
His dusty boots is his Cadillac
Flamin' hair just a-blowin' in the wind
Ain't seen a bed in so long it's a sin

Now you may call him a tramp
But I know it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile

[Outro]
Walk on brother
Don't let no one stop you
Highway chile
Yeah yeah yeah
Highway chile
Rolling stone
Go on down the highway
Highway chile
Yeah yeah yeah
Highway chile

[Verse 1]
Can you see me, yeah, begging you on my knees?
Whoa yeah!
Can you see me, baby?
Baby, please don't leave
Yeah, if you can see me doing that
You can see in the future of a thousand years

[Verse 2]
Can you hear me? Crying all over town
Yeah, babe
Can you hear me, baby? Crying 'cause you put me down
Must be joking
If you can hear me doing that you can
Hear a freight train coming from a thousand miles

[Guitar solo]
Ah yeah

[Verse 3]
Can you hear me? Singing this song to you
Ah, you better open up your ears
Can you hear me, baby? Singing this song to you
Ah shucks!
If you can hear me sing
You better come home like you're supposed to do

[Outro]
Can you see me?
Hey, hey
I don't believe you can see me
Whoa yeah!
Can you hear me baby?
I don't believe you can
You can't see me

[Chorus]
Well, there ain't no
(Ain't no)
Ain't no telling, baby
When you will see me again, but I pray
It will be tomorrow

[Chorus]
Well, the sunrise
(Sunrise)
Is burning my eyes, baby
Well now, I must leave now, but I really hope
To see you tomorrow, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, my house is oh, such a sad mile away
The feeling there always hangs up my day
Oh Cleopatra, she's driving me insane
She's trying to put my body in her brain
So uh, just uh, kiss me
Goodbye, just to ease the pain

[Chorus]
Ain't no
(Ain't no)
Ain't no telling, baby
(Ain't no telling, babe)
Ain't no telling, baby
When you gonna see me, I really hope
That uh, it will be tomorrow
You know what I'm talking about
(Ain't no telling)

[Outro]
Woah yeah
Hope it will be, hope it will be tomorrow
(Ain't no telling)
Ain't no telling baby, yeah
You know what I'm talking about
Anyway, I must leave now

[Verse 1]
I just want to talk to you
I won't uh, do you no harm
I just want to know about your different lives
On this here people farm
I heard some of you got your families
Living in cages, tall and cold
And some just stay there and, dust away
Past the age of old

[Chorus]
Is this true?
Please let me talk to you

[Verse 2]
I just want to know about
The rooms behind your minds
Do I see a vacuum there
Or am I going blind?
Or is it just uh, remains from vibrations
And echoes long ago
Things like "Love the World"
And uh, "Let your fancy Flow"

[Chorus]
Is this true?
Please let me talk to you
Let me talk to you

[Verse 3]
I have lived here before, the days of ice
And of course this is why I'm so concerned
And I come back to find the stars misplaced
And the smell of a world that has burned
A smell of the world that has burned

[Bridge]
Yeah well, maybe
Maybe it's just a change of climate
I can dig it
I can dig it baby, I just want to see

[Verse 4]
So where do I purchase my ticket?
I would just like to have a ringside seat
I want to know about the new Mother Earth
I want to hear and see everything
I want to hear and see everything
I want to hear and see everything

[Outro]
Aw, shucks
If my daddy could see me now
Everything, everything
Everything, everything

[Refrain]
It’s alright now, I don’t wanna wait
It’s alright now, I don’t wanna wait
It’s alright now, I don’t wanna wait
It’s alright now, I don’t wanna wait

[Verse 1]
Let me be your fortress
One word then all of this
If I pushed it all to the back
Would you run home just like that?

[Pre-Chorus]
If you’re not there today
It’s alright now, I can wait
We cannot think of the cost
Burnt up like the days we lost

[Chorus]
If only you could you see mine, running out dry
Some of these feelings never died
I step onto your side, you never did see mine
Tell me, are you sleeping still tonight?

[Verse 2]
Is this the one? Is this the one?
Is this the place where it all stems from?
Where it had every right to become
Step away, step away, stay numb

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you weren’t there today
It’s alright now, I can wait
We cannot think of the cost
Burnt up like the days we lost

[Chorus]
If only you could you see mine, running out dry
Some of these feelings never died
I step onto your side, you never did see mine
Tell me, are you sleeping still tonight?

[Refrain]
It’s alright now, I don’t wanna wait
It’s alright now, I don’t wanna wait
It’s alright now, I don’t wanna wait
It’s alright now, I don’t wanna wait

[Bridge]
Made a plan to be someone
Mess it up when the moment comes
Step away, step away, stay numb
Made a plan to be someone
Mess it up when the moment comes
Step away, step away, stay numb
Made a plan to be someone
Mess it up when the moment comes
Step away, step away, stay numb
Made a plan to be someone
Mess it up when the moment comes
Step away, step away, stay numb

[Verse 1]
Well, you got me floating round and round
Always up, you never let me down
The amazing thing, you turn me on naturally
And I kiss you when I please

[Chorus]
You got me floating round and round
(Got me floating, round and round)
You got me floating never down
(Hey! Touch the ceiling babe)
You got me floating naturally
(Got me floating, naturally)
You got me floating float to please
(Yeah, now you)

[Verse 2]
You got me floating across and through
You make me float right on up to you
There's only one thing
I need to really get me there
Is to hear you laugh without a care
What I say now

[Chorus]
You got me floating round and round
(Hey!, Round and round)
You got me floating never down
(Got me floating, Woah hey!)
You got me floating naturally
(Got me floating, naturally)
You got me floating float to please
(You got me floating)

[Instrumental break 1:15-1:41]

[Chorus]
You got me floating round and round
(Hey, one time I gotta say it)
You got me floating never down
(Got me floating, yeah)
You got me floating naturally
(See the sky)
You got me floating float to please

[Verse 3]
Now your daddy's cool
And your mama's no fool
They both know
I'm heads over heels for you
And when the day melts
Down into a sleepy red glow
That's when my desires start to show

[Outro]
You got me floating
(Hey! Hey!)
You got me floating
(Got me floating)
You got me floating
(Touch the sky)
You got me floating
(Got me floating)
You got me floating

You got me floating
(Yeah! Hey!)
You got me floating
(I told you)
You got me floating

[Verse 1]
She walks with a bell clock round her neck
So the hippies think she's in with time, time
Her hair glistens like robins on a deck
Branches attack me from her neck

[Chorus]
She's so fine
She's so very very fine

[Verse 2]
The sun from a cloud sinks into her eyes
The rain from a tree soaks into her mind, mind
Morning sign sounds just like a lark
All these signs are always the  start

[Chorus]
She's so fine
She's so very very fine

[Bridge]
When I veer I get so near
But so far, far, far away
Listen to me today

[Outro]
We united just beside a leaf
The ground was hard underneath her
She's so fine, fine

[Intro]
Well, I'm a voodoo chile
Lord, I'm a voodoo chile
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, the night I was born
Lord, I swear the moon turned a fire red
The night I was born
I swear the moon turned a fire red
Well my poor mother cried out "Lord, the gypsy was right!"
And I've seen her, fell down right dead
(Have mercy)

[Verse 2]
Well, mountain lions found me there waitin'
And set me on a eagle's back (oh, Lord)
Well, mountain lions found me there
And set me on a eagle's wing (yeah)
(It's the eagle's wing baby, what did I say)
Well uh, he took me past to the outskirts of infinity
And when he brought me back
He gave me a Venus witch's ring
Hey! (yeah) and he said "Fly on, fly on"

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo chile baby, voodoo chile
Hey!
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Well, I make love to you
And Lord knows you'll feel no pain, yeah
Say, I make love to you in your sleep
And Lord knows you felt no pain
(Have mercy)
Because I'm a million miles away
And at the same time I'm right here in your picture frame
(Yeah! What did I say now?)

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo Chile
Lord knows I'm a, voodoo Chile
Yeah!

[Instrumental Break]
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah, turn it up
Yeah, go ahead uh
What I say
Yeah

[Verse 4]
Yeah, well my arrows are made of desire
From far away as Jupiter's Sulphur mines
Say my arrows are made of desire, desire
From far away as Jupiter's Sulphur mines
Way down by the Methane Sea, yeah
I have a hummingbird and it hums so loud
You think you were losing your mind, hmm

[Drum solo]
Yeah, yeah
Turn that damn git-tar down!
(Ha-ha-ha) Ha-ha-ha
Yeah

[Verse 5]
Well, I float in liquid gardens
And Arizona new red sand (Yeah)
I float in liquid gardens
Way down in Arizona red sand (yeah now, baby)
Well, I taste the honey from a flower named Blue
Way down in California
And the New York drowns as we hold hands
Yeah, Hey!

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo Chile, Lord knows
I'm a voodoo Chile, yeah!

[Instrumental Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, ow
Hey!

[Verse 1]
No one knows where she comes from
Maybe she's a devil in disguise
I can tell by looking in her eyes

[Chorus]
Little miss strange
Little miss strange

[Verse 2]
Little miss strange came into my parlor
I don't know just what to ask her
I don't remember what we did after

[Chorus]
Little miss strange
Little miss strange

[Instrumental break 0:57-1:45]

[Verse 3]
Little miss strange came out of the darkness
Walked across my head, I stood beneath the light
I'm talking about the dream I had the other night

[Outro]
Little miss strange
Little miss strange

[Verse 1]
Sure was a long, long, long, hot summer night
As far as my eyes could see (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But my heart was way down
In a cold, cold winter storm
My darling, where can you be?
Where can you be, baby?
Where can you be?

[Verse 2]
There were three sugar walls and-a two candy cane windows
(Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop)
But the serious moon melted all those in sight (all those in sight)
Everybody's on fire but I'm a snowing in a cold blizzard
Where are you on this-a hot cold summer?
Where are you on this-a hot cold summer?
Where are you on this-a hot cold summer night?

[Verse 3]
Around about this time the telephone blew its horn across the room
Scared little Annie clean out of her mind, clean out of her mind
Roman the Candle, he peeps out of his peekaboo hide and seek
And grabbed little Annie from the ceiling just in time
And the telephone keeps on screaming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 4]
Hello, says my shaky voice, well, how are you doing
I start to stutter
Ah, can't you tell I'm doing fine
It was my baby talking, she's way down across the border
She says, I'm going to hurry to you, I've been a fool
And I'm tired of crying

[Verse 5]
Yeah, a long, long, long, hot summer night
As far as my eyes could see (as far, as far as I could see)
But I can feel the heat coming on as my baby's getting closer
I'm so glad that my baby's coming to rescue me
So glad that my baby's coming to rescue me
So glad my baby's coming to rescue me
Rescue, rescue, rescue
Rescue, rescue
Rescue, rescue, what'd I say
Rescue me, rescue me
Rescue, rescue me, rescue me
Rescue

[Chorus]
Well, I realize that I've been hypnotized
I love you, gypsy eyes
I love you, gypsy eyes
Alright!

[Verse 1]
Hey, Gypsy
Way up in my tree I'm sitting by my fire
Wondering where in this world might you be
And knowing all the time you're still roaming the countryside
Do you still think about me?

Oh my, gypsy
Well, I walked right on to your rebel roadside
The one that rambles on for a million miles
Yes, I walk down this road searching for your love and my soul too
But when I find you, I ain't gonna let go

I remember the first time I saw you
The tears in your eyes looked like they were trying to say
Oh, little boy, you know I could love you
But first, I must make my getaway
Two strange men fighting to the death over me today
I'll try to meet you by the old highway
Hey!

[Chorus]
Well, I realize that I've been hypnotized
I love you, gypsy eyes
I love you, gypsy eyes
I love you, gypsy eyes
I love you, gypsy eyes
I love you, gypsy eyes
I love you, gypsy eyes
Alright!

[Verse 2]
I've been searching so long, my feet, they painfully lose the battle
Down against the road my weary knees take their place
Off to the side I fall, but I hear a sweet call
My gypsy eyes has found me and I've been saved

[Outro]
Lord, I've been saved
That's why I love you
Said, I love you
Hey, I love you
Lord, I love you
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Hey man, take a look out the window and see what's happening
Hey man, it's raining
It's raining outside man
Aw, don't worry about that
Everything's going to be everything
We'll get into something real nice you know
Sit back and groove on a rainy day
Yeah, yeah I see what you mean brother, lay back and groove

[Chorus 1]
Rainy day, dream away
Ah let the sun take a holiday
Flowers bathe an' ah see the children play
Lay back and groove on a rainy day

[Verse 2]
Well, I can see a bunch of wet creatures, look at them on the run
The carnival traffic noise it sings the tune splashing up and
Even the ducks can groove rain bathing in the park side pool
And I'm leaning out my windowsill digging everything
And you too

[Chorus 2]
Rainy day, rain all day
Ain't no use in gettin' uptight, just let it groove its own way
Let it drain your worries away
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and dream on a rainy day

[Verse 1]
Hooray, I awake from yesterday
Alive but the war is here to stay
So my love, Katherina and me
Decide to take our last walk
Through the noise to the sea
Not to die but to be reborn
Away from a life so battered and torn
Forever, forever

[Verse 2]
Oh, say can you see, it's really such a mess
Every inch of earth is a fighting nest
Giant pencil and lipstick tube-shaped things
Continue to rain and cause screaming pain
And the Arctic stains
From silver blue to bloody red
As our feet find the sand and the sea
Is straight ahead, straight up ahead

[Verse 3/Chorus]
Well, it's too bad, that our friends can't be with us today
Well, that's too bad
"The machine that we built would never save us"
That's what they say
(That's why they ain't coming with us today)
And they also said
"It's impossible for man to live and breathe underwater forever"
Was their main complaint
(Yeah)
And they also threw this in my face, they said:
"Anyway, you know good and well
It would be beyond the will of God
And the grace of the King"
Grace of the King, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]
So my darling and I make love in the sand
To salute the last moment ever on dry land
Our machine has done its work, played its part well
Without a scratch on our bodies and we bid it farewell
Starfish and giant foams greet us with a smile
Before our heads go under, we take a last look
At the killing noise of the out of style
The out of style, out of style

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
So down and down and down and down
And down and down we go
Hurry, my darling, we mustn't be late for the show
Neptune champion games to an aqua world is so very dear
Right this way, smiles a mermaid
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer
Atlantis full of cheer
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
It’s Meek motherfucking Milly ya’ll
This for all my niggas that down

[Verse 1]
My niggas hard grind, we ain’t car buying
We got them S550’s call it soft nine
Yeah that’s the price up on that twerk so If you lost mine
Watch what you say out your mouth while you online
‘Cause them fed boys lock you for a long time
Conversations played in court, every word lying
Information on your boy, yeah your whole squad
Sit for talking like your boss and when you served dimes
Went from straight drops and we be cracking them grands
‘Cause niggas work been stepped on like the back of my pants
I get you murked and crapped on in the snap of my hands
We really riding, you just rapping it fam, you don’t want a war
That 44 leave your boy by that corner store
I catch you sliding send some hollows through that driver door
If it’s a problem, I'll revolve it with that collar boy
4’1, long gun, that a body boy
We don’t mean no backup ‘cause we throwing backwoods snuff
You pull that gun, I shoot you down fast as a that cracker would
Roll up and crack a wood, let’s go to hazzy baby
That coke government, 80 baby, a blaze you crazy
Bitches talk about me ‘cause I fuck then flee them probably
I don’t fucking need em' I be on my grind, all the time
I ain’t signed, I ain’t gotta shine, all the time
That’s why everyday I’m hustling ‘cause time on the line
A eye for a eye, you niggas think you coming through, I sit and laugh
CD drop, just watch what the numbers do
See me in that Bentley, continental
Call it summer blue, spending blocks
Neck blinging , you ain’t even know what to do
But I advise ya’ll, get some Tylenol
‘Cause we gon’ make you niggas sink as soon as we buy cars

[Outro]
Niggas gon’ want killers when we cop the fuck up
Niggas know how we do bloodhounds, eighth broad we don’t fall, we ball
All my niggas here, all my niggas down right now
Omelly, Donny, Rick dot, all my eighth broad niggas
Northside niggas, southside niggas, my real niggas ride to this
Niggas know how we do, we out

[Verse 1]
And it starts with the beat of a drum, far away
I took a chance with your mind, I've come to play
I get the buzz from your girl, I buzz away
In my car, in my house and my babe today
I never wanted to stand the loving game
I write your name on my hand to fan the flame
I'm lookin' twice at you, girl, we're not the same
And if we fight, you're the one to blame

[Pre-Chorus]
But now suddenly, I don't find the time to see you
Become close to me, and then act like I don't know you
It's not good for me, I can't find the time to see you
Become close to me, and then act like I don't know you

[Chorus]
Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends
Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends

[Verse 2]
And it starts with the beat of a drum, far away
I took a chance with your mind, I've come to play
I get the buzz from your girl, I buzz away
In my car, in my house and my babe today
I never wanted to stand the loving game
I write your name on my hand to fan the flame
I'm lookin' twice at you, girl, we're not the same
And if we fight, you're the one to blame

[Chorus]
Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends
Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends
Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends

[Verse 1]
Jillian was her name
She was sweeter than aspartame
Her kisses reconfigured my DNA
And after that I never was the same
And I loved her even more
Than Marlon Brando loved souffle
She was gorgeous, she was charming
Yeah, she was perfect in every way
Except she was always using the word "infer"
When she obviously meant "imply"
And I know some guys would put up with that kind of thing
But frankly, I can't imagine why

[Chorus]
And I told her, I said
"Hey! Are we playing horseshoes, honey?
No, I don't think we are!
You're close! (Close!)
But no cigar!"

[Verse 2]
Then I met sweet young Janet
Prettiest thing on the planet
Had a body hotter than a habanero
She had lips like a ripe pomegranate
And I was crazy like Manson about her
She got me all choked up like Mama Cass
She had a smile so incredibly radiant
You had to watch it through a piece of smoked glass
I thought after all these years of searching around
I'd found my soulmate finally
But one day I found out she actually owned a copy
Of Joe Dirt on DVD

[Chorus]
Oh, no! I said
"Hey! Are we lobbing hand grenades, kiddo?
No, I don't think we are!
You're close! (Close!)
Oh, so very close! (Close!)
Yeah, baby, you're close! (Close!)
So close!
But no cigar!"

[Bridge]
(Oh, yeah!)
(Oh, no!)
(Oh, yeah!)
(Oh, no!)
(Oh, yeah!)
(Oh, no!)
(ALL RIGHT!)

[Verse 3]
Julie played water polo
She wore a ribbon on her left Manolo
She had me sweating like Nixon every time she was near
My heart was beating like a Buddy Rich solo
And she was everything I've dreamed of
She moved right up to number one on my list
And did I mention she's a world famous billionaire
Bikini supermodel astrophysicist?
Yeah, she was so pretty she made Charlize Theron
Look like a big fat slobbering pig
The only caveat is one of her earlobes
Was just a little tiny bit too big

[Chorus]
I said
"Hey! Are we doing government work here?
No, I don't think we are!
You're close! (Close!)
So very, very close! (Close!)
Aaw, baby, you're close! (Close!)
So close!
But no cigar!"

[Outro]
Missed it by that much! (No cigar!)
Ah, yeah! Ah, right! (No cigar!)
Really, really, really close!
But no cigar!
You got my pride
Hangin' out of my bed
You messing with my life
So I bought my lead
You even messin' with my children
And you're screaming at my wife, baby
Get off of my back
If you wanna get outta here alive

(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) That's what I want now
(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) That's what I need now
(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) To live
(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) So I can give

You got my heart
Spittin' electric water
You got my soul
Screamin' and holl'rin'
You bout to hook my girlfriend
You know the drugstore man
But I don't need it now
Unless you're trying to slap it out of her hand
(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) So I can live
(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) So I can give
(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) Yeah
(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) That's what I need

You don't have to
Say that you love me
If you don't mean it
You better believe
If you need me
Or you just want to bleed me

[you're] Better sticking your dagger in someone else
So I can leave
Set me free!

(Keep on pushing) Right on
(Straight ahead) Straight ahead
(Keep on pushing) Straight up there
(Straight ahead) Straight ahead, freedom!
(Keep on pushing) So I can live, babe
(Straight ahead) Freedom!
(Keep on pushing) So that I can give
(Straight ahead) Freedom!
Keep on pushing! (So I can live)
Straight ahead! (Freedom)
Keep on pushing!
Straight ahead!
Keep on pushing!

[Verse 1]
Well, I wish I was a catfish
Swimming in, Lord, the deep blue sea
I'd have all you pretty women
Fishing after me, fishing after me
Fishing after me, yeah

[Refrain]
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah

[Verse 2]
When I went down, my girlfriends house
And I sat down, Lord, on her front step
And she said, "Come in now Jimi
My husband just now left, just now left"

[Refrain]
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah

[Verse 3]
Well there's two, two trains running
But there's not one, Lord, that's going my way
You know there's a one train running at midnight
Other ones leave just for a day
Leave just for a day

[Refrain]
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse-Jimi Hendrix]
I'm a voodoo chile, lord I'm a voodoo chile
Yeah
The night I was born, lord the moon stood a fire red
Said the night I was born, the moon turned a fire red
My poor mother her crying, she said "The gypsy was right!"
And she fell right dead

[Outro-Jimi Hendrix]
Hey, and he said "Fly on, fly on!", because I'm a voodoo chile, baby
Voodoo chile

[Long Instrumental outro]

[Intro]
Mama
Mama Hinan take one
Oh, oh yeah
Oh oh oh yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
Everything's gonna be alright this morning
Now bust it
Hey, when I was a young boy
Around 'bout the age of five, I think
I had somethin' in my pocket
A lot of hope alive
Now I'm a man, I made 21
You now baby, we'll have a whole lot of fun
Because I'm a man, spending
Hey child, little boy
Guess where I am
Am a
Dididdy diddy
Dididdy diddy

Hey, all you pretty women, standin' in line
I'll make love to you all this time
I'm not sure you'll never miss
The way I make love
Miss Harris
Because I'm a man
I swear I'm the only
Oh me
Little child, now
Oh me
Little child
Anna na na na

Doodoodoo doody
Doodoodoo doody

Because I'm a man
Yeah
Because I'm a mannish child
I said I'm a mad villain
I said I'm a man babe
I said I'm a man
Yeah baby
Yeah
I'm going down south
To Kansas too
I'm going to bring back my second cousin
Little John, we call him blue
Because I'm a man
What fun we had
Chasing rabbits
In the sand
Hey hey hey
Hey!

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
Lord, I had a woman
Lord knows she was good to me in every way
Yes, I had a woman
A real woman

Lord, she gave me love both night and day
My sunshine
Whoo hoo
For my woman
Or else or else
Its going to take me one more day
If it takes me

She went way down in Dallas
Way down in Texas land
Lord, she had me wrapped around her wrist and around her finger, baby
Like a ring wrapped around a finger of a severed hand
I'm looking for my Dallas honey bee

[Outro]
Who can you be?
Who can you be?
Oooh hoo hoo help me
Help me look for her
Oh yeah

[Verse]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's about the time we'd like to present you to the electric church
And baby if you would you all listen to our notes
Here, here in our sins, playing
Instead of rapping like I am now
Then maybe I'll well maybe this is good enough
What you think we stick with songs
It's all freedom

There's a red house, over yonder baby
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder, baby
Lord, that's where my baby stays

I haven't been home to see my baby
In about a ninety-nine and one half days
It's about time to see her

[Outro]

[x2]
Wait a minute something's wrong, babe
Lord, have mercy, this key won't unlock this door

[Verse]
She's just a night bird flyin' through the night
Fly on
She's just a night bird makin' a midnight, midnight flight
Sail on, sail on
Well, she's flying down to me
But, 'til tomorrow got to set her free
Set her free

[Verse 2]
So all we got, baby, is one precious night
All we got is one precious night
Throw all your blues and shoes and things
And rags down under the bed
Just wrap me up in your beautiful wings
Better hear what I say, yeah
Oh, carry me home
Please take me through your dreams
Inside your world I want to be

[Outro]
Until tomorrow no tears will be shed
Hold on 'til the sun gets out of bed
Hold on, hold on, baby
Fly on
Sail on, sail on , sail on
Sail on

[Verse 1]
Look over yonder, here come the blues
The thirteenth of any time, powered by fools
I can see them coming
Wearing a blue armored coat
You're sitting here with your violins
Hitting wrong notes
Look over yonder, he's coming my way
When he's around, I never have a happy day
(You even bust my guitar strings)

[Chorus]
Look over yonder
Look over yonder
Look over yonder
Look over yonder

[Verse 2]
Well, he's talking to my baby
They found my peace pipe on her
Now they're dragging her away
Lord knows we don't need a devil like him beating us around
Well, he's knocking on my door
How my house is tumbling down
Now don't you come no closer
The path is keeping me bolder
Wait by my door, baby
Unless you want to start another war

[Chorus]
Look over yonder
Look over yonder
Look over yonder
Look over yonder

[Intro]
OK, here we go
I'm going to try it with the long beginning, ok
Then, then, I'm going to do the weak start, ok
What's it called Jimi?
Here he comes
Here he comes, take one

[Chorus]
Here he comes, I say
Here comes your lover now
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man

[Verse]
Ah, I got to get my head from this pillow
I go to get out of your
No hard feelings
Reach down baby, and get my running shoes
Oh yeah
Reach down baby, and get my running shoes
I got to get out of here and I got no time to lose
Hey

[Chorus]
Here he comes, I say
Here comes your lover now
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man

[Bridge]
I got to get my suitcase
And get the hell out of just as fast as I can

[Outro]
Here he comes, baby
Here he comes, baby
Here he comes, baby
Here he comes, baby
Doo doo

[Verse 1]
Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me
Just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between
The moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she is going to come back tomorrow

[Chorus]
And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm going to be by your side"

[Verse 2]
Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
"Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you are going to be my man
You are going to rise"
And then she took me high over yonder

[Chorus]
And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side"

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Shoot down some of those airplanes your flying
Especially the ones that are flying too low
Shoot down some of those airplanes
Especially the ones that your flying too low

Come on back to earth my friend
Come on back up with me
We've all been up through the night time baby
Now let's read the rays of reality

[Chorus]
With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of you
Anything you wanna do

[Verse 2]
Flying too much today
It's so groovy to float around sometimes
Even a jelly fish will tell you that
I said floatation is groovy
And he said
And a jelly fish will agree to that
Yeah, but that old jelly fish
Been floating around so long
Lord he hasn't got a bone in his jelly back
Floating every day and every night
Riding high is a risk
Sometimes the wind isn't right

[Chorus]
With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of you
Anything you wanna do

[Chorus]
With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of you
Anything you wanna do

[Outro]
With the power of you
Anything you want to do

[Verse]
Yeah, ooh
Well, I travel at the speed of a reborn man
I got a lot of love to give
From the mirrors of my hand

I sent a message of love
Don't you run away
Look at your heart, baby
Come on along with me today

Well, I am what I am, thank God
Some people just don't understand
Well, help them God
Find yourself first
And then your tool
Find yourself first
Don't you be no fool

Here comes a woman
Wrapped up in chain
Messing with that fool baby
Your life is pain
If you want to be free
Come on along with me
Don't mess with the man
He'll never understand
I said find yourself first
And then your talent
Work hard in your mind
So you can come alive
You better prove to the man
You're as strong as him
Because in the eyes of God
You're both children to him

[Outro]
Everybody come alive
Everybody live alive
Everybody love alive
Everybody hear my message
Hey, ooh
Hey, ooh
Hey, ooh

[Verse 1]
I used to live in a room full of mirrors
All I could see was me
Well, I take my spirit and I smash my mirrors
Now the whole world is here for me to see
I said the whole world is here for me to see
Now I am searching for my love to be
Hey!

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Rubber glass was all in my brain
Cotton screaming crying in my head
Rubber glass was all in my brain
Just the thought of my dreams cut me in my bed
And just the thought of my dreams cut me in my bed
I said making love was strange in my bed

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
All right
Ooh ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No place stumping
No place far
Can't find the floor
Nowhere at all
See nothing but sunshine
All around

[Outro]
Love come shining over the mountains
Love come shining over the sea
Love will shine on my baby
Then I'll know who's exactly for me
Lord, I'll know who will be for me
In the meantime, which is a groovy time
Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so heavy, gonna make you stagger
Dolly Dagger, she drinks her blood from a jagged edge
(Drink up, baby)

Been riding broomsticks since she was fifteen
Blow out all the other witches on the scene
She got a bull whip, just as long as your life
Her tongue can even scratch the soul out of the devil's wife

Well, I seen her in action at the players' choice
Turning all the love men into donut boys
Hey red hot momma, you'd better step aside
This chick's gonna turn you to a block of ice
Look out

Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so strong gonna make you stagger, baby
Dolly Dagger
She drinks the blood from a jagged edge
Right on
Drink up baby
Hey!

[Break]

Yeah, look at old burnt out Superman
Tryin' to shoot his dust on the sun
Captain Comic is the man on the run
On the words of love
Do they ever touch Dolly Brown
Better get in some highway and clear outta town

Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so heavy, gonna make you stagger
Dolly Dagger
She ain't satisfied 'til she gets what she's after
She drinks the blood from the jagged edge
Better watch out, baby, here comes your master
Alright
Watch out there, baby
Gonna give a little bit of that

(Dolly, heavy mama
Get it on, get it on, get it on
Dolly, heavy mama
Get it on, get it on, get it on
Dolly, heavy mama
Get it on, get it on, get it on
Dolly, heavy mama
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah...)

[Fade out]

[Verse]
There goes Ezy
Ezy Ryder
Riding down the highway of desire
He says the free wind
Takes him higher
Trying to find his heaven above
But he is dying to be loved

He's telling me living
Is so magic
Something is forever
So he claims
He's talking bout lying
It is so tragic, baby
But don't you worry about today
We got freedom coming our way

How long
Do you think
He's going to last
Carrying out on a gas 

[?]
See all the others say
Do what you please
Got to get the brothers together
And the right to be free
In a cloud of angel dust
I think I see me a freak
Hey motorcycle mama
You going to marry me? haha

[Outro]
I will be stone crazy
Love coming in at you
Stone crazy baby

[Verse 1]
"Oh, help me in my weakness"
I heard the drifter say
As they carried him from the court room
And were taking him away
Well, my trip hasn't been a pleasant one
And my time it isn't long
And I still do not know
What is was that I've done wrong

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside
A tear came to his eye
"Well, you fail to understand," he said
"Why must you even try?"
Outside, the crowd was stirring
You could hear it from the door
Inside, the judge was stepping down
While the jury cried for more
Cried for more, cried for more
Hey, you better leave that boy's soul alone

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Oh, stop that passing the jury
Grab me a tendon and me a nurse
Oh, the trial was bad enough
Yes, but this is ten times worse
Just then bolt of lightning
Showed the court house out of shape
And while everybody knelt to pray
The drifter made his escape
The drifter did his escape

[Outro]
Yeah
So long
Drifting on a sea
Of forgotten teardrops
On a lifeboat sailing for your love
Sailing home

Drifting on a sea
Of old heartbreaks
On a lifeboat sailing for your love
Sailing home

[Verse 1]
I get stoned
I can't go home
I'm calling long distance on a public saxophone
My head is aching
Lord, my mind is breaking
Feel I got run over by Captain Coconut and his dog named Rover

[Chorus]
Got to keep on moving
Got to keep on moving
To understand both sides of the sky
You got to keep on grooving, yeah
Good grooving
Because you got your God and so do I

[Verse 2]
We got to keep on loving
Good, good, good, loving
Make love on my dying bed
We got to stop smoking, stop, stop
I mean cigarette smoking
Or else I cough myself to death
And to make love to you baby
I wouldn't even have the breath

[Chorus]
Got to keep on moving
Got to keep on moving
To understand both sides of the sky
You got to keep on grooving, yeah
Good grooving
Because you got your God and so do I

[Verse]
I sure got the blues this morning, baby
Yeah, and I'm here to tell you about it
So you might as well pick up on it
I'm a man
At least I'm trying to be
I have lived before
The other half of me
I have lived before
That you don't want me
But in this search
For nothing desperately
Oh, I'm trying trying
Not to be a fool
I'm trying trying
Lord to keep my cool, baby trying so hard to keep it together

After I find, baby
That true love of mine
I am just Rolling screaming
Crying flying
Can't be trusted, got busted
Rolling stone
You are a woman
At least you say you are
You are a woman
At least you look like you are
You are a woman
At least you taste like you are
But you can take it off
In bed with my guitar
And then you leave them
Throw me outside
To cry, cry
To the moon and the nighttime
Save my soul
You cannot find
All you want is a ticket to ride
After you show me everything
It did prove otherwise

[Outro]
You just rolling, screaming, crying good love is sometime
But cannot be trusted
Stepping stone
Stepping stone

[Chorus 1]
Hello my friend
So happy to see you again
I was so alone
All by myself i just couldn't make it

[Verse 1]
Have you heard baby
What the wind's blowin' round
Have you heard baby
A whole lot a people's coming right on down

Communication, yeah, is coming on strong
I don't give a damn baby
If your hair is short or long

I said get out of your grave
Oh, everybody is dancing in the street
Do what you know
Do not be slow
You got to practice what you preach
Yeah, because it is time for you and me
Come to face reality
Forget about the past baby
Things ain't what they used to be
Keep on straight ahead
Keep on straight ahead

[Chorus 2]
Straight ahead baby
Straight ahead baby
Whoo!

[Verse 2]
We got to stand side by side
We got to stand together and organize
Send power to the people, that's what they're screaming
Freedom of the soul
Pass it on, pass it on, to the young and the old

You got to tell the children the truth
They don't need a whole lot of lies
Because one of these days, baby
They'll be running things
So when you give them love
You better give it right
Woman and child, man and wife
The best love to have is the Love Of Life

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
Hello my friend
It's so good to see you again
Hey now I've been all by myself
I don't think I can make it alone

[Intro]
Here I come to save the day

[Verse 1]
A little boy inside a dream just the other day
His mind fell out of his face, and the wind blew it away
A hand came out from Heaven and pinned a badge on his chest
It said, "Get out there, man, and a-do your best"
Uh

[Chorus]
They call him Astro Man
And he is flying higher than
That old faggot superman
Ever could

[Verse 2]
Oh, they call him Cosmic Nut
And he's twice as dense as Donald duck
And he will try his best to screw you up
The rest of your mind

[Interlude]
Oh, look out, my guitars!

[Chorus]
Astro man
Flying across the sky
Ten times higher
Then that old faggot superman
Ever, ever could
Ever could

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
There he goes, there he goes
Where he stops? No one knows
There he goes, there he goes, uh

[Outro]
He is trying to, trying to blow out the rest of your mind
He's going to blow out the rest of your mind
Talking about looking for peace of mind
Astro man will leave it in pieces
Have you put our trouble behind him
Make you fly around in pieces
Yeah, blow out the rest of your mind
Astro man will blow out the rest of your mind
He's going to blow out the rest of your mind
Wu-hu, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Blow out the rest of your mind

[Verse 1]
Well I, I just came back today
I just came back from the storm
Yeah

I said, I just came back, baby
I just came back from the storm
Yeah, from the storm

Well, I did not know it then
But I was suffering, suffering
For my love to keep me warm

[Chorus]

[x2]
It was so cold and lonely, yeah
The wind and crying blue rain
Were tearing me up

[Verse 2]
I want to thank you, my sweet darling
For digging in the mud and picking me up
Thank you so much
It was a crying blue rain, the burning my eyes
The wind and lightning struck by suprise
It was you, my love, who brought me in
I love you so much
I'll never stray from you again
Hey

[Outro]
I just came back today
I just came back to get my baby on her way
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, I'm up here in this womb
I'm looking all around
Well, I am looking out my belly button window
And I see a whole lot of frowns
And I am wondering if they don't want me around

[Verse]
What seems to be the fuss out there?
Just what seems to be the hang?
Because you know if you just do not want me this time around
Yeah, I will be glad to go back to spirit land
And even take a longer rest
Before I am coming down the chute again

Man, I sure remember the last time, baby
They were still hawking about me then
So if you don't want me now
Make up your mind, where or when
If you don't want me now
Give or take, you only got two hundred days
Because I ain't coming down this way too much more again
You know they got pills for ills and thrills and even spills
But I think you are just a little too late
So I'm coming down into this world, daddy
Regardless of love and hate
And I'm going to sit up in your bed, mama
And just grin right in your face
And then I'm going to eat up all your chocolates
And say, "I hope I'm not too late!"

So if there is any questions
Make up your mind
Because you better give or take
Questions in your mind
Give it or take
You only got two hundred days

[Chorus]
Well, I'm up here in this womb
Looking all around, sure is dark in here
I'm looking out my belly button window
And I swear I see nothing but a lot of frowns
And I'm wondering if they want me around
Look over yonder, here come the blues
The thirteenth of any time, just like a fool
A double-breasted green and red polka-dot coat
Playing the violin, hittin' wrong notes

Wow! Look over yonder, he's coming my way
When he's around, I never have a happy day
He gives me bad luck by rubbin' his wing
See that? I just broke a guitar string
D'aww...

Ow!

[Break]

Wow! Look over yonder, he's smiling at my babe
Now she says she's gonna leave me here today
I don't need bad luck like uh, him hanging around
He's knockin' on my door, now my house is burnin' down
Crackle, crackle
Pop, pop
Wow! Look over yonder, this is the end
He's just now saying he wants to be my friend
When he's around, I can't do nothing right
He's got me wearing shades in the middle of the night
Look over yonder, yeah
Look over yonder, baby
Got to get away, get away from here
Ow! Look over yonder, yeah
Look over yonder, baby
Got to, got to look over yonder
Yeah
Look over yonder
Where's my shotgun so I can blow this fool away?
Get away, brother!
Ow, look over yonder, baby!
Yeah!
Look over yonder!
Look over yonder, baby
Look over yonder!
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm just a lonesome ship passing through the night
I'm just a lonesome bird flying on a midnight flight

[Verse]
All I got for you is me
So darling can't you see
We'll make love all through the night
Make love all through the night
Lay your troubles down on the chair
You've got to shake those blues right out your hair

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Now the gypsy woman told my mother
A'before I was born
She say "You got a boy child's a'coming
He's gonna be a son of a gun
He's gonna make you girls
Jump and shout
Then the world–
Then the world better know
What it's all about"

[Chorus]
But you know I'm him
Everybody knows I'm him, yeah
I'm the hoochie-coochie man
Everybody knows I'm him

[Verse 2]
I've got a black cat bone
I've got a mojo too, baby
I got the little child a'comin'
He's gonna come and mess with you
I'm gonna make you girls
Take me by my hand
And then the world–
Then the world better know
I'm the hoochie-coochie man, yeah

[Chorus]
Everybody knows I'm him
Well you know I'm the hoochie-coochie man
Everybody knows I'm him, yeah

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 3]
Now, on the seventh night
Of the seventh month
Of the seventh week
The seven doctors say
"He was born for good luck
That you'll see
I got seven hundred girlfriends and dollars
So don't you mess with me"
You know I'm him

[Chorus]
Everybody knows I'm him
I'm the hoochie-coochie man
Every, every, everybody knows I'm him

[Verse 1]
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back
I'm sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
That he needs you to test his inventions

[Chorus]
Can you please crawl out your window
Use your arms and legs, it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you
You can go back to him any time you want to

[Verse 2]
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little ten women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning

[Chorus]

[Spoken Intro: Jimi Hendrix]
"Buddy Miles is going to do this thing he wrote
Called 'Them Changes'"

[Verse 1]
Well my mind is going through them changes
I feel just like I'm in the time
Every time you see me going some where
I feel like I'm going out of my mind, yeah
Oh, my baby she left me the other day
And we were having so much fun yeah, yeah
Oh, my baby she stepped out on me
And that's the reason why she had to part

[Chorus]
It's alright yeah, yeah
It's alright
What I say
It's alright
Ooo-hoo

[Verse 2]
Well my mind is going through them changes
I think I'm going out of my mind
Every time you see me going some where
I think I could commit a crime know
She had me running
She had me crying
She had me running
She had me, had me, had me crying
She had me running
She had me crying
She had me running
Had me crying

[Chorus]
It's alright yeah, yeah
It's alright
What I say
It's alright
Ooo-hoo

[Verse 3]
Clap your hands
Go clap your hands
Can you clap a little louder

[Chorus]
It's alright yeah, yeah
It's alright
What I say
It's alright
Ooo-hoo
It's alright yeah, yeah
It's alright
What I say
It's alright
Ooo-hoo

[Bridge]
Oh no
I want my love
I want my love
I want my love

[Chorus]
It's alright yeah, yeah
It's alright
What I say
It's alright
Ooo-hoo

[Outro]
"Buddy Miles there"

[Verse 1]
A police car and a screaming siren
Pneumatic drill and ripped up concrete
A baby wailing and a stray dog howling
The screech of brakes and lamp lights blinking

[Chorus]
That's entertainment
That's entertainment

[Verse 2]
A smash of glass and the rumble of boots
An electric train and a ripped up phone booth
Paint splattered walls and the cry of a tom cat
Lights going out and a kick in the balls

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Days of speed and slow-time Mondays
Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday
Watching the news and not eating your tea
A freezing cold flat with damp on the walls

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Waking up at 6 a.m. on a cool warm morning
Opening the window and breathing in petrol
An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard
Watching the television and thinking about your holidays

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes
Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume
A hot summer's day and sticky black tarmac
Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were far away

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
Two lovers kissing at the scream of midnight
Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude
Getting a cab and travelling on buses
Reading the graffiti about slashed seat affairs

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Day tripper
Yeah
Um ah um ah

[Verse]
I got a good reason, for taken the easy way out
I got a good reason, for taken the easy way out now
She was a day tripper
She was a day tripper, yeah
One way ticket, yeah
One way ticket, yeah
It took so long to find out, I found out
Shes a big teaser
She let me half the way down
Shes a big teaser
She let me half the way down
She was a day tripper
Tripping bright and gay
It took so long to find out, I found out
Oh, can you hear me now
Yeah
I try to please her
She only played one that stands
I try to please her
She only played one that stands
She was a day tripper
The day tripper, yeah
Was a one way ticket
One way ticket, yeah
It took so long to find out, I found out
Oh, I found out
You're out of your mind
Day tripper
I got a good reason
I got a good reason
Yeah

[Outro]
Baby you can 

[?]

[Verse 1]
I was born in Little Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand

I was high top shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then

You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again

[Chorus]
"Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her"
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years

I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
Because I love my baby, love my baby, ah

My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I'm not going nowhere

I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year

Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there

[Chorus]

[x 3]

[Verse 1]
I should have quit you
A long time ago
I should have quit you, baby
A long time ago

[Chorus]
But you got me messing around with you, baby
You got me crying on a killing floor, yeah

[Verse 2]
If I don't follow, yeah
My first mind
If I don't fallow, pretty baby
My first mind
I would have been gone since my second time
Yeah

[Bridge]
Lord knows, right now
I should have been gone
Lord knows, I should have been gone

[Chorus]
But you got me messing around with you, baby
You got me crying on a killing floor, yeah
But you got me messing around with you, baby
You got me crying on a killing floor, yeah

[Chorus]
Hey Izabella

[Verse]
Girl, I'm holding you in my dreams every night
Yeah, but you know good well baby
You know we got this war to fight
Well, I'm calling you under fire
Well, I hope you're receiving me all right

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Girl, I'm fighting this war for the children and you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby
All this blood is for the world of you
All your love
So I hope you save your love, baby
Then I know the fighting is true

[Verse 1]
Shoot down some of those airplanes you've been driving
Especially the ones that fly too low
Shoot down some of those airplanes
Especially the ones that fly you too low
Come on back up to Earth, my friend
Come on back up with me
We all been through the night time, baby
Now let's reap the waves of reality

[Chorus]
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything is possible

[Verse 2]
Playing too much with one toy, baby
Leads, it leads, yeah, Into the foggy
It's so groovy to float around, sometimes
Even a jellyfish will tell you that
I said flotation is groovy and easy
Even a jellyfish will agree to that
Yeah, but old jellyfish been floating so long and so slack
Lord, and don't got a bone in his jelly back
Floating every day and every night, riding high is a risk
Sometimes the wind ain't right

[Chorus]
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything is possible

[Outro]
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of you anything that you wanna do
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything that you wanna do
With the power

From Texas to GA, niggas bleeding your speakerbox
Playas stayin' throwed, ho, putting diamonds off in your socks
Blowing killer, sipping lean, and dropping screens
North Dallas and Aquemini, fool, it's all the same team

[Verse 1]
Mind over matter
Does it matter to any of us?
Don't change the subject
I'm heavy on your love
I missed that train
New York City, it rains
Fly to East L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind

[Chorus]
And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall

[Verse 2]
Mind over matter
I'm in tatters thinkin' about her
Taste my disaster
It's heavy on my tongue
All the lights aglow
Tokyo snows
Go to watch the show
Curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time

[Chorus]
And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall

(I missed that train)
New York City, it rains
(Fly to East L.A.) in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind

Curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time

Mind over matter
Mind over matter
You know you're on my mind

And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?

T.I
Ok, we started catching felonies in Bankhead
Riding through the hood in a hot box
In '96, in the hood, had a trap house
Every day cruise through the city, crack rock
Got a pistol in my pocket and a bankroll
Everybody try me, I don't let the thing go, bust it
I put a whole crew where you can't go, cousin
Homie don't like it but he can't do nothing
Came through busting, I respect that
You violate a mandatory nigga, break that
Walk up, pull out a Smith and Wesson, push it real bad
Now the undercover people left for dead
They came with the OG's hanging, OZ's slanging
Styrofoam, double cup, codeine drinking
You run up 44 B banking, meet you at the crossroad where they don't be singing

[Verse 1]
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 2]
You've been so unavailable
Now, sadly, I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Bridge]
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Outro]
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, know
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
A-B-C-D-E-F
Im a G till end
The end of the road
Look back in the kitchen at the end of the stove
Hey T, looks like we at the end of the O
Choppa 4 in a 20 ounce of Carter 24
Yes sir (Cinema)

You sit on 24s
And we sip on 24s
Head is sittin on a pair of gucci pennyloafs
Yea i get money fuck with bitches that get me more
Now, you know the game same shit different hoes
(See what you know about DJ Cinema: presents Mardi Gras)

[Verse 2]
Who cut the ears and the tail off Mickey Mouse
Never been a rat never had him in the house
Call me captain kangaroo, i got money in my pouch
I don't mean loose change when I say money in the couch
Yea we put the drinks down we pick the two's up
You have a dude tripping? we hit dude up
You ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up
(you ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up)

[Interlude]
Target practice baby
Only thing is Im not the shooter I'm the bullet, Bitch!

[Verse 3]
Weezy fuckin' baby, get em a leash
Young Money, Dipset, you better believe
That gun got me walking like i got irregular knees
I be all over that bread like sesame seeds
Automatic with the money like reggie for 3
Big birds no sesame street
Bitch I'm too clean they ain't messing with me
I'm just tryna see my decimals peek
These niggas lighter than some vegetable meat
These niggas just sweet like a Tahitian treat
Ok they say I'm full of hot air then i release the heat
Spill a nigga from his teeth defeat
You know what im talking bout, you know what i mean?
Like kick the sneak

Yea birdman say you niggas is bitches

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I put that on everything, on my clique
Let me get a couple drinks in my system I go put it down on your bitch
Oh man, I've been putting on for my niggas, and I let 'em put her on
Brand new whip with some petal and some metal they gon' flip that 

[?] on
How y'all niggas gon' act when I pull up in that Maybach with a fucking chauffeur in the front and a view with bitches in the back
And they all want me to, (Touch 'em, touch 'em)
And later on I'm gon', (Fuck 'em, fuck 'em)
I know y'all niggas don't like me, tough titty for you broke hoes
Send them niggas wanna fight me, they gon' leave the club with a broke nose
Y'all keep me going, y'all keep me great
So I'ma do me and haters gon' hate

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I pull up in the drop head I don't think that they really want it
Drunk an eighth then I drop dead I don't think that they know I'm on it
The red light I got stopped there I could tell 12 by only
Showed 'em my paper like "Go on nigga", you got the wrong nigga but
On my momma, and on my dad
I like commas, I don't like dashes
Put that on MJ, I know I'm bad
I'm talking bout' Jordan, ain't talking bout' Jackson

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
All this money but you ain't go do nothing
All that talking but you ain't go do nothing
Pulling out guns but you ain't shoot nothing, nothing
Shit, partner protecting me money ain't nothing
On slam dunk and I ain't playing with you niggas, can't sprang at you niggas, can't stop till' the whole world feel us
Ya feel us, BSM we the real good billas'
He talk a lot of much, that boy just jealous
He don't want no war, ain't no niggas knocking at your front door
In the club, hoodies, goons on the dance floor
Think I'm playing, I call a hundred more (more, more,)
Racks, fuck ones long as money stack
Been on tour six months, I'm back
Lost weight but my pocket still fat

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Young Cash]
Niggas just be talkin' cause they got lips
When I put up them choppers niggas get flipped
Hit 'em in the head, stomach, then I reload my clip
I dunno what y'all done heard
But Young Cash ain't one to play with
Just ask these niggas in the streets
Who had failure to make payments?
Matter fact, they swimmin' with the fishes
I'ma shark just swimmin' with the bitches
And I got your girl with my hand on her ass if I'm coming downtown watching Netflix
Young Cash, I'm a real G (Niggas see it in my eyes)
You tried nigga but everybody gon' see (That you ain't bout' that life)
I'm the best in the game, so everybody know that (I'm a smooth criminal)
And we can come to a trap, they got about nine 

[?] (It's a 

[?] minimum)
On my momma, on my children
On this hood, on this verse
You try me I'll put your face up on a shirt

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Swag so turnt up I walk past a bitch
I don't need a bitch, don't even ask for shit
I got a fly mouth and yea I talk nasty bitch
Yo nigga used to have cash, now he broke as shit
2002 man I was serving massive bricks
Call me and my niggas Pacman the shit
I can't fit in my pants so rubber band the shit
My mama kicked me out cuz she couldn't understand this shit
I wish that I could turn but I'm not an evangelist
I wanna go to church but I feel like a hypocrite
Cuz when that work came in I had to sell this shit
So many P's at the trap then they would smell the shit
It's Guwop

[Chorus: Gucci Mane:]
Answer, answer
Nigga owe me money but the nigga won't answer
Answer, answer
Got a bitch with me, now the bitch won't answer
Answer, answer
I ain't gotta worry bout nothing financial
Answer, answer
I'mma kidnap the bitch and hold the bitch for ransom

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I started trappin in '94, sellin dimes at Texaco
Move the trap to Grisham Road, on I20 with heavy loads
Rap poppin, I let it go
Go back, I never know
I don't like meetin new people, you a real nigga, I never know
I got robbed a long time ago
Never happened again though
Keep me a extendo
Don't know if you friend or foe
You niggas playin Nintendo
I was windin my '74
Standin front of that corner cold
So broke, gonna rob the store
You say yo man is a gangsta
Then why he lyin in that chalk for?
Yo big brother go in the bank for er
Tryna open the vault tho
All my young niggas on go
Keep me one of them bank rolls
I don't fuck with these broke hoes
Diamonds all on my dick ho

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 3: Jackie O]
Text messages, no reply, but you keep sayin that you a real nigga
All lame excuses, they play it out like Hilfiger
This here is my livelihood, blood sweat and tears nigga
Damn right I need my bread, bitch I got bills nigga
We got the money, didn't rent a car
Ain't got the car then wear the jewels
Ain't got the jewels you gon lose yo life and they'll catch yo ass on the evening news
20 minutes to hit my phone
20 minutes and I'mma couter mine
You got 20 minutes to hit my line or 20 niggas gon be runnin all through yo house
You got my number, nigga holler at me
You owe me and I want that
I got a bunch of niggas that's young and silly
When it come to killin they on that
I did my job, I front the pack
Nigga do yo job and run that back
You done lost the work? Nigga hit that lic
I don't give a fuck, bring my money back

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 1]
Early in the morning by the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Come back baby I wish you would
This crying and grieving won't do me no good
Hugging and a-kissing, late at night
You know pretty baby it feels just right
Come back baby what you trying to do?
Turning on me and some other men too
Come back baby give me one more chance
You know I still love you, gonna give you romance
Yeah, romance all night long
In my arms, oh yeah

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Early in the morning by the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Come back baby I wish you would
This crying and grieving won't do me no good

[Outro]
Hey pretty baby I love you so
You know pretty baby it hurts me to see you go
Oh yeah 

[repeat ad inf.]

[Verse]
Aye, Aye, I said tell me what's really going on
Philly back up in this bitch I'm ready, I'm in my bag
Sound like I turned and hit them bitches fast
I wake up early in the morning and go get the cash
Everyday my birthday, I be getting cake bitch
Niggas talk about me when they see me never say shit
Shout to that nigga Puffy cause that Loco got me wasted
Standing on the top just blacking out like I'm a racist
Tip be gotta nigga on some fuck a mixtape shit
Diddy gotta a nigga on some drink Ciroc straight shit
We at King and Diamonds throwing money by the case bitch
I just came back from jail, and I'm balling Lebron James shit
Same shit no different day, swagger blow ya bitch away
I been getting money like my block doing a brick a day
I know niggas dead broke, but they just a lick away
From running in your crib, snatching yours, and being rich today
Hey, hockey team on my wrist bitch
Tell that ho to grab my dick and treat it like a lipstick
Stunt so fucking hard I make my hater have a hiss fit
Nigga you don't feel me you gone smell me like a incense
I been sick, swine flu, matter fact no chicken pox
Wonder how he feel I'm fucking every single bitch he got
I was at the bottom and I crept up on the tippy top
Shining on these niggas like the diamonds in my wrist and watch
I love Nicki Minaj, I swear, y’all, I admit it
I hope one day I can fuck her just to say I fucking hit it
And girl I'm fucking serious I lick it 'fore I stick it
If you ever hear this verse I'm on your top just like a fitted
Uh, and Philly want that back
You won't even have a show you be in Philly coming back
I make sure I save you verses and put you on every track
I swear to god girl I ain't lying I would kill it from the back
Because I'm gone, yeah I know I"m drawling
If I can can get her now, then I just wait 'til I get on
I don't want you to kiss me, I just wanted to bone
I don't want you to kiss me, I just wanted to bone
And you know I will take you down though
All the way to the ground though
If you wanted to keep your bitch you better not bring her 'round though
If I tell her to hit me, then you know that she gone
She be screaming she miss me, instead of calling my phone
Oh shit, mother fucker god damn
Mah is you fuckin' or not, like Cam
I'm out Miami in the RA going ham
P my passenger

[?] stunting in the lamb'
My nigga 

[?] in the lamb' too
Up and down on Collins, bending corners like we bamboo
Stunting on my old hoes they see me be like damn boo
Call me Jackie Turner all these hoes that I done ran through
I'm gone, I tell them bitches that I'm gone

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I asked my little bitch if she seen a brick and she said no
I told that little bitch look at my wrist and she said oh
You on some bullshit, with that point like Eric Snow
My nigga B move them O's like he playing tic tac toe
Now and we both going in, like a got a curfew
You don't get no money, paper shorter than commercial
Let me hear you niggas plotting on me, I'm a murk you
Have my goons at your crib every day like Urkel
One day I go fuck a bitch, then I be like fuck a bitch
Have her try to bust my windows out like Jazmine Sullivan
Cause I got another bitch and she even badder
Looking like Beyonce, but that don't even matter
Cause I ball hard, I play for team Louie
They whole clique suck my dick, that's team chewy
Rocks in the Bezel, all husky face blew it
Since a lil' nigga used to talk that shit like Stewie
Who he, Louie had Louis chicks, Louis shirts, Louis belt
Walked up in the Louis store and tell 'em I want the shelf
Buy the whole mannequin, niggas and they shenanigans
Go get 'em sent to Hahnemann, shoot 'em like we gambling
Or hit 'em like its blackjack bout to get my mac back
Once I trade these handguns, I'm trying to feed my grandson
I'm having million dollar dreams
And hundred dollar nightmares thinking 'bout the cream
Ok, black Impalla, black rims, black tims, black ice
All black everything, flowing through the back night
Black flooded rollie on, looking like a flashlight
Tryna get that black car money bitch cash life

[Intro]
First you get the respect and then you get the money
After you get the money, that's when the power come
You dig?

[Verse]
I'm only 23, living like I'm 32
I just made a 100K and spent it all out with my crew
I be blowing money fast, what the fuck I'm supposed to do?
All this paper I done made, I can't take it to the grave
In a R8 Audi with the motor in the rear
I was nominated youngest baller of the year
Just think a couple months ago, I was locked up on the tier
In a cell but now I'm dropping on these niggas like a tear
For the way I got that Lambo in the back of me
Phantom in the front  of me
Stunting on my old hoes, look what this money done to me
Shout out all them niggas in my hood that ever fronted me
Cause I'm a put them all on and better they run to me
Cause real niggas do real things
If you was real you would've went and bought a real chain (Fraud)
Fake ass niggas playing in the real game
Frontin' on they old block, saying that the deal came
They asking how I get all this power
Cause I be on the grind like 24 hours (Yes sir)
365 dream chasing for a dollar, I been here since yesterday, I ain't even take a shower
More money more power, more power, more business, more bitches
Tryna holla when they see you by the dollar
And the problem when you on that cake
And when you shine, a lot of niggas they be on that hate
If I don't grind then who the fuck gon' put it on my plate?
She say I'm Hollywood, well shit I must be on my way
With my Louis luggage straight to Californ-ia
I hit my nigga K, like meet me by the port by eight
Uh, I had a dream like Mr. King
That I was in a phantom, color Listerine (Ew)
No top, bald headed like Mr. Clean
Shit I ain't claiming these bitches like Billie Jean
I'm just doing something to these niggas really mean
He got the money without the power, what do he mean?
He like the nigga that ride the bench that's playing for a team
That win the champ ain't get no ticks but he still get the rings

[Outro]
You dig me?
You like a nigga
Ya'll niggas got five rings
But you been riding the bench for five years
So that don't make you a nigga with power
You know what I mean?
That don't make you a Kobe nigga
Cause you was riding the bench while niggas was putting in the work
But you was just there and got the rings
You dig me?
That's like a nigga with no power, I'm gone

[Verse 1]
New feeling inside
It's a hot certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Down my soul, baby

[Verse 2]
I can't explain
Going out of my mind
Dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue
Things you say well maybe they're true
I get funny dreams again and again
Knows what it means, but

[Chorus 2]
Can't explain
I think it's love
Say it to you
When I feel blue
I can't explain, no, I can't explain

[Interlude]

[Outro]
You know I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind
Well I'm a worried guy
But I can't explain

[Verse 1]
If you should ever leave me
My life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me

[Chorus]
God only knows what I'd be without you

[Verse 2]
I may not always love you
But as long as there are
Stars above you
You'll never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

[Chorus]
God only knows what I'd be without you

OOOOHH
I like to smoke marijuana, It gives me a deep meditation
I love to draw marijuana

I love to smoke marijuana

Marijuana

[Verse 2]
Smoke, I choke, I blow them O's
In my chest and out my nose

I done smoke all kinds of strands
African, Afghanistan
From the pharmacy, hand in hand
Gettin high with my enginieer
I stay smokin bud with my cameraman
Ounce a day, what I put on

Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Full dog bombs the moon
Devil in a market place
Devil in your bleeding face
Full dog bombs the moon

There's always a moron
Someone to hate
A corporate tie
A wig and a date

No shape, no depth
No underground
What a dog

[Chorus]
Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Full dog bombs the moon
A devil in the market place
A devil in your bleeding face
Full dog bombs the moon
What a dog
We need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality. It isn’t a reality yet. Today, women make up half of the U.S. workforce, but the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes. But unless women and men both say this is unacceptable, things will not change. Men have to demand that their wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters earn more— commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender. Equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect.

Humanity requires both men and women, and we are equally important and need one another. So why are we viewed as less than equal? These old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning. We have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect, so that as they grow up, gender equality becomes a natural way of life. And we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible

We have a lot of work to do, but we can get there if we work together. Women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters. We must demand that we all receive 100 percent of the opportunities

[Verse 1: Shakira]
I left a note on my bedpost
Saying not to repeat yesterday’s mistakes
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory
The way you make me feel, yeah, you got a hold on me
I never met someone so different
Oh, here we go
You're part of me now
You're part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow

[Chorus: Shakira]
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
I can't remember to forget you

[Post-Chorus: Shakira]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I can't remember to forget you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: Rihanna & Shakira, Both]
I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed
Repeat yesterday’s mistakes
What I'm tryna say is not to forget
You see only the good, selective memory
The way he makes me feel like
The way he makes me feel, I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh, there we go
He a part of me now
He a part of me
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow

[Chorus: Shakira & Rihanna]
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight (Oh-oh)
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
I can't remember to forget you

[Bridge: Shakira & Rihanna]
I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I'll do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I'll do anything for that boy
I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I'll do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I'll do anything for that boy

[Chorus: Shakira & Rihanna]
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight (Oh-oh)
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
I can't remember to forget you

[Outro: Shakira & Rihanna]
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight (Oh-oh)
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
I can't remember to forget you

[Verse 1]
My mind runs away to you
With a thought I hope you'll see
Can't see where it's wandered to
But I know where it wants to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waiting patiently
Though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy
And I wanted you to know that

[Chorus]
You're the one, designed for me
A distant stranger, that I will complete
I know you're out there, we're meant to be
So keep your head up, and make it to me

[Verse 2]
So sick of this lonely air
It seems such a waste of breath
So much that I need to share
So much to get off my chest

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waiting patiently
Though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy
And I wanted you to know that

[Chorus]
You're the one, designed for me
A distant stranger, that I will complete
I know you're out there, we're meant to be
So keep your head up, and make it to me

[Outro]
And make it to me
And make it to me
And make it to me
And make it to me

[Verse 1]
Her eyes and words are so icy
Oh, but she burns
Like rum on a fire
Hot and fast and angry as she can be
I walk my days on a wire

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It looks ugly, but it's clean
Oh mama, don't fuss over me

[Chorus]
The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

[Verse 2]
Calls of guilty thrown at me, all while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully, just like she throws
With the arm of her brother

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I want it, it's a crime
That she's not around most of the time

[Chorus 2]
The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

[Verse 3]
Her fight and fury's fiery
Oh, but she looks
Like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful, I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And it's worth it, it's divine
I have this some of the time

[Chorus 2]
The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

[Verse 1]
I had a thought, dear, however scary
About that night, the bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging? What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me from the earth?

[Chorus]
I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

[Verse 2]
I knew that look, dear: eyes always seeking
Was there in someone that dug long ago
So I will not ask you why you were creeping
In some sad way, I already know

[Chorus]
So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

[Chorus]
I could not ask you where you came from
I could not ask and neither could you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We could just kiss like real people do

[Verse 1]
I watch the work of my kin, bold and boyful
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths
Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me

[Chorus]
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

[Verse 2]
Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh, I
Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet

[Chorus]
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
In leash-less confusion, I'll wander the concrete
Wonder if better now having survived
The jarring of judgement and reason's defeat the sweet
Heat of her breath in my mouth; I'm alive

[Chorus]
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

[Chorus: The New Royales & (Pitbull)]
Money got your tongue tied
It's a slow ride up till you're goin' down
Funny how your friends lie
It's a landslide when you wear the crown
(Give it to me)

[Bridge: Pitbull]
The people that you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down (Can't stop me now)
The people that you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down (Can't stop me now)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
They said I couldn't do it, but I did it
Fuck TVT, beat the most attention
Met with all labels they didn't get it
Now I'm taken over, fuck with it
Time to get flithy rich, try to stay not guilty, bitch
They said they used to handle pricks
I believe them when they projects are brick
All they rap about is crack and coke
Knowin' they ain't never dealt crack or coke
Yeah it's a joke but thanks
Cause I'm laughin' all the way to the bank

[Chorus: The New Royales & (Pitbull)]
Money got your tongue tied
It's a slow ride up till you're goin' down
Funny how your friends lie
It's a landslide when you wear the crown
(Give it to me)

[Bridge: Pitbull]
The people that you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down (Can't stop me now)
The people that you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down (Can't stop me now)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
It's not how you fall, it's how you get back up, dawg
Struggle, hustle, fight hard, that's all I know, that's right, dawg
Blood of a king, heart of a lion (Heart of a lion)
Based on rental, pussy boy
Someone please pass me the iron
Death before dishonor
That means for years I've been dyin'
Stop your blood clots cryin'
I'm here to save Private Ryan

[Chorus: The New Royales & (Pitbull)]
Money got your tongue tied
It's a slow ride up till you're goin' down
Funny how your friends lie
It's a landslide when you wear the crown
(Give it to me)

[Bridge: Pitbull]
The people that you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down (Can't stop me now)
The people that you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down (Can't stop me now)
The people that you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down (Can't stop me now)
The people that you see on the way up
Same people you don't see on the way down (Can't stop me now)
(Give it to me)

[Outro: Pitbull]
Can't stop me now
Can't stop me now
Can't stop me now
Can't stop me now

[Verse 1]
All this money in my pocket I be showing off
When they play me in the club them hoes be going off
They heard that Make 'Em Say and they thought I was going soft
But I'm like coca in the pot cause I be going hard hard
Niggas check my resume
Catch me in that Aston with my bad bitch her name Desiree
Fuck shit I don't ever say, my niggas don't ever play
We stunt on shit like everyday and trust me I don't ever hate
I be on that money shit, you be on that funny shit
I never count no dollar bills and never fuck no bummy bitch
She say why you go so hard, cause I be on that hungry shit
I think I ate so many Benjamins my fucking tummy sick
Spit up all my shit up
Nigga play around with me I guarantee you he get hit up
This a stickup, take your ho
Niggas tried to take my flow but I just had to snatch it back
You know I ain't having that
Matter fact you can keep em cuz I switch em like my bitches
And I change em like my clothes and its the same just like my hoes
Niggas ain't fucking with me
Out my range, just like my rolls
Because I shine even in the dark and in the light I even glow
Every where I go out
All I do is show out
Me against these other rapper niggas, that's a blowout
I could fuck your girlfriend, we don't even go out
She say she on the monthly ok Imma fuck her throat out
You mad we eatin' doe

[?] got them bricks he moved them birds just like Meechie though
Bring 30 tomorrow and that's for sure that he gone feed you though
Cuz my swag on 100 and I got to feed your flow
LA down MIA, MIA to Philly bitch
Catch me out in ATL with TI and we killing shit
We be photo posing, polo horsing and I'm willing
He like hello all my diamonds vvs yellow and I'm stealing shit
Tykeem he stay killing shit, you know I'mma murder it
I can make a nigga beat sound like you never heard of it
40,000 people with a mixtape, no nervous shit
I step up on the stage and treat that bitch like I was Jay, ayy
All I do is show out! I say all I do is show out! I say all I do is show out!
Show! show out! show out!

[Verse 1]
Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up
Climbs across his bike and he's away
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street
Back to mother, it's another empty day

[Chorus 1]
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy
Uncle Arthur still reads comics
Uncle Arthur follows Batman

[Verse 2]
Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion
Sally was the real thing, not just lust

[Chorus 2]
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly
Uncle Arthur and his new bride
Uncle Arthur follows Sally

[Verse 3]
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop
He gets his pocket money, he's well-fed

[Cohrus 3]
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks
Uncle Arthur past the river
Uncle Arthur down the high street
Uncle Arthur follows mother

[Intro]
La la la la la la, la la la la la la la

[Verse 1]
A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face
My summer girl takes little backward steps away
Jack Frost took her hand and left me, Jack Frost ain't so cool

[Chorus]
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat because I feel cold

[Verse 2]
And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away
Not like before, her smile was warm in yesterday
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand

[Chorus]
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat because I feel cold

[Verse 3]
See my eyes, my windowpane
See my tears like gentle rain
That's the memory of the summer day

[Chorus]
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat because I feel cold
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat because I feel cold

[Outro]
La la la la la la 

[repeat]
Rubber Band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand

Rubber Band
In 1910, I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes

Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune
Oh

Rubber Band
Won't you play a haunting theme again to me
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea?
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon

(Oh, play that theme)

Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in lively parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love
Rubber Band
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of your band, oh

[Outro]
Oh yeah
I hope you break your baton
There is a happy land where only children live
They don't have the time to learn the ways
Of you, sir, Mr. Grownup
There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there
Mr. Grownup
Go away sir

Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's going to buy a kite
Jimmy's ill with chickenpox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us

Mother calls, but we don't hear
There's lots more things to do
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet
But we will be, very shortly

Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray
There is a happy land where only children live
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed, sir
Mr. Grownup
Go away sir

Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup

[Intro]
Here is the news
According the latest world population survey
The figures have reached danger point, my god
London 15 million 75 thousand
New York 80 million
Paris 15 million and 30
China 1000 million
Billington-Spa: lots

[Verse 1]
My studies include exophagy
I formed my own society
To crush the power of fecundity
The world will overpopulate
Unless you claim infertility
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah

[Chorus]
We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

[Verse 2]
I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel
That they are not infertible
The crops are few, the cattle gone
There's only one way to linger on
So who will buy a drink for me, your
Messiah

[Bridge]
Achtung, achtung, these are your orders
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their
Allotted amount of air
Will be slaughtered and cremated
One only cubic foot of air is allowed
I have prepared a document, legalising mass abortion
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide

[Chorus]
We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

[Verse 3]
You don't seem to hear me clear
Do I talk about your sphere?
Let me explain my project dear
Show you how I'll save the world
Or let it die within the year
Why do you look that way at me, your messiah

[Chorus]
We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

[Outro]
We are hungry men
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to eat you
When I live my dream, I'll take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you
Happy at the sound of your voice

Baby, I'll slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find, that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever
When I live my dream

When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me
And the empty man you left behind
It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me
Only love can live in my dream

I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish
Wish, and the storm will fade away
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an overture
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream
When I live my dream, please be there to meet me
Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave
Then we can live in our new land

Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm gonna make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream

[Verse 1]
Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Botella lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule

[Chrous]
Silly boy blue, blue
Silly boy blue

[Verse 2]
Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill

[Chorus]
Silly boy blue, blue
Silly boy blue

[Verse 3]
You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die

[Bridge]
La la la la la la la la la la 

[x2]
La la la la la 

[x2]

[Chorus]
Silly boy blue, blue
Silly boy blue

[Verse 4]
Child of Tibet, you're a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song

[Chorus]
Silly boy blue, blue
Silly boy blue
Silly boy blue, blue
Silly boy blue

[Chorus]
Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red

[Verse 1]
Rich men's children running past
Their fathers dressed in hose
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
Gazing eyes and running wild
Past the stocks and over stiles
Kiss the window merry child
But come and buy my toys

[Verse 2]
You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
Reaped it with a sharpened scythe, threashed it with a quill
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will
Now your watching's over, you must play with girls and boys
Leave the parsley on the stalls
Come and buy my toys

[Verse 3]
You shall own a cambric shirt
You shall work your father's land
But now you shall play in the market square
Till you'll be a man

[Chorus]
Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red
Let me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
Once he had a name, now he plays our game
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang

Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong
Because she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang

Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids have paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang

You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion, but at least you're in
At least you're in

This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices ain't so stiff
15 bob a go, afraid that's past a joke
This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang
This is what to do now that you're here
Sit 'round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang

[Verse 1]
She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back
And never took her out
She wore a trenchcoat khaki
Her hobnail boots were full of holes

[Chorus]
She's got medals

[Verse 2]
Her mother called her Mary, but she changed her name to Tommy, she's a one, oh
She went and joined the army, passed the medical
Don't ask me how it's done
They sent her to the front line
Fighting for her country's name

[Chorus]
She's got medals

[Verse 3]
She got very tired of picking up girls
Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls
Then the enemy dropped a bomb
Survivors there were none

[Verse 4]
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed
You can see her ghost, but that's a lie because the naughty woman isn't dead
She deserted on the previous morning
Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
Called herself Eileen
Came to London town
Now she's settled down

[Chorus]
She's got medals

[Verse 1]
This girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the pictures of herself
Every magazine on every shelf

[Verse 2]
This girl is maid of Bond Street
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs

[Verse 3]
This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
Buys the Daily News
But passengers don't smile at her
On no, don't smile at her

[Verse 4]
This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy that she once knew
Doesn't want to know her any more

[Verse 5]
And this girl is a lonely girl
Everything she wants is hers
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time, to love, all the time

[Verse 6]
This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesn't have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

[Verse 6]
And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs

[Verse 1]
There's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers, all that jazz
Till the war come along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot

[Verse 2]
And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
"Ah-choo, excuse me"

[Bridge]
Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair
And you put it in your pocket

"God, it's pouring down"

[Verse 3]
Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket

[Verse 4]
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Say "ah-choo!"
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10 and full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, oh God

[Verse 5]
No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes, my friend
And this one here's for you

"Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
Bloody obscene, (crikey) catch pneumonia or something in this rain..."

[Verse 1]
Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to
You won't be the first or last

[Verse 2]
It must strain you to look down
So far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me
In his house could do for you

[Verse 3]
I'm the cream
Of the great Utopia dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen

[Verse 4]
I'm a Phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye socket's empty
See nothing but pain
I keep havin' this brainstorm
About twelve times a day

[Chorus]
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me
Quite amazed
As I am unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed

[Verse 5]
I've got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a Queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream

[Chorus]
So now you could spend your morning talking with me
Quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed

[Verse 6]
Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching

[Chorus]
So now, you should spend the morning, lying to your father
Quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazed
I'm not following

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah
Don't sit down
Don't sit down
Don't sit down

[Verse 1]
The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So, rest your head and
Read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do?

[Chorus 1]
I'm not quite sure what
We're supposed to do
So, I've been writing just for you

[Verse 2]
They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark, well so do I

[Chorus 2]
I'm not quite sure
What you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay

[Verse 3]
He makes you laugh, he brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake?

[Chorus 3]
I'm not quite sure what
I'm supposed to do
So, I'll just write some love to you
Do, do, do, do

[Chorus 1]
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you
That sets the test

[Verse 1]
So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
"I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul
...dry
I crushed my heart
To ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can They spare
What of me?
Who praised Their efforts
To be free?
Words of strength and care
And sympathy
I opened doors
That would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide
For little pay
I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me

[Chorus 1]
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you
That sets the test

[Verse 2]
So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word
"We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men, but Ours
We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill Our needs
Now We are strong
And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
The silent guns of love
Will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt
Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
On slogans such as
"Wish You Could Hear
Love Is All We Need
Kick Out The Jams
Kick Out Your Mother
Cut Up Your Friend
Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End
And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
And We Can Force You to Be Free
And We Can Force You to Believe"
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
"I believe in the Power of Good
I Believe in the State of Love
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right"
And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
On the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich
And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow

[Bridge]
And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe
And We Want to Live
Oh, We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live

[Outro]
Live
Live
Live

[Verse 1]
In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

[Verse 2]
Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know"
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
Well he laughed insane and quipped Khalil Gibran
And I cried for all the others until the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

[Verse 3]
So I said "So long" and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the morals of this magic spell
Negotiate my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking, my cheeks aflame
He said, you'll never go down to the Gods again
(Turn around, go back!)
He struck the ground, a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said, do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back!)
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said, do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back!)
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Day after day
They send my friends away
To mansions cold and grey
To the far side of town
Where the thin men stalk the streets
While the sane stay underground

[Verse 2]
Day after day
They tell me I can go
They tell me I can blow
To the far side of town
Where it's pointless to be high
Because it's such a long way down

[Pre-Chorus]
So I tell them that
I can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm
I will do me harm
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all (am I?)
Don't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be
Just my librium and me
And my E.S.T. makes three

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me

[Bridge]
Where can the horizon lie
When a nation hides
Its organic minds in a cellar, dark and grim
They must be very dim

[Verse 3]
Day after day
They take some brain away
Then turn my face around
To the far side of town
And tell me that it's real
Then ask me how I feel

[Pre-Chorus]
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all
Don't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be
My libido's split on me
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy

[Chorus]
Because I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sadmen roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me

[Outro]
Zane, Zane, Zane, Ouvre le Chien
Zane, Zane, Zane, Ouvre le Chien

[Verse]
Pack a pack horse up and rest up here on
Black Country Rock
You never know, you might find it here
On Black Country Rock
Pack a pack horse up and rest up here on
Black Country Rock
You never know, you might find it here
On Black Country Rock

[Chorus]
Some say the view is crazy
But you may adopt another point of view
So if it's much too hazy
You can leave my friend and me with fond "À Dieu"

[Verse]
Pack a pack horse up and rest up here on
Black Country Rock
You never know, you might find it here
On Black Country Rock
Pack a pack horse up and rest up here on
Black Country Rock
Never know, you might find it here
On Black Country Rock

[Chorus]
Some say the view is crazy
But you may adopt another point of view
So if it's much too hazy
You can leave my friend and me with fond "À Dieu"

[Outro]
Some say the view is crazy
But you may adopt another point of view
So if it's much too hazy
You can leave my friend and me with fond "À Dieu"
Ah!

[Verse 1]
He looked a lot like Che Guevara
Drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion
Such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang

[Chorus]
Panic in Detroit
I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home
I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

[Verse 2]
He laughed at accidental sirens
That broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive

[Chorus]
Panic in Detroit
I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home
I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

[Bridge]
Putting on some clothes, I made my way to school
And I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights

{Verse 3}
Having scored a trillion dollars
Made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table
A gun and me alone
I ran to the window, looked for a plane or two

[Chorus]
Panic in Detroit
He'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust."
I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
{Instrumental Outro}
Please trip them gently, they don't like to fall
Oh by jingo
There's no room for anger, we're all very small
Oh by jingo
We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts
From the skies, from paradise
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball
Won't someone invite them, they're just taller children
That's all
After all

Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown
Oh by jingo
So hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down
Oh by jingo
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence, they're just older children
That's all
After all
I sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords
With my words
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called
But the thought just occurred
We're nobody's children
At all
After all

Live till your rebirth and do what you will
Oh by jingo
Forget all I've said, please bear me no ill
Oh by jingo

[Outro]
After all, after all

[Verse 1]
I count the corpses on my left, I find I'm not so tidy
So I better get away, better make it today
I've cut twenty-three down since Friday
But I can't control it
My face is drawn, my instinct still emotes it

[Chorus]
I slashed them cold, I killed them dead
I broke the gooks, I cracked their heads
I'll bomb them out from under the beds
But now I've got the running gun blues

[Verse 2]
It seems the peacefuls stopped the war
Left generals squashed and stifled
But I'll slip out again tonight
'Cause they haven't taken back my rifle
For I promote oblivion
And I'll plug a few civilians

[Chorus]
I'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead
I'll break them gooks, I'll crack their heads
I'll slice them till they're running red
But now I've got the running gun blues

[Verse 1]
Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
All the night and all the day
Hide and seek's the game you play
Treat me as sure as sin

Oh Rosalyn, yeah Rosalyn

[Verse 2]
Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
When I'm holding you so tight
It's so hard to say goodnight
It's you that I love now can't you see?

[Chorus]
Do you really love me, do you love me true
Do you really love me Rosalyn?
Yeah got to know, yeah got to know
Yeah got to know Rosalyn

[Verse 2]
Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
When I'm holding you so tight
It's so hard to say goodnight
It's you that I love now can't you see?

[Chorus]
Do you really love me, do you love me true
Do you really love me Rosalyn?
Yeah got to know, yeah got to know
Yeah got to know Rosalyn

[Outro]
Yeah got to know, yeah got to know
Yeah got to know Rosalyn
Rosalyn
Yeah Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, ooh-yeah, ah

[Verse]
President Joe once had a dream
The world held his hand, gave their pledge
So he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine
They called it the Prayer, its answer was law
Its logic stopped war, gave them food
How they adored till it cried in its boredom
"Please don't believe in me
Please disagree with me
Life is too easy
A plague seems quite feasible now
Or maybe a war
Or I may kill you all"

[Chorus]
Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine

[Bridge]
I need you flying, and I'll show that dying
Is living beyond reason, sacred dimension of time
I perceive every sign, I can steal every mind

[Chorus]
Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine

[Chorus]
Ohhhhh... here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Oh, yeah (here comes the night)

[Verse 1]
I can see right out my window walking down the street my girl
With another guy
His arms around her
Like it used to be with me
Oh it makes me want to die

[Chorus]
Yeah, here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Yeah... (here comes the night)

[Verse 2]
There they go, funny how they look so good together
Wonder what is wrong with me
Why can't I accept
The fact she's chosen him
And simply let them be?

[Chorus]
Yeah, here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Yeah... (here comes the night)

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3]
Oh she's with him
He's turning down the lights
Now he's holding her the way I used to do
I can see her closing her eyes
And telling him lies
Exactly like she told me too

[Outro]
Oh, here it comes

Here comes the night

[Repeat and Ad Lib to Fade]

[Verse 1]
We met upon a hill
The night was cool and still
She sucked my dormant will
Mother, she blew my brain
I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold

[Verse 2]
I had no time to spare
I grabbed her golden hair
And threw her to the ground
Father, she caved my head
Oh Lord, the things she said
My God, she should be told

[Bridge]
I was very smart
Broke the gentle hearts
Of many young virgins
I was quick on the ball
Left them so lonely
They'd just give up trying
Then she took my head and
Smashed it up
Kept my young blood rising
Crushed me mercilessly
Kept me going around
So she don't know I crave her so-o-o

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'll give my love in vain
To reach that peak again
We met upon a hill
Mother, she blew my brain
I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold

[Verse 1]
When all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with superfear
Their tragic endless lives could heave nor sigh
In solemn, perverse serenity
Wondrous beings chained to life

[Chorus 1]
Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a supergod cries

[Verse 2]
Where all were minds in uni-thought
Powers weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh
A chance to die, to turn to mold

[Chorus 2]
Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries
Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod dies

[Verse 1]
Emily tries but misunderstands
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams 'til tomorrow

[Chorus]
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

[Verse 2]
Soon after dark Emily cries
Gazing at trees in sorrow, hardly a sound 'til tomorrow

[Chorus]
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river for ever and ever
Emily

[Chorus]
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

[Verse 1]
Well, don't you worry 'bout what's been on my mind
I'm in no hurry, I can take my time
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tired
Out of my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm h-h-h-high

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

[Verse 2]
I feel so strong that I can't disguise, oh my
Well, I just can't apologise, no
Don't hang me up but don't let me down
We could have fun just by groovin' around
And around and around

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

[Bridge]
Oh, you know I'm smiling baby
You need some guiding baby
I'm just deciding baby

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

[Verse 3]
This doesn't happen to me every day
No excuses I've got anyway, hey
I'll satisfy your every need
And I know you'll satisfy me, oh my-my-my, my-my

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together

[Verse 4]
They said we were too young
Our kind of love was no fun
But our love comes from above
Do it!
Let's make love
Hoo!

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now!

[Verse 1]
Oh, little baby
You know I've been away
Oh, little baby
You know I'll come today
Don't you know that

[Chorus]
Everything's alright
(everything's alright)
Everything's alright
Everything's alright
(everything's alright, babe)

[Post-Chorus 1]
Let me hold your hand and be your loving man (all night)
Let me hold your hand and be your loving man (all night)
Let me hold your hand and be your loving man (all night, alright!)

[Verse 2]
Oh, little baby
You know I feel so good
Oh, little baby
I never knew I could
And don't you know that

[Chorus]
Everything's alright
(everything's alright)
Everything's alright
Everything's alright
(everything's alright, babe)

[Post-Chorus 2]
Let me give you loving like nobody can (all night)
Let me give you loving like nobody can (all night)
Let me give you loving like nobody can (all night, alright!)

[Bridge 1]
Let me hold your hand and be your loving man
Let me hold your hand and be your loving man
Let me hold your hand and be your loving man

[Bridge 2]
No, no, no, no, no, that's a-loving you
(Must have been you, I'm going all night loving you)
No, no, no, no, no, I'll be good for you

[Chorus]
Everything's alright
(everything's alright)
Everything's alright
Everything's alright
(everything's alright, babe)

[Post-Chorus 2]
Let me give you loving like nobody can (all night)
Let me give you loving like nobody can (all night)
Let me give you loving like nobody can (all night, alright!)

[Outro]
Everything's alright
Everything's alright
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Wake up, you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

[Verse 2]
What are we coming to?
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned what we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

[Chorus]
Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior

[Verse 3]
Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself, they belong to you
They're the start of the coming race
The Earth is a bitch, we've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

[Chorus]
Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Let me make it plain
Gotta make way for the Homo Superior

[Verse]
The tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
The mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws
They've opened shops down Westside
Will all the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky

[Verse 1]
She'll come, she'll go
She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky oil
The lady from another grinning soul
Cologne she'll wear
Silver and Americard
She'll drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta

[Chorus]
And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end

[Verse 2]
She'll come, she'll go
She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view

[Chorus]
And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end

[Chorus]
Will you stay in our lovers' story?
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks hung up on romancing

Will you stay in our lovers' story?
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks hung up on romancing

[Verse 1]
We bought a lot of things to keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow and a book of rules
On what to say to people when they pick on you
'Cause if you stay with us you're going to be pretty kooky too

[Chorus]
Will you stay in our lovers' story?
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks hung up on romancing

[Verse 2]
And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up this old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching other people's dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire and take the car downtown

[Chorus]
Will you stay in our lovers' story?
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks hung up on romancing

Will you stay in our lovers' story?
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks hung up on romancing

[Verse 1]
Oh my love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wanderer
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand
Your strange demand
To 'collocate' my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place
I've no defence
I've got to keep my veil on my face

[Pre-Chorus]
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

[Chorus]
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

[Verse 2]
You're fey, Janine
A tripper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown
So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere

[Pre-Chorus]
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

[Chorus]
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

[Verse 1]
Monday morning feels so bad
Everybody seems to nag me
Coming Tuesday I feel better
Even my old man looks good
Wednesday just don't go
Thursday goes too slow
I've got Friday on my mind

[Chorus]
(See my baby)
Gonna have fun in the city
(feel like fucking you)
(Do my baby screw)
Be with my girl
She's so pretty
(all I want to do)
(I will go crazy)
She looks fine tonight
(zoom zoom zoom)
She is out of sight to me (so divine)
(Tonight) I spend my bread
(Tonight) I lose my head
(Tonight) I've got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind

[Verse 2]
Do the five day drag once more (Monday blue)
There is nothing else that bugs me
More than working for the rich men (poor man, beggar
Man, thief)
Hey I'll change that scene one day
Today I might be mad
Tomorrow I'll be glad
'Cause I'll have Friday on my mind

[Chorus]
(See my baby)
Gonna have fun in the city
(feel like fucking you)
(Do my baby screw)
Be with my girl
She's so pretty
(all I want to do)
(I will go crazy)
She looks fine tonight
(zoom zoom zoom)
She is out of sight to me (so divine)
(Tonight) I spend my bread
(Tonight) I lose my head
(Tonight) I've got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind

[Ad lib to Fade]

[Verse 1]
I recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And we'd speak of a Swedish room
Of hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise...
Some things we could do

[Chorus]
In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An Occasional Dream

[Verse 2]
And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
Between the sheets of summer
Bathed in blue...
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago
And I still can't touch your name
For the days of fate
Were strong for you...
Danced you far from me

[Chorus]
In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mine

[Verse 1]
Fill your heart with love today
Don't play the game of time
Things that happened in the past
Only happened in your mind
Only in your mind
Oh, forget your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And you'll be free, yeah
The writing's on the wall
Free, yeah
And you can know it all if you choose
Just remember, lovers never lose

[Chorus]
'Cause they are free, of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love cleans the mind and makes it free

[Verse 2]
Oh, happiness is happening
The dragons have been bled
Gentleness is everywhere
And fear's just in your head
Only in your head, fear is in your head
Only in your head, so forget your head

[Pre-Chorus]
And you'll be free
The writing's on the wall
Free, yeah
And you can know it all if you choose
Just remember, lovers never lose

[Chorus]
Because they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love will clean your mind and make you
Fuh-ree-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee, yeah!

[Outro]
Free-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Free-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Free-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Free-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Free-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Free-yeah

[Verse 1]
Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

[Verse 2]
Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh, "It's the madness in his eyes"
As he breaks the night to cry:

[Verse 3]
It's really me
Really you and really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you and really Me
You'll lose me, though I'm always
Really free

[Verse 4]
And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild-Eyed Boy from Freecloud

[Verse 5]
And the village dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild-Eyed Boy from Freecloud
And the women once proud clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand

[Verse 6]
And the Magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy said
"Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down"
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the Wise Boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled back to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain track

[Intro]
This is "Andy Warhol" and it's take one, now take one
It's— it's Warhol, actually
What did I say?
Hol, it's Hol as in holes
What? Andy Warhol
Andy Warhol-hol, like hol—hol—
"Andy Warhol" take one
Ha
Are you ready?
Yeah, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1]
Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two New Pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

[Chorus]
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all

[Verse 2]
Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wakes up on the sea
Be sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint
And he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

[Chorus]
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all

[Verse 1]
I'm on my own, nowhere to roam
I tell you, baby, don't want no home
I wander 'round, feet off the ground
I even go from town to town
I said I think this rock is grand
Say I'll be your man

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

[Chorus]
I met this chick the other day
And then to me, she said she'll stay
I get this pad, just like a cave
And then we'll have our live-in maid
And then I'll lead her on the ground
My head is spinning round

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

[Verse 3]
I, I, I, I, I need a lover who's someone new
And then to her, I will be true
I'll buy her furs and pretty things
I will even buy a wedding ring
But until then I'll settle down
Say I'll be your man

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

[Outro]
But until then I'll settle down
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down

[Verse 1]
I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind

[Chorus]
Crying God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

[Verse 2]
Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor

[Chorus]
Crying God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
Hey!

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, hear this Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
Some words had truthful vengeance
They could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more

[Chorus]
Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

[Verse 2]
You gave your heart to every bedsit room
At least a picture on the wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
The paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising, we'd rather be scared
Together than alone=-

[Chorus]
Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

{Instrumental Bridge}

[Verse 3]
Now, hear this, Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he'd gaze a while down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So we're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
Give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity

[Chorus]
Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Ah, a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Oh, here she comes
Ooh, here she comes
Oh, here she comes, ooh

{Instrumental Outro}

[Verse 1]
Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make man more wise
Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will it seem the same

[Chorus]
(Come tomorrow), will I be older
(Come tomorrow), maybe a soldier
(Come tomorrow), may I be bolder than today

[Verse 2]
Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been
Boy into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands

[Chorus]
(Come tomorrow), will I be older
(Come tomorrow), maybe a soldier
(Come tomorrow), may I be bolder than today

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Soon I hope that I will find
A seed within my mind
That won't disgrace my kind

[Intro]
"Maybe I should announce it, should I?
Memory of a free festival."

[Verse 1]
The Children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

[Verse 2]
Touch, We touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

[Verse 3]
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the topest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something just the same

[Verse 4]
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes
And saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained

[Outro]
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party

[Verse 1]
I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I'm watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all time low
'Cause she's hoping to score
So I can't see her letting him go

Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind
Oh, not her

[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
Oh, and she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it
She don't make false claims
But she's a queen, and such are queens
That your laughter is sucked in their brains

Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
Yes, she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down

[Refrain]
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say
No, no, no?

[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

[Verse 3]
So I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh, the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah, I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
And he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all

[Refrain]
It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say
No, no, no?

[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

[Outro]
Ooh
You becha
Oh, yeah
Uh-huh
Mmm

[Verse 1]
I can go anyway (way I choose)
I can live anyhow (win or lose)
I can go anywhere (for something new)

[Chorus]
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

[Verse 2]
I can do anything (right or wrong)
I can talk anyhow (and get along)
I don't care anyway (I never lose)

[Chorus]
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

[Bridge]
Nothing gets in my way, not even locked doors
Don't follow the lines that been laid before
I get along anyway I care
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere

[Verse 3]
I can go anyway (way I choose)
I can live anyhow (win or lose)
I can go anywhere (for something new)

[Chorus]
Anyway, anyway, anywhere I choose

[Outro]
Anyway
Anyway I choose!
I wanna go
Do it myself, do it myself
Do it myself, do it myself
Anyway
Anyway I choose!

[Verse 1]
And so the story goes, they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie like the hope it was
And the goodmen tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of brawn were nicely shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss

[Chorus 1]
Sighing, they swirl through the streets like the crust of the sun
The Bewlay Brothers

In our wings that bark
Flashing teeth of brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, and we were gone
Hanging out with your dwarf men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions

[Verse 2]
I was stone and he was wax
So he could scream and still relax, unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Thru our veins and lo! It was midnight back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today

[Chorus 2]
And it was stalking time for the moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers

With our backs on the arch
And the Devil may be here
But he can't sing about that
Oh, and we were gone
Real cool traders
We were so turned on
You thought we were fakers

[Verse 3]
Now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned
The factor max that proved the fact is melted down
And woven on the edging of my pillow
And my brother lays upon the rocks
He could be dead, he could be not, he could be you
He's chameleon, comedian, Corinthian and caricature

[Chorus 3]
Shooting up pie-in-the-sky
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the bad
The Bewlay Brothers

In the blessed and cold
In the crutch-hungry dark
Was where we flayed our mark
Oh, and we were gone
Kings of oblivion
We were so turned on
In the mind-warp pavilion

[Outro]
Lay me place and bake me pie
I'm starving for me gravy
Leave my shoes, and door unlocked
I might just slip away, hey

Just for the day, (hey) hey
Please come away, hey
Just for the day, hey
Please come away, hey
Please come away
Just for the day
Please come away
Please come away
Please come away
Please come away
Away
Away

[Verse 1]
In my life I've never stopped
To worry about a thing
Opened up and shouted out
And never tried to see
Wondering if I've done wrong
Will this depression last for long
Won't you tell me

[Chorus]
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone

[Verse 2]
Once we had an easy ride
And always felt the same
Time was on our side
And I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days
Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And Mummy didn't need no boys
Won't you tell me

[Chorus]
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone

[Verse 3]
Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
Get your feet back on the ground
Won't you tell me

[Chorus]
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone

Up every evening 'bout half eight or nine
I give my complete attention to a very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a, he's got more channels, a

[Refrain]
So hologramic, oh, my TVC 15

I brought my baby home, she, she sat around forlorn
She saw my TVC 15, baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, my, my, she crawled right in my

"Send back my dream test baby, she's my main feature"
My TVC 15, yeah, he just stares back unblinking

[Refrain]
So hologramic, oh, my TVC 15

[Verse 4]
One of these nights I may just jump down that rainbow way
Be with my baby, then we'll spend some time together

So hologramic oh my TVC 15

My baby's in there someplace, love's rating in the sky

[Verse 1]
This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

[Verse 2]
Heart wrecker, heart wrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell

[Verse 1]
Love me, love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind

[Verse 2]
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind

[Chorus]
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me

[Verse 3]
Don't you know you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind

[Chorus]
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me

Don't you know you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures in the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind

[Outro]
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

[Verse 1]
You always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet

[Pre-Chorus]
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand

[Chorus]
When you rock and roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock and roll with me

[Verse 2]
Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting
I've found a door which lets me out!

[Chorus]
When you rock and roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock and roll with me

[Chorus]
Oh, when you rock and roll with me
There's no one else I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
When you rock and roll with me

[Outro]
When you rock and roll, when you rock and roll with me
No one else I'd rather, I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears, I'm in tears
When you rock and roll with me

[Intro]
I've got to use her

[Verse 1]
Every time I feel fascination
I just can't stand still, I've got to use her
Every time I think of what she put me through, dear
Fascination moves, sweeping near me
Still, I take ya

[Chorus]
(Fascination) fascination
(Sho'nuff) fascination
(Takes a part of me) takes a part of me
(Can a heartbeat) can a heartbeat
(Live in the fever) live in the fever
(Raging inside of me?)
(Fascination) fascination
(Oh, yeah) oh, yeah
(Takes a part of me) takes a part of me
(I can't help it) I can't help it
(I've got to use her) I've got to use her
(Every time) fascination comes around
Ooh
(Fascination)

[Verse 2]
Your soul is calling like when I'm walking
Seems that everywhere I turn I hope you're waiting for me
I know that people think that I'm a little crazy
Ooh, but pleasure seeks this thing, I think I like fascination
Still, I take ya

[Chorus]
(Fascination) fascination
(Sho'nuff) fascination
(Takes a part of me) come on, come on, come on, come on
(Can a heartbeat) can my heartbeat
(Live in the fever) live in the fever
(Raging inside of me?) raging inside of me?
(Fascination) fascination
(Oh, yeah) oh, yeah
(Takes a part of me) come on, come on, come on, come on
(I can't help it) I can't help it
(I've got to use her) I've got to
(Every time) every time
Fascination comes around

[Chorus]
(Fascination) sure enough
(Sho'nuff) takes a part of me
(Takes a part of me) can a heartbeat
(Can a heartbeat) live in the fever
(Live in the fever) raging
(Raging inside of me?) fascination
(Fascination) fascination
(Oh, yeah) fascination
(Takes a part of me) fascinate, ah, oh babe

Fascination comes around

Fascination
Takes a part of me
Can a heartbeat live in the fever raging inside of me?
Fascination takes a part of me
I can't help it, got to use her
Every time, every time
Every time fascination comes around
Something kind of hit me today
I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way
People will hold us to blame
It hit me today, it hit me today

We're taking it hard all the time
Why don't we pass it by?
Just reply, you've changed your mind
We're fighting with the eyes of the blind
Taking it hard, taking it hard
Yet now

We feel that we are paper, choking on you nightly
They tell me: son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far
For we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin
For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy
You're just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuck-me pumps
And your nimble dress that trails

Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead
One thing kind of touched me today
I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night
Knowing it's right, knowing it's right

Now I'm hoping some one will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared
Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care, someone will care

But now
We're today's scrambled creatures
Locked in tomorrow's double feature
Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell
It's a twenty-four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell
And the streets are full of pressmen
Bent on getting hung and buried
And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt
Who sucks you while you're sleeping
It's the theatre of financiers
Count them, fifteen 'round a table
White and dressed to kill
Oh, caress yourself, my juicy
For my hands have all but withered

Oh, dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead
We are the dead
We are the dead

[Verse 1]
Someday they won't let you, now you must agree
The times they are a-telling and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw of 1984

[Verse 2]
They'll split your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell you that you're eighty, but brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there
Beware the savage jaw of 1984

[Chorus]
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore)
(Mor-or-or-or-ore)

[Verse 3]
I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side
I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '65
Beware the savage jaw of 1984

[Chorus]
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore)
(Mor-or-or-or-ore)

[Outro]
1984
1984
1984
1984
1984
1984

[Verse 1]
Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don't live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulsars unreal
He'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
He'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin
Then we can really begin

[Bridge]
Please saviour, saviour, show us
Hear me, I'm graphically yours

[Chorus]
Someone to claim us, someone to follow
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us, someone like you
We want you Big Brother, Big Brother

[Verse 2]
I know you think you're awful square
But you made everyone and you've been every where
Lord I think you’d overdose if you knew what’s going down

[Chorus]
Someone to claim us, someone to follow
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us, someone like you

Someone to claim us, someone to follow
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us, someone like you

Someone to claim us, someone to follow
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us, someone like you

[Outro]
We want you Big Brother

[Chorus]
Everything will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight

Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Watching them come and go
The Templars and the Saracens
They're travelling the holy land
Opening telegrams
Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of Coeur de Leon
Salvation for the mirror blind

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you pray
All your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear

[Chorus 1]
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers, they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan
Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you pray
All your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear

[Chorus 1]
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers, they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

[Chorus 2]
You pray til the break of dawn
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And you’ll believe you’re loving the alien
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
They pulled in just behind the fridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

[Chorus]
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All right)
She wants the young American

[Verse 2]
Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang
But Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries "Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"

[Chorus]
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All right)
But she wants the young American

[Bridge]
All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?"

[Chorus]
All night
He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(He wants the young American)
(All right) All right
He wants the young American

[Verse 3]
Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have you been the un-American?
Just you and your idol sing falsetto
'bout Leather, leather everywhere
And not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro-Sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and

[Chorus]
(All night)
All night, you want the young American
(Young American) young American
(You want the young American) All right
All right
You want the young American

[Verse 4]
You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?

[Chorus]
All night
I want the young American
(Young American) young American
(I want the young American)
All right
I want the young American, young American

[Outro]
(Young American, young American)
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want I, I want you
(Young American, young American)
(I want the young American)
(All right)
All I want is the young American
(Young American, young American)
(I want the young American)
(All night)

[Verse 1]
Don't look down
They're making sort of crazy sounds
Don't look down, no
Don't know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield

[Chorus]
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

[Verse 2]
I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name

[Chorus]
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

[Verse 3]
When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear

[Chorus]
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

[Verse 4]
No I won't be bored I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake

[Chorus]
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

[Intro]
(Hey, it ain't over)

[Verse 1]
Me, I hope that I'm crazy
I feel you driving and you're only the wheel
Slow down, let someone love you
Ooh, I've never touched you since I started to feel
If there's nothing to hide me
Then you've never seen me hanging naked and wired

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody lied, I say it's hip
To be alive

[Chorus]
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
(Ooh, that's all you've got to do)
(Ooh, it ain't over)

[Verse 2]
Me, I'm fresh on your pages
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud
Life lies dumb on its heroes
Wear your wound with honor, make someone proud

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone like you should not be allowed
To start any fires

[Chorus]
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
(Ooh, that's all you've got to do)
(Ooh) It ain't over

[Chorus]
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
(Ooh, that's all you've got to do)
(Ooh) All you got to do is win (it ain't over, no)

[Outro]
And your smile is spreading thin (Ooh, seek and believe in you)
It seems you're trying not to lose (Ooh, it ain't over, no, no)
Since I'm not supposed to grin (Ooh, that's all you got to do)
All you've got to do is win (Ooh, it ain't over, no)
(Ooh, seek and believe in you)
All you've got to do is win (Ooh, it ain't over, no, no)
Woo-hoo! (Ooh) All you've got (that's all you've got to do)
Is all you've got (Ooh, it ain't over)
It ain't over

[Chorus 1]
Taking it all the right way
Keeping it in the back
Taking it all the right way
Never no turning back
Never need, no, never no turning back

[Chorus 2]
Flying in just a sweet place
Coming inside and safe
Flying in just a sweet place
Never been known to fail, never been, no
Never been known to fail

Doing it, doing it right

Ah, sometimes, doing
Wishing sometimes (give it back)
Up there, up there (giving it)

[Verse 1]
Down where your paint is cracking
Look down your backstairs buddy
Somebody's living there and
He don't really feel the weather
And he don't share your pleasures
No he don't share your pleasures

[Chorus]
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he don't run to catch your ash
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash

[Verse 2]
You can't help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There's nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat
Somewhere a baby's bleeding
Somewhere a mother's needing
Outside a boy is lying
But mostly he is crying
And he just shouts in anger
You'll find him interesting

[Chorus]
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he doesn't build for you
Everybody always wants to run with you

[Verse 1]
He's everybody's token, on everybody's wall
Blessing all the papers, thanking one and all
Hugging all the babies, kissing all the ladies
Knowing all that you think about from writing on the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so divine, his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race
He says "I'm somebody"

[Chorus 1]
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart
He says "don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"

[Verse 2]
He's the savage son of the TV tube, planets wrote the day was due
All the wisest men around, predicted that a man was found
Who looked a lot like you and me, yeah
Everyone with sense could see
Nothing left his eye unmoved, he had the plan, he had to use

[Pre-Chorus]
(Somebody) he's so divine, (ooh, ooh) his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight (somebody up there)
(Somebody) his ever loving face (ooh, ooh)
Smiles on the whole human race
(Somebody, somebody, somebody up there)

[Chorus]
(Somebody) he's got his eye on your soul
(Ooh, ooh) and his hand on your heart
He says "don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody)

[Bridge]
Somebody plays my song in tune
Makes me, makes me, makes me stronger for you, babe
Was a way when we were young, that
Any man was judged by what he'd done
But now you've pick them on the screen (what they look like)
Where they've been

[Chorus]
Keep your eye on your soul and your hand on your heart
He says "don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody)

[Verse 3]
Leaders come, they hate all the people know
That given time, the leaders go
Tell me, can they hold you under their spell?
Can they walk and hold you as well as a
Smile like Valentino? Could he sell you anything?
(Somebody, somebody)

[Chorus]
Keep your eye on your soul, keep your hand on your heart
He says "Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"

[Outro]
(Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody)
(Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody)
Somebody (somebody, somebody)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody)
Somebody (somebody, somebody)
Yeah, can't remember (somebody) peace so well
Oh, space to ramble, (somebody, somebody) space to boogie
Soul shine (ooh-ooh), so divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh, somebody)
Soul shine (Ooh-ooh), so divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh)
(Somebody)
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Yeah, can't remember peace so well
Can't remember peace so well
Can't remember peace so well
Soul shines (somebody)
Soul shines, so divine, somebody (somebody)
Soul shines, so divine, somebody (somebody)

[Verse 1]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[Chorus]
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 2]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like the restless wind inside a letterbox
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

[Chorus]
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 3]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on and on across the universe

[Chorus]
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Outro]
Nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing's going to
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing's going to
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change it
Nothing's going to change it
Hey, nothing's going to change it
Nothing's going to change it
Nothing's going to change it
Nothing's going to change it
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing going to change it
Nothing going to change it
(No, no, no, no, no, no)
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 1]
Once we were lovers
Can they understand?
Closer than others I was your
I was your man
Don't talk of heartaches
Ooh, I remember them all
When I'm checking you out one day
To see if I'm faking it all

[Chorus]
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me inside?
Show your love, love
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)

[Verse 2]
There's been many others
(Oo-oo-oo-ooh) so many times
Sixty new cities, and what do I
What do I find?
I want love so badly
I want you most of all
You know, it's harder to take it from anyone
It's harder to fall
Can you hear me call ya?

[Chorus]
Well, can you (hear me?)
Can you (feel me inside?)
Show your (love, love)
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)

[Chorus]
Well, can you hear me? (yeah)
Can you feel me inside? (I do)
Show your love (love, love)
Show me your sweet, sweet love, show me your love
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right
To your love life, baby

[Outro]
Take it in right to your love life
Take it in right, take it in right
Right to your love life
Take it in right, ah
(Why don't you take it?) take it in, take it in right
(Why don't you take it?) Right down, right down
(Why don't you take it?) mmm, why don't you take it?
(Right to your heart) can you hear me?
(Why don't you take it?) can you feel me?
(Why don't you take it?) can you take it in right?
(Why don't you take it?) ooh, right down, right down
(Right to your heart) can you take it? Feel me?
(Why don't you take it?) down, to right down
(Why don't you take it?) to your heart
(Why don't you take it?) to your heart
(Right to your heart) take it down, take it down
(Why don't you take it?)
(Why don't you take it?) take it in right
(Right to your heart)

[Verse 1]
I've seen the city
I took the next flight
For Borneo
They say it's pretty
I like the tee shirts
In Borneo
Some wear Bob Marley
Others in Playboy
Or Duvalier
Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
With a book on Borneo

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Strangers come and go
It's such a waste of time
Problems far behind
Another day
But even in springtime
It's a rich slice of life
So send me a letter

[Chorus 1]
(We'll meet in borneo)
I'll reply with a broken spear
(We are *unclear*)
That dusky mulatto
(We'll meet in borneo)
In nylons and tattoos
(I like the free world)
Hot juice in coke bottles
(We'll meet in borneo)
We dance in the sand
(We are *unclear*)
Well, they twirl and they tumble
(Tumble and twirl)
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
(Tumble and twirl)
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
(Tumble and twirl)

[Verse 2]
I've been to Leon's
He's got nine daughters
And a stereo
(Stereo)
They say that Leon
Watches from the tree tops
In Borneo
(Borneo)
When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
That's the way it goes
Way down yonder in Borneo

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Far beneath his mansion
There's an open drain
Sending all the sewage down the hill
But when the general shows movies
No one hesitates
To sneak from the jungle

[Chorus 2]
(We'll meet in borneo)
They laugh and they mumble
(We are *unclear*)
Enjoying the show
(We'll meet in borneo)
And that dusky mulatto
(I like the free world)
Hot juice in coke bottles
(We'll meet in borneo)
In blue jeans and tattoos
(We are *unclear*)
Well, they twirl and they tumble
(Tumble and twirl)
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
(Tumble and twirl)
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
(Tumble and twirl)

[Chorus 3/Outro]
I like the free world
(I like the free word)
They say it's pretty
(tumble and twirl)
This time of year
(I like the free word)
They tumble and twirl
(tumble and twirl)
I'll tumble and twirl
{etc.}

[Verse 1]
Where's the pain in the violent night?
I'm depressed by the grin
I stay over many years
I should have thought of that
For the love of the money
Like a black-hearted violin
It's the nature of being

[Chorus]
It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell bad from wrong
I can't pass you by
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me

[Verse 2]
Where the flesh meets the spirit world
Where the traffic is thin
I slip from a vacant view
I should have thought of that
And the sound of tomorrow
Like a black-hearted vile thing
Like the silence of tension
It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell good from bad
I can't pass you by
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me
You've been around
Can't pass you by
You've been around
But you've changed me
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-change!
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me
You've been around
Can't pass you by

[Chorus]
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting that you told me that you
Didn't want me around any more

[Verse 1]
But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like they've done so many times before
And this stubborn old fist
On the end of my wrist
Keeps a knocking on your front door

[Chorus]
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting about those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things
That you said

[Verse 2]
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head

[Chorus]
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more

[Verse 3]
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head

[Chorus]
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more

[Intro]
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

[Verse]
Dear when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free

[Chorus]
I can walk down the street
There's no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
I feel free
I can walk down the street
There's no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
I feel free

[Outro]
Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
You're the sun, and as you shine on me
I feel free

Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
You're the sun, and as you shine on me
I feel free

Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
You're the sun, and as you shine on me
I feel free

[Verse 1: Al B. Sure! & Backing Vocalists]
Getting my facts from a Benetton ad
Looking through African eyes
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire (Black tie, white noise)
I've got a face, not just my race, bang bang
I've got you, babe

[Refrain: Backing Vocalists & David Bowie]
Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise

[Verse 2: David Bowie & Backing Vocalists]
Sun comes up and the man goes down
Woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear (Black tie, white noise)
Then we jump through hoops, we're divisible now
Just disappear

[Refrain: Backing Vocalists & David Bowie]
Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise

[Chorus: David Bowie & Al B. Sure!]
We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Then die in the flames singing "We Shall Overcome"
What's going on?
There'll be some blood, no doubt about it
But we'll come through, don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know I won't kill you
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me, no
But I look into your eyes and I wonder sometimes

[Refrain: Backing Vocalists & David Bowie]
Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise

[Bridge: David Bowie & Al B. Sure!]
Oh Lord, just let him see me
Lord, Lordy, let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together

[Chorus: David Bowie & Al B. Sure!]
Reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Walk through the night thinking "We Are the World"
What's going on?
There will be some blood, no doubt about it
We shall come through, don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know I won't kill you
And I turn my back for I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me, no
But I wonder why
Yes, I wonder why sometimes

[Refrain: Backing Vocalists & David Bowie]
Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise

[Verse 3: David Bowie & Backing Vocalists]
They'll show us how to break the rules
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
(Black tie, white noise)
Fascist cries, both black and white
Who's got the blood? Who's got the gun?

[Refrain: Backing Vocalists & David Bowie]
Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise

Cranking out
Cranking out
Cranking out white noise
Cranking out

Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise

[Intro]
When comes the shaking man
A nation in his eyes
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo
Streaking cathedral spire

[Verse 1]
They say
They say
They say
He has no brain
They say
He has no mood
They say
He was born again
They say
Look at him climb
They say jump
They say jump

[Verse 2]
They say
He has two gods
They say
He has no fear
They say
He has no eyes
They say
He has no mouth

[Chorus]
They say 'hey that's really something'
They feel he should get some time
I say he should watch his ass
My friend don't listen to the crowd
They say jump
They say jump
Watch out!

[Breakdown]
Watch out!
Watch out!

[Chorus]
They say 'hey that's really something'
They feel he should get some time
I say he should watch his ass
My friend don't listen to the crowd
They say jump

[Outro]
Got to believe somebody
They say jump
Jump
Got to believe somebody

[Verse 1]
Burning up each other's love, burning up our lives
Tried all kinds of working out, miracle goodnight
Future full and empty, knocking on my door
Ragged limbed and hungry mama, miracle no more

[Chorus]
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing)

[Verse 2]
Morning star, you're beautiful, yellow dime on high
Spin you 'round my living room, miracle goodnight
Evening flower all alone, puzzling, capisce?
Haven't got a death wish, just want a little more

[Chorus]
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it all right
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it all right
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe

[Spoken Ad Libs]
I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here
I wished I had a future, anywhere

[Verse 3]
I love you in the morning sun, I love you in my dreams
I love the sound of making love, the feeling of your skin
The corner of your eyes, I long forevermore
I never want to say goodnight, miracle goodnight

[Chorus]
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it all right
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it all right
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe

[Spoken Ad Libs]
Don't want to know the past, I want to know the real deal
I really don't want to know that
The less we know, the better we feel

[Keyboard Solo: Richard Hilton]

[Verse 4]
Morning star you're beautiful, yellow dime on high
Spinning around my little room, miracle

[Guitar Solo: Nile Rodgers]

[Chorus]
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Moon tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it all right
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Moon tell me) make it all right
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it all right
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it all right
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe

[Verse 1]
Something's going on in society
(Dancing with the big boys)
You chew your fingers
And stare at the floor
(Dancing with the big boys)
One wrong word
And you're out of sync
Talking 'bout a hands on policy
(Big boys)

[Verse 2]
Death to the trees
(Dancing with the big boys)
They weren't bad
They weren't brave
Nothing is embarrassing
(Dancing with the big boys)

[Verse 3]
There are too many people
Too much belief
(Dancing with the big boys)
Where there's
Trouble there's poetry
(Dancing with the big boys)
Your family is a football team
(Big boys)

[Verse 4]
This dot marks your location
(Dancing with the big boys)
Loneliness in a free society
(Dancing with the big boys)
(Big boys)
This can be embarrassing
(Big boys)
Dancing with the big boys
(Dancing with the big boys)

La-la-la, la-la-la...
(Big boys)

[Verse]
There's no hold
The moving has come through
The danger brushing you
Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels
It's so cold
The dark dug up by dogs
The stiches torn and broke
The raw meat fist you choke
Has hit the bloodlite

[Chorus]
Glass traps open and close on
Nite flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall

Glass traps open and close on
Nite flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall

[Outro]
On nite flights
Only one way to fall

[Verse 1]
Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

[Verse 2]
I know there's something in the wind
That crazy balance of my mind
What kind of fool are you and I?
Scared to death and tell me why

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

[Interlude]
Still I keep my love for you

[Verse 3]
You made a date with destiny
You jog-jog in my memory
You haunt in mind not fade away

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
I'm sick and tired of telling you

[Verse 1]
Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

[Outro]
Still I keep my love for you
Don't let me down and down and down
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
No place to hide no way to fall
Still I keep my love for you
Still I keep my love for you

[Chorus]
(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Stay in) Stay in
(Fade out) Fade out
(Day in) Hoo hoo
(Day out) Oh hoo hoo

[Verse 1]
She was born in a handbag
Love left
On a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
Nothing seems to make a dent
Going to find her some money, honey
Try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about
(Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Stay in) Stay in
(Fade out) Fade out
(Day in) Hoo hoo
(Day out) Oh hoo hoo

[Verse 2]
First thing she learns is
She's a citizen
Some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
Someone rings a bell
And it's all over
She's going out of her way
Stealing for that one good rush
(Ah)

[Chorus]
(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Stay in) Stay in
(Fade out) Fade out
(Day in) Hoo hoo
(Day out) Oh hoo hoo

[Verse 3]
She could use a little money
She's hanging on his arms
Like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey
She's on the other side
Oh come on little baby
Late night, big town
Police, shake down

[Chorus]
Day in
Day out
Stay in
Fade out
Hoo hoo

(Day in)
(Day out)
(Stay in)
(Fade out)

[Verse 4]
(Day in) She's got a ticket to nowhere
(Day out) She's going to take a train ride
(Stay in) Nobody knows her, or knows her name
(Stay out) She's in the pocket of a home boy
(Stay in) Oh she's going to take her a shotgun, pow
(Stay out) Spin the grail spin the drug
(Stay in) She's going to make them well aware
(Stay out) She's an angry girl
(All over)

[Chorus]
(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Stay in) Stay in
(Fade out) (Fade out) Fade out

[Outro]
(Day in) And there's angels everywhere
(Day out) Suddenly shooting her down
(Day in) Shooting her with video, drugs, bullets, and promises
(Day out) Angels in a ton of sound... And it's—
(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Day in) You stay in, or ya...
(Day out) Ya fade out, fade out
(Day in) Fade out
(Day out) Ha, and ya...
(Day in) Fade out
(Day out) Fade out, fade out
(Day in) Hoo hoo
(Day out) Oh hoo hoo
(Day in)
(Day out) (Day out)
(Day in) (Day in)
(Day out) (Day out)
(Day in) Hoo hoo

[Verse 1]
Oh you, you walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
(Your scalding face)
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage
It's too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
(Your fearful hands)

[Verse 2]
Get me to the doctor's, I've been told
Someone's back in town, the chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence and my honour’s at stake
The weather's grim, ice on the cages
Me, I'm Robin Hood, and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming

[Verse 3]
If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose, nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain, kiss you in the rain
(Kiss you in the rain) Kiss you in the rain (Kiss you in the rain)
In the rain (In the rain)

[Bridge]
Get me to the doctor

[Outro]
Get me off the streets
(Get some protection)
Get me on my feet
(Get some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Oh, get me off the streets
Get some protection
Oh get me on my feet (wo-ooh!)
While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure to the blackout
(Get some protection)
Get me on my feet
(Get some direction, wo-ooh!)
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets
(Get some protection)
My love wherever you are
Whatever you are
Don't lose faith
I know it's gonna
Happen someday to you

Please, wait
Please, wait
Wait, don't lose faith

You say that
The day never arrives
And it's never
Seemed so far away
But I know it's gonna
Happen someday to you

Please, wait
Please, wait
Wait, don't lose faith
Please, wait
Please, wait
Please, don't lose faith

Don't lose faith
You say that
The day never arrives
And it seems so far away
But I know it's gonna
Happen someday
Someday to you, to you

Please, wait

[Intro]
Time will crawl

[Verse 1]
I've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
'Til the twenty-first century lose
I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon, and he—
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot and he—
He made him fly through a hole
'Til he grew real old, and he—
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

[Chorus]
Time will crawl
'Til our mouths run dry
Time will crawl
'Til our feet grow small
Time will crawl
'Til our tails fall off
Time will crawl
'Til the twenty-first century lose

[Verse 2]
I saw a black, black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm, warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

[Chorus]
Time will crawl
Time will crawl
Time will crawl
'Til the twenty-first century lose
(Go!)

[Interlude]
Time will crawl
Time will crawl

[Verse 3]
You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask went off
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep

[Chorus]
Time will crawl
And our heads bowed down
Time will crawl
And our eyes fall out
Time will crawl
And the streets run red
Time will crawl
'Til the twenty-first century lose

[Chorus]
And our mouths run dry
Time will crawl
And our feet grow small
Time will crawl
And our tails fall off
Time will crawl
'Til the twenty-first century lose

[Chorus]
And our heads bowed down
Time will crawl
And our eyes fall out
Time will crawl
And the streets run red
Time will crawl
'Til the twenty-first century lose

[Outro]
Time will crawl
For the crazy child
Time will crawl
We'll give every life
'Til the twenty-first century lose
For the crackpot notion

[Verse 1]
In the event that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion
And we never get old

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember it's true
Dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

[Chorus]
We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose

[Post-Chorus]
It's a very modern world
But nobody's perfect
It's a moving world
But that's no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again
Will we?

[Verse 2]
And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember it's true
Loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

[Chorus]
We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose

[Post-Chorus]
But any sudden movement
I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated
But I've got to write it down
And it won't be forgotten
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again
How can I?

[Verse 1]
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too
Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways
I say trust Him at once which is something these days

[Chorus]
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she
Knows what the noise
Can do

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she
Knows what the noise
Can do

[Bridge]
Did the world just explode?
Don't recognize anyone
But you've still got me under your thumb

[Chorus]
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise
Can do

[Verse 2]
Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy
In this sexual noise, vicious chords
Offer joy
You live and you die in the blink of an eye
Well I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise

[Chorus]
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she
Knows what the noise
Can do

Dance to the noise

[Verse 3]
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
But you can't buy me off in this serial world
Who who who died and made you material girl?
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she
Knows what the noise
Can do

[Bridge]
So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric
Goes wrong
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern
Song

[Chorus]
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she
Knows what the noise
Can do

[Verse 4]
Or this shallow orb mugged by reality
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need
You
Live and you die in the blink of an eye
Still I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise

[Chorus]
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she
Knows what the noise
Can do

[Verse 1]
African night flight one-time Mormon
More men fall in Hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman, I went too far
Bent on a windfall, rent a Sony
Wonder how the dollar went down
Got to get a word to Elizabeth's father
Hey ho, he wished me well
Seemed like another day I could fly
Into the eye of God on high

[Chorus]
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Got to get a word through one of these days
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Got to get a word through one of these days

[Verse 2]
Getting in the mood for a Mombasa night flight
Pushing my luck, going to fly like a mad thing
Bare strip takeoff, skimming over Rhino
Born in slumber, less than peace
Struggle with a child, whose screaming, dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine
Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life, quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one left unnamed
Seems like another day I could fly
Into the eye of God on high
Seems like another day I could fly
Into the eye of God on high
Over the bushland, over the trees
Wise like orangutan, that was me

[Chorus]
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Got to get a word through one of these days
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Got to get a word through one of these days

[Verse 1]
Photograph king, watches you go
Now, fashions may change, heaven knows
But you still leave a stain on me
Only to go
Colours may fade
Seasons may change, weather blows, but you still leave a mark on me
Wrong, negative fades, never the twain, reckless and tame

[Chorus 1]
I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
I'd like to beat on your drum
I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum
(I'd beat it; I beat it; can't beat it; I feel it)

[Verse 2]
Disco brat, follow the pack
Watching you peel, heaven knows, prison can't hold all
This greedy intention
Only to go, picture you now
Music may change, hi-di-ho, keen to follow your nose
Wrong love out of tune
Sweet is the night
Bright light destroys me

[Chorus 1]
I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
I'd like to beat on your drum
I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum
(I'd beat it; I beat it; I beat it; I beat it)

[Chorus 2]
I'd like to beat on your drum (oh, yeah)
I'd like to beat on your drum (ah)
I like your face in the crowd
I'd like to beat on your drum
(I'd beat it; I beat it; you beat it; I beat it)

[Interlude]
Can't beat it
Can't beat it
I beat it
Ah yeah

[Chorus 2]
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to yell it out loud
I'd like to beat on your drum
(Can't beat it; can't beat it; I beat it; I beat it)

[Outro]
Can't beat it
I beat it
Beat it out loud
Beat it out of the crowd
Beat it
Beat it
Beat it
Beat it

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel the need to move on
So I pack a bag and move on
Move on
Well, I might take a train or sail at dawn
Might take a girl when I move on
When I move on

[Verse 2]
Somewhere, someone is calling me
When the chips are down
I am just a travelling man
Maybe it is just a trick of the mind
But somewhere there is a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere there's an ocean
Innocent and wild

[Verse 3]
Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground
Cyprus is my island
When the going's rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that

[Bridge]
Mahi-ya, mahi-yo, mahi-ya, mahi-yo
Mahi-ya, mahi-yo, mahi-ya, mahi-yo

[Verse 4]
Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
I can't forget you, can't forget you
Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man
I can't forget you, can't forget you

[Outro]
I can't forget you, can't forget you

(Yassassin) I'm not a moody guy
(Yassassin) I walk without a sound
(Yassassin) Just a working man, no judge of men
(Yassassin) But such a life I've never known

[Verse 1]
We came from the farmlands
To live in this city
We walked proud and lustful
In this resonant world

[Bridge]
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

[Chorus]
(Yassassin) I'm not a moody guy
(Yassassin) I walk without a sound
(Yassassin) Just a working man, no judge of men
(Yassassin) But such a life I've never known

[Verse 2]
Look at this, no second glances
Look at this, no value of love
Look at this, just sun and steel
Look at this, then look at us
If there's someone in charge
Then listen to me
Don't say nothing is wrong
'Cause I have got a love and she is-a feared

[Bridge]
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

(Yassassin) I'm not a moody guy

[Verse 1]
The vacuum created by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer

[Chorus]
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

[Verse 2]
A series of shocks - sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling, witnesses falling

I feel a little roughed up, feel a bit frightened
Nearly pin it down some time
Red sail action, wake up in the wrong town
Boy, I really get around

Thunder ocean, thunder ocean
Red sails take me, make me sail along
Red sails, and a mast so tall
Red sails, red sails

Do you remember, we another person
Green and black and red and so scared
Graffiti on the wall keep us all in tune
Bringing us all back home

Red sails, thunder ocean
Red sails, sailor can't dance like you

Red sail, some reaction

Action boy seen living under neon
Struggle with a foreign tongue
Red sails make him strong
Action make him sail along

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I want to be free, don't you want to be free?

If there was only something between us
Other than our clothes
Something in our skies, something in our skies
Something in our blood, something in our skies

Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
Falls upon deaf ears
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson

[Post-Chorus]
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future
And these cerulean skies
Something in our skies, something in our skies
Something in our blood, something in our skies

[Interlude]
Paddy? Paddy?

[Bridge]
Paddy, will you carry me?
I think I've lost my way
Heart's filthy lesson, heart's filthy lesson
I'm already five years older, I'm already in my grave
I'm already
Heart's filthy lesson, heart's filthy lesson
I'm already
I'm already
Heart's filthy lesson, heart's filthy lesson
Will you carry me?
Oh Paddy
I think I've lost my way

[Outro]
Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss
Heart's filthy lesson
Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Tell the others
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Paddy, what a fantastic decade
Tell the others
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Tell the others

[Verse 1]
When I believed in nothing
I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint
In some place
I called her name
And though my days were slipping by
And nights so cruel
I thought I'd die

[Prec-Chorus]
She danced her little dance 'til it made me cry
She was shaking like this honey doing that

[Verse 2]
When I needed soul revival
I called your name
When I was falling to pieces
I screamed in pain
Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real
Swept over me

[Pre-Chorus]
You danced a little dance 'til it made me cry
She was shaking like this honey doing that

[Chorus]
Never let me down
She never let me down
Never let me down
She never let me down

[Verse 3]
When all your faith is failing, call my name
When you've got nothing coming, call my name
I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head
Until the bad stuff breaks

[Pre-Chorus]
Dance my little dance 'til it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that

[Chorus]
Never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

[Outro]
Oh no

[Verse 1]
She had an horror of rooms, she was tired, you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes, they were blue but nobody home
Well, she could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do
And she do
She opened strange doors that we'd never close again

[Pre-Chorus]
She began to wail jealousy's scream
Waiting at the lights, know what I mean

[Chorus]
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

[Verse 2]
She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise
Well, I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies

[Pre-Chorus]
She wails Jimmy's guitar sound, jealousy's scream
Waiting at the lights, know what I mean

[Chorus]
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

[Chorus]
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

[Chorus]
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

[Verse 1]
Poor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him and it hit him so

[Verse 2]
Poor dunce
He pushed back the pigmen
The Barbs laughed
The fool is dead

Poor dunce
He's less than within us
The brains talk
But the will to live is dead
And prayer can't travel so far these days

[Verse 3]
The talk of your life
Standing so near
To innocent eyes
Poor dunce

Swings through the tunnels
And claws his way
Is small life so manic
Are these really the days

Poor dunce, poor dunce

[Non-Lyrical Vocalizing]

[Verse 1]
Poor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him and it hit him so

[Non-Lyrical Vocalizing]

[Outro]
People spat upon him
Poor soul
Poor soul
Poor soul

[Verse 1]
I am home, lost my job
And incurably ill
You think this is easy, realism
I've got a girl out there, I suppose
I think she's dancing
Feel like Dan Dare lies down
I think she's dancing, what do I know?

[Chorus]
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around, no, can't turn around, no, oh ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around, no, turn around no, oh no
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers
Believing in me

[Verse 2]
One more weekend
Of lights and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit

[Chorus]
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around, no, can't turn around, no, oh, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I say
Can't turn around, no, can't turn around, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers
Believing me

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around, no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around, no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no (kiss-kiss)

[Verse 3]
Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart
He used to be my boss and now he is a puppet dancer
I am a D.J., and I've got believers

[Outro]
I've got believers, I've got believers
I've got believers in me (I've got believers)
I am a D.J., I am what I play, I am a D.J

[Verse 1]
Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song?
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the Action Man
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed to love
Sordid details following"
The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
And I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet is glowing

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

[Verse 2]
Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too"
One flash of light, but no smoking pistol
I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, whoa whoa
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

[Outro]
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom

[Verse 1]
There's a brand new dance but I don't know its name
That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland, full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here

[Pre-Chorus]
Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Turn to the right
Ooh, fashion!
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

[Chorus]
Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep

[Verse 2]
There's a brand new talk but it's not very clear
That people from good homes are talking this year
It's loud and tasteless and I've heard it before
You shout it while you're dancing on the dance floor
Oh bop, fashion

[Pre-Chorus]
Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Right
Fashion!
We are the goon squad
And we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

[Chorus]
Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

[Outro]
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
La-la la la la la la-la
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
La-la la la la la la-la
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
La-la la la la la la-la
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
La-la la la la la la-la

[Verse 1]
Well, how come you only want tomorrow?
With its promise of something hard to do
A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above and sun on your arms
Strength in your stride and hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go
Blinded with desire - I guess the season is on

[Verse 2]
So you train by shadow boxing, search for the truth
But it's all, but it's all used up
Break open your million dollar weapon
And you push your luck, still you push, still you push your luck
A broken nosed mogul, are you one of the New Wave boys?

[Verse 3]
Same old thing in brand new drag
Comes sweeping into view, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
As ugly as a teenage millionaire
Pretending it's a whizz kid world
You'll take me aside, and say
"Well, David, what shall I do? They wait for me in the hallway"
I'll say "Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways"
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner
I feel like a group of one, no-no
They can't do this to me

[Chorus]
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife

[Bridge]
Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes
And the word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
And you're alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you daren't look behind

[Verse 4]
You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No, no

[Chorus]
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife
I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife

[Verse 5]
And no one will have seen and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove that you couldn't pass the test
There'll be others on the line filing past
Who'll whisper low I miss you he really had to go
Well, each to his own, he was another piece of teenage wildlife
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Another piece of teenage wild... life

[Outro]
Wild...
Wild... life

[Verse 1]
Well, I wouldn't buy no merchandise
And I wouldn't go to war
And I mixed with other colours
But the nurse doesn't care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away
I really can't remember
Last time I saw the light of day
But I remember Sam
'Cause he was like me

[Chorus]
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

[Verse 2]
Well, they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And, oh, I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now I'm learning to be a part of societ... societ... s...

[Chorus]
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

[Bridge]
No athletic program
No discipline, no book
He just sat in the backseat
Swearing he'd seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace
Singing old songs we loved

[Chorus]
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

[Outro]
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

[Intro]
Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah

[Verse 1]
You've arrived in the land of a thousand different names
And the fabulous sons have crashed their planes in flames
Now tomorrow is back claiming redemption is on your heels
And a toothless past is asking you how it feels

[Pre-Chorus]
And me my little red Corvette has driven by
Fair weather heart has fallen in
My rainy day girl is feeling down
And she tells me that the world is spinning round
I say the dream was all for you
You're nobody else

[Chorus]
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hi, can I walk you home again today
Got to get forgive and forget hey, hey
Something good is happening and I don't know what it is
Don't you know we're back on trial again today

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's breaking wine for you
Hell it's only because you're true
Someone out-timed my heart
Stopping and preaching and letting love in
You are my moon, you are my sun
Heaven knows what you are

[Chorus]
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you, yes they were
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you, yeah
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you

[Outro]
Doesn't matter what you try to do
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
Doesn't matter what you try to do
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
Doesn't matter where you try to go
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
Doesn't matter who we really are
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
Oh, It doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
It doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
It doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
It doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
Oh, It doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
It really doesn't matter
I do
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
It doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
It doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)

[Verse 1]
Baby Grace is the victim
She was 14 years of age
And the wheels are turning, turning
For the finger points at me

[Pre-Chorus]
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
No I have not been to Oxford Town

[Chorus]
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies

[Verse 2]
And the prison priests are decent
My attorney seems sincere
I fear my days are numbered
Lord get me out of here

[Pre-Chorus]
(Here) (All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town

[Chorus]
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies

[Spoken Interlude]
This is your shadow on my wall
This is my flesh and blood
This is what I could've been

[Verse 3]
And the wheels are turning and turning
As the Twentieth Century dies
If I had not ripped the fabric
If time had not stood still
If I had not met Ramona
If I'd only paid my bill

[Pre-Chorus]
(All's well)
I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town

[Chorus]
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies

[Spoken Interlude]
This is my bunk with two sheets
This is my food though foul
This is what I could have been

[Chorus]
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th Century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
(All's well)
20th century dies
(All's well)

All's well, all's well
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies

[Verse 1]
Well, I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries "It's all in vain"
The voice of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Oh Lord, I just need one day

[Chorus]
Well, I've been breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes, I've been breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay?

[Verse 2]
Well, the river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just a slave of a burning ray
Oh, give me the night, I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night

[Chorus]
Been breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes, I've been breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay?

[Bridge]
Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me, hoping I'm going to die

[Chorus]
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
I won't be breaking no rocks
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
I said I won't be breaking no rocks
(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh
Who will pardon me?
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
(I won't be breaking no rocks)

[Outro]
When the kingdom comes
(When the kingdom comes)
(When the kingdom comes)
When the kingdom comes
(When the kingdom comes)
(When the kingdom comes)
When the kingdom comes
(When the kingdom comes)
(When the kingdom comes)
When the kingdom comes

[Verse 1]
Stay away from the future
Back away from the light
It's all deranged - no control
Sit tight in your corner
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

[Verse 2]
If I could control tomorrow's haze
The darkest shore wouldn't bother me
If I can't control
The web we weave
My life will be lost in falling leaves

[Verse 3]
Every single move's uncertain
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

[Verse 4]
I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
You've got to have a scheme
You've got to have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man

[Bridge]
No control
Stay away from the future
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

[Verse 5]
Forbidden words, deafen me
In memory, no control
See how far a sinful man
Burn his tracks, his bloody robes

[Verse 6]
You've got to have a scheme
You've got to have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man
I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
No control
I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged

[Outro]
I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
Deranged
Deranged

[Verse 1]
Psychodelicate girl - come out to play
Little metal faced-boy
Don't stay away
They're so war-torn and resigned
She can't talk anymore
What are they trying to prove?
What would they like to find?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's love back to front and no sides (like I say)
These pieces are broken (like I say)
These pieces are broken (hope I'm wrong but I know)

[Chorus]
Because you're young
You'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young
What could be nicer for you
And it makes me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars

[Verse 2]
He punishes hard
Was loving her such a crime?
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
They're people I know - people I love
They seem so unhappy - dead or alive

[Pre-Chorus]
It's love back to front and no sides (like I say)
These pieces are broken (like I say)
These pieces are broken (hope I'm wrong but I know)

[Chorus]
Because you're young
You'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young
What could be nicer for you
And it'll make me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars

[Outro]
A million dreams
A million scars
A million

[Intro]
Turn and turn again
Turn and turn again

[Verse 1]
I shake
And stare at the sun
'Til my eyes burn
I shake
At the mothers brutal vermin
I shake
And stare at the watery moon
With the same desire
As the sober Philistine
And I shake

[Chorus]
Turn and turn again
Worm, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again

[Verse 2]
The screw
Is a tightening Atrocity
I shake
For the reeking flesh is as romantic as hell
The need
To have seen it all
The Voyeur of Utter Destruction
As beauty

[Chorus]
I shake
Worm, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again
I shake
Turn and turn again
I shake
I shake
I shake

[Outro]
Research has pierced
All extremes of my sex
Call it a day
Call it a day
Needle point life
Blinds the will to be next
Call it a day
Research has pierced
All extremes of my sex
Call it a day
Call it a day
Needle point life
Blinds the will to be next
Call it a day
Call it a day

[Verse 1]
I was Ramona A. Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste
In a tunnel
But I've been having a MIDI-life crisis
And I've been dreaming of sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny colored English
We'll creep together, you and I
For I know who the small friends are

[Bridge]
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
A night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name, I am with name

[Verse 2]
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
(And she should say)
Twitch & stream
It'll end in chrome
Night of the female
Good time drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
(And she should say)
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone

[Verse 3]
A person who loses a name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads, between the centuries
A millennium fetish
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
I am with name

[Bridge]
Night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone

[Outro]
(Give it to me one more time!)
Anxiety descending
Anxiety descending

[Verse 1]
Eddie boy lit like paraffin
Spending two weeks
In a crack house
Burns on his brain
Like Chernobyl
Dean was seen
With a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed
Someone to pray for
Until I met you

[Pre-Chorus]
Life is like a broken arrow
Memory a swinging door
I could be your great misfortune
I can make you happy
Every day of your life

[Chorus]
Making my love
Like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far

[Verse 2]
Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice
Because love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice
I've touched down with vermin
Cowardice, lice
And I say
Nobody cares what you do
Please be yourself to death
I could be your great misfortune
But you'll never find a, bet you'll never find a better man

[Chorus]
Making my love
Like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far

[Verse 3, Mickey Rourke]
Peter met Frank
Formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads out of shape for the name of Trotsky, Sinn-Fein, Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover the page
With debts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs
Threw it all away
Another life in the grave (a life in the grave)

[Pre-Chorus]
Life is like a broken arrow
Memory a swinging door
I could be your great misfortune
Well, I could make you happy
Every goddamn single day of your life

[Chorus]
Making my love
Like a shining star
Like a shining star
If that's what you are
Like a shining star (oh)
Making my love (making my love)
Like a shining star (like a shining star)
Taking my love (taking my love)
Just a touch too far (just a touch to far)
Making my love (making my making my making my love)
Like a shining star (like a shining star)
Taking my love (making my love)
Just a touch too far (just a touch to, uh far)
Making my love (making my love)
Like a shining star (huh, like a shining star)
Taking my love (taking my love)
Just a touch too far (touch to, uh, far)
Making my love (mmm)
Like a shining star (mmhmm)
Taking my love (mmhmm)

[Intro]
Here it is
Hey

[Verse 1]
Do you see that thing (that thing)
I'm sure it's love (it's love)
Would you do one thing
New York's in love
The city grew wings
In the back of the night
The clouds are stuck
Like candy-floss
She sees the rich trash
Having all the fun
Makes her wonder where they get the energy from
There's nothing you can do to her
This city's all clean and waiting
I don't mean to wait too long
But this joint can't get much higher

[Chorus]
New York's in love
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New York's in flames
New York's in love
With the way she talks (t-t-talks, t-t-talks)
And the way she walks
New York's in love
Goo goo goo goo goo goo

[Verse 2]
My, oh my, it's a tom-tom beat
No-one knows they've had their day
We can dance and we can see the singles swing
Everybody's waiting for the Go-Go Boys
You're turned to stone by the family
It's now the dead speak to the living
Nothing left here
But a raging blaze
I don't mean to wait too long

[Chorus]
New York's in love
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New York's in flames
New York's in love
With the way she talks
And the way she walks (walk that walk)
New York's in love
Goo goo goo goo goo goo

[Outro]
Pretty as a picture
New York, New York
Ugly on each side
New York's in love
New York's in love
New York's in flames
New York's in love
New York, New York

[Verse 1]
Cruising around me
The flames burn my body
Wishful beginnings
Does this remind them again and again
You're a sorry little girl
You're a sorry little girl

[Verse 2]
Please hide
For the pain must feel
Like snow
You're a sorry little girl
Sorry little girl

[Verse 3]
Please hide from the kiss and the bite
Shame burns
Breathing in, breathing out
Breathing in only doubt
The pain must feel like snow
I'm no longer your golden boy
Sorry little girl
I'm sorry little girl

[Verse 4]
The pain must feel like snow
There you go
Cover me, cover me
We flew on the wings
We were deep in the dead air
And this one will never go down
We had such
Wishful beginnings
But we lived
Unbearable lives
I'm sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
So so sorry little girl

[Outro]
The pain must feel like snow
There you go
There you...

[Verse 1]
Silhouettes and shadows
Watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
Just walkie-talkie
Heaven or hearth
Just big heads and drums
Full speed and pagan

[Chorus]
And it's no game

[Verse 2]
I am barred
From the event
I really don't understand the situation
So where's the moral?
People have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists it's so degrading

[Chorus]
And it's no game

[Bridge]
Documentaries on refugees
Couples 'gainst the target
Throw a rock against the road
And it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday
And it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain
And it makes all the papers

[Chorus]
And it's no game

[Verse 3]
Children round the world
Put camel shit on the walls
They're making carpets on treadmills
Or garbage sorting

[Chorus]
And it's no game

[Verse 1]
White boys falling on the fires of night
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
Flesh punks burning in their glue
Revolution comes in the strangest way
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
I'd rather be inside you

[Chorus]
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
(You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect
You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect)

[Verse 2]
Mama can I kiss you daddy can I **** you  (tell)
(We wish you well, we wish you well)
Innocence passed me by
Want to be screwing
When the nightmare comes
(I wish you well, I wish you well)
Want to come quick and die

[Chorus]
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
(You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect
You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect)

[Verse 3]
All the little rose-kissed foxy girls
(Shoes, shoes, little white shoes)
Where have all the flowers gone
All the little fragile champion boys
(Toys, toys, little black toys)
Dripping on the end of a gun
(Even if you disagree)

[Chorus]
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
(You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect)

[Outro]
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Wish you well, wish you well
(even if you disagree, even if you disagree)
Toys, toys, little black toys
Wish you well, wish you well
(even if you disagree)
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Wish you well, wish you well

[Verse 1]
"You know who I am," he said
The speaker was an angel
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
"It's time we should be going"

[Chorus]
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, driven by the night
'Til you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, see it in my eyes
'Til you come

[Verse 2]
No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me

[Chorus]
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, driven by the night
'Til you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, feel it in my voice
'Til you come

[Outro]
(Waiting so long, ahhh...)
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
(Waiting so long)

[Verse 1]
Heaven loves ya
The clouds part for ya
Nothing stands in your way when you're a boy
Clothes always fit ya
Life is a pop of the cherry when you're a boy

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you're a boy, you can wear a uniform
When you're a boy, other boys check you out
You get a girl, these are your favorite things
When you're a boy

[Chorus]
Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out

[Verse 2]
Uncage the colours, unfurl the flag
Luck just kissed you hello
When you're a boy
They'll never clone you, you are always first on the line
When you're a boy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you're a boy, you can buy a home of your own
When you're a boy, learn to drive and everything
You'll get your share
When you're a boy

[Chorus]
Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out

[Verse 1]
It's just a one dollar secret
A lover's secrets in the UK
Torn apart in the UK
In the dribble of May-Day
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's nothing inside
And there's nothing in mind (no)
And only you rocket on through the sky

[Chorus]
Well, it couldn't be done without dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry

[Verse 2]
When the days were the days were the days boys
When blue ties were for the biggy guys
Frannie dressing down for the enemy
You saw him hanging on the enemy

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no one in love
And there's nowhere to scream
And only you race on to wonder where

[Chorus]
Well, it couldn't be done without dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry

[Bridge]
You can't make love with money
You can't make mistakes with babies
Nothing looked good on you
That's how I liked you best
Now you're ready for the real McCoy

[Verse 3]
Deep in the heart of Cupid
Murders on the heels of love
Just the ghost of a story
Just a one dollar secret

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby these were the sounds
Baby these were the sounds (yeah)
And only you whisper these things aren't true

[Chorus]
Well, it couldn't be done without dogs
Well, it couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry

[Outro]
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry (cry, cry)
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry (cry, cry)
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry (cry, cry, cry, cry)
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry (cry, cry, cry, cry)
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry (cry, cry, cry, cry)
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry (cry, cry, cry, cry)
'87 and Cry
Hey
Hey
'87 and Cry

[Verse 1]
Johnny is a man and he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through you
When you ask him how the kids are
He'll get home around seven
'Cause the Chevy’s real old
And he could have had a Cadillac
If the school had taught him right

[Chorus]
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

[Verse 2]
And the food is on the table but the food is cold
(Don't hit her)
Can't you even cook?
What's the good of me working when you can't damn cook?
Well, Johnny is a man and he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through

[Chorus]
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

[Outro]
It shows through
It shows through
It shows through

[Verse 1]
Pin up girls at the roller derby
Take me down to Newark, New Jersey
American flags
Blue, blue streamers
Everybody's laughing
The crowd is cheering

[Chorus]
Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world
Not of this world

[Verse 2]
Dance at night back in Alabama
Christmas lights on my teal green trailer
American flags
Blue, blue streamers
All the men are watching
The crowd is screaming

[Chorus]
Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world
Not of this world

[Bridge]
Prizes, prizes
A diamond tiara
Here's to the girl with the blue mascara
I have a disco ball mind
Lights flashing all of the time
I have a disco ball mind
I wanna die, I wanna die
I wanna die, I wanna die

Ooooooh, oooh

[Chorus]
Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world
Not of this world

[Verse 1]
Oh, can you feel it in the way
That a man is not a man?
Can you see it in the sky
That the landscape is too high?
Like a nervous disease (And it's been there all along)
It will tumble from the sky (And it's been there all along)

[Chorus]
Project cancelled
Tumbling central
Red money
Can you hear it fall?
Can you hear it well?
Can you hear it at all?

[Verse 2]
I was really feeling good
Reet Petite and how'd you do
Then I got the small red box
And I didn't know what to do
'Cause my fingers could not grope
And I could not give it away
And I knew I must not drop it, stop it, take it away

[Chorus]
Project cancelled
Tumbling central
Red money
Can you hear it fall?
Can you hear it well?
Can you hear it at all?
Project cancelled
Tumbling central
Red money
Can you hear it fall?
Can you hear it well?
Can you hear it at all?
Can you hear it at all?
Can you hear it at all?

[Outro]
Red money
Red money
Red money
Red money
Such responsibility
It's up to you and me

[Verse 1]
Funny how secrets travel
I'd start to believe
If I were to bleed
Thin skies, the man chains his hands held high
Cruise me blond
Cruise me, babe
A blond belief beyond beyond beyond
No return, no return
I'm deranged
Deranged, down, down, down
I'm deranged, down, down, down
So cruise me, babe; cruise me, baby

[Chorus]
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me; cruise me; cruise me, babe

[Verse 2]
The clutch of life and the fist of love
Over your head
Big deal Salaam
Be real deranged Salaam
Before we reel
I'm deranged

[Chorus]
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me cruise me cruise me babe

[Outro]
I'm deranged

[Verse 1]
Just when I'm ready to throw in my hand
Just when the best things in life are gone
I look into your eyes

[Chorus]
There's no smoke without fire
You're exactly who I want to be with
Without you
What would I do?

[Verse 2]
And when I'm willing to call it a day
Just when I won't take another chance
I hold your hand

[Chorus]
There's no smoke without fire
Woman, I love you
Without you
What would I do?

[Verse 1]
There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
I'm trying not to lose control
But you're just pushing, pushing, pushing for a fight
You look trapped, turn the radio on
Too much smoke, air conditioning gone

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking, looking, looking for a break

[Chorus]
Is it love or is it what
Who's this guy I'm going to blow away (ay)
What kind of love is he giving you
I'mma dizzy's
What I'm trying to say
(I said I'm) too dizzy
You can't have a lover
I'm too dizzy
It's me or no other
I'm a bad loser
I'm shaking in anger
I'mma too dizzy
You can't have no lover

[Verse 2]
You can go on dreaming every night
But I'm not letting you out of my sight
I'm ten times the man than any guy around
But you're just itching, twitching, itching for a break
There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking, looking, looking for a break

[Chorus]
Is it love or is it what
Who's this guy I'm going to blow away
What kind of love is he giving you
Imma dizzy's
What I'm trying to say
I said I'm too dizzy
You can't have a lover
I'm too dizzy
It's me or no other
(Oh) I'm a bad loser
I'm shaking in anger
I said I'm too dizzy
You can't have no lover

[Outro]
I said I'm too dizzy
Don't come any harder
I said I'm too dizzy
Don't come any closer
I said I'm too dizzy
(I said I'm) too dizzy
Too dizzy
Too dizzy
Too dizzy
Too dizzy
You can't have no lover (oh no)
Too dizzy
Too dizzy
I'm too dizzy

[Verse 1]
Like weeds on a rockface waiting for the scythe
Ricochet - ricochet
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs
Ricochet - ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
"And who can bear to be forgotten"
"And who can bear to be forgotten"

[Chorus]
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
"Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep
Dreaming of tramlines, factories, pieces of machinery
Mine shafts things like that."
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet - it's not the end of the world

[Verse 2]
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet - ricochet
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Teaching life in a violent new way
Ricochet - ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
"And who can bear to be forgotten"
"And who can bear to be forgotten"

[Chorus]
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
"Early, before the sun
They struggle off to the gates
In their secret fearful places they see their lives
Unraveling before them"
March of flowers - march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet - it's not the end of the world

[Verse 3]
"That's when they get home, damp eyed and weary
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests
Making unfulfillable promises
For who can bear to be forgotten"

[Verse 1]
He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City
There's not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise
As I walk down the aisle

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm gone, gone, gone

[Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality]
Now I'm older than movies

[Dance my way, falling up through the years]
Let me dance away

[Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly]
Now I'm wiser than dreams

[Losing breath underwater well I'm gone, gone, gone]
Let me fly, fly, fly

[Spin slack through reality]
While I'm touching tomorrow

[Dance my way, falling up through the years]
And I know who's there

[Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly]

[Losing breath underwater when I'm gone, gone, gone]
When silhouettes fall

[Spinning slack through reality]

[Chorus]
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past

[Refrain]
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking

[Verse 2]
Three old men dancing under her lamp lights
Shaking their sex in the bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked, anew
Like a bad tempered child
On the rain slicked streets

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm gone, gone, gone

[Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality]
Now I'm older than movies

[Dance my way, falling up through the years]
Let me dance away

[Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly]
Now I'm wiser than dreams

[Losing breath underwater well I'm gone, gone, gone]
Let me fly, fly, fly

[Spin slack through reality]
While I'm touching tomorrow

[Dance my way, falling up through the years]
And I know who's there

[Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly]

[Losing breath underwater when I'm gone, gone, gone]
When silhouettes fall

[Spinning slack through reality]

[Chorus]
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past

[Refrain]
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm gone, gone, gone

[Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality]

[Dance my way, falling up through the years]
Let me dance, dance, dance

[Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly]
And I'm gone

[Losing breath underwater well I'm gone, gone, gone]
Let me dance, dance, dance

[Chorus]
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past

[Refrain]
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man

[Intro]
Now, this isn't the right thing to do
So—
So, let's—
So, let's go

[Verse 1]
Young girls they know what they're after
Young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Rockets shooting up into space
Buildings they rise to the skies

[Chorus]
Bang bang, I got mine
Bang bang, reach for the sky

[Verse 2]
I keep a good friend on videotape
He'll drive his sports car until it's too late
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonight
Because love is my bet and it's the best yet

[Chorus]
Bang bang, I got mine
Bang bang, sun don't shine

[Chorus]
Bang bang, you are angels
Bang bang, now, you all oughta' be in pictures

[Verse 3]
Oh girl
Oh girl
My problems can't follow me
Phone calls, I take my machine
I wander lonely to the sea
Lonely, ha-ha-ha, what does it mean

[Chorus]
Bang bang, I got mine
Bang bang, and you are next in line

[Chorus]
Bang bang, reach for the sky
Bang bang, sun don't shine

[Bridge]
Rise buildings
Rise to the sky
(Well, uh,) young girls they know what they're after
I said, young girls don't kiss me goodbye

[Chorus]
Bang bang, then you closed, then you some closed, then you closed down
(

[?])
Bang bang, 

[?]
(Just come in first)

[Chorus]
Bang bang
(If prayers had wings)
Bang bang
(And you were next in line)

[Verse 1]
You never told me of your other faces
You were the widow of a wild cat
And now I know about your special kisses
And I know you know where that is at
I guess I recognise your destination
I think I see beneath your make-up
What you want is so separation
This is no ordinary, this is no ordinary

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh)
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys

[Verse 2]
You've got a very heavy reputation
But no-one knows about your low-life
I know a way to find a situation
And hold a candle to your high-life disguise
You caught me kneeling at your sister's door
That was no ordinary stick-up
I'm well aware just what you're looking for
I am no ordinary, I am no ordinary

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh)
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys
Baby-faced boys
Baby-faced

[Outro]
What a criminal world
What a criminal...
Criminal
What a criminal world
What a criminal...
Criminal

[Verse 1]
For we're living
In a safety zone
Don't be holding back from me
We're living from hour to hour down here
And we'll take it when we can

[Verse 2]
It's a kind of living which recognises
The death of the odourless man
When nothing is vanity nothing's too slow
It's not Eden but it's no sham

[Chorus]
There is no hell
There is no shame
There is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell
And it's lights up, boys
Lights up boys

[Verse 3]
Explosion falls upon deaf ears
While we're swimming in a sea of sham
Living in the shadow of vanity
A complex fashion for a simple man

[Chorus]
And there is no hell
And there is no shame
And there is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell

[Verse 4]
And the silence flies
On its brief flight
A razor sharp crap shoot affair
And we light up our lives

[Chorus Variation]
And there's no more of me exploding you
Re-exposing you
Like everybody do
Re-exploding you
I don't know what to use
Make somebody move
Me exploding
Me exploding you

[Verse 1]
Was she never there?
Was she ever?
Was it air she breathed?
At the wrong time

All the flowers so
From the gallery
With the hymns of night
Singing: "Come to me"

[Chorus]
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life

[Verse 2]
Just one living chance
When the mother sighs
When the father steps aside
At the wrong time
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life

[Bridge]
Was she ever?
Was she ever here?
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life away

[Outro]
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life away
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life away
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long

[Verse 2]
Feel my blood enraged
It's just the fear of losing you
Don't you know my name?
And you've been so long

[Chorus]
And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline

[Verse 3]
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long

[Verse 4]
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through
You've been so long
And it's been so long

[Chorus]
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline

[Verse 5]
See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made can never bend
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through​
You've been so long
Well, it's been so long

[Chorus]
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out fire
With gasoline

[Outro]
(Been so long)
(Been so long) and it's been so long
(Been so long) I've been putting out fire
(Been so long) it's been so long
(Been so long) been putting out fire
(Been so long) it's been so long
(Been so long) putting out fire
(Been so long)
Been so long (so long, so long)
Been so long (so long, so long)
Been putting out fire (been so long, so long, so long)
Been putting out fire (been so long, so long, so long)
Been so long
(Been so long, so long, so long)
(Been so long, so long so long)
Been putting out fire
Been putting out fire
Been so long
Been so long
And I've been putting out fire
I've been putting out fire

[Intro]
(We're living in the golden, in the golden age)
(We're living in the golden age, the golden age)

[Verse 1]
Stomping along
On this big Philip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
Looking across at Richard Rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
To leave a job
When you know
You know the money's from day to day

[Chorus]
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams
In my mind's eye
All the joy I see
Thru these architect's eyes
(We're living in the golden, in the golden age)
(We're living in the golden age, the golden age)

[Verse 2]
Cold winter bleeds
On the girders of Babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and the rocks and the sand
Stomping along on this big Philip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
These summer scumholes
This goddamned starving life

[Chorus]
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams
In my mind's eye
All the joy I see
Thru these architect's eyes

(We're living in the golden, in the golden age)
(We're living in the golden age, the golden age)

[Outro]
It's difficult you see
It's difficult you see

[Chorus, one more time]
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams
In my mind's eye
All the joy I see
Thru these architect's eyes

[Intro]
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)

[Verse 1]
I feel like a sail-boat
Adrift on the sea
It's a brand new day
So when you gonna phone me?

[Verse 2]
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
I could take you to heaven
I could spin you to hell
But I'll take you to New York
It's the place that I know well

[Verse 3]
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
Sitting on a flagstone, talking to a faceless girl
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
Been wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well

[Pre-Chorus]
Duck and I sway (what's my line?)
I shoot at a full moon (what's my line?)
So what's my line?

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, ooh
'Cause love is the answer
Love's talking to me
I'd scream and I'd fight for you
You're better than money

[Verse 3]
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
We're the kind of people who can shake it if we're feeling blue
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
When I'm feeling disconnected, well, I sure know what to do
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, baby
Oh, shake it, shake it

[Pre-Chorus]
I duck and I sway (what's my line?)
I shoot at a full moon (what's my line?)
So what's my line?

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it (whoa!)
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)

[Outro]
Shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
Shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)

[Verse 1]
Stinky weather, fat shaky hands
Dopey morning Doc, grumpy gnomes

[Refrain]
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

[Verse 2]
Big screen dolls, tits and explosions
Sleepy time, bashful but nude

[Refrain]
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

[Spoken ad lib]
I'm getting that

[Verse 3]
Intergalactic, seeming to be you
It's all in the tablets, sneezy Bhutan

[Refrain]
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

[Verse 4]
Mars happy nation, sit on my karma
Dame meditation, take me away

[Refrain]
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

[Chorus]
Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away

[Refrain]
You little wonder, little wonder you
You little wonder, little wonder you

[Chorus]
Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away

[Refrain]
Little wonder, little wonder you
You little wonder, you little wonder you
You little wonder you
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

[Chorus]
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails

[Verse 1]
Well some people try to pick up girls
They get called assholes
This never happened to Pablo Picasso
The girls would turn the color of a juicy avocado
When he would drive down their street in his El Dorado
He could walk down your street
Girls could not resist his stare
So Pablo Picasso was never called an asshole
Not like you
Wow!

[Chorus]
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails

[Verse 2]
He could walk down your street
And girls could not resist his stare
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole
Well the girls would turn the color of a juicy avocado
When he would drive down their street in his El Dorado
Well he was only 5'3"
But girls could not resist his stare
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole
Not in New York
Wow!

[Chorus]
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails

[Verse 1]
Better take care
Think I better go, better get a room
Better take care of me
Again and again
I think about this and I think about personal history
Better take care
I breathe so deep when the movie gets real
When the star turns round
Again and again
He looks me in the eye says he's got his mind on a countdown
3-2-1

[Pre-Chorus]
Forever
I'm screaming that I'm gonna be living on till the end of time
Forever
The sky splits open to a dull red skull
My head hangs low 'cause it's all over now

[Chorus]
And there's never gonna be enough money
And there's never gonna be enough drugs
And I'm never ever gonna get old
There's never gonna be enough bullets
There's never gonna be enough sex
And I'm never ever gonna get old
So I'm never ever gonna get high
And I'm never ever gonna get low
And I'm never ever gonna get old

[Verse 2]
Better take care
The moon flows on to the edges of the world because of you
Again and again
And I'm awake in an age of light living it because of you
Better take care
I'm looking at the future solid as a rock because of you
Again and again
Want to be here and I wanna be there
Living just like you, living just like me

[Pre-Chorus]
Forever
Putting on my gloves and bury my bones in the marshland
Forever
Think about my soul but I don't need a thing just the ring of the bell in the pure clean air

[Chorus]
And I'm running down the street of life
And I'm never gonna let you die
And I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get
And I'm never ever gonna get old
I'm never ever gonna get
Never ever get old

Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, Boy's Own
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, Boy's Own
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop

[Verse 1]
Where do we go from here?
There's something in the sky
Shining in the light
Spinning and far away

[Chorus]
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, Boy's Own
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop, (Satellite)
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, (Satellite), Boy's Own
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop, (Satellite)
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, (Satellite), Boy's Own
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop

Looking for satellites
Looking for satellites

[Verse 2]
Where do we go to now?
There's nothing in our eyes
As lonely as a moon
Misty and far away

[Chorus]
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, Boy's Own
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop, (Satellite)
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, (Satellite), Boy's Own

Looking for satellites
Looking for satellites

[Outro]
Where do we go from here?

[Verse 1]
Streets damp and warm
Empty smell metal
Weeds between buildings
Pictures on my hard drive

[Refrain]
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy

[Verse 2]
Steam under floor
Shards by the mirror's frame
Clouds green and low
No sign, no nothing now

[Refrain]
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy

[Bridge]
All the pages that have turned
All the errors left unlearned, oh

[Refrain]
Well I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
In the world

[Outro]
Not me
Not me

[Intro]
You
You
You

You
You
You

[Verse 1]
All our friends
Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets
Hotter than the sun
No peachy prayers
No trendy réchauffé
I'm with you
So I can't go on

[Chorus]
All my violence raining tears upon the sheets
I'm bewildered, for we're strangers when we meet

[Verse 2]
Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you
Blended sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes

[Chorus 2]
All my violence raging tears upon the sheets
I'm resentful, for we're strangers when we meet

[Verse 3]
Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new
Your embrace
It was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu

[Chorus 3]
Steely resolve is falling from me
My poor soul, poor bruised passivity
All your regrets ran rough-shod over me
I'm so glad that we're strangers when we meet
I'm so thankful, that we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover, for we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over, but we're strangers when we meet

[Outro]
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet

[Verse 1]
Silver leaves are spinning round
Take my hand as we go down and down and down
Looking for water
But I lost God in a New York minute
Don't know about you but my heart's not in it
(Looking looking looking)
I'm looking for water
I'm looking for water
(Looking looking looking)
I can't breathe the air
Can't raise the fight
Because all we've got left is a beat in the night
And I'm
Looking for water
Looking for water
Looking for water
Looking looking

[Verse 2]
Take my hand as we go down and down
Leave it all behind nothing will be found
I'm looking for water
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking looking)
I'm looking for water
Looking everywhere
Looking for water
Looking here and there
I'm looking for water
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking looking)
I can't live in this cage
I can't eat this candy
To the ends of the Earth
To this pain in my head
The look in your eyes
That never means never
The dawns early light
Baby dumb is forever

[Bridge]
(Looking looking)
(Looking looking)

[Outro]
Looking for water
(Looking looking)
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking looking)
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking looking)
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking looking)
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking looking)
I'm looking for water
Looking for water

[Verse 1]
She waited by the moon
She was sick with fear and cold
She felt too old for all of this
Of course she never showed
She lugged her suitcase to the bus
Melted home through the snow
North along Riverside

[Verse 2]
She slips beneath the sheets
A husband's quiet devoted wife
But strangers, sad and nervous
By the dawn's early light
Love lies like a dead cloud
On a shabby, yellow lawn
Up on Riverside

[Chorus]
She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
She'll keep an eye on Jessica
South along the Hudson
She'll turn the radio high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
South along the Hudson yeah
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now/I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson, yeah
(I'll bring you there)
And she'll drive the big car
And talk herself insane
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
Just a little bit angry now
(I'll bring you there)

[Verse 3]
Way back when millennium
Meant racing to the light
He promised her a dream-life
He'd take her back to street-life
Away from violent water
With its cormorants and leaves
Up on Riverside

[Chorus]
She'll drive the big car
But he'll sit behind
Bursting her bubbles of Ludlow and Grand
South along the Hudson
She'll turn the radio way up high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now/I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now/I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson, yeah
(I'll bring you there)
She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
(I'll bring you there)
She'll keep an eye on Jessica
Just a little bit faster now
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now

[Verse 1]
What have you been doing to yourself?
What have you been doing to yourself?
What have you been doing to yourself?
It's the last thing you should do-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
It's the worst thing you can do-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
Save the last dance for me
Catch the last bus with me
Give the last kiss to me
It's the safest thing to do-oh-oh-oh-oh

Yeah

Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
What have you been doing to yourself?
What have you been doing to yourself?
What have you been doing to yourself?
It's the last thing you should do-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
It's the worst thing you can do-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
My, my, the time do fly when it's in another pair of hands
And a loser I will be for I've never been a winner in my life
I got used to stressing pain, I used the sucker pills to pity for the self
Oh, it's the animal in me but I'd rather be a beggar man on the shelf

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
On a better day, I'll take you by the hand
And I'll walk you through the doors
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm

[Chorus]
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you

[Verse 2]
My, my, but time do fly when it's in another pair of pants
And illusion I will be, for I've never been a sinner, la di da

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm

[Chorus]
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

[Outro]
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 1]
Way back in time
Someone said try some
I tried some
Now buy some, I bought some
Oh oh oh
After a while
When I had tried them, denied them
I opened my eyes and I saw you

[Chorus]
Not a thing did I have
Not a thing did I see
Untill I called on your love
And your love came to me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh

[Verse 2]
Through my life
I've seen grey sky, met big fry
Seen them die to get high
Ohhh
And when it seemed that I would only be lonely
I opened my eyes and I saw you

[Chorus]
Not a thing did I feel
Not a thing did I know
Untill I called on your love
And your love sure did grow
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh

[Outro]
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh

[Verse 1]
Tragic youth was looking young and sexy
The tragic youth was wearing tattered black jeans
Bearing arms and flaunting all her mischief
The tragic youth was going down on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear

[Chorus]
I built a wall of sound to separate us
And hid among the junk of wretched highs
I sped from Planet X to Planet Alpha
Struggling for reality

[Post-Chorus]
Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Ha ha ha ha
Whoo hoo

[Verse 2]
Hey, now my sight is failing in this twilight
Da da da da da da da da da
Now my death is more than just a sad song
Da da da da da da da da da

[Pre-Chorus]
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear
Woo hoo

[Chorus]
I still don't remember how this happened
I still don't get the wherefores and the whys
I look for sense but I get next to nothing
Hey boy welcome to reality

[Post-Chorus]
Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo

[Bridge]
I've been right and I've been wrong
Now I'm back where I started from
Never looked over reality's shoulder

[Post-Chorus]
Ha ha ha ha
Huh ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Huh ha ha
Wooh
Woo hoo
Wooh

[Verse 1]
All of my life I've tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same

Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe I'm born right out of my time
Breaking my life in two

[Chorus]
Throw me tomorrow
Now that I've really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow
Everything's falling into place
Throw me tomorrow
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's child

[Post-Chorus]
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep
Shuffling days and lonesome nights
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet

Lucky old sun is in my sky
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
Innocence in your arms

[Chorus]
Throw me tomorrow
Now that I've really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow
Everything's falling into place
Throw me tomorrow
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's child

[Post-Chorus]
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Thursday's child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Thursday's child

[Outro]
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was

[Verse 1]
You promised me the ending would be clear
You'd let me know when the time was now
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Stab me in the dark, let me disappear
Memories that flutter like bats out of hell
Stab you from the city spires
Life wasn't worth the balance
Or the crumpled paper it was written on

[Refrain]
Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible

[Verse 2]
Hot cash days that you trailed around
Cold cold nights under chrome and glass
Led me down a river of perfumed limbs
Sent me to the streets with the good time girls

[Refrain]
Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible

[Pre-Chorus]
We could dance, dance, dance through the fire
Dance, dance, dance through the fire

[Chorus]
Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king

[Verse 3]
Spin-offs with those who slept like corpses
Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs
Killing time in the '70s
Smelling of love through the moist winds
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Close me in the dark, let me disappear
Soon there'll be nothing left of me
Nothing left to release

[Pre-Chorus]
Dance, dance, dance through the fire
Dance, dance, dance through the fire

[Chorus]
Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king

[Verse 1]
"Are you OK?
You've been shot in the head
And I'm holding your brains,"
The old woman said

So I drink in the shadows of an evening sky
See nothing at all

[Verse 2]
The stars look so special
And the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting
Beyond the yoga zone

Time to question the mountain: Why pigs can fly?
It's nothing at all

[Chorus]
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you

[Chorus]
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away

[Outro]
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes, nothing ever goes
Nothing

[Verse 1]
Your coat and hat are gone
I really can't look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Don't look me in the eye
We lay in each others arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we lived it out, something in the air
We smiled too fast then can't think of a thing to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Lived with the best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Nothing left to say
Let's take what we can
I know you hold your head up high
We've raced for the last time
A place of no return

[Chorus]
And there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
Something in the air
Something in my eye

[Verse 2]
Abracadoo - I lose you
We can't avoid the clash, the big mistake
Now we're going to pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Can't believe I'm asking you to go
We used what we could to get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted
Anyone more than you

[Pre-Chorus]
Lived all our best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Say what you will
But there's something in the air
Raced for the last time
Well I know you hold your head up high
There's nothing we have to say, there's nothing in my eyes

[Chorus]
But there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
There's something I have to say
There's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long

[Verse 1]
Oh my, naked eyes
I should have kept you, I should have tried
I should have been a wiser kind of guy
I miss you

[Verse 2]
Give me wings, give me space
Give me money for a change of face
These noisy rooms and passion pants
I loved you

[Chorus]
Where's the morning in my life?
Where's the sense in staying right?
Who said time is on my side?
I've got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
But I survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

[Chorus]
You alone across the floor
You and me and nothing more
You're the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you, I hated when you lied
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

[Verse 3]
Beatle boys, all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs every night
Wish I'd sent a Valentine
I love you

[Outro]
I'll survive
Naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
My naked eyes
I'll survive

[Intro]
Telling lies

[Verse 1]
Gorgeous girls are bound to meet
To talk of stars and kings and feet
Through the chromosomes of space and time

Me I'm fast like bad infection
Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress

[Pre-Chorus]
Telling lies
Telling lies
Telling lies
Telling lies

[Chorus]
Telling lies (Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like somethings going to happen this year)
Telling lies (Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like somethings going to happen this year)
Telling lies

[Verse 2]
Shadow falls in shrinking smiles
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure

Come straggling in your tattered remnants
You come to me with tears and blame
I'm your future, I am tomorrow, I am the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Telling lies
Telling lies
Telling lies
Telling lies

[Chorus]
Telling lies (Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like somethings going to happen this year)
Telling lies (Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like somethings going to happen this year)

Telling lies

Telling lies

[Outro]
Oh ah oh
Oh ah oh
Oh ah oh
Oh ah oh
Feels like somethings going to happen this year
Feels like somethings going to happen this year
(Telllliiing lllliiiies)
Oh ah
Feels like somethings going to happen this year
(Telllliiing lllliiiies)
Oh ah
Feels like somethings going to happen this year
(Telllliiing lllliiiies)
Oh ah
Feels like somethings going to happen this year

[Verse 1]
I forgot what my father said
I forgot what he said
I forgot what my mother said
As we lay upon your bed

[Pre-Chorus 1]
A city full of flowers
A city full of rain

[Chorus]
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

[Verse 2]
I forgot what my brother said
I forgot what he said
I don't regret anything at all
I remember how we wept

[Pre-Chorus 2]
On a bridge of violent people
I was small enough to cry

[Chorus]
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Hold my face before you
Still my trembling heart

[Chorus]
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

[Verse 3]
The gods forgot they made me
So I forgot them too
I listen to the shadows
I play among their graves

[Pre-Chorus 4]
My heart was never broken
My patience never tried

[Chorus]
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

[Outro]
Seven
Seven
Seven
Seven
Seven
Seven
Seven

[Intro]
Much too much to bear

[Verse 1]
Your love is hard and fast
Your love will always last
If it's you I need
I've got to pay the levy
Got to pay
Because your love's too heavy on me

[Chorus]
And it's much too much to bear

[Verse 2]
If I ever leave you darling
I hope you see
That I really love you
But your love's too heavy on me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When I make love to you
Do all the things you want me to do
You never think of me
Always cry a bevy
Bevy of tears
Because your love's too heavy on me

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
There was a time I could give all I had to you
But my enthusiasm waned and I can't bear the pain
Of doing what I don't want to do

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Your love is hard and fast
Your love will always last
If it's you I need
I've got to pay the levy
Got to pay
Because your love's too heavy on me

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Grown inside a plastic box
Micro thoughts and safety locks
Hearts become outdated clocks
Ticking in your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Now it's time to close our eyes
Now it's time to say goodbye
Now it's time to face the lie
That we'd never cry

[Chorus]
What's really happening?
What tore us apart?
What's really happening?
What's really happening?
What tore us apart?
What's really happening?

[Verse 2]
All the clouds are made of glass
And they're slowly sinking
Falling like the shattered past
Were we built to last?

[Chorus]
What's really happening?
What tore us apart?
What's really happening?
What's really happening?
What tore us apart?
What's really happening?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now it's time to close our eyes
Now it's time to say goodbye
Now it's time to face the lie
That we'd never cry

[Chorus]
What's really happening?
What tore us apart?
What's really happening?
What's really happening?
What tore us apart?
What's really happening?

[Verse 1]
Johnny's in America,
Lo-Teks at the wheel
No one needs anyone
They don't even just pretend
Johnny's in America

[Chorus]
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans

Johnny's in America

[Verse 2]
Johnny wants a plane
Johnny wants to suck on a Coke
Johnny wants a woman
Johnny wants to think of a joke
Johnny's in America

[Chorus]
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
Johnny's in America

[Verse 3]
Johnny's in America
Johnny looks up at the stars
Johnny combs his hair and Johnny wants pussy and cars
Johnny's in America
Johnny's in America

[Chorus]
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans

[Interlude]
God is an American
God is an American

[Chorus]
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
Yeah, I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans

[Outro]
God is an American
God is an American
God is an American
God is an American
God is an American

[Verse 1]
Today, today is the 1st of May
Everything around us
Everything a lie
Your hearts beating fast
As we race through the dark
Past the really good people
Who do what they’re told

[Chorus]
What will be my name
In the USA?
Hold my hand and
I’ll take you there
Who will I become
In the USA?
Hold my hand and
I’ll take you there

[Verse 2]
Sophie and Lev are running away
These are the days
The days of gloom
Lev can’t smile and Sophie can’t sing
A mile to the future
Where tomorrow is king

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I don’t need to know
Know where you are
Only that you are
Safe in this world
Then I’ll be content
Get on with my life
Eat, drink and sleep
Look up at the stars

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Fingertip sun at sideshow stalls
They throw the balls
At coconut fur that hides behind
Colored shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice-cream cone
They circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers
From a hole in the tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor
He's clogged and clothed in saffron robes
His beads are all he owns

[Chorus]
Slow down
Slow down
Someone must have said "let's slow him down"
Slow down
Slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

[Verse 2]
Fairy tale skin
Depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war
A gentle face you've seen before

Karma man tattooed on your side
The wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been
I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in
But
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin

[Chorus]
Slow down
Slow down
Someone must have said "let's slow him down"
Slow down
Slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Slow down
Slow down
Someone must have said "let's slow him down"
Slow down
Slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

[Verse 1]
What to do?
What to say?
What to wear on a sunny day?
Who the phone?
Who to fight?
Who to dance with on a sunday night?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm reaching the very edge you know
Reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side this time
Reaching the very edge

[Chorus]
You're still breathing but you don't know why
Life's a bit and sometimes you die
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell

[Post-Chorus]
I am a drug, I am a dragon
I am the best jazz you ever seen
I am the dragon, I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets I found gold
I find you out before you grow old
I find you out before you grow old

[Verse 2]
What is eternal? What is damned?
What is clay and what is sand?
Who to diss? Who to trust?
Who to listen to? Who to suss?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm reaching the very edge you know
Reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side this time
Reaching the very edge

[Chorus]
You're still breathing but you don't know why
Life's a bit and sometimes you die
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell

[Post-Chorus]
I am the dragon, I am the drug
I am your best jazz you've ever heard
I am the dragon, I'm the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets I found gold
I found you out before you grow old
I found you out before you grow old

[Outro]
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out but they wore it well
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out but they wore it well
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out but they wore it well
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out but they wore it well
You're still breathing but you don't know why
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell

[Refrain]
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty

[Verse 1]
In the street a man shouts out loud
A wallet drops and money flies into the midday sun

[Pre-Chorus]
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

[Chorus]
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire

[Pre-Chorus]
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

[Chorus]
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire

[Refrain]
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty

[Verse 2]
In a house a man drops dead
As he hits the floor he sighs
"What a morning"

[Pre-Chorus]
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground
Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

[Chorus]
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire

[Outro]
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire (I don't want knowledge, I want certainty)
Earthlings on fire (I don't want knowledge, I want certainty)
Sometimes
Earthlings (I don't want knowledge, I want certainty)
I don't want knowledge

[Verse 1]
New Angels of Promise
We despair
We are the dead dreams
We take the blame
Take us to the edge of time
Take us to the edge of time
We are the fabulous lovers
I'm a blind man and she's my eyes

[Chorus]
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd
It's always time
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd
It's always time

[Verse 2]
New Angels of Promise
We despise
Don't fall apart now
We are the silent ones
Take us to the edge of time
Take us to the edge of time
We are the tabular lovers
We listen to the storm

[Chorus]
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd
It's always time
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd
It's always time

[Verse 1]
New Angels of Promise
We despair
We are the dead dreams
We take the blame
Take us to the edge of time
Take us to the edge of time
We are the fabulous lovers
I'm a blind man and she's my eyes

[Chorus]
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd
It's always time
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd
It's always time
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd
It's always time
It's always time
It's always time
It's always time
{Intro}

[Chorus 1]
If you say run
I'll run with you

[Chorus 2]

[X2]
For fear your grace should fall
For fear tonight is all

[Verse 1]
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues

Wild colors light up your face
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

Put on your red shoes and dance the blues

[Chorus 3]
Under the moonlight
The serious moonlight

[Chorus 2]

[X2]

[Bridge]
You could look into my eyes

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 4]
If you say hide
I'll run with you

Let's dance!
Let's dance!
Let's dance!

[Verse 3]
Let's dance!

You could look into my eyes

[Chorus 3]

[Verse 1]
Black eyed ravens
They spiral down
They tilt his head back
To the flame filled sunset
Raise their guns high
As the darken falls
These are the days boys
Shallow man
Shallow man... and they
Eats in the doorway
With his head inclined
And he's always in decline
No-one heals anymore
So he shrinks as they ride
Under vermillion sky

[Chorus]
So it goes
Just a searcher
A lonely soul
The last of the dreamers

[Verse 2]
Shallow man
Shallow man
Speaks to the shadows
Moves his trembling hands
And he's always a little late
For the dawning of the day

[Chorus]
So it goes
Just a searcher
A lonely soul
The last of the dreamers

[Verse 1]
How you turn my world
You precious thing
You starve and near exhaust me

Everything I've done
I've done for you
I move the stars for no one

[Verse 2]
You've run so long
You've run so far
Your eyes can be so cruel
Just as I can be so cruel
Oh I do believe in you
Yes I do

Live without your sunlight
Love without your heartbeat
I, I can't live within you
I can't live within you

[Verse 3]
I, I can't live within you

[Verse 1]
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
I put it on when I go lonely
Will you take off your dress and send it to me?

[Verse 2]
I miss your kissing and I miss your head
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
Just run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet and send it to me

[Verse 3]
I miss your soup and I miss your bread
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when you dine

[Interlude]
D-A-V-I-D

[Verse 3]
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
Bloody your hands on a cactus tree
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me

[Outro]
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore

[Verse 1]
Oogie waits for just another day
Drags his bones
To see the Yankees play
Bones Boy talks and flickers gray
Oh, they slip away

[Verse 2]
Once a time
They nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen
No one knew what they could do
Except for me and you
They slip away
They slip away

[Chorus]
Don't forget
To keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world
And war torn
How I wonder where you are
Oo-o
Sailing over
Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb
But you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are
Oo-o

[Verse 3]
Oogie knew there's never ever time
Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space it's always 1982
The joke we always knew
Oo-oo
What'sa matter with you
C'mon, let's go
Slip away
Oo-o

[Chorus]
Don't forget
To keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world
And war torn
How I wonder where you are
Oo-o
Sailing over
Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb
But you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are
Oo-o

[Outro]
Sailing

[Verse 1]
Here shall we live in this terrible town
Where the price for our minds
Shall squeeze them tight like a fist
And the walls shall have eyes
And the doors shall have ears
But we'll dance in their dark
And they'll play with our lives

[Chorus]
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and round
Hark who are we
So small in times such as these

[Refrain]
Slow Burn
Slow Burn

[Verse 2]
Oh, these are the days
These are the strangest of all
These are the nights
These are the darkest to fall
But who knows?
Echoes in tenement halls
Who knows?
Though the years spare them all

[Chorus]
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Twirling us round and round
And upside down
There's fear overhead
There's fear overground

[Refrain]
Slow Burn
Slow Burn

[Chorus]
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and round
And here are we
At the center of it all

[Refrain]
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
Slow Burn

[Intro]
I've been looking, I've been looking
I've been looking, I've been looking

[Verse 1]
I've been looking
For a woman
To save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with a feeling
Of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now

[Verse 2]
A woman with a feeling
Of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now

[Verse 1]
Walking in the snowy street
Let me understand
Drifting down a silent park
Stumbling over land
Open up your heart to me
Show me who you are
And I would be your slave
Do you sleep in quietude?
Do you walk in peace?
Do you laugh out loud at me?
No one else that is free
Open up your heart to me
Show me all you are
And I would be your slave

[Chorus]
I don't sit around and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand

[Verse 2]
I bet you laugh out loud at me
A chance to strike me down
Give me peace of mind at last
Show me all you are
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave

[Chorus]
I don't sit around and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand
I would give you all my love
Nothing else is free
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave

[Chorus]
I took a trip On a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And boy, I really felt blue

[Verse 1]
Two or three flying saucers
Parked under the stars
The winding stream
Moon shining down
On some little town
And with each beam
The same old dream

[Chorus]
I took a trip
On a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I pulled down my sun visor
Boy, I really felt blue

[Verse 2]
You jumped into your Gemini
I jumped into mine
We'll orbit the moon
For just one time
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night
Will you hold hands
With me in the moonlight

[Chorus]
I took a trip
In a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I took
I took a walk in space
Boy, I really felt blue

[Verse 3]
Well, I peeked through the crack
And I looked way back
The stardust trail
Leading back to you
What did I do
What could I do
Yes what did I do

[Outro]
Well
I thought about you
I thought about you
Took a trip
On a gemini spacecraft
Thought about you

[Verse 1]
5:15
I'm changing trains
This little town
Let me down
This foreign rain
Brings me down

[Verse 2]
5:15
Train overdue
Angels have gone
No ticket
I'm jumping tracks
I'm changing towns

[Chorus 1]
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore you

[Verse 3]
5:15
All of my life
Angels have gone
I'm changing trains
Angels like them
Thin on the ground
All of my life
All legs and wings
Strange sandy eyes

[Verse 4]
5:15
Train overdue
Angels have gone

[Chorus 2]
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore you
Cold station
All of my life
Forever I'm out of here forever

[Verse 1]
Said you took a big trip
They said you moved away
Happened oh, so quietly
They say

[Verse 2]
Shoulda took a picture
Something I could keep
Buy a little frame
Something cheap
For you

[Chorus]
Everyone says 'hi'

[Verse 3]
Said you sailed a big ship
Said you sailed away
Didn't know the right thing
To say

[Verse 4]
I'd love to get a letter
Like to know what's what
Hope the weather's good
And it's not too hot
For you

[Chorus]
Everyone says 'hi'
Everyone says 'hi'
Everyone says
Don't stay in a sad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says 'hi'

[Bridge]
If the money is lousy
You can always come home
We can do the old things
We can do all the bad things
If the food gets you leery
You can always phone
We could do all the good things
We could do it, we could do it
We could do it
Don't stay in a bad place
Where they don't care how you are

[Chorus]
Everyone says 'hi'
Everyone says 'hi'
Everyone says 'hi'
And the girl next door
And the guy upstairs
Everyone says 'hi'
And your mum and dad
Everyone says 'hi'
And your big fat dog
Everyone says 'hi'
Everyone says 'hi'
Hi hi hi hi

[Verse 1]
Please don't tear this world asunder
Please take back this fear we're under
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop wanting you
Please make sure we get tomorrow
All this pain and all the sorrow

[Chorus]
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop needing you
I might just stop needing you
Give my children sunny smiles

[Verse 2]
Give them moon and cloudless skies
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you

[Bridge]
When we talk, we talk to you
When we walk, we walk to you
From factory to field
How many tears must fall

[Verse 3]
Down there below
Nothing is moving
I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop needing you
I might just stop loving you
I demand a better future
I demand a better future

[Chorus]
I demand a better future
For I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future

[Outro]
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
For I might just stop loving you, loving you, loving you
I demand a better future

[Verse 1]
Steel on the skyline
Sky made of glass
Made for a real world
All things must pass
Waiting for something
Looking for someone
Is there no reason?
Have I stared too long?

[Refrain]
Whoa
Whoa

[Verse 2]
You say you'll leave me
And when the sun is low
And the rays high
I can see it now
I can feel it die

[Refrain]
Oh (whoa)
Oh (whoa)

[Hook]
Now you got a body
But what I love most is how you put
Put your lips on top of me
You gots to be the baddest bitch I've ever seen in my life
Wait!
Your girl look better than you
You know what that means, I'm done with you
Bye!

[Verse 1]
Imma go hard, so fucking hard till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking arm
Whip the wood grain, whip the wood grain till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking palm
Break the blood vessel out their motherfucking eye everytime I ride by and they're looking at the charm
I laugh at em like that, with my seat laid all the, all the way to the back
And the heat lay right, right, right under that
Clap, clap, brr, brr, that's the sound of my gat
That's the sound of a 100 round drum, like a marching band, I'm a stand up guy
I'mma pump my fist, I'mma wave my hand until I get the attention of the president, pussy
Presedential suite, laying in, laying in nothing but money
With a dove skin bitch laying on the side of me
Reminds me of Buffy, please remind me to fuck her after this freestyle
100 carat, nigga I'm the golden child
Full metal jacket, shit, going pow, pow
Blow your brains out, let it hang out, let the neighbors talk about it, then skip trial
Wow, I'm amazed by how you niggas talk about you're married to the game, ain't took a vow
I'll fuck em up, cut em up, shoot em in the foot, or just gun butt em up
Now, I'm on some other shit, we ain't on the same page
You ain't sticking to the script
Let a 100 round clip stick to your lip like Carmex
Shoot up your whip, fuck your tire, leave your car flat
Blood or crip, I don't give a fuck bout none of that
All of y'all can get it, homeboy, it's more than rap
Training Day, I teach you niggas how to rap
I rap like I got angels on my back
God given, I never walk in the booth without the Holy Spirit
I don't write it
Off the top like a psychic
I kick, lyrics like Jet Li
Which produce money to put your boy on the beach
Shit, sand in my feet
Tell me what the fuck you know bout me

[Hook]

[Spoken: Madonna]
Oh, dear

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Let's dance, you can do a little two-step
I'll go anywhere that you step to
Because I'm following you

[Verse 2: Warren Beatty]
My feet might be fallin' out of rhythm
Don't know what I'm doin' with 'em
But I know I'm following you

[Chorus: Madonna, Warren Beatty, Both]
Unlikely as it is to me
On the floor with two left feet
Let's boogie woogie till our hearts skip a beat
But who's counting?
Encore
Once again around the dance floor
Romance is in the picture too
Now I'm following you

[Spoken: Madonna]
Take it away, boys

[Tap Solo]

[Interlude]
On the run
Be the one
On the run

[Montage: Madonna, male voiceovers]

(Come here Tracy, this is Sam, what are you doing up there?)
I'll tell ya
(Calling Dick Tracy, calling Dick Tracy)
(Do you read me, Tracy?)
(To tell you the truth Tracy, I don't know)
Find out
An unexamined life is not worth livin'
Come over here, come over here, come over here

[Verse 1 reprise: Madonna]
Let's dance, you can do a little two-step
I'll go anywhere that you step to
'Cause I'm following you

[Warren Beatty]
My feet, my feet
My feet might be fallin' outta 

[garbled]
Encore
Once again around the dance floor
Romance is in the picture too
Now I'm following you
But who's counting?

[Spoken Bridge: Madonna, male voiceovers]
(Ten million, twenty million, thirty million)
What about Dick Tracy?
(Forty million)
Dick, that's an interesting name
(Fifty million)
Dick Dick (Sixty million) Dick
Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick, (Seventy million), Dick
Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick (Eighty million), Dick Dick Dick
Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick
(Ninety million)
Dick
My bottom hurts just thinking about it

[Chorus: Madonna & Warren Beatty]
Unlikely as it is to me
On the floor with two left feet
Let's boogie woogie till our hearts skip a beat
But who's counting?
Encore
Once again around the dance floor
Romance is in the picture too
Now I'm following you

[Spoken Outro: Madonna]
Could you knock it off please?
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Selling out is not my thing
Walk away, I won't be broken again
I'm not, I'm not what you think
Dream away your life, someone else's dream
Nothing equals nothing

[Verse 2]
Letting go is not my thing
Walk away, won't let it happen again
I'm not, I'm not very smart
Why should I feel sad for what I never had?
Nothing equals nothing

[Chorus]
Turn to stone, lose my faith
I'll be gone before it happens
Turn to stone, lose my faith
I'll be gone before it happens

[Verse 3]
Selling out, is not my thing
Walk away, I won't be broken again
I won't, I won't fall apart
Dream away your life, dream away your dream
Nothing equals nothing

[Chorus]
Turn to stone, lose my faith
I'll be gone before it happens
Turn to stone, lose my faith
I'll be gone before it happens
Turn to stone (Turn to stone)
Lose my faith (Lose my faith)
I'll be gone before it happens
Turn to stone (Turn to stone)
Lose my faith (Lose my faith)
I'll be gone

[Verse 1]
Do you think I'm crazy
For considering aviation?
I'm a fan of flying
Why not do it for the nation?
Cause I have nothing else to do
This summer but commit it to you
Have a big degree in philosophy
But I don't know what I want to be

[Chorus]
So I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
Going into aviation
I'm going into aviation

[Verse 2]
Do you think I'm crazy
Cause I'm up and leaving, baby?
Well, I ain't got nobody
And I ain't got no money, baby, yeah
I feel high as I might tonight
So lean back and enjoy the ride
And the weather is clear, yeah, nobody is near
The future is not here

[Chorus]
So I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
Going into aviation
I'm going into aviation

[Verse 3]
Do you think I'm crazy
Cause I'm going to Pensacola?
Where nobody knows me
Where someone could just start over
I'll be all right in a month or two
Cause it's warm there in the winter, too
Think New York is great, I really like the state
But it's time to be on my way

[Chorus]
I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
I'm gonna take a vacation, yeah, man
Fly fighter jets all over the nation
Fly fighter jets all over the nation

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
From the Colosseum Block to the Island, "What the blood clot?"
Stay designing, always wiling, and we puff pot
Queens to Brooklyn, no lies, give 'em 'nought shot
Chicken been getting jerked before your little nuts dropped
You know the mantra, Tyson in 

[El Fonta?]
The i-tal jockey keep me fucking like a monsta'
Her landing strip is red like hair that's on Tatanka
I'm steady diving in chocolate like Willy Wonka
I take a knee and shoot a duck in the air
Five minutes, I'm making stuffing filled with truffles and pears
I'm lapping "Go," while you only move a couple of squares
But still take out some time to do some drugs in the stairs
"Freeze! Lay on your stomach," what the popo said
My team selling the patties, getting cocoa bread
Babylon, them have to catch me, burn up on the irie!
Never die, I'ma give it to you my way!
Yo, peace to the chicken spot, peace to patty spot
Peace to the types of spot that Veggie Castle dready spot
The dollar van, the Wallabe and Reggie spot
And if a coward wanna rump I give him seven shots

[Hook]
Y'all wan' test we? I'm in the corner puffing Marley
Got the knife inside the boot, hoping they don't shoot
Cuz I don't want to hurt nobody, Ow
Y'all wan' test we? I'm in the corner puffing Marley
Got the knife inside the boot, hoping they don't shoot
Cuz I don't want to hurt nobody, Ow

[Verse 2: Maffew Ragazino]
Ay, ya no wan' rump with the senior
Who lean like he mixed Jamaican rum and tequila
Trail a load of hoes from Kingston and Montego
Keep dick hard like Rottweiler Mandingo
Bob Marley ganja, stuffed up in the fanta
Pass the dutchie towards San Fransisco
Where your nephew bout to bounty kill a punaani
Hoes know the Movado!
Lick a shot for Windswee
I am living dangerously, Barrington Levy
Make the girl wine like Beenie "Sim Simma"
Keys to my new bitch bimma, her name Serena
Rastafarian reefer got me feeling so irie, tranquil and leisure
Berry salmon and jerk chicken
Oxtail, gravy on white rice and fried plantain

[Verse 1: Alex Turner]
Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky
Yours until the rivers all run dry
In other words, until I die

[Verse 2: Oisin Leech]
Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours until the sun no longer shines
Yours until the poets run out of rhyme
In other words, until the end of time

[Bridge: Alex Turner]
I'm gonna stay right here by your side
And do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothing in the world could drive me away
Every day, you'll hear me say

[Verse 3: Alex Turner]
Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours until two and two is three
Yours until the mountain crumbles to the sea
In other words, until eternity

[Outro: Alex Turner & Oisin Leech]
Baby, I'm yours, 'til the stars fall from the sky
Baby, I'm yours, until the rivers all run dry
Baby, I'm yours, until the sun no longer shines
Baby, I'm yours, until the poets run out of rhyme
Baby, I'm yours

[Intro]
It's a lot of it nigga
Oh so your old ass don't wanna smoke with a nigga?
I got weed
It's a lot of it nigga
Yea, uh

[Verse]
Nigga we made it
Niggas get jealous
The owner can't tell us shit nigga we paid it
Look at the picture we painted
My shit make your shit get repainted
My nigga I'm faded, S-O to pay me
Cause this year I promise they got it we take it
Fuck all them bitches that hated
Last year I got lazy cause nigga we mofucking made it
No I ain't giving out favors
If niggas is talking then dissing is cool
Cause this year ain't no nigga my neighbor
It's hundreds I'm running
I eat with Armenian niggas that get to that paper
I'm back on the road with a four and a baby
So baby just hit up my pager, nigga I'm major
This shit was a movie, I took her for sushi
My kick is front Louie, my chick outta truly
Your bitches are groupies, one of Wasatcha
My nigga book me the flight
I was gon' book her the ticket to fuck her
But it only took me one night and I damn near
Head in a Porsche I crashed the Panamera
I ain't got a damn care cause I'm the man in here
Walking with the metal cause the mofucking devil
Ain't playing it fair, I throw a damn chair
Liquor and the weed got me looking like a nigga with a blank stare
I'm in the bank yeah, every time I step up in your city
I'm the nigga getting banked out, I said I said it before
She getting me high but give me head on the low
I been getting the dough but really getting it though
Got the KDE moving and that's a cheddar to go
I b-redded flow enough finesse on the low
You can never nigga when I'm coming all up in it
Niggas talk money but it's funny to me
They don't see me like the car tinted
(Ah!) Everything I'm doing gotta have an R in it
Audemar, Audecar, authentic
The streets wanna know why you and Drizzy Drake
Ain't been doing no features
I'm not for the answers the only thing I am is ready when he is
In living Jesus I nailed 'em my keeper to help me spit ether
My women let Bellevardé spill on designer they know I got cleaners
Fuck with me shawty, if it ain't me then who else?
We learned it from early don't bite off the hand
That's gon' feed you some wealth
Killer on the street, I preach and I repeat
No slip I sleep, I creep with my heat
Ice deep, even on my street with my peep the nigga might try pre-or
Got off a tour, 'bout to go hop on another one
Tell a fuck nigga to fall back (Yup!)
Just like the summer done
Said it when I was eleven when I put the pen into the pad
Like Paramedic Pat, now we pull up pressing 

[?]
We done took an interception
Jugging in a cooking section, niggas took it that you took a lesson
But I didn't 

[?]
And you know the mofucka in the hood
Rapping like a mofucking hood reverend

[Verse 1]
How do I say goodbye
To what we had?
The good times that made us laugh
Outweigh the bad

[Chorus]
I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

[Verse 2]
I don't know where this road
Is going to lead
All I know is where we've been
And what we've been through, ooh

[Chorus]
If we get to see tomorrow
I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

[Chorus]
And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday
And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

[Verse 1]
The rain slammed hard as bars, it caught me by surprise
Mutt of the planet and shook me down for alibis
I'm waiting for the keeper to release me
Debating this sentence, biding my time
In memories of old friends of mine
In daydreams of Birdland
I see my soul on fire, burning up the bandstand

[Chorus 1]
Next time I'll be bigger, I'll be better than ever
I'll be happily attached to my cold hard cash
But now Manhattan holds me to a chair in the sky
With the Bird in my ears and boats in my eyes going by

[Verse 2]
There's things I wish I'd done, old friends I'm gonna miss
Beautiful lovers I never got the chance to kiss
Daydreamin' drugs the pain of living
Processions of missing lovers and friends
Fade in and they fade out again
In daydreams of rebirth
I see myself in style, raking in what I'm worth

[Chorus 2]
Next time I'll be bigger, I'll be better than ever
I'll be resurrected royal, I'll be rich as Standard Oil
But now Manhattan holds me to a chair in the sky
With the Bird in my ears and boats in my eyes going by

[Verse 1]
It was only last June when her old man ran away
She couldn't stop crying cause she knew he was gone to stay
10:35 on a lonely Friday night
She was standin' by the bar, hmm, she was lookin' alright, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I asked if she wanted to dance
And she said all she wanted was a good man
And wanted to know if I thought I was qualified, yeah

[Chorus]
I said, "Baby, don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
I may be qualified for a one-night stand
But I could never take the place of your man"

[Verse 2]
It hurt me so bad when she told me with tears in her eyes
(Tears in her eyes)
He was all she ever had and now she wanted to die
He left her with a baby and another one on the way, yeah
She couldn't stop cryin' 'cause she knew he was gone to stay, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She asked me if we could be friends
And I said, "Oh, honey baby, that's a dead end
You know and I know that we wouldn't be satisfied, no"

[Chorus]
And I said, "Baby, don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
Wouldn't be satisfied with a one-night stand
And I could never take the place of your man"

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, the place of your man
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
One, two, one, two, woo
Ahh

[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
In France a skinny man died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle and soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys and their idea of fun Is being in a gang called The Disciples, high on crack, totin' a machine gun
Time
Time

[Verse 2]
Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a church and killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story is tellin' you somebody died
Sister killed her baby 'cause she couldn't afford to feed it
And we're sending people to the moon
September my cousin tried reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing horse; it's June
Time
Time

[Chorus]
It's silly, no?
When a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies
Oh, why?
Time
Time

[Verse 3]
Baby make a speech, star wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn
Time
Time

[Chorus]
Is it silly, no?
When a rocket blows up
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say man ain't happy, truly
Until a man truly dies
Oh, why?
Oh, why?
Sign o' the Times
Time
Time

[Outro]
Sign o' the times mess with your mind
Hurry before it's too late
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby
We'll call him Nate, if it's a boy
Time
Time

[Verse 1 : Young Thug]
(Uh!) Plottin' on Donald Trump (woo! woo!)
I was 15 years old when I shot that chopper (rrraah rrrah rraaow!)

I said do not think I'm tripping when I say "Bitch, I be the real-iest"

Loaded with Benjamin Franklin
Walkin' through Beverly Center with etiquette
Issuing out so many bars, the cameras are rolling
They tryna edit it (Longway!)
Jawbreaker, jawbreaker, jawbreaker
I got that hard like "Ed, Edd, n' Eddy"

[Hook: Young Thug]

Nigga I'm just sayin' homie (sayin' my nigga..I'm sayin')
We got thrown in a riot van
And the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win
Just had to take it on the chin

Smoked a bong a last night
And stole somebody's telephone
He thinks it's all alright
But they've left him on his own, on his own

But baby stop calling
Over and over, yeah
And give me some funny cigarettes
And do what they told you, yeah

Pinched a car with one headlight
And lost control, the passengers were screaming
Made him shut his eyes right tight
And think of you, and hope that he was dreaming

Then up rolled the riot van
And called the fire brigade
But it was already too late
And there was no arrests to make
Ohhhhh!
But baby stop calling
Over and over yeah
And give me some funny cigarettes
And do what they told you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I should warn you
When I'm not well
I can't tell
Oh, there's nothing I can do
To make this easier for you

[Refrain]
You're going to need to be patient with me

[Verse 2]
I'm this apple, this happening stone
When I'm alone
Oh, but my blessings get so blurred
At the sound of your words

[Refrain]
I’m gonna need you to be patient with me

[Verse 3]
How can I warn you when my tongue turns to dust
Like we've discussed
It doesn't mean that I don't care
It means I'm partially there

[Refrain]
You're going to need to be patient with me
That's when I knew you
You might be lonely too
That's what I wished for
Somebody just like you
To tell me what to do, honestly
And leave me like you found me

Can you believe it
I'm somebody just like you
Content with being blue, honestly
Leave me like you found me

I sit on the couch alone
Where you sit when I'm not home
And I feel so close to you

And down the city streets
People are climbing the trees
They're finally up off their knees
Honestly
You leave me like you found me
Can you leave me like you found me

[Hook]
I'm black and Jewish
Don't be so foolish
I'm black and Jewish
It's a Mitzvah

[Verse]
Please don't forget I'm black, please don't forget I'm Jewish
I play ball like Lebron and I know what a W-2 is
Chilling in Boca Raton with my mensch, Lenny Kravitz
The only purple drink we sip is purple Manischewitz
At my show, you won't simply put your hands in the air
We can also raise a chair or recite a Jewish prayer
Like Baruch Yitadel Yisrael
Ve'et ha Kim Kardashian Kanye West, amen
I eat Hova with nova, knishes with my bitches
A bagel and cream cheesy with my boy, his name is Weezy
Do not go to Feingold's, though
The pickles are rubber
And I will not be harming ya
I read the Old Testament, okra and matzahball, I'll eat the rest of it
I celebrate Hanukkah, dated Rihannakah
Birth right in Israel, mama from Canada
Daddy from Africa
Best of worlds when you're Jewish with black in ya
Challah!

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
Oh bitch I'm country as cowboy boots
I debut beating boy band groups
Nigga let me know what the fuck y'all wanna do
Either keep up or you can't (can't)
Mildew or barbecue, crack or do your thang, dang
I ain't come here for no dumb shit
You tell me which one is the hardest nigga
Lyrics or the drum kick
And when it's finished over and done with
I'ma smoke a blunt and knock the pussy off of some bitch
I ain't no speedy, you say I beat it too much
I ain't gone eat it, you ain't gone drown me, and I pound it enough
See me leaving with a big butt woman
With me, walking funny, pussy up in her stomach
Sittin' in the front cause T.V.'s running
Peanut-butter leather seat, with Big Truck on it
I must've kidnapped her, the nigga man-hunting
Cause I heard him hollering, "Hold on baby I'm coming!!!"

[Hook: Butch Cassidy]
We hushed those who never thought we would get this far
(Baby, I'm comin')
(I'm coming baby!)
But bitch I told you (Tarantula)
So do what you're supposed to (Tarantula)
Give me brains, stop looking strange, bitch, shit changed
It's just like I told you (Tarantula)
Came up like I'm supposed to (Tarantula)

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
And I'm known as the Black Prince of the South
So wop-bop-a-loo-bop, bitch watch out
I make your momma shake her tail feather
Don't tell your daddy that I'm here, because you know I make him feel threatened
Go get your sexy dress to turn me on
While he down there quoting Betty Wright, "I know you not gon' sing that song!!!"
I hit the chart and never move off
Or homie cool off
Before your nose looks like Rudolph's
I give it to him and this bitch can't handle it
Old ugly, jealous, mother-fucker, this shit jammin'
Ridiculous amounts of raw uncut talent
On top of bass, strings, kicks, and piano
They callin' me big bucks, no whammies
This year I'm screaming, "Jive Records, Big Truck," got dammit
Heads up, tighten up, a nigga move
Ranked CEO/Rapper/Fool

[Hook: Butch Cassidy]

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
I'm fixin' to blow up like the jaws of Dizzy Gillespie
Heavens to Betsy
Julio Iglesias couldn't out rock me, Speedy Gonzales couldn't come catch me
Grammy-nominated, especially
The Soul Train Award winner, call me Black Elvis Presley
You probably can't keep up with what you've seen me on
Either 106 & Park, Queen Latifah, Chris Rock, or Jenny Jones
I knock down buildings, and chop down trees
I kick so fucking hard they say, "You Japanese?"
I'm up in the millions because of what I invent
Look at you, over there with your seat belt light on approaching y'all initial decent
A.k.a The Tarantula
Hot rhymes coming from a canister
They keeping my fans for something to brag on
These peoples in here ain't leaving until I finish my fucking last song
Bitch, walk like a Barbarian
Tall, dark and cut, I keep them fucking hoes starin'

[Hook: Butch Cassidy]
MCQUEEN: You've been on the scene as an artist now for 10 years, which is impressive, given the level of interest and artistry that you've managed to sustain in your work. In the process, you've become incredibly influential. So you talk about doing all of these other things, which is great, but there's really no amount of money that could make you more influential than you are now. So my question is: What are you going to do with all of the influence that you have right now?

WEST: Well, influence isn't my definition of success—it's a by-product of my creativity. I just want to create more. I would be fine with making less money. I actually spend the majority of my money attempting to create more things. Not buying things or solidifying myself or trying to make my house bigger, or trying to show people how many Louis Vuitton bags I can get, or buying my way to a good seat at the table. My definition of success, again, is getting my ideas out there. The first company that has really given me a shot is Adidas. They did the deal ... I mean, Damon Dash did the deal, at the end of the day. He signed Kanye West 12 years ago. What does that mean now?  What does that mean to music? You know, people say things about creativity and jobs and every 10 years, blah, blah, blah. But I don't have a desire to not continue making music. When I left Chicago and moved to New York, it wasn't because I didn't love Chicago; it was because I needed to go to New York. So right now, I've got other innovations and other thoughts that I want to pursue. As I was saying earlier, I create like a 3-year-old. When you're 3, you wake up one morning and say, "I wanna ride a bike." And then the next day, you wake up and say, "I wanna draw." I don't want to be in a situation where, because I was good enough at riding a bike one day, then that's all I can do for the rest of my life. I mean, you know firsthand, being a fine artist and then moving into the Hollywood space ... You know, I say to Renzo Rosso, Bernard Arnault, and François-Henri Pinault, the heads of Diesel, LVMH, and Kering, "Come to my show and look at the mountain I made. Look at these 20,000 people screaming, and then tell me I don't deserve to design a T-shirt." If I want to design a T-shirt in my lifetime, then please help me do it! People say, "Well, why don't you just do it on your own?" Are you telling me to sew every single T-shirt? People say, "Why do you antagonize the high-end companies and your fan base?" and this and that. But what I'm saying is that in working with partners like Louis Vuitton and Zanotti and Balmain and Fendi like I have—and please forgive me for using film as a metaphor because I hate when people do that with music—I feel like it's a better form of film that I'm working with when I work with them. I'm working with better cameras. I'm working with better editors ... Steve, please forgive me because I feel like it's super-patronizing whenever someone does an analogy or a metaphor that relates to the field that you currently work in

MCQUEEN: No, not at all

WEST: I'm sorry. I find it super-insulting whenever people give me a music analogy. It's like, "You know, I would have understood it if you just said it in English. You didn't have to put it in music terms, like you somehow know more about music or I would understand it better if it were in music terms." So please forgive me for putting that in film terms. I mean, talking about film to Steve McQueen ...

MCQUEEN: 

[laughs] I grew up in Europe, in London, and you grew up in the States. When was the first time you came to Europe? Do you remember?

WEST: I think it was when Damon Dash had me and some other Roc-A-Fella artists come over. He stressed the importance of connecting with London, especially. Then we went to France, and I hated France when we first went there. Now, of course, I love it. But at the time, there was a rapper out of Chicago who wanted me to show up at some event of his, and he was trying to threaten me in some way physically if I didn't show up because we had done a record together. And Dame Dash had to man-up on the situation and apply a bit of gangster to have them fall back, just for me to be able to get on that first flight to London

MCQUEEN: It's interesting how when Malcolm X ventured out of the United States for the first time, he went to Europe, he went to Africa, he went to Mecca, and then, when he came back to America, he realized that, to some extent, for him, it wasn't about black or white, it was about people. In talking to you now, it seems like you feel the same way—that it's never really been about race for you, but at the same time, it has very much been about that, if you know what I mean

WEST: My mission is about what I want to create. It's for people, for humanity. It's about things that can make the world better. I'm not saying that I'm going to make a better world; I'm just saying that I will provide some things that will help, and my glass ceiling that I'm facing is based on my color. You know, I was looking at some cheesy-ass MTV videos a while ago, and it was so funny because it was like, "Wow, these videos are pre-Michael Jackson"—and people forget that Michael Jackson had to fight to get on MTV because he was considered to be an urban artist. This was, like, the greatest pop star of all time, and they told him, "We're not gonna play your video because it doesn't fit our format."

MCQUEEN: It actually stunned me to find out that you've never won Best Album at the Grammys. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, but it's kind of odd, considering what you've done in music over the last decade

WEST: I wasn't even nominated for Best Album this year. This year, I only got two nominations by the Grammys: for Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song

MCQUEEN: Well, that's my problem with all this stuff. It's ghettoization—and I'm talking about country as much as rap. It's all just music. And I've got a problem with people kind of trying to categorize it, where it's either good or it's bad. I find it all odd, to be honest. Have you ever been nominated for Best Album?
WEST: I've been nominated for Best Album maybe three times. I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne less than a year apart and neither of them got nominated. "Ni**as in Paris" 

[off Watch the Throne] wasn't nominated for Best Song either. But let's go into the fact that I have the most Grammys of any 36-year-old or 40-year-old or whatever, and I've never won a Grammy outside of the Rap or R&B categories. "Jesus Walks" lost Best Song to some other song; "Ni**as in Paris" wasn't nominated in that category. But those are the labels that people want to put on you. People see you in a certain way, so if I was doing a clothing line that had rock tees in it or whatever we just did for the "Yeezus" tour, which sells $400,000 of stuff in two days ... You know, I like Shame 

[2011] as much as 12 Years a Slave, but Hollywood likes the idea of a black director directing 12 Years a Slave more than it likes the idea of a black director directing Shame

And a couple stacks stashed up in your top drawers (So, Give It To 'Em)
And they coming 'round the corner, 5 percent

Chevy creepin' real slow, you know the routine
Don't try to play MacGyver
Sawed of shotgun pointin' out the window (So, Give It To 'Em)
Not to mention them crooked cops
Pull you over when you drop
On the side of the road, take all your word
Pocket all your dough
I ain't goin' thru none of that no more

Shell toed Adidas, all black Lamborghini
Sexy thang ridin' with me, granting wishes like a genie
Ain't no problem gettin' money, certified eight digits

Started at poverty now they call us the pinnacle
Talkin' Bugatti I blow it all on a vehicle
Millions in real-estate and the work that I administrate
When I smoke in the whip, peel the top just to vehicles
Ain't no palm trees in the ghetto, yeah it's cloudy weather
But we shinin' bright as ever!
I refuse to lose in any game I choose to play
Until I die, I gotta get it in a major way
Akon saved the day...

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
My head's killing me, I'm losing sleep
And I'm waking up tired of it all
Early in the morning and it's starting already
Why my name always involved?
I try to get rid of the baggage
Fake friends I call them "has-been"
Yeah, they lying on stuff
And it's okay if they don't show me love, no

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
They want me to lie down
They want me to crawl
They want me to cry now
But I'm never falling off

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Chris Brown]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody (Brap!)
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders? (Brap!)
Get off of me, (Brap!), get off of me (Brap!)
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah (Ow!)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Tell me what I gotta do
I'm tryna make it clear to you
Not dealing with the attitude
I'm tired of tryna make you see that I'm still me
Switched up my longitude and latitude
You're in my way, you better move
'Cause I'm on the same ride, know I'll never change
I'm lovin' every day, I know that I'm the same Jenny from around the way 'round

They want me to lie down
They want me to crawl
They want me to cry now
But I'm never falling off

[Intro: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still wit' you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you and that's just being real wit' you
You see, the truth is everybody wanna know
How close me and Snoop is and who I'm still cool with
Then I got these crab-ass niggas I first drew with
Claimin' they non-violent, talkin' like they Ruthless
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name outta your mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

[Chorus: Phish & Dr. Dre]
What's the difference between me and you? (Uh-huh)
You talk a good one (Uh), but you don't do what you supposed to do (Uh-huh)
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you? (Me and you)
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

[Verse 2: Hittman]
The difference is: I don't care
Can't you tell it by my rigid stare?
I'm legendary, get you open like a Frigidaire
More despair, your style's dead as Fred Astaire
You need medicare, security blanket and a fuckin' teddy bear
"Awh yeah, awh yeah"
Is your expression when you eyewitness a session
Vocal pitch makin' impressions like Jerry Butler
Stupid fucker, I will cut ya
Doin' a sucka's such a tragedy, I'll run you raggedy like Ann
You'll kick the pink can like a faggoty man
New styles, I usually keep clandestine
Like files of semen found in J. Edgar Hoover's intestines
No question
But keep that on the low low, Falana slow mo
When puffin' marijuana couldn't get the time of day
Now I'm fuckin' nigga's Mommas
Drama's still part of my dietary
Hit hard like Singletary
Kill your daughter, bust her cherry

[Chorus: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
A'ight, hold up, hold up!
Stop the beat a minute, I got somethin' to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me (What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back (Right), just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga, let's blow this bitch
I mean it dog, you ever need somebody offed: "Whose throat is it?"
Well, if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people (Hi!), then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed-off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin' to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, "I just don't give a fuck" and see who means it

[Chorus: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

[Outro: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?

[Verse 1]
Everybody knows I'm a good girl, officer
No, I wouldn't do a thing like that, that's for sure
The house was already on fire, I swear I'm not a liar (Officer)
Well, I'm a little shaken, but I'm fine, thanks for asking
Tell me, do you always work alone so late? (Officer)
Gosh, I'm a little shy standing here in my nightgown​
Do you really have to put those tight handcuffs on?

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking at me, then suddenly

[Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love
Lovin' hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane
I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Lovin' hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

[Post-Chorus]
Officer
Officer
Officer

[Verse 2]
Let's get in the back of your cop car, officer
You can ask me anything you want, anything, anything
Do you have a girl? I don't see a ring on your finger
Well that's interesting, have you ever thought of dating a singer?
The flames are getting higher, so's my desire
It's kind of exciting, don't you think?

[Pre-Chorus]
Then suddenly he's uncuffing me

[Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love
Lovin' hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane
I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Lovin' hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

[Bridge]
If you can't stand the heat
Then stay out of the fire
You might get what you desire, boy
Love is strange
Sometimes it makes you crazy
It can burn or break you

If you can't stand the heat
Then stay out of the fire
You might get what you desire, boy
Love is strange
Sometimes it makes you crazy
It can burn or break you down

[Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love
Lovin' hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane
I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Lovin' hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

[Verse 1]
When you left the house this evening
You said you'd be back in a little while
But I've been waiting for such a long time
And this waiting is driving me wild

[Verse 2]
And while I wait, I think about you
Do you need me and I'm not there?
Are you planning to be without me?
Do you have a new affair?

[Chorus]
You're a bad, bad woman
You're a bad, bad woman

If you would only call, if you would be so kind

You're a bad, bad woman
You're a bad, bad woman
You're a bad, bad woman

But it was already rolled

Oh, I turned down my lights

Back to the Wirral where it all began
Wirral riddler

[Chorus: Miles Kane]
Send a letter to me, baby

Sometimes I feel good, at times I feel used
Lovin' you, darlin', makes me so confused

[Chorus]
I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm lovin' you

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, I never felt this way

And cause me so much pain? (Yeah, yeah)
Just when I think I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you

[Outro]
What?

[Verse 1]
She's been thinking, well fuck it all, we're not going home today
And she's been eating too much magic beans to walk home anyway
And you can't fool me, come down to the dirty ground
Put up your picture and the playful word will get around
Yeah, word will get around, yeah
Yeah, word will get around

[Hook]
Everyone's feeling alright
I won't be sleeping today
I won't be sleeping tonight

[Verse 2]
Feeling silly, feeling oh so sick
And I can't see you through the smoke because the cloud's so thick
And there's a fire as you're dancing to the disco sound
Put up your picture baby and word will get around
Yeah, word will get around, yeah
Yeah, word will get around

[Hook]
Everyone's feeling alright
I won't be sleeping today
I won't be sleeping tonight

[Verse 1]
Space invaders flying home
And they're going to hit the sack
And they're probably going to die getting high
Cause they're mixing crazy moments with the crack

And she's kissing all the boys
She's to clever to be slack
But she's bound to go away for a day
And she'll like it, so she won't be coming back

[Hook]
Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days have died
Baby, baby, baby
Now won't you dry your pretty eyes
Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days are dead
Come on

[Verse 2]
Spot big bell bottom cords
And a matching with a hat
And you're a rule breaker, baby
Can't you see me standing only in your way to hit the sack
And she's kissing all the boys
She's too clever to be slack
But she's bound to go away for a day
And she'll like it, so she won't be coming back

[Hook]
Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days have died
Baby, baby, baby
Won't you dry your pretty eyes
Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days are dead
Come on

[Verse 1]
Come and take a leaf out of my book
I'm a crack-dealing crook
Selling lots of rock and roll to the masses
And I know if you wanna take a trip to the city
We can go (To Gibraltar)
We can go (To Gibraltar)

[Chorus]
Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on
Give me your switch card
I'll book some flights

[Verse 2]
1996 and I'm stuck at the bottom of a truck
On the run from the MI5, got detectives
And I'll say if you catch me that I really wish
That I had stayed (In Gibraltar)
That I had stayed (In Gibraltar)

[Chorus]
Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on
Give me your switch card
I'll book some flights

[Verse]
When you leave us through the patient doors
That rattle in your ear will be the sound of our applause
Rapturous, considered and due
Oh, the nasty laughter and desperate smirks
Are tangled in the boredom where our brittle kisses lurk
Well, how can I believe you when you can't believe your luck?

[Chorus]
And the shards of past attraction lie visible but shy
And blunt and weak and worn
Away by whining in the emery paper voice you use to speak
Oh, the shards of past attraction lie visible but shy
And blunt and weak and worn
Away by whining in the emery paper voice you use to speak

[Post-Chorus]
In the trap
You only want to be the first to laugh
You only want to be the first in the sandtrap
You only want to be the first to laugh

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
And your climbing holes and cinder claws
Ring out like the calenture that you sent us all towards
Farewell, farewell, farewell

[Verse 1]
If you want me to stay, I'll be around today
To be available for you to see
I'm about to go there then you'll know
For me to stay here, I've got to be me
You'll never be in doubt, that's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days I'm gone, forget reachin' me by phone
'Cause I promise I'll be gone for a while

[Chorus]
And when you see me again, I hope that you have been
The kind of person that you really are now

[Verse 2]
You got to get it straight, how could I ever be late
When you're my woman taking up my time
Oh how could I ever allow, I guess I wonder how
I could get out a pocket for fun, oh oh
When you know that you're never number two
Number one is gonna be number one, oh, oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh, I'll be good) Oh, I'll be good (I wish I could) I wish I could
Get this message over to you now

[Instrumental Break with Vocalizations]

[Chorus]
And when you see me again, I hope that you have been
The kind of person that you really are now

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be so good, I wish I could
Get this message over to you now

[Instrumental Break with Vocalizations]

[Outro]
Get this message over to you now
I'll be so good, I wish I could

[Instrumental Outro with Vocalizations]

[Verse 1]
Deep inside the soul hole of a-Mother Earth
Father Time came with a supersonic, supersonic burst
His soul monkey sperm tribes racing to be first
Her ruby fruit jungle givin' bush, baby, bush-baby birth
The baby was a boy, but I think what stunned her
Is that this bare-breasted baby was a baby boy, boy, boy, boy wonder
Crackin' from his thumb bone came thelonious thunder, yeah
Fill the sky with hellfire from way down, down, down under

[Chorus 1]
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I get all the bush I can

[Verse 2]
Erupting from the ground in Hollywood, he glowed
His jungle turned to concrete, his funk bone, bone, bone, bone to stone
A full-blown volcano, I must let it be known
That through this boy's veins, atomic lava blood flows and flows
His soul-shocking sounds, they make the mountains moan
This boy's become a man, it's time to take, take, take, take the throne

[Chorus 2]
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I get all the bush I…

I get all the bush I…

[Outro]
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man
I'm a jungle man

[Verse 1]
Well all right, take me back, hold my hand
All the way back to the brotherland
Take me back, I want to go back, ho
Oh, take me back with my funky ass band
All the way back to the brotherland, take me back, let's go

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to go as fast as I can
Slidin' on back to the brotherland, now children, ho
Take me on back, let's go
Take me on back, take me on back
Take me on back (Oh, east LA)

[Verse 1]
Oh give me a home where the buffalo roam
And the death of a race is a game
Where seldom is heard, a peaceable word
From the white trash who killed as they came
Though these words dig deep, they offer no relief
A-God save the queen, I am an Indian chief
There is a secret I keep, it's called the talking leaf
And you better believe that he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds a sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of a wounded knee creek

[Chorus]
American ghost dance
American ghost dance
American ghost dance

[Verse 2]
Today a new man who is with old ways
He walks the streets of life, but he's in chains
"I'm alive," he cried, "I can feel the flame
Burning red inside, I am an Indian brave
There is a memory, uh huh, that lives in my blood
Of the brand you laid on all you touched
But the burning flame, it turns to burning pain
Genuine genocide and that's truly insane
So like a wild hurricane, I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died when it should have been saved"

[Chorus]
American ghost dance
American ghost dance
American ghost dance
American ghost dance

[Verse 1]
Oh give me a home where the buffalo roam
And the death of a race is a game
Where seldom is heard, a peaceable word

Though these words dig deep, they offer no relief
God save the queen, I am an Indian chief
There is a secret I keep, it's called the talking leaf
And you better believe that he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds a sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of a wounded knee creek

You're in the middle of June in the summer of '59
I was young and cool, shot a bad game of pool, and I hustled all the chumps I could find
Now they call me the swan cause I wave my magic wand and I loved all the women to death
I partied hard, packed a mean rod, and I'll knock you out with a right or left

Got a box full of letters
Think you might like to read
Some things that you might like to see
But they’re all addressed to me

Wish I had a lot of answers
Because that’s the way it should be
For all these questions
Being directed at me

[Chorus 1]
I just can’t find the time
To write my mind
The way I want it to read

[Chorus 2]
You’ll come back again
And I’ll still be your friend

[Verse 2]
I got a lot of your records
In a separate stack
Some things that I might like to hear
But I guess I’ll give them back
I wish I had a lot of answers
Because that’s the way it should be
For all these questions
Being directed at me

Pumpin' the blood through the heart of New Orleans
She's the mystic heat of the Bourbon Street dream
She's just made out of flesh and bones
But let me tell you little boy, you better leave her alone

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Leroy Brown thought he was bad too
'Till she left him floatin' in the old bayou
She's the kind of girl, she's built like a bomb
She's the blackeyed, blackeyed, blackeyed blonde, get down

[Bridge]
That's right
She black
She blonde

[Verse 3]
That blackeyed beauty with the golden crotch
French electric sex a cock shocking swamp fox
Heaten queen of sleeze she's hot to box
But let me tell you little boy, she'll clean your clock

[Verse 4]
A slick and sly spy, stuck in the muck of the moat
Blew his mind to find a diamond in the boat
Double-o-dooms day for Mr. James Bond

Uh-huh
Blackeyed pea

Give it up to this planet full of strife
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap
The cups went up like a natural fact

[Verse 1]
It was our shoulder space that made the perfect place
For the magic of the cup to style out with grace
With a tight turn twist and a slight swerve swank
The brothers cup kissed with a kickass clank

[Chorus]
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up

[Refrain]
Give it up to this planet full of strife
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap
The cups went up like a natural fact

[Verse 2]
So love all your brothers and love all your sisters
Love all the misses and love all the misters
Don't be shy when you're sharin' your kisses
The brothers cup kiss and we ain't sissies

[Break]
We are the brothers cup
We are the brothers cup
Get it?
Good
Good
Alright
Keep it, keep it

[Bridge]
It is our notion that the perfect peace potion
Can be found in the wake of the green sea's motion
The long rocking swell of the mighty blue ocean
Is the cradle of peace it's the perfect peace potion

[Refrain]
Give it up to this planet full of strife
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife

[Verse 3]
With the power of the cup we are about to astound
All your preconceptions, they will come unbound
We're the brothers cup coming to your town
Bringing tubs of love we're going to spread it around

[Interlude]
We are the brothers cup
We are the brothers cup

[Chorus]
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up

[Verse 1]
To live without a savior, answer to his name
Shouldn't be afraid, shouldn't be ashamed
Like a kid behind the counter remembering your name
Shouldn't be afraid, shouldn't be ashamed

[Chorus]
If it's not like I told you, then it's still your call
You should live how you want, stay with me, we should stay apart
Just shouldn't ever have to be this hard

[Verse 2]
Like a man on the sidewalk remembering your face
Shouldn't look away, shouldn't be afraid
He remembers when they still wore gaiters, World War I
Shouldn't be afraid, shouldn't be ashamed

[Chorus]
If it's just your heart talking, I don't mind
If you want to call me darling, that's just fine, that's just fine
But if it's your mind that's wandering, it'll fall in line
When I kiss your cheek, dear, every time, every time

We used to have a lot of things in common
But you know now we're just the same
You always had more than I really wanted
Aw honey, help me
Aw honey, help me pick up the change

If it's just your heart talking, I'll listen every time
Dear, you can talk my ear off, anytime, anytime
But if my mind starts wandering, it won't be gone long
Whenever I hear your heart talking, it's a song, it's a song

We used to have a lot of things in common
But you know now we're just the same
You always had more than I really wanted
Aw honey, help me
Come on honey, help me pick up
Aw honey, help me pick up the change
Aw honey, help me
Come on honey, help me pick up
Aw honey, help me pick up the change
You're like a moon that's full
Across a sea of foam
I'm the sky you've been burning

I don't think you even understand
I thought I held you by the hand
I thought I held you

I'm like a songwriter
You're the reason I've run out
Run out of metaphors

I don't think you even understand
I thought I held you by the hand
I thought I held you
I thought I held you
You've got a problem, I think you know
I'll tell you mine before you go
You've been thinking about somebody new
That's not the issue

Secrets, I have some too
I'll tell you mine before I say goodbye to you
I've been thinking about leaving too
That's not the issue

I'm leaving, I'm leaving now
I'd say goodbye, but I don't know how
You've been sleeping with somebody new
That's not the issue
There's a whole lot of money that you gave me
I'd gladly empty my pockets right now
You'd parlay all that by triple
It's just that simple

Those days I'd gladly walk so long for you
Although it seemed I crawled most of the way
After some time I felt like a cripple
It's just that simple

Last week I was thinking about traveling by land
And the time you remember we were by the lake
It wasn't even like we made a ripple
It's just that simple
In my head, the time didn't make a ripple
It's just that simple
You've been dealing with all of these feelings
Like they got you believing they have no meaning
But they do

Your life's been stinking, your heart's been sinking
And you're too busy thinking to stop
You blink and you're blue

Should've been in love
Should've been in love
Should've been in love

Your mind's been racing, your heart's been chasing
And you might as well face it
Time's wasting, it's true

Your life's been stinking, your heart's been shrinking
And you're too busy thinking to stop
You blink and you're blue

Should've been in love
Should've been in love
Should've been in love
I know how it goes
So
I just had to
Let you know I know

My life's been stinking, my heart's been shrinking
And I'm too busy thinking to stop
I blink and you're gone

Should've been in love
We should've been in love
We should've been in love

[Verse 1]
When I sat down on the bed next to you
You started to cry
I said, maybe if I leave, you'll want me
To come back home
Or maybe all you mean is "leave me alone"
At least that's what you said

[Verse 2]
You're irresistible when you get mad
Isn't it sad? I'm immune
I thought it was cute
For you to kiss
My purple black eye
Even though I caught it from you
I still think we're serious
At least that's what you said

[Verse 1]
When the devil came
He was not red
He was chrome, and he said
Come with me

[Verse 2]
You must go
So I went
Where everything was clean
So precise and towering

[Verse 3]
I was welcomed
With open arms
I received so much help in every way
I felt no fear
I felt no fear

[Verse 4]
The air was crisp
Like sunny late Winter days
A Springtime yawning high in the haze
And I felt like I belonged
Come with me

[Outro]
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me

[Verse 1]
Spiders are singing in the salty breeze
Spiders are filling out tax returns
Spinning out webs of deductions and melodies
On a private beach in Michigan

[Verse 2]
Why can't we wish their kisses good
Why do they miss when their kisses should
Fly like winging birds fighting for the keys
On a private beach in Michigan

[Refrain]
This recent rash of kidsmoke
All these telescopic poems
It's good to be alone

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Why can't they say what they want
Why can't they just say what they need
Come clean, listen and talk
Hello private caller, his I.D.'s blocked

[Verse 4]
The sun will rise, we'll climb into cars
The future has a valley and a shortcut around
Who will wear the crown of drowning award
Hold a private light on a Michigan shore

[Refrain]
Fool me with a kiss of kidsmoke
From a microscopic home
It's good to be alone

[Interlude]

[Verse 5]
I'll be in my bed
You can be the stone
That raises from the dead
And carries us all home
There's no blood on my hands
I just do as I am told

[Verse 1]
There's a random painted highway
And a muzzle of bees
My sleeves have come unstitched
From climbing your tree

[Verse 2]
When dogs laugh some say they're barking
I don't think they're mean
Some people get so frightened
The fences in between

[Chorus]
The sun gets passed from tree to tree
Silently then back to me
With the breeze blown through
Pushed up against the sea
Finally back to me

[Verse 3]
I'm assuming you got my message
On your machine
I'm assuming you love me
But you know what that means

[Chorus]
The sun gets passed from sea to sea
Silently and back to me
With a breeze blown through
Pushed up above the leaves
With a breeze blowing through
My head upon your knee

[Outro]
Half of it's you, half is me
Half of it's you, half is me

[Verse 1]
His goal in life was to be an echo
Riding alone, town after town, toll after toll
A fixed bayonet through the great southwest to forget her
She appears in his dreams
But in his car and in his arms
A dream can mean anything
A cheap sunset on a television set can upset her
But he never could

[Chorus]
Remember to remember me
Standing still in your past
Floating fast like a hummingbird

[Verse 2]
His goal in life was to be an echo
The type of sound that floats around and then back down
Like a feather
But in the deep chrome canyons of the loudest Manhattans
No one could hear him
Or anything
So he slept on a mountain
In a sleeping bag underneath the stars
He would lie awake and count them
And the gray fountain spray of the great Milky Way
Would never let him
Die alone

[Chorus]
Remember to remember me
Standing still in your past
Floating fast like a hummingbird

[Chorus]
Remember to remember me
Standing still in your past
Floating fast like a hummingbird

[Outro]
A hummingbird
A hummingbird

[Verse 1]
I was chewing gum for something to do
The blinds were being pulled down on the dew
Inside, out of love, what a laugh
I was looking for you

[Verse 2]
Saxophones started blowing me down
I was buried in sound
Taxicabs were driving me around
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown

[Verse 3]
They were translating poorly, I felt like a clown
I looked like someone I used to know
I felt alright
And if I ever was myself, I wasn't that night

[Chorus]
Oh, it's okay for you to say what you want from me
I believe that's the only way for me to be
Exactly what do you want me to be?

[Chorus]
Oh, it's okay for you to say what you want from me
I believe that's the only way for me to be
Exactly what do you want me to be?

[Verse 1]
I was chewing gum for something to do
The blinds were being pulled down on the dew
Inside, out of love, what a laugh
I was looking for you

[Verse 2]
Saxophones started blowing me down
I was buried in sound
Taxicabs were driving me around
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown

[Chorus]
Oh, it's okay for you to say what you want from me
I believe that's the only way for me to be
Exactly what do you want me to be?
Exactly what do you want me to be?

[Chorus]
Fill up your mind with all it can know
Don't forget that your body will let it all go
Fill up your mind with all it can know
What would we be without wishful thinking

[Verse 1]
Chambers of chains
With red plastic mouths
The inside of outside
No one has found
How to unring the bell
It's just as well
The turntable sizzles
Casting the spells
The pressure devices
Hell in a nutshell
Is any song worth singing
If it doesn't help

[Chorus]
Fill up your mind with all it can know
Don't forget that your body will let it all go
Fill up your mind with all it can know
'Cause what would love be without wishful thinking

[Verse 2]
Open your arms as far as they will go
We take off your dress
An embarrassing poem
Was written when I was alone
In love with you
I shook down those lines
To shine up the streets
I got up off my hands and knees
To thank my lucky stars that you're not me

[Outro]
What would we be without wishful thinking
What would we be without wishful thinking
What would we be without wishful thinking

[Chorus]
Maybe the sun will shine today
The clouds will blow away
Maybe I won't feel so afraid
I will try to understand
Either way

[Verse]
Maybe you still love me
Maybe you don't
Either you will or you won't
Maybe you just need some time alone
I will try to understand
Everything has its plan
Either way
I'm going to stay
Right for you

[Chorus]
Maybe the sun will shine today
The clouds will roll away
Maybe I won't be so afraid
I will understand everything has its plan
Either way
I attack with love, pure bug beauty
I curl my lips and crawl up to you
I attack with love, pure bug beauty
I curl my lips and crawl up to you
And your afternoon
And I've been puking

I move so slow, steady crushing hand
Holy shit! There's a company in my back
I move so slow, steady crushing hand
Holy shit! There's a company in my back

Hide your soft skin; your sorrow is sunshine
Listen to my eyes
Hide your soft skin, your sorrow is sunshine
Listen to my eyes
They are hissing radiator tunes

I move so slow from the steady crushing hand
Holy shit! There's a company in my back
I move so slow, steady crushing hand
Holy shit! There's a company in my back
You learn so slow, old radiant beauty
I'll curve my flight
You learn so slow, old radiant beauty
I'll curve my flight
Under your bended knee
And I will always die, I will always die
I will always die, so you can remember me

I move so slow, steady crushing hand
Holy shit! There's a company in my back
I move so slow, steady crushing hand
Holy shit! There's a company in my back
There's a company in my back

[Verse 1]
Oh, hold on
You risk exciting me
Once in Germany someone said nein
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9
Oh, hold back
Oh, don’t invite me
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9
Once in Germany someone said nein

[Chorus]
I’m a wheel
I will
Turn on you

[Verse 2]
Oh, I invented a sister
Populated with knives
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

[Chorus]
I’m a wheel
I will
Turn on you

[Chorus]
Um
I’m a wheel
I will
I’m a wheel
I will

[Chorus]
I’m a wheel
I will
Turn on you

[Outro]
I’m going to  turn on you, turn on you
I’m going to  turn on you, turn on you
I’m gonna turn on you, turn on you, turn on you

[Verse 1]
I remember my mother's
Sister's husband's brother
Working in the gold mine full-time
Filling in for sunshine
Filing into tight lines
Of ordinary beehives
The door screams I hate you
Hate you hanging around my blue jeans
Why is there no breeze
No currency of leaves
No current through the water wire
No feelings I can see
I trust no emotion
I believe in locomotion
But I've turned to rust as we've discussed
Though I must have let you down
Too many times
In the dirt and the dust

[Verse 2]
I have no idea how this happens
All of my maps have been overthrown
Happenstance has changed my plans
So many times my heart has been outgrown
Now everybody's feeling all alone
Can't tell you who I am
When everybody's feeling all alone
Can't tell you who I am

[Verse 3]
I am looking forward
Towards the shadows tracing bones
Our faces stitched and sewing
Our houses hemmed into homes
Trying to be thankful
Our stories fit into phones
And our voices lift so easily
A gift given accidentally
When we're not sure
We're not alone

[Verse 1]
Sunlight angles on
A wooden floor at dawn
A ceiling fan is on
Chopping up my dreams
What is left of them
I take to sleep again
Where I dare pretend
I'm more than I seem
Tears get triggered
Yours remind me
Of the ice melting in my glass
Finally full again
So
I listen for
Your lips to break apart
Into words

[Chorus]
It definitely starts to spoil my heart
Somewhere there's a war
Sometimes there is art
It definitely starts to spoil my heart
Somewhere there's a war
Sometimes there is art
When I'm awake enough
I'm going to shake it off
Shake it off

[Verse 2]
Hotels hold me
Thoughts arousing
So many hearts
Beating in one place
Like a giant
Beast with many souls
No
Just a body
Full of holes

[Chorus]
It definitely starts to spoil my heart
Somewhere there's a war
Sometimes there is art
It definitely starts to spoil my heart
Somewhere there's a war
Sometimes there is art
When I'm awake enough
I'm going to shake it off
Shake it off

[Verse 1]
Your mind's a machine
It's deadly and dull
It's never been still and its will
Has never been free

[Pre-Chorus]
Lightly tapping
A high-pitched drum

[Chorus]
The sun starts to shine
And you shiver at your soul
A fist so clear and climbing
Punches a hole
In the sky
So you can see
For yourself
If you don't believe me
There's so much less
To this than you think

[Verse 2]
It's almost gone
The night is dissolving
In a cup God lifts
To toast the lightning
Lightly tapping
It's high-pitched and it hums

[Chorus]
Your spine starts to shine
And you shiver at your soul
A fist so clear and climbing
Punches a hole
In the sky
So you can see
For yourself
If you don't believe me
There's so much less
To this than you think

[Verse 1]
The greatest lost track of all time
The Late Greats' "Turpentine"
You can't hear it on the radio
You can't hear it anywhere you go

[Verse 2]
The best band will never get signed
K-Settes starring Butcher's Blind
Are so good, you won't ever know
They never even played a show
You can't hear them on the radio

[Verse 3]
The greatest singer in rock and roll
Would have to be Romeo
His vocal chords are made of gold
He just looks a little too old

[Verse 4]
The best song will never get sung
The best life never leaves your lungs
So good, you won't ever know
I never hear it on the radio
Can't hear it on the radio

[Chorus 1]
I'm walking
All by myself
I was talking to myself about you
What am I going to do

[Verse]
I was singing
This song about you
I was thinking about singing
This song for you

[Chorus 2]
The more I think about it
The more I know it's true
The more I think about it
The more I'm sure it's you
Honey I think you're just right
You're just right

[Chorus 1]
I was walking
Like I said by myself
I was talking
To myself about you
Like I always do

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
Are you under the impression
This isn't your life?
Do you dabble in depression?
Is someone twisting a knife in your back?
Are you being attacked?
Oh, this is a fact that you need to know
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Wilco
Wilco
Wilco will love you, baby

[Verse 2]
Are times getting tough?
Are the roads you travel rough?
Have you had enough of the old?
Tired of being exposed to the cold?
The stare of your stereo
Put on your headphones before you explode
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Wilco
Wilco
Wilco will love you, baby

[Bridge]
There's so many wars that just can't be won
Even before the battle's begun
This is an aural arms open wide
A sonic shoulder for you to cry on

[Chorus]
Wilco
Wilco will love you, baby

[Verse 3]
Is someone twisting a knife in your back?
Are you being attacked?
Oh this is a fact that you need to know
Oh

[Chorus]
Wilco
Wilco
Wilco
Wilco will love you, baby

[Verse 1]
If you feel like singing a song
And you want other people to sing along
Just sing what you feel
Don't let anyone say it's wrong
And if you're trying to paint a picture
But you're not sure which colors belong
Just paint what you see
Don't let anyone say it's wrong

[Bridge]
And if you're strung out like a kite
Or stung awake in the night
It's alright to be frightened

[Chorus]
When there's a light (what light)
There's a light (one light)
There's a light (white light)
Inside of you

[Verse 2]
If you think you might need somebody
To pick you up when you drag
Don't lose sight of yourself
Don't let anyone change your bag
And if the whole world's singing your songs
And all of your paintings have been hung
Just remember what was yours is everyone's from now on

[Bridge]
And that's not wrong or right
But you can struggle with it all you like
You'll only get uptight

[Chorus]

[x4]

[Verse 1]
By the end of the bout
He was punched out
Fists capsized, muscles shouting
Deeper down
He felt the insult of a kiss

[Verse 2]
Deeper still than we can go
Further out than triremes row
Drowning slow
His memories persist

[Verse 3]
Out beyond the telescopes prowl
Up above the towers touched up pile
He realized
This mystery is his

[Verse 4]
Underneath the ocean floor
The part of who we are, we don't explore
I adore the meaninglessness of the this
We can express

[Verse 5]
By the end of the bout
He was punched out
Fists capsized, muscles shouting
Deeper down
He felt the comfort of a kiss

[Verse 1]
We once belonged to a bird
Who cast his shadow on this world
You were a blessing and I was a curse
I did my best not to make things worse for you

[Verse 2]
That isn't true
I always knew this would be our fate
This is what happens when wings separate
This happens, all dead weight, eventually

[Verse 3]
We may as well be made of stone
We can't be flown

[Chorus]
One wing will never fly
Neither yours nor mine
I fear we can only wave goodbye

[Chorus]
One wing will never ever fly
Neither yours nor mine
One wing will never ever fly, dear
Neither yours nor mine
I fear we can only wave goodbye

[Chorus]
One wing will never ever fly, dear
Neither yours nor mine
I fear we can only wave goodbye

[Verse 1]
It's in my hair, it's on my clothes
It's in the river, over the road
It's shining down, my angry star
Hanging off the hood of my car
I'm not going far
Not going far

[Verse 2]
It's coming down, they're coming up the shoulders
What have they found? I wonder if they know
I'm in a bull black Chevy Nova
Silhouetted by the setting sun
This can't be undone
This can't be undone

[Verse 3]
If I'm the one, blood on the sofa
Blood in the sink, blood in the trunk
High at the wheel of a bull black Nova
And I'm sorry as a setting sun
This can't be undone
Can't be outrun

[Verse 4]
It's in my hair, there's blood in the sink
I can't calm down, I can't think
I keep calling, there's blood in the trunk
I can't calm down
I freak out
Black out

[Verse 1]
Come on, children, you're acting like children
Every generation thinks it's the end of the world
All you fat followers get fit fast
Every generation thinks it's the last
Thinks it's the end of the world

[Chorus]
It's a dream down a well
It's a lone heavy hell
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore

[Chorus]
It's a fear we transcend
That we're here at the end
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore
You never know

[Verse 2]
Come on, kids, you're acting like children
Act your age
Get back to black metals and pearls
Oh, all you sword swallowers, pull yourselves together
Every generation thinks it's the worst
Thinks it's the end of the world

[Chorus]
It's a secret I can't tell
It's a wish down a well
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore

[Chorus]
It's a long heavy hell
Synthesizer Patel
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore
But you never know
You never know

[Chorus]
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore
It's a secret I can't tell
It's a wish down a well
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore
It's a fear to transcend if we're here at the end
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore
But you never know
Oh, you never know

[Verse 1]
Wake up, we're here
It's so much worse than we feared
There's nothing left here
The country has disappeared
The winter trees bleeding, leave red blood
The summer sweet dreaming, April blush
But none of that is ever gonna mean
As much to me again

[Verse 2]
Hold out your hand
So much you don't understand
So stick as close as you can
All of the best laid plans
You've got the white clouds hanging so high above you
You've got the helicopters dangling, angling to shoot
The shots to feed the hungry
Weekend news crew anchorman

[Chorus]
So every evening we can watch from above
Crushed cities like a bug
Fold ourselves into each others guts
Turn our faces up to the sun

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I won't take no
I won't let you go
All by yourself
Oh no, you need my help
When the cold night shakes you like a chandelier
The snowflakes break through the atmosphere
And melt on the blue breath of the auctioneers
And disappear

[Chorus]
So every evening we can watch from above
Crushed cities like a bug
Fold ourselves into each others blood
And turn our faces up to the sun

[Verse 1]
Once I thought the world was crazy
Everyone was sad and chasing
Happiness and love and
I was the only one above it

[Verse 2]
Once I thought without a doubt
I had it all figured out
Universe with hands unseen
I was cold as gasoline

[Chorus]
Took too long to see
I was wrong to believe in me only

[Verse 3]
Once my life was a game so unfair
It beat me down and kept me there
Unaware of my naysayin'
Solitaire was all I was playing

[Chorus]
Took too long to see
I was wrong to believe in me only

[Chorus]
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go for you
I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight for you
I'll kill, I'll kill, I'll kill, I'll kill for you
I will, I will, I will
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go for you
I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight for you
I'll die, I'll die, I'll die, I'll die for you
I will, I will, I will

[Verse 1]
And if I die, I'll die, I'll die alone
On some forgotten hill abandoned by the mill
All my blood will spring and spill
I'll thrash the air and then be still
You’ll wake with a start from a dream
And know that I am gone
You'll feel it in your heart
But not for very long

[Verse 2]
You'll rise each day as planned
Your will is your command
And stand each Sunday
A hymnal steady in your hand
And you'll sing to yourself
The rising falling melody
That you could never read
Without the choirs' lead
Still alone and lost indeed
And your soul will not be free

[Verse 3]
I will go, I will go, I will go
And in wars waters I will wade
And I will know without remorse or regret
The fairness of our trade
For you to live, I took your place
A deal was made and I was paid
And the goal as I was told
Was a place where my body could be laid
And we will steal your life
And die old in better homes surrounded
By your peers without suffering or fear
Grandchildren far and near
And none will shed a tear
For the love no longer here

[Chorus]
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go for you
I will
I'll fight, I'll fight,I'll fight, I'll fight for you
I will, I will, I will

I'll kill, I'll kill, I'll kill, I'll kill for you
I will
I'll die, I'll die, I'll die, I'll die for you
I will, I will, I will

[Outro]
And if I die, I'll die, I'll die alone like Jesus
On a cross
My faith cannot by tossed
And my life will not be lost
If my love comes across

[Verse 1]
I was on my way home
From high school
I stuck at the crossing
I dug in for a duel
But at the last moment
I buried the brakes
My life split in two directions
Into two separate fates

[Verse 2]
I got on the last flight
To Amsterdam
But couldn't hit the runway
So we took off again
Aw, there's no need to worry
The captain cut in
The winds are less angry
Over in Berlin

[Bridge]
You know it's true
The other shoe
It waits for you
What can you do?
Remember to show gratitude
The darkest night is nothing new

[Verse 3]
Sonny's got a problem
All the mini-mart clerks know
She knows nothing of Eminem's
Suburban gangster flow
Oh, maybe it's random
How each moment unfolds
It didn't feel like the wrong time or place
Until they cut off her clothes

[Chorus]
A sonny feeling is taken away
A sonny feeling is taken away
A sonny feeling is taken away
A sonny feeling is taken away

[Verse 4]
I'm on my way home
From my high school
I'm always contemplating
Why the kids are still cruel
Oh, the kids are still cruel

[Chorus]
A sonny feeling is taken away
A sonny feeling is taken away
A sonny feeling is taken away
Some of the feeling gets taken away

[Verse 1]
Everything alive must die
Every building built to the sky will fall
Don't try to tell me my
Everlasting love is a lie

[Chorus]
Everlasting, everything
Oh, nothing could mean anything at all

[Verse 2]
Every wave that hits the shore
Every book that I adore
Gone like a circus, gone like a troubadour
Everlasting love forever more

[Chorus]
Everlasting, everything
Oh, nothing could mean anything at all

[Verse 3]
Oh, I know this might sound sad
But everything goes both good and the bad
It all adds up and you should be glad
Everlasting love is all you have

[Chorus]
Everlasting, everything
Oh, nothing could mean anything at all
Everlasting, everything
Oh, nothing could mean anything at all

[Verse 1]
Oh yes
I love my label and my label loves me
For she's so good and kind together we will pave our destiny
My label always loves to hear some pretty chords on its records like these ones
She's always pleased to hear some of these pretty melodies so I sing them some

[Chorus]
I love my label, I love my label yeah
And my label's got high hopes in me

[Verse 2]
Play the blues
Oh I'm so proud of them up here, we're one big happy family
I guess you could say I'm the poor relation of the parent company
They always ask for lots of songs but no more than 2:50 long so I write them some
They never talk behind my back and they're always playing my new tracks when I come along

[Chorus]

[x2]
Hate will keep us together
Love will tear us apart
What has joined us
In the dark

Oh I was worried
I would drive you away
You felt different and I felt the same

Then I told you
And you agreed
Some days I despise
Everyone I see
We're all swine
But you're all mine

What will keep us together
Will tear us apart
Maybe making up your mind
Breaks your heart
Hate will save the dolphins
I wish there was a way
I could change it so nothing
Would ever change
Or stay the same

All I can do
Is sing it for you
Whole lives go by
Then we die
You're all swine
We're swine

Love will keep us together
Love will tear us apart
I don't care what the song says
It's not my heart

Anyway, the point is
Things can always be worse
When you don't have a chorus
It's verse after verse after verse

Then I told you
In my arms
I hate you less
Than the rest
We're all swine
But you're all mine

Suicide doors and she dyin' to get in
They lookin' at me stank 'cause they know I be shittin'
They try to keep me out 'cause they know I take they women

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
Now let me find out, you will let me blow your spine out
Sex game mean, make you call a time out
Quarter 'til we can rendezvous at my house
That pussy crack had me fiendin' like Amy Winehouse
If I give you nine, can I get that other sixty?
When it come to licky-licky, we can split it fifty/fifty
Peanut butter skill'll have you cumin' in a jiffy
Damn, skippy, swallow my juniors, Ken Griffey

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ayy
Meet me outside, ask your girl what she think about ménage

[Verse]
Girl, you so beautiful
I love the way you feel inside
But I don't want you to think, I just want your body
I want all of you, of you
I don't want nobody more than you, no
Just want your body, I want all of you, yeah
Sweat dripping off your body onto mine
Don't it feel, don't it feel good?
Ain't nothing better when I'm inside
Girl, we doing what we doing very well
So, deep inside, deep inside your love
Deep inside
(Let me hit it!)

[Hook]
Hit this, hit this, hit this blunt with me
Baby
Hit this, hit this, hit this blunt with me
Darling
Hit this, hit this, hit this blunt with me
Baby
Hit this, hit this, hit this blunt with me

Well, it's the hungry hustler, Afro Man
Rims and Vogues on the Astro Van
Money coming in like a Palmdale Pimp
Double-O G with a low key limp

Always stand to myself
Concentrate on my wealth
Greater than your highest expectation
I run the world, let alone the nation
Doing it every day
Looking good, making pay
Smoking the best
From the west
Palmdale High
Across my chest
It's lonely at the top
But I like it
It's a brew punch and spike it
Who make this money?
Me, that's who!
I'ma smoke more weed
And drink more brew!

[Hook]

All the girls
Gather 'round
When Afroman
Comes to town

Hugging me
Kissing me
Bugging me
Dissing me

I'm in dank dimension
Love female attention
I'm down to Earth
But I'm top notch
C-walk like hopscotch

Snap your fingers
Bob your head
Hit the blunt
Make your bread
Stay on top like the boy dog
Life is something to enjoy dog
Take it, baby
All the way
When I hear you moan
I feel okay

Climax--
Fire up a tree
Baby--
Hit the blunt with me

[Hook]
Oh man...

I didn't prepare a speech and I'm sorry but I'm glad I didn't because I'm not gonna do this like everybody else does it.  'Cause everybody that I should be thanking - I'm really sorry - but I have to use this time. See, Maya Angelou said that we, as human beings, at our best,  can only create opportunities.  And I'm gonna use this opportunity the way that I want to use it.

So, what I want to say is - um, everybody out there that's watching, everybody that's watching this world? This world is bullshit. And you shouldn’t model your life — wait a second — you shouldn’t model your life about what you think that we think is cool and what we’re wearing and what we’re saying and everything. Go with yourself. Go with yourself.

And there's just a few people that I want to say something to.  I want to say, Mama, I love you I'm so glad that we're becoming friends. Amber, you're my sister, you're my best friend.  Andrew Slater - no one else could have produced this album, and no one else did. Um...

And it's just stupid that I'm in this world, but you're all very cool to me so thank you very much.  And I'm sorry for all the people that I didn't thank, but man...it's good.  Bye.

[Chorus]
This is my song for real, no doubt (oh)
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
(Feeling thugged out here)
As I walk you to the dance floor (oh)
We begin to dance slow (yeah)
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty

[Verse 1]
Hey pretty mama, how you doing?
Said I'm just in town for the weekend
Looking for a little trouble to get into
Baby, tell me what you're drinking
And I got you, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball (oh yeah)
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah

[Chorus]

Put your arms around me

With a back room I could come to live in
And your hair weave's looking kind of purty
The way you back it up on me baby
Lord have mercy

[Pre-Chorus]
Playas wanna play (um)
Ballers wanna ball (ballers wanna ball)
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah

[Chorus]

This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's (I'm feeling) making me feel thugged out (thugged out)
As I walk you to the dance floor (dance floor)
We begin to dance slow (we'll dance)
Put your arms around me (oh yeah)
I'm feeling on your booty

[Verse 3]
If it's your birthday
Then put your hands up
You wanna get drunk
Then put your hands up
And if you got some cash
Then put your hands up
Have your own job
Put your hands up

[Pre-Chorus]
Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball (ballers wanna ball)
Rollers wanna roll
Feels so good, say it again
Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah

[Chorus]

As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty

[Introduction]
Come on
Let me tell you a little story

[Verse 1]
Grandma, used to say nothing before it was time
Used to say that the world would be mine
So I should just have faith
She showed me, all I need in this life is for free
Change is one thing that is guaranteed
So I should just keep pace

[Bridge]
So I marched on like the soldier in the story
Long the way I met a guy named Glory
He went to my head
I said

[Chorus]
Oh baby, got to know you better
I'm feeling you now more than ever
Oh baby, got to know you better
I'm feeling you, feeling you
I feel the power
I feel the power
I feel the power
I want the power

[Verse 2]
Strong will
Long the road met a girl named Doubt
Wrapped in my mind, couldn't get her out
No matter how I tried it
And somewhere she introduced me to a friend named Fear
Thought I would never get the hell out of here
I had to say goodbye

[Bridge + Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You wanna feel invincible?
If you wanna victorious
If you wanna feel this way
Let me hear you say

Power
Say power
Say power
Say power

[Outro] (x2)
I said
Oh baby, got to know you better
I'm feeling you now more than ever
Oh baby, got to know you better
I'm feeling you, feeling you

[Verse 1]
Watching my life, passing right in front of my eyes
Hell of a story, or is it boring?
Can't claim to care, never been reluctant to share
Passing out pieces of me, don't you know nothing comes free?

[Chorus]
What Mom don't know has taken its toll on me
It's all I've seen that can't be wiped clean
It's hard to believe what it's made of me

[Verse 2]
Passing my life, living it out with her side
Listening closely, hearing her mostly
Can’t shake concern, seems that every time that I turn
I'm passing out pieces of me, don't you know nothing comes free?

[Chorus]
What Mom don't know has taken its toll on me
It's all I've seen that can't be wiped clean
It's hard to believe what it's made of me

[Announcer]

Greetings from Miami-Dade County, Florida
This is, this is, this is, this is, this is
Listennn!
This is, this is, this is, this is, this is
Ohhhh, New York!
Let's go Listennn!

[Chorus 1: Ja Rule, DJ Khaled, & Jadakiss]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the bass and that limelight glow
I know
(You thinking that this game is over)
Oh no!
(A-HAAAAAA!)
(The wait is over)
New York is back!
(Let me see your hands, wave 'em side to side)
D-Block!
(Put 'em up high, dunk ride cause)
New York is back!
(Let me see your hands, wave 'em side to side)
(Uh, yeah, uh yeah)
(Put 'em up high, lets ride cause)
(A-HAAAAAA!)
New York is back!

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yo, the hammer and the muzzle came together
All I did was hold on to the pieces 'til the puzzle came together
Before it all got hype
I was in the core of the Apple before it got ripe
So I ain't gotta act like
I'm on top of, or in front of them
If I'm not the best, dog, then I'm one of them
Listen, I'm a different kind of boss
I'm cut from a different kind of cloth
These niggas is different kind of soft
Everybody know it all
Nobody followin' protocol
The money's only good 'til you blow it all
Stacking ever since
Guliani knocked John Gotti (what?)
So now he's running for president
It's a shame what the game's became
But the truth is
There's really nobody to blame
But the music
Lets give it a minute
With no wack gimmicks
Just hard beats and rhymes
To blow breath back in it

[Chorus 2: Jadakiss (DJ Khaled)]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the bass and that limelight glow
I know
(You thinking that this game is over)
Oh no!
(The wait is over)
New York is back!
(Let me see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, dunk ride cause)
New York is back!
(Let me see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, lets ride cause)
New York is back!

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Muh'fucka I'm the heart and the soul of this
You claim king, but we in control of this
Name another rapper you see on the streets
Huggin' the block at the height of a beef!
(Coca!)
(Crack crack crack crack crack crack)
Yellow tape and white sheets
Yeah, that's my backdrop whenever I speak
I know a lot of y'all would love to ice me
Make my head jerk like I'm doing the hyphy
But that'll never happen, get on some sick shit
Like fifteen in you, and one in your infant
(Owwww!)
Joe's the business, ask about me
In the middle of the desert and they still can't drought me
You know Coka baby he stay on that New York shit
You seen Weezy coming down on that forklift
And money ain't a thing, unless he come up with
Then I'ma have to hit 'em, make a little breads often

[Chorus 3: Fat Joe (DJ Khaled)]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the bass and that limelight glow
I know
(You thinking that this game is over)
Oh no!
(The wait is over)
New York is back!
(Let me see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, dunk ride cause)
New York is back!
(Let me see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, lets ride cause)
New York is back!

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
New York, New York, nigga, never went nowhere
I just took off a couple of years
But now I'm back on my day-to-day
Old school, Gucci frames like day to day
Who gon' tell New York "Time's up"? Flavor Flav?
Cause as much as things change it remains the same
And you can give me the city of God
And Mecca, the temple, the mosque
An inspiration; the inception, the art
Of hip-hop was born
The rap game was formed
From niggas that's dead broke, sell drugs, bear arms
Against all odds
And argue all day about who's a bigger star; Joe, Jada or Ja?
So close but so far
So many with no start
I can't believe 50 Cent and NY fell off
Then LA came back, then South is running shit
Then one blood group, shit's all developing, NEW YORK!

[Chorus 4: Ja Rule (DJ Khaled)]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the bass and that limelight glow
I know
(You thinking that this game is over)
Oh no!

Maybe we can go down to 7-Eleven
Drive down the drag in your Pontiac heaven
Baby, you can buy me Diet Mountain Dew
And we'll get right down to it, me and you

Layin' on your hood like a flatbed truck
In the spotlight, we see Jim and Chuck
We saw their car from a mile away and it's slowin'
They say there's a motel dance, let's get goin'

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, it's a party

Say hello to your sisters and let's try some yoga
I'm yoda, it's cold, but let's get it poppin' like soda
One will make a bridge and two will make a pose up

I take'em to the head, now to the bed, said the red gorilla

[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Ooh I got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker and I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall

Say it now, say it now!

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Look what you're doing, look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run

[Intro: Big KRIT]
What’s good, get rid of them for the people
Black and blue remix, let’s go shawty

[Verse 1: Gary Clark Jr]
When you're feeling down and out
When you're feeling black and blue
You should feel like you can come to me
And I'll tell you the truth

Yet somewhere we got twisted
How do we get lifted?
How did we not go insane?

For so long we've existed
Still we are resisted
Why is it we still remain?

[Hook]
Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
Oh no, don't leave me
Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
Oh no, don't leave me

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Knockin’ on your door again, I heard you across the hall
Decided to provide you with knowledge that might just pause
Decisions to up and go, I know what you’re going through
No need to be shy about it, ain’t none of us brand new
Don’t let the world brand you and hand you no ass whoopin’
You gotta knuckle up, knuck and buck, shake your dreads
Ain’t talking about the club save your dub make your bread
Pursue your dreams, stay clean, don’t have no stanky leg
Because they don’t really dance no more
If you ain’t down for the cause what you standin’ for
We need an antidote, for all this hate
To people that relate, keep doing what it takes
Not to be black and blue

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gary Clark Jr]
They say you get just what you paid for
And that you reap just what you sow
So, you won't get everything you pray for
Surprises me that you don't know, by now

I need something to hold on to
While the world is spinning 'round and 'round
It could crumble any moment
I keep my feet on solid ground, for now

[Hook]

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I spent a hundred on my fit and it’s by Hundreds
I’ll do whatever for them hundreds, only hundreds
I spend them racks on my homies, but they one hundreds
I bangin' blood but all my hundreds, they blue hundreds
Keep it one thousand, I’m one thousand, I’m ten hundreds
Run hundreds extremely up and still don’t act funny
I'm a dream chaser, I'm chasin' nothin' else but money
I'm a dream chaser and I had a dream 'bout money

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I bought that brand new Rayful Edmond then I went and saw my bitch
And she said that make her pussy wet well girl come ride this dick
I’m the type to fuck yo ho, I won’t even lock her in
Let you fuck a nigga good, I don’t call her, I call her friend
I got it in by the 20, by the 10 I done been
Out in Paris with my niggas, bought some bottles, I'mma spend
Cause they go hard for me
Got niggas on 

[?] spendin' that hard money
And I know, shit, all my niggas 1 hundo
They was down when the money used to come slow
North side, south side, niggas cutthroat
Wrong time, outside, at yo front door
Fuck hoes, getting money, we don’t love those
You ain’t come for the money, what’d you come for?
Got a 7th in the Sprite, but I want mo
500 for the car, ho, hold up, hold up

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I spent a hundred on my fit and it’s by Hundreds
I’ll do whatever for them hundreds, only hundreds
I spend them racks on my homies, but they one hundreds
I bangin' blood but all my hundreds, they blue hundreds
Keep it one thousand, I’m one thousand, I’m ten hundreds
Run hundreds extremely up and still don’t act funny
I'm a dream chaser, I'm chasin' nothin' else but money
I'm a dream chaser and I had a dream 'bout money

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I’m a project breakin' on PJ
And my PJ came out a PJ
Bitch she wanna suck me up, that’s a survey
Me, Milly, and yo bitch, that’s a threeway
Roll it up, don’t smoke it, this persie
Run into my boys don’t persuade
Every time a nigga leave out the house got bands on me
And I’m feelin' myself like a nursery
Hickery, dickery, dock
I ride my Benzo to the stars
You better watch whoever mob
But any man take no mo
I got these bitches in a jar
I keep me some racks in a jar
I pull up not here, I’m fresh as a casket
Came from the dirt like a maverick
Only got choppas and I buy rounds by the hundreds
Choppa will make a nigga learn, call it phonics
Actin' like Arthur DW, boy you done with
I take a nap and I give a rack cause I’m dumb rich

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I spent a hundred on my fit and it’s by Hundreds
I’ll do whatever for them hundreds, only hundreds
I spend them racks on my homies, but they one hundreds
I bangin' blood but all my hundreds, they blue hundreds
Keep it one thousand, I’m one thousand, I’m ten hundreds
Run hundreds extremely up and still don’t act funny
I'm a dream chaser, I'm chasin' nothin' else but money
I'm a dream chaser and I had a dream 'bout money

[Verse 1: Howard Lawrence]
I’ve been infected with restless whispers and cheats
That manifested in words and lies that you speak 

[x4]

[Chorus: Howard Lawrence]
Because I played the fool for you
Because I played the fool for you
Because I played the fool for you
Because I played the fool for you
Because I played
Because I played
Because I...
Because I...

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Your love is so beautiful
And I'll play the fool for you
Boy, your love is so beautiful
And I'll play the fool for you babe
It makes me feel so good when you hold me tight
Hold to want me back
You make everything alright!
Boy, your love is so beautiful
And I'll play, I'll play, I'll play the fool for you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
Boy your love's got me in a daze
And I'd do anything you say
Boy your love's got me in a daze
And I'd do anything you say babe
You give me what I need
Baby, you're the one
Always be my king, can't nobody take you down
Boy, your love is so beautiful
And I'll play, I'll play, I'll play the fool for you

[Chorus x2]

[Break: Mary J. Blige x2]
I'll play
I'll play
I'll play!
I'll play
I'll play
I'll play!
I'll play
I'll play
I'll play baby!

[Verse 1]

[Verse One]
All I wanted was a record deal
A couple dollars when I got it
I couldn't understand why I still had all my problems
All alone, couldn't find no help
And the stage ain't a good place to find yourself
So I started lifting weights, hoping if I got bigger
All my confidence would too
Didn't work, go figure
Big ole' chest, hole in my heart
I even bought a chain
With ice to glow in the dark
But it didn't work though
Interrupt my work flow
And them haters talked shit
And I took it personal
But today, I feel like someone answered my prayers
I know it’s coming now so it’s cool

[Hook]
Let’s peel off a layer
To what’s underneath
What makes the real me?
I want you to see
Ma ma ma ma ma pain, my struggle
My story, my life
My heart, my spirit
My time, my fight
My flaws, my errors
My god, my life
My heart, my spirit
My time, my light
My light

Light light light
Light light light
Ma ma ma ma ma light
Light light light
Light light light

[Verse Two]
What is meant to be will be, all the rest we'll see
All the rest we'll see
Had to dream up new dreams cause I’m livin out my dreams
Alright
Let's just say it was a new beginning
I followed my heart and now I’m winning winning winning
Like I’m supposed to
Like I’m made for
Sean told me, we still the same brah
All I know is God made me good at writing songs
If you chase the wrong shit your whole life wrong
But it didn't work though, interrupt your work flow
I was on the wrong path, spinning round in circles
But today I feel like someone answered my prayers
I know it’s comin out so it’s cool

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Kanye West]

Uh, I don't need no little ass
I need a ghetto ass girl
With a car that can make it 'cross town with just a little gas
I know when we first met, you was a little gassed
But you want to keep your swag
So you was holding back
Your little brother love me
He say, "Yeezy got some fresh clothes"
Your grandmother love me
Cause I always dress in dress clothes
I can switch your dress code
Change your life like, "presto"
I am like that Aston Martin engine, you just press "go"
Why you acting like you ain't impressed for
Oh, see why you listen to the press though?
I ain't finna explain my life up on no Larry King
Cause when I show her that thing
She said, "that explains everything"
Everything
That just changed everything
Yeezy on her name ring
Yeezy where her chain bling
Yeah, I throw Barack up, but
Baby, you get my vote
Love a ghetto girl with more ass than the models

[Bridge: Kanye West]

See, see, see I did the screwed up shit myself
I ain't put no affect, no
You know

[Verse 2: Kanye West]

Ay, ay, ay gonna thump 'm thump
When I thump I'm thumpin' on the old game
I can thump, thump, do some, something 'till they sold me
Turn that bitch to a Soul Train
I'll get a thump with the old stain
Want to just slap that cocaine
Like a cold king, someone who just sound like, "okay"
Okay, I get it, I pound it, I spit it, now I'm throwin' up
I'm gonna, wanna something, 'till I got my moana
And then I'm gonna....

[Intro: Billy Blue]
And now ladies and gentlemen: Lupe Fiasco
Know you gotta sip that Remy to this one, Lupe (yeah)
Had to get Blue on this track, you feel me?
Uhh, holla at 'em, whoa!
That's all I appreciate right there man
I live for this shit, you know what I mean?
Uhh, talk to 'em

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, uhh, f-f-filet mignon with my food stamps (mm)
Car cosigned by my momma (Momma)
Medical card from Obama ('bama)
Background check for a chopper (chopper)
Filet mignon with my food stamps (mm)
Car cosigned by my momma (Momma)
Medical card from Obama ('bama)
Background check for a chopper (rrah)

[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]
Background check for a chopper (rrah)
Background check for a chopper (rrah)
Filet mignon with my food stamps (mm)
Background check for a chopper (rrah)
Medical card from Obama ('bama)
Background check for a chopper (chopper)

Background check for a chopper (chopper)

[Verse 1: Billy Blue]
I got my chopper full and my black tee, slide
My baby momma done fucked up on her food stamps
That’s three months to re-certify
I’m ridin', niggas be watching, they don’t want these problems
When them bills due, niggas get ready 'cause no bullshit, I'm plottin'
I’m a government baby, let me get my cheese, let me get my cheese
Got a seven-trey in my momma yard, sittin' on D's
I’m 'bout this fee, I’m 'bout this fee, just know what’s free
You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, so don’t critique
Look at me nigga, just a young hood nigga, tryna get this cake
I don’t need to be givin’ out how school gon’ educate
Filet mignon for my food stamps, I know momma credit quite good
So I’m out here with this dope money, got a big body in my hood
Nigga you see it, better believe it, this what I’m 'bout
Got a trap house that be boomin', nigga, fiends in and out
Cut the check, anyway it come, nigga, Section 8
See we straight, see this money I make, this block can stay, ha

[Verse 2: Buk]
Yeah bitch, filet mignon with my food stamps
Would tell you I don’t but it won't be the truth
Let me hit you back on my government phone
Still a hood nigga, whatcha want me to do?
We get a blunt and a joint out a sawbuck and loud
Where I’m from we be actually hoopin’ in Jordans
Five dollar white t-shirts and them loose cigarettes
Ain’t nobody finna do shit important
People really don’t give no fuck about nothing
Although they may smile and be cordial
Dealin’ around with the wrong damn crowd
Then bring a frown to my friend, I'm in an alley, we warned you
Background check for the chopper
The barrel breathin' back down the neck of imposters
The murder rate ain’t back down yet
Cause they ain't wrote that down yet to the nigga that was tryna say somethin’
Some people, listen
You could be predisposed or be preconditioned
Or speak with the preacher, been preaching, be the person
To put some process in your progress or be the prevention
I just live my life and I don’t stop grindin' until God tell me to
I get money, I ain’t gotta sell my soul, ho, who the hell is you?
They say my kind ain’t welcome everywhere, well I can deal with that
But those who pop they shit get the shit popped outta them
It's still a fact
So mind your business and stay the fuck outta mine
You’ll solve you'll find that this is
Best for everyone involved, all in all, the Lord my witness

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, uhh, f-f-filet mignon with my food stamps (mm)
Car cosigned by my momma (Momma)
Medical card from Obama ('bama)
Background check for a chopper (chopper)
Filet mignon with my food stamps (mm)
Car cosigned by my momma (Momma)
Medical card from Obama ('bama)
Background check for a chopper (rrah)

[Verse 3: Trouble]
Permit, don’t need permission from a doctor
I been smokin’ since a pre-teen toddler
I been servin’ since a jit, tryna dodge all the obstacles
My teachers all told me that were probable
Probable cause, no cracker never really had it
I was just a nigga in a high price whip
Yeah, I’m just a nigga with an education brought up in the ghetto
Where you better have extension on the clip
Well beef comes around in the town
More often than these bitches' emotions
I got a yopper, five dollars, off the streets (yeah I'm totin')
For protection more than anything though (you gon' test my devotion)
My first amendment right, they violate it anytime we outspoken
Chicago violence boostin’ up but we just focusin’
On other environments cause the country taking notice
More fiends are risin', molly the new dope
And I apologize cause it was something I was promotin’
Chopper in my bitch name in case I light somebody up
You just tell them it was stolen
Rich gunplay, shit that’s all they see, that’s all they know
Without it kinda hopeless
Said this in ’09 and still no medicare for grandma
I done said all their names and niggas still ain't want no anna
Lu probably tell me, "Trouble, you gotta put the mac down
Felonies all in your background"
Said this in ’09 and still no medicare for grandma
I done said all their names and niggas still ain't want no anna
Lu probably tell me, "Trouble, you gotta put the mac down
Felonies all in your background"

[Verse 4: Trae tha Truth]
I used to run up in your crib with shit that go blocka
Nigga tryna brick my squad like I’m Waka
I don’t wanna see no chain I can’t rock-a
Heard 'em tell me life is a bitch, can’t stop her
Even if I could, I tell 'em I wouldn’t knock her
'Til I get that Section 8 and then swap her
Baby momma tax return, new dropper
I might wanna go silk that bitch like I’m Shocker
All of my whips wetter than a water house
Food stamps getting flipped, what that water cost?
Yeah I’m actin like a nigga that ain’t never had shit
Filet mignon, porterhouse
My little brother on his medical shit from that block street
Nigga healthcare insured by that guap
Doorways ain't hiding me, no stop
Jackers playin’ open season with they yop
Shit I probably be the same, I find drama
Law's out lookin’ for me like Osama
I don’t wanna do no bid, Your Honor
Still waitin’ on my one phone call from Obama
Tell ‘em I need the chopper, they tellin’ me I'm a felon
I'm tellin' 'em they got it wrong, I beat the case in '9-7
And I'm well acquainted with hell but I’m tryna make it to heaven
But they don’t want me to make it, that’s why the niggas be tellin'
If I don’t get the chopper, I’ma probably run up inside
They better gimme a answer, I’m tryna be cool
If I don’t get it then everybody gon’ fear it
Every week I’m finna make ‘em repeat it like they in school
Bad news, everybody open up somethin’
You can move all you want just not sudden
It ain’t no thinkin' I was playin', I am not frontin'
The mentality of a goon, I am not stuntin'

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, uhh, f-f-filet mignon with my food stamps (mm)
Car cosigned by my momma (Momma)
Medical card from Obama ('bama)
Background check for a chopper (chopper)
Filet mignon with my food stamps (mm)
Car cosigned by my momma (Momma)
Medical card from Obama ('bama)
Background check for a chopper (rrah)

[Verse 5: Fam-Lay]
Storm is gone now it’s all clear
The road was long but we all here
Now go and tell, I don’t care
2014 is our year
Big shout out to the whole streets
This goes out to all that knows me
All y’all pussy niggas, hold these
Y’all play tough guys but call the police
Look I don’t care, I don’t share
I keep me a bad bitch with long hair
I send them choppers around there
When I’m somewhere sittin’ in a lounge chair
Overseas, blowin’ tree
Blowin’ green, throwin’ B's
Livin’ like life is supposed to be
And if you wanna see it all, nigga roll with me
To the top, couldn’t stop
Had a major deal but it wouldn’t pop
Niggas hated on me but I wouldn’t stop
And now life sweeter than a puddin’ pop
Think you so slick? Come and get me dawg
None of y’all niggas fuckin' with me dawg
Some of y’all niggas comin' with me dawg
None of y’all niggas' boots fit me dawg
You thinkin' back-a-wards y'all
You need to think tactical dawg
We laughin’ at y’all
While you thinking me and Lu radical, naw
You seein' this shit that keep goin' on
Then pick a different zone for your mobile homes
Storing fingerprints on your mobile phone
When you sippin' that shit they keep pourin' on

[Verse 6: Glasses Malone]
I’m bout that, I’m bout that, that Bentley out in that driveway
Cost more than my house did, fuck land, I’m fly today
First class if I fly, credit card ain’t mine
Don’t know how I’m gettin’ back but in luxury I arrive (turn up)
IPhone in my baby name, long way from that chirp
Stripper pole in my bedroom, but I’ma kill my daughter if she twerk
I’ma kill my daughter if she twerk, Miley Cyrus on that bullshit
But a real nigga can’t judge, that for Billy Ray to have to deal with
Record deal, fuck college, missed out but no Pyrex
My Harley got low mileage (and this white carpet in my project)
Thirty guns in my section, none of the homies got aim
My side bitch said she pregnant, but I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game, I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
And this one is mine, I don’t trust his momma so he don’t got my name
Cheap rims on  my ride, mirrors loose as my beat pound
I ain’t addicted to shit, but weed man on my speed dial

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, uhh, f-f-filet mignon with my food stamps (mm)
Car cosigned by my momma (Momma)
Medical card from Obama ('bama)
Background check for a chopper (chopper)
Filet mignon with my food stamps (mm)
Car cosigned by my momma (Momma)
Medical card from Obama ('bama)
Background check for a chopper (rrah)

[Verse 7: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh-huh, my nigga, what we doing?
Ayy, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
AR-15 with collapsible stock
Picatinny rail with a three-point harness
With 150 round magazine and a dot
Ayy, FMJ’s by the box, nigga
Got the same setup as the SWATs, nigga
Shouldn’t find that surprising
Cause I bought the motherfucker from a cop
Ayy, seen a lot of brown money as a shorty
Welfare baby can’t afford me
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried
Ayy, excuse me as I repeat myself
Work twice as hard to complete myself
My opposition is not pretending
When I work twice as hard to defeat myself
Fuck being a hip-hop purist
When I'm  spendin’ 50 thousand on Securus
Embrace the contradiction, you’ll feel us
RIP to the homies but long live the killas
It’s why I look at God kinda odd
Cause these are the cards that he deal us
Ramen can’t fill us, Medicaid can’t heal us
And the mommas can’t stop us and these choppers might kill us
Look these wild niggas in they eyes
In the video it's some niggas that done died
Looked the ghosts in the face and I cried
No Wu-Tang, just Lu gang when I ride
With an L up
Sayin' "Free the guys" like I'm Durk (them hittas!)
With a clean record but I’m cursed
To make a half a million off a verse
Nigga, chop

[Outro]
Kick, push, kick, push it, push it, kick, chyeah
Get it, chyeah, push, kick, push it, push it, kick, chyeah
Get it, chyeah, push, kick, push it, push it, kick, chyeah
Get it, chyeah, push, kick, push it, push it, kick, chyeah

[Intro]
Five days
Underwater
Near your island
Off the coast, I know

Five ways
You were my lover
Incantation
Of the tide in rhyme

[Verse]
Oh
All in the glow of fire, you're waiting
Oh
Has it been so long now? Ah-ah ah

Oh
I thought you knew that I'd be coming
The way you move, a foreign groove
At night, I could never
I could never hold you...

[Chorus]
Watch it rise up where you hide
Your pearls
Feel it pile up where you cast
Those stones you wear

When no one's home
Do they feel cold on your bones
All the years I miss your warmth
Have you missed my warmth?

On your island, oh...

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh...

[Verse 1]
I've lost the use of my heart
But I'm still alive
Still looking for the light
And the endless pool on the other side

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the wild wild west
I'm doing my best
I'm at the borderline of my faith
I'm at the hinterland of my devotion
I'm in the front line of this battle of mine
But I'm still alive

[Chorus]
I'm a soldier of love
Every day and night
I'm a soldier of love
All the days of my life

[Verse 2]
I've been torn up inside
I've been left behind
Tall I ride
I have the will to survive
In the wild, wild west
Trying my hardest
Doing my best to stay alive

[Pre-Chorus]
I am love's soldier
I wait for the sound
I know that love will come
I know that love will come
Turn it all around

[Chorus]
I'm a soldier of love
Every day and night
I'm a soldier of love
All the days of my life

[Bridge]
I am lost but I don't doubt
Tall I ride
I have the will to survive
In the wild, wild west
Trying my hardest
Doing my best to stay alive

[Pre-Chorus]
I am love's soldier
I wait for the sound
I know that love will come
I know that love will come
Turn it all around

[Outro]
I'm a soldier of love
I'm a soldier
Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
I'm a soldier of love
I'm a soldier

Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
Still wait for love to come

[Verse 1]
Holy Moses, I have been removed
I have seen the spectre, he has been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses, I have been removed

[Verse 2]
Holy Moses, I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction, and I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness
But it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses, I have been deceived

[Bridge]
I'm going back to the border where my affairs
My affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
Been poisoned from my head down to my shoes, oh
Holy Moses, I have been deceived

[Verse 3]
Holy Moses, let us live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man over there, what's his color? I don't care
He's my brother, let us live in peace, oh
He's my brother, let us live in peace, oh
He's my brother, let us, let us live in peace

[Intro]
Hey DJ

[Verse]
Lady in a glass dress
I can see right through you
You act like you don't want this
But you know that you do
Since he broke your heart, girl
You say you'll never love again
And you won't let it stop, girl
But we know in the end
You still dream, dream
You still dream, dream
Baby, I can make your dreams come true
Oh, oh, my lady in the glass dress
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
You say keep her close
It’s too good to be with you
But I'm a dreamer
It’s too good to be real
Feels too good to be real
Roll my weed up, I got a light

[Chorus]
There's some magic here (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Nobody's here with me, but me and you
It's perfect, smoke this
One more, baby, take it
Take it, smoke this

You say, once in a lifetime (Woah)
Well I say, girl, you're wrong
Something special (Oh-oh-oh)
Your face (Oh-oh)
I see something gorgeous
But I love getting faded

[Chorus]
There's some magic here (Yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Nobody's here, but me and you (Nobody, but you and me)
It's perfect, baby, would you smoke this?
Just one more, baby, take it
Take it, take this (Take this, smoke this)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There's some magic here (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You don't have to worry, 'cause nobody's here, but me and you
It's perfect, smoke this
One more, baby, take it
Take it, smoke this

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, I'm, oh
Oh-oh (It's perfect)
So, smoke this
One more, baby, take it
Smoke this

Mistletoe to the middle of the floor,little mama getting kissed by Santa Claus
Hand all in your cookiejar, dipping it like a foreign car
You won't search far for that shooting star imma nibble to the middle like a candy bar
Girl you looking fine. From behind bump n grind
Turn that ass round, crack that spine we call that Duncan hine

My bed could be your stage, and I’mma make you a star

You throwin’ ass, I’m catchin’ it, the neighbours keeping score
Louis Armstrong, I pick you up, eat that against the door

[Hook repeat 4th time:]

R. Kelly ft: Pullout – Cookie Monster Lyrics

[Verse 1]
She dripping in gold she dripped in gold she water whipping
Dipped in gold, she clean the kitchen, damn she a good mathematician
Just to put her clothes on, probably her 20 minutes
Just to put that gold on, probably take like 40 minutes
Gold car, gold Bentley, and she got a gold beautician
You know Guwop feed his baby, treat her like a pediatrician
Drop top Benz it beat the street, my gold teeth match her diamond necklace
Drumma Boy I killed the beat and it didn't take me 30 seconds
Gold teeth match her diamond necklace, you know Bricksquad hella flexin
1017 be super keyed, drug test, man, we never passin
Gucci Mane wear yellow gold and rose gold he hella clashin'
Told my mama "I can't go to school, that's not my fucking passion"

[Hook]
She D.I.G she dipped in gold, you dig that ?
Yeah you know she dipped in gold
She D.I.G. she dipped in gold, you dig that ?
Man I swear her body cold
She D.I.G. she dipped in gold, you dig that ?
Man I got her dripping in gold
She D.I.G. She D.I.G. you dig that ?
She dripping gold, she dripping gold, she dipped in gold

[Verse 2]
My raps they just be so offensive
Please just stay out Gucci's business
Drumma Boy you too explicit
Big Guwop I'm so prolific
I just got like 30 gold
Bitch, I just came from the dentist
Hella trippin, hella whippin, drop my top, my rims they spinnin
??????? no you ain't
Say ya love me, no you don't
Hit the blunt I wish I would
Bitch you can't even hit the trunk
Drop top Rari riding through Bleveland paint our cars red every month
Can you handle what you will see? cause this right here ain't what you want
No, ain't what you want
No you're not and no you can't
Park my jeep jump in my dump it's big dog Gucci but I won't run
Dip my blunt in gold, man, now I got a golden blunt
Sippin on some golden lean this activist it keeps me slumped (Wasted!)

[Hook]
She D.I.G she dipped in gold, you dig that ?
Yeah you know she dipped in gold
She D.I.G. she dipped in gold, you dig that ?
Man I swear her body cold
She D.I.G. she dipped in gold, you dig that ?
Man I got her dripping in gold

She dripping gold, she dripping gold, she dipped in gold

[Verse 3]
She work out man, she doing crunch

I'm goin let her hit the blunt
She refused to give a son (what?)
All these thiyow on my dick, man I got to give em one
I just came from show Ohio they gave me like half a hundred
I feel like the old pimp C man I think I should team Bun
I should sign with BMG cause I just moved a metric ton
I should sign with BSM cause man I used to hang with Dunk
NPA 1017 bet 10,000 dollars playing ???

She D.I.G. She D.I.G. you dig that ?
She dripping gold, she dripping gold, she dipped in gold
Hi I'm Voletta Wallace, Biggie's mom
I wish to thank you for your kind words
You warm gestures and your constant support over the years
I also need to share with you a few words about my son
Please take a few moments and listen
I hope you gain something from it, thanks

As a child Christopher was outspoken
When it suited him at times he was quiet
And of course he was mischievous as all little boys are
As a young man he liked to do everything

He liked to read, he liked to be with his friends
As young kids or young boys he enjoyed life
Everything that would make him happy or comfortable
He would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family

His early inspirations toward rap music were
The LL's of the world, the Sugar Hills, the Mr. Magics
And the Fat Boys of the rap channel
Those were all the things I heard in the house
Even though I called it noise and banging
I know now, it is a accepted musical art form
I was a single parent, I raised my son on my own
His father had no influence on his decision
Towards the musical outlet or career he chose

My son had a mind of his own, even if his father was around
He would have turned to rap he loved music, he loved rap
At a point in my son's life he developed paranoia
About death and about the dying

We are living in a world of imperfect human beings
Where greed, jealousy and envy
Are manifested by what others have accomplished in life
My son was very very much aware of that

He appreciated his station in life on the directions
In which he was going or traveling
On the other hand there were others
Who I should use the hip hop phrase player hating

And I think that is what resulted in his paranoia
If I had to change anything in my son's life
That would have allowed him to be here today
I would have deterred him from a career in music
I'm aware that millions appreciate his music, millions loved his music
Be that it may if he hadn't chosen that lifestyle, that career
My son would be alive today
If I could sum up Christopher in one word the word would be generous

The thing that my son loved most about life was the fact that
He was in a position to help, position to share
Position to give to others who needed, to others who wanted
To others appreciated the gifts that he gave

[Verse 1]
Craving your body all through the night
Feels like I'm going through withdrawals
I wanna hold you
I want you inside of these arms
I'm dying to taste you, I can't deny
Can't get out of my mind
Please let me hold you
'Cause I need your loving tonight

[Chorus]
Whenever I'm near you
My love just comes down
Whenever I see you
I just want you around
'Cause I wanna feel you
All through the day and the night
Whenever I'm near you
It feels like bedtime

[Verse 2]
Constantly thinking of things to do
Places where we can make love
I wanna freak you
I'll freak you wherever you want
Placing my kisses all over you
Caressing you so nice and slow
Oh, how I want you
Girl, there's something I want you to know

[Chorus]
Whenever I'm near you
My love just comes down
Whenever I see you
I just want you around
'Cause I wanna feel you
All through the day and the night
Whenever I'm near you
It feels like bedtime

[Bridge]
(Do you get lonely?)
I get lonely
(Thinking about me)
Thinking about you
(Am I the only)
Girl I dream of or think of at all?
(Are you into me, out of your mind for me?
Say you can't go a day without me)
Girl, I love you and I want you
And I need you, I need you, I need you

[Chorus]
Whenever I'm near you
My love just comes down
Whenever I see you
I just want you around
'Cause I wanna feel you
All through the day and the night
Whenever I'm near you
It feels like bedtime
Whenever I'm near you
My love just comes down
Whenever I see you
I just want you around
'Cause I wanna feel you
All through the day and the night
Whenever I'm near you
It feels like bedtime

[Outro]
It feels like bedtime

[Outro: Kurupt]
What up, Dr. Dre?

[Verse 1]
Distant stars
Come in black or red
I've seen their worlds
Inside my head
They connect
With the fall of man
They breathe you in
Then dive as deep as they can

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to him
He is in outer heart
And the space has been broken

[Chorus]
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken

[Verse 2]
Is it far away
In the Glitter Freeze
Or in our eyes
Every time they meet
It's by the light
Of the plasma screens
We keep switched on
All through the night while we sleep

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to her
I am without a heart
And the space has been broken

[Chorus]
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken

It's kind of like you holdin' me, strokin' me
Takin' control of me, never let go of me cause you my girl
It's kind of like I'm floatin' and takin' a turn
On the roller coaster of love, when I see you shine like pearl
I know you got a man and all, but he ain't treatin' you right
Nine times out of ten, you won't see him tonight
Baby girl, I'm tellin' you, I'm smellin' you on a situation
So don't even keep me waitin' and contemplatin', come on

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Lovin' the square, I'm just rollin'

Caserm told me to look to the left (yeah)
Jay Lyriq said her and not her
Dog it ain't gettin' no worse
Got better (uh), a brandetta
When I caught my breath I said

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Como estas? Ven aqui, mami girl
Como estas? Ven aqui, to my casa
Como estas? Ven aqui, mami girl
Como estas? Ven aqui to my casa, casa

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Wednesday night at the moon
Tryna find somethin' to get into
You wouldn't believe what the hell I seen
Drive by a Puerto Rican mama
Had a big thang right behind her
Before she spoke, she didn't think
That I would say

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Como estas? Ven aqui, mami girl
Como estas? Ven aqui, to my casa
Como estas? Ven aqui, mami girl
Como estas? Ven aqui, to my casa, casa

[Verse 4: Taino]
I love the way you carry yourself, I'm felling you (uf)
Mami yo te quiero conquistar
Tu eres la que me agita mi chica bontina y me excitas, como tu te moves al bailar
No sientelo, lo que te voy a dar es claro

Dimelo quien soy yo? Taino!
And I know your man will never do it like me amor

[Verse 5: T-Pain]
Girl, I can tell you one thang

Hey
Somebody
(I love you, I love you, I-I-I love you)
Get your ass up

[Verse]
Ladies and gentlemen
You are now in tune to an unknown buffoon
With enough room in his tomb to blow your mind like “Boom!”
(Oh I like this one)
Then you assume, that I've done something wrong in my life
(uh, huh, you know it mayne)
But at the same time I’m gonna try to describe the vibe of the world through my eyes (C'mon, whoo!)
And maybe you won’t - despise me
Or try to deprive me of the respect that I need

Oh, I see
You don’t know that a nigga motor just blow
And I’m walking by myself - talking to myself
Up and down the streets when both my feets is in old shoes
And all these old dudes talking ‘bout - “oh, it ain't that bad, I walked through the snow in school” (Hahaha)
Bitch we live in Tallahassee, a place were it never snows
But it rains on Pain ‘cause Faheem can’t take it (wow)
My head is a mail box and it’s full and I don’t want to check it (wow)
I wanna buy a whole damn car just to wreck it (wow)
‘Cause this fuck nigga told my wife I got two other girls pregnant (Damn Pain!)
Now you think I’m gon’ change ‘cause my wife cries all night
And I’m not quite the husband type?
You damn right (okay)
‘Cause I’ve been living my whole damn life without my damn mic
And my damn light bill due and one day I
Might see you and if I
Fight with you I can take your
Life in two ways (oh shit)
The hard way - and the bad way
‘Cause if I have a bad day then you might not make it to the Youngbloodz concert

Ladies and gentlemen I’m sorry if I’m losing you
But I’m just sick and tired of trying to get mine (go get it)
So, don’t come to me with your 23’s (c'mon)
With that fake ass smile (c'mon)
Smoking on your black-n-mile ‘cause all the while (c'mon)
I know what you’re saying in your head
This nigga go stronger than me (uh, huh)
Longer than me (uh, huh)
But he ain't  gon’ ever be shit 'cause everything belonging to me (damn)
See, I refuse to be abused and misused and accused of not paying my dues
I am not a crack addict, but if you want everything I got
You gon’ get it
‘Cause Imma let your ass have it

(Yeah that's what I'm talkin about)
(amazing, do that thing)
Yeah, okay now
What you do is
Marinate on that

(Yes Pain)
(Hell yeah)

[Outro]
Ooh
Ooh
(I love you, I love you, I-I-I love you)
Ooh
(I love you, I love you, I-I-I love you)
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I saw her through the window today
She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon Cafe
I started to keep going but something made me stop
She used to love me a lot

She looked lonely and I knew the cure
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought I'd walk on in and I'd give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot

I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said "where have you been? It's been a while"
She was glad to see me, I could almost read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot

[Hook 1]
She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe I said goodbye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot

[Verse 2]
I remember how good it was back then
And I said "it's not too late to start again
We could spend the night together, take up where we left off"
She used to love me a lot

But I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
"Yes I'm in need of something, but something you ain't got
But I used to love you a lot"

[Hook 2]
I thought she loved me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe she said goodbye
She just left me standing there, I've never been so shocked
She used to love me a lot

[Outro]
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot

[Intro]
This that feel good music right here..
Haha it feels good don't it?

[Hook]
Summer, Summer, Summer, Summertime, Remember those?
Summer, Summer, Summer, Summertime, The best times was the
Summer, Summer, Summer, Summertime, I love those
Summer, Summer, Summer, Summertime

[Verse 1]
Summertime, the right time, daytime, right length, right watch
Like the nice guy, fly guy wit a nice guy
Gucci top with the Nike highs
Or the LV with the V-Neck T
Fly, so fly on the beach
Beach chair loud
Damn, champagne from the liquor bank
On my way to the Chevron got a full tank
Now we ride and wherever he wanna go
She know I spend C notes on all my peoples
Well done, ain't nothing like the pool party fun
I got plenty drink, give the pool party some
Red rum the whole bottle of patron
But, no worries, baby I got more to poor
Catering from Roscoe's, Chicken and waffles
Together politicking blacks, whites, and Asians
I love

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Oh, the man rose with the millionaire stroke
From the 323, to the 310
I got my 23's on
Jordan's so important, with my fit already scorching
And then 15, before 7 to the Porsche's, we do the 23's
No rims, if you see them laid back, just hide til' the driver drive and some of em' get million dollar profits
Got it? Now put the Tyga CD in and stop poppin'
Meet the bad guy, they call me God in the blue Bugatti
Yeah I'm styling in the 6 series, with a bulk wallet
Stop it, hah, the sunset looking violent
Come vibe with em' get it poppin', no violence
No alarm sirens, just me and you cruisin'
To the music, this how a young boss do it

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I turn on the tube and what do I see?
A whole lot of people crying, "Don't blame me"
They point their crooked little fingers at everybody else
Spend all their time feeling sorry for themselves
Victim of this, victim of that
Your mamma's too thin and your daddy's too fat

[Chorus]
Get over it
Get over it
All this whining and crying and pitching a fit
Get over it, get over it

[Verse 2]
You say you haven't been the same since you had your little crash
But you might feel better if I gave you some cash
The more I think about it, Old Billy was right
Let's kill all the lawyers, kill 'em tonight
You don't want to work, you want to live like a king
But the big, bad world doesn't owe you a thing

[Chorus]
Get over it
Get over it
If you don’t wanna play then you might as well quit
Get over it, get over it

[Bridge]
It's like going to confession every time I hear you speak
You're making the most of your losing streak
Some call it sick, but I call it weak
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you drag it around like a ball and chain
You wallow in the guilt, you wallow in the pain
You wave it like a flag, you wear it like a crown
Got your mind in the gutter, bringing everybody down
You bitch about the present and blame it on the past
I'd like to find your inner child and kick its little ass

[Chorus]
Get over it
Get over it
All this bitching and moaning and pitching a fit
Get over it, get over it

[Chorus]
Get over it
Get over it
It's gotta stop sometime, so why don't you quit?
Get over it, get over it
Wow, we're here on this stage right now.

First and foremost, I want to thank our fans, the people that got us on this stage. Before there was any media, before there was any buzz about us, before there was a story, there was our fans and it spread organically through them so without them there would be no us. Shout out to everybody repping worldwide.

I want to thank my beautiful fiancee, my parents, my manager, and our team that puts together this music, that sacrifices everything for this art. Countless hours in the studio and onstage and everyone that made this album what it is. I love you guys.

And I want to say, we made this album without a record label, we made it independently, and we appreciate all the support.
You know what girl
I have been meaning to tell you something
I want you to listen when I tell you this
I don’t even know how to say it
But I am just gonna say it
Just like this
It is getting harder to fuck your friends
It is getting harder to fuck your friends
It is getting harder to fuck your friends
It is getting harder to fuck your friends
It is getting harder to fuck your friends
It is getting harder to fuck your friends
It is getting harder to fuck your friends
It is getting harder to fuck your friends
It is getting harder to fuck your friends
It is getting harder to fuck your friends

[Verse]
I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, that look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream

[Bridge]
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, mmm
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream

[Verse]
I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, that gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream
To Kendrick: You got robbed. I wanted you to win. You should have. It’s weird and sucks that I robbed you. I was gonna say that during the speech. Then the music started playing during my speech and I froze. Anyway, you know what it is. Congrats on this year and your music. Appreciate you as an artist and as a friend. Much love.

My text to Kendrick after the show. He deserved best rap album... I'm honored and completely blown away to win anything much less 4 Grammys. But in that category, he should have won IMO. And that's taking nothing away from The Heist. Just giving GKMC its proper respect.. With that being said, thank you to the fans. You're the reason we were on that stage tonight. And to play Same Love on that platform was a career highlight. The greatest honor of all. That's what this is about. Progress and art. Thank you. #grammys

[Verse 1]
Aurora borealis
The icy sky at night
Paddles cut the water
In a long and hurried flight
From the white man
To the fields of green
And the homeland
We've never seen

[Verse 2]
They killed us in our teepee
And they cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Crying on the ground
But the fire sticks
And the wagons come
And the night falls
On the setting sun

[Verse 3]
They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little box
At the top of the stairs
With my Indian rug
And a pipe to share

[Verse 4]
I wish a was a trapper
I would give thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And find out how she felt
In the morning
On the fields of green
In the homeland
We've never seen

[Verse 5]
And maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
We'll sit and talk of Hollywood
And the good things there for hire
And the Astrodome
And the first teepee
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
Pocahontas
Kendrick:

Got me breathing with dragons
I crack the egg on you bastard
Why you step to the master
Like you sick with this
I really do this shit
You not equivalent to the Kdot the almighty
Watch this, I will body
Anybody in the crowd
You want me john gotti, couldn't see me
You peeping this is freestyle off top of the dome
I'll let you know why every other rapper need to go home
This a new verse, I put rappers in new hearse
I take rappers to new church
Who wanna see me, you first
Then him second, then you third
Nouns, my verbs
Battle these words
Nigga that shit is absurd
Troi Breeze:

OK if I'm 2nd or I'm 3rd
Whatever he just said you heard
But I'm coming through and I think that I got a new verse
Goin' off the top of the dome
I'm really tryna change the way that I've been livin' at home
I'm really doin' it
Nigga I be doin' this
Nigga I come through with this
Nigga I will do it and I swear I am so studious
Nigga I'm a student and I peeped the way you did it
Now I'm bout to do it off of the top of the fuckin' tip

Kendrick:

If you bout to do off of the top, then fucking did it
If you say that you the best, then nigga won't you admit it
I see you got the waves in your hair i been there
Back in 8th grade, when the pussy i was scared
But now im seeing all kinds of woman in peripheral
This is individual, this here is a ritual
This here is spiritual
This is not rap , this is god body
Nigga this ain't nothing close to lyrical
Troi Breeze:

Shit all I'm sayin now is I agree with you
I been grownin' in it like I was a tree with you
Now I'm tryna do it like I was a seed and I grew up
And now I'm blessed like I just sneezed; hachew
I really appreciate it
I really appreciate you callin me up cause I'm out here and I'm ballin' it up
Taking the biggest shots, and now I been getting' it tryna spend the biggest knots
Cause I'm really out here tryna grind for my family
Tryna go off of that energy, I know you feel my "inner G"
My brotha was from Piru
My pops was from what's he was raised out on Grape Street

Kendrick:

Well if ya brother was from Piru and your partna was from Watts
Then you should already know about them Compton blocks
All my niggas that's with me is from the city
All my niggas hold choppas and they be with me
And this is TDE this is stri-stri- strictly for my niggas and bitches tell me you with me
(crowd roar)
You see that scream right there, thats that scream that every other rapper scared
Thats that scream that every other clapper scared
They dont want shoot back
If they did they would get bitch slapped like my nigga Snoop Dogg back in '94
This is Kurupt flow
This is the LBC shit
This the Compton DPGTDE shit
FUCK WITH ME SHIT
Make some noise for my nigga

Troi Breeze:

My name is Troi Breeze

Kendrick:

Make some noise for Troi Breeze
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Yeah, ain’t nuttin' to it but to do it, nigga that's true
A quarter milli and a Buick, nigga guess who?
It came to me like the dream that I once had
Them niggas said I couldn't do it, then I busted through
And now I'm flying worldwide, singing rap songs
Fucking all the bad hoes that I once knew
And busted nuts for all the times I was shitted on
See it was once fuck me, now it's fuck you
Clearly, now hear me
Back with a vengeance, hope you niggas feel me
You cut me deep and know it hurts severely
I'm a forgiver, I still love you dearly, sincerely
It's Truly Yours, bout to stack another quarter milli
Nigga got a quarter milli, don't be silly

[Intro]
Na, na, na, na, my nose runnin'
Got my shades over this
The whole skyline of the city's right in front of my face, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm in the zone this year, it's all fire nigga check my attire
Your worst fear is confirmed, your reign at the top expires this year
No application, I'm hired this year
This a dedication to that bitch who slashed my nigga tires, oh yeah
I knew about you, bitch I knew about you
Came up on a good nigga, he ain't have a clue about you
Tried to tell that nigga, don't trust that bitch as far as you can smell her, nigga
But you live and you learn
On these road to riches niggas bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you cross turn into bridges you burn
You're bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you.. fuck it you don't hear me
Look, ayo, I walk along this long harbor of life and sit on the piers
Reflect on my pain and shit on my fears
Should I feel an ounce of guilt that I outdid all my peers?
Or write my name in the sky and show them niggas I'm here?
This one is for the history books, picture me shook or failin'
This is revenge of the dreamer
Misery took a million of my niggas' hopes from 'em, don't even know some 'em
No more, the coke numbed 'em, no suicide notes from 'em
They killin' theyselves, slowly killin' they cells
Five iPhones dropped, my nigga still in the cell
He said he found God, shit, I doubt it, to each his own
Whatever keeps you strong to get up out it, we need you home
Cause see a war's goin' on outside, I 'bout cried
When that boy that the cops shot died, my mouth wide open from shock
Sick and tired of hopin' it'll stop
This pen the only hope that I got, I open up shop, and break out

[Chorus]
Got what you want, I got what you need
My heart on my sleeve, watch me bleed, I break out!
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga
Fuck what you think, cause if your shit don't stink
Nigga my shit won't sink, cause it can't, I break out!
I gotta break the fuck up outta here
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga

[Verse 2]
War stories, got tour stories
Pop-four-whores-on-the-top-floor stories
Niggas know, every verse is worth a brick of blow
Just a seven figure nigga got the game in figure four
I know at times I'm hypocritical, you niggas dig it though
I fuck until my dick be sore, leave bitches walkin' pigeon toe and break out!
On to the next bitch, homie
Your new chick—that's my ex-bitch, homie—in fact, I'm still logged in her Netflix, homie
Just make sure she cook you breakfast, homie
Her bacon slammin' but her eggs get runny—funny
So many bombs, you'd think Flex get money from me
Cole world but my neck get sunny
Now I don't fuck around with hoes from reality shows
Or blow-up dolls, 'cause I don't like havin' sex with dummies, love me
No disrespect meant, honey, this just a compilation of my observations
While trapped in this God-forsaken nation
Shit, but since we makin' conversation
I've been thinkin' me and you would make a bangin' combination
I know that you mad, I know what I said
But my dick be arguin' with my head, are you with the bed?
Well if so let's break out!

[Chorus]
Got what you want, I got what you need
My heart on my sleeve, watch me bleed, I break out!
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga
Fuck what you think, cause if your shit don't stink
Nigga my shit won't sink, cause it can't, I break out!
I gotta break the fuck up outta here
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga

[Intro]

[Verse]
Blowing smoke, showing growth, no one's close
Never mashing brakes on breakbeats or going broke ever
Never, Rozay rich forever
Learn how to take a punch can't be a bitch forever
Cause it's gonna come, if not from a fight
With that big ass bully nigga you never quite liked
And just from life, knocking you on your ass
Turning off all of your lights like Teddy Pendergrass
Or mama on her last dollar, tryna stretch it
Gotta pay electric, gotta pay the water
Why she wanna a daughter when it's hard enough tryna raise two boys
Back in the days, I would've hated on the New Boyz
Just saying, cause the radio was just playing
And I heard one of their songs and my nigga sang along
And I'm thinking to myself, damn they came and went
A couple singles but could never be the main event
Without substance, something for them to grab on
Wonder if niggas know they time is short and they won't last long
I ain't even certain, one day they love you
Next day they put the niggas you put on above you
I let you niggas talk, it ain't no need to interrupt you
Cause my album 'bout to be the biggest fuck you
And don't worry, we'll let you back on the train
Riding Jermaine, once you see these niggas not in my lane
I pray to god end they reign
I fucked a bitch I used to dream about
And could've died when I came from disbelief
Now I don't wish to speak on a name, that shit is weak
We the new lost boys, shouts to Mr. Cheeks
Shouts to Queens, getting money regiment with my getting money regime
I'm a money machine, developing the routine, nah mean?

[Outro]
Nah mean, nah mean?
That was like a Jay Z joint
Nah mean, Nah mean, nah mean, nah mean?
You know how he used to say it
Nah mean?
B-r-r-ing, warm up

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
I got somethin' for you lookin'-ass niggas
Week and a half, I'ma be in that ass... pause
It's like I'm working on an album and a mixtape at the same motherfucking time!

[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my partner 'fore I fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each other

[Hook: Young Thug]
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
For that dope he whipped, you need a new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Who the fuck told you
That Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat?
I got six cars and I also got rentals and all of 'em tinted
No, I'm not Nipsey, not from L.A., but I got keys to the city
I fuck it, I suck it, I beat it down, then she beat me to the ceilin'
Stoner my lifestyle, I'm livin' too wild
I came to make you proud, that money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
Can't wait for my time to come back around
She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style
Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild
I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it
Young rich nigga hittin' million dollar licks
Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick
You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go I got a pass like the staff
I'm goin' off top like a motherfuckin' layup
357, six shots like Al
I left ten bands in a motherfuckin' cab

[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my partner 'fore I fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each other

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Every time I come out, I ain’t ever with no new bitches
These bitches is stealing, I'ma sue bitches
Dripping down his dick, this pussy too vicious (vicious)
Every time I fuck him, I say "Whose is it?"
Yo! Who the fuck told 'em that, "They was like Nicki? Oh no, bitches didn't!"
I'ma give bitches a minute of shine, then I'll tell 'em good riddance (good riddance)
To raise a child, it might take a village
But I wouldn't know, cause these bitches my sons
Yes, they was, and they still is
Gave him the kitten, now that nigga smitten
Told him to hop in my foreign, and then I said, "No, I'm just kiddin'!"
Hell of a livin', you bitches on chitlins
When I come out of my mansion, I sprinkle some bread to the pigeons
B-b-b-b-but, bitches is lyin', they lyin', they lyin', they lie in they bio
So I ain't fuckin' with chickens unless I got pico de gallo
Girls is plottin', what more could they steal?
Tell Justin Timberlake, that I am comin' for Jessica Biel
Bitch, I'm a star-rah, you niggas, I holla tomorrow
Doors go up, 'cause I am too rich to cop a Gallardo
No regular doors, on Aventadors
Painted it pink, just so I could take pictures, while you rented yours
H-H-H-Hell of a ticket, h-h-h-h-hell of a price
I want it, I get it, I wire the money, I never think twice
I am not gay, but let's be precise
'Cause if she pretty then watch it, 'cause I'ma be fuckin' ya wife

[Hook: Young Thug]
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
For that dope he whipped, you need a new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I knew I was gonna run my money up and everybody didn't
All these niggas pussy niggas, tellin' on they partner
Hope the pussy nigga get a bigger sentence
Pussy nigga play, I'm coming back with the K
And I'ma shoot that motherfucker 'til he livid
Bitches wanna see a nigga thumb through it fast
I'ma name myself Young Thugga tenant
100 bands at a time, I fronted you bands, but you
I don't like using profanity but the Young Thugger will cut you
All of my cups are muddy, I fuck my bitches' buddies
I just want nut like Buddy, all of my bitches buddies
Panamera with the tinted roof, all the niggas' dogs goin', "Roof"
Top notch shawty, nigga ring came with karats
Young nigga rich, jewelry colder than the attic
If she ain't a virgin then that bitch is only average
I can't even hear ya, baby, get rid of the static
I can't learn a bitch, but I learned mathematics
I just ball her down whenever she call my pattern

[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my partner 'fore I fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each other

[Hook: Young Thug]
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
For that dope he whipped, you need a new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

[Verse 1]
I want to see you smile again
Like diamonds in the dust
The amazing sound of the killing hordes
The day the banks collapsed on us

[Verse 2]
Cease this endless chattering
Like everything is fine
When sorry is not good enough
Sit in the back while no one drives

[Outro]
So glad, so glad you're mine
So glad, so glad you're mine
So glad, so glad you're mine
So glad, so glad you're mine

[Verse 1]
You don't want to talk to me
You don't want to say the words
Trying to get off the hook
Trying to get off the hook
Sprawling on a pin
Hanging off a hook
Trying to get yourself away
Trying to get yourself away

[Verse 2]
There's no use dwelling on
On what might have been
Just think of all the fun
You could be having
We know the way you talk
We know what you want
We know what you want
What you really want

[Verse 3]
Take a look around
The candles on the cake
On what might have been
The road you should have took
Mistakes, mistaken
There's no use dwelling on
No use dwelling on

[Chorus 1]
It's such a beautiful day
It's such a beautiful day
Find yourself a moment
And go and get some wings

[Chorus 2]
It's such a beautiful day
It's such a beautiful day
Go up to the mic, go up to the mic
Go and get some wings

[Produced by Omen]

[Intro: J. Cole]
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless

This is dedicated (yo turn my vocals up)
You know who this is dedicated to

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?

[Verse 1: Bas]
Damn, you niggas so bitchless
Swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers
Like Bas, why you gotta say bitch when you swear?
Bitch, I don't care
Damn, you niggas so bitchless
I swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers
Got a bitch like a diamond
Bitch got no flaws
See the switch when she walk
Give the bitch an applause
My bitch, call her my bitch if I want
Fly to another continent if I want
Ride through the projects if I want
Type of chick keep me home, but I won't
Gotta roam out of town, paying dues getting high
Til' I put a fiend flag on the moon, cutie pie
Say she want a shirt and a hat too, that's cool
She be waking up in both mine soon that's true, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?

[Verse 2: Omen]
Yeah, TDK, TDK
Chi City nigga, and I'm known to treat hoes like Stevie J
Gone off the Henny I'm beyond faded
Damn y'all lookin' so dehydrated
Why y'all lookin' so dehydrated?
Y'all so thirsty and I'm her favorite
I don't talk much, but I say a lot
They wanna stroll to the back, red cup game come and take a shot
When we sweating in the dark don't run
Throw it back like a inside the park, home run
She a square but that ass rotund
She let me cut samurai shogun
Know you heard bout the backstroke
I can make your perm turn to an afro
I got dumb hoes, bad bitches
Nice girls, classy women
I'm too official
Dreamville, nigga too official
Calling me a dog, I'm calling her a bird
Talking to the pussy cat I'm Dr. Dolittle

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
They say grief is the price of love, fuck love!
I'm out in D.C. what's the price of love, I'm tryna
Get into something like a virus
Get lucky like I'm Irish
Born broke I'mma die rich
Steve Jobs of the projects
Pete Rock with a South twist
When the beat drop nigga drop heat
Like a teapot
Nigga eavesdrop on the knowledge
Once again it's on
A nigga cash never been this long
A nigga passion ain't been this strong
I'm in the zone
Known to slang dick like it's ten inch long
Open wide get my bid'ness on
Young Dennis get my menace on
No O-Dog more like more Caine
Get dough, fuck hoes that's a full life thing
'06 I was po' like rain
Flow sick and I don't like lames
Stop playing, bitch

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?

[Verse 1]
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Chorus]
A crooked smile
A crooked smile
This crooked smile

[Verse 2]
Listen
I got a story for ya, when I was seventeen
I had a name, was far from lame and that meant everything
I hit the club with my nigga Ced. ain't nuttin' new
But on this particular night that we was coming through
Niggas was on the stage, battlin' babblin'
Going nowhere, I figured, "Fuck it, there's a couple hoes here"
I might as well sign up and climbed up the stage
I went first, I kicked my verse, spit like a lion out the cage
The crowd feeling my rage, I aired the nigga
Tossed the mic right to 'em like I dared the nigga
Thought I scared the nigga, DJ started the beat
His heart started to beat fast, the part of defeat
The nigga verse was weak, that is until he said this
"You ain't So So Def, your teeth just got Jagged Edges"
Damn, that was the dagger that killed my swagger
I never hit that stage again, I begged my mom for braces, then I had a

[Chorus]
Crooked smile
A crooked smile
A crooked smile
A crooked smile

[Verse 3]
Growing up was just a young knucklehead running wild
Momma youngest, e'erybody knew I was the problem child
Front teeth missing in my smile, snaggletooth nigga for a while
Liftin' up my pillow, tooth fairy never came around
Damn, we was po', but I ain't know
Mouth open at the mirror daily, look and wonder how my teeth'll grow
They came slow and out of line, I couldn't comprehend
The significance at the time, this crooked smile
Was just another sign saying life ain't fair
Some niggas had the perfect smile with the nice wave hair
Oh yeah, remember Brandy? Loved her like candy
She went with my nigga, Sosa, I was scared to approach her
That nigga had the fresh new gear, J's drop
He got a fresh new pair, and there I was with hand-me-downs
Turn into the class clown, teachers couldn't stand me now
Defense mechanism, lookin' for attention

[Chorus]
With this crooked smile
This crooked smile
This crooked smile
This crooked smile

[Outro]
"Crooked Smile". You know what it is. This is for those that's—that's not picture perfect, but we still worth the picture, you know? As I sit here and sip this Corona. Ayy, shout out to Brandy, man. I—I still got love for ya. I'll never forget, we was in the fifth grade, maybe it was later than that, but remember we was at the 

[?] we had the orchestra thing and you told—you told a white girl, you told her to tell me that if I went and got some braces that you would go out with a nigga and shit. Ah, those were the days. I still got love for ya. You know shit like that made a nigga tough

[Verse 1]
I've been searching for someone
But never looked before my eyes
There you were to my surprise
It was so obvious looking into your face
After playing a game of truth or dare
I wanted to stay at your place

[Pre-Chorus]
I never thought that I would fall in love with you
But since the day we kissed I knew it had to be you
I never thought we would be together
I can't believe I just made love to you
After all the things that we've been through
Now what are we gonna do? Ohh

[Chorus]
Monday, a friend of mine, Tuesday, we played a game
Wednesday, you went away, Thursday, things weren't the same
On Friday, you came back I wanted to kiss you on Saturday
On Sunday we made love, now what are we gonna do?

[Verse 2]
As much as I, I want you, I don't wanna wreck a friend
I've already found in you
I've been there before and I can't ignore
How two friends became one but walked away with none

[Pre-Chorus]
I cannot risk a friend but the love is so good
I gotta make a choice I would if I could
I never thought we would be together, how can I address you?
"Hey lover?", "Hi friend!" "How ya doin'?", "Where ya been?"
I gotta make a choice

[Chorus]
Monday, a friend of mine, Tuesday, we played a game
Wednesday, you went away, Thursday, things weren't the same
On Friday, you came back I wanted to kiss you on Saturday
On Sunday we made love, now what are we gonna do?
Monday, a friend of mine, Tuesday, we played a game
Wednesday, you went away, Thursday, things weren't the same
On Friday, you came back I wanted to kiss you on Saturday
On Sunday we made love, now what are we gonna do?
(What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?)

[George Benson guitar solo]

[Outro]
Monday
Things weren't the same
On Monday we made sweet sweet love, Tuesday, we played a game
On Sunday we made love, now what are we gonna do?

Monday, a friend of mine, Tuesday, we played a game
Wednesday, you went away
Tyga

Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever
Until they realize they
Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever

Once upon a time, rhyming, working at part time
Designers pricing it too high, im just trying to be fly
Categorized, closet full of Louis, cuz da hundreds fluent
Who knew we doin there's more to this youtube money, chewing
Review my struggle to it, rockiest roads
And ice cream cuz environments around me endangering
Never knew it too busy sharp shooting
Little fishes don't get caught by this harpoon bitch
Its just music meet my instruments
OG say get your loose leafs, think in the margin kid
Never be too big for the littlest ship
Ripken, for clowns who don't think the Cal hit shit
Or how gangsta it gets when you don't portray the images
Remembering Pac's last picture
In the back of my mind stuck since September, nah Im six you niggas
If you there, enter knock before i switch ya agenda
Body temperature zero, spirit missing, I should have listened
Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever
Until they realize they
Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever

Somebody body by that neighborhood party
Now he hot and street mama want answers but we remain in silent
No we glade it, cremate it, funeral, play the violins
What a sad time it is, society ran by communists
Obama that could improve how sick i am
Conglomerant diamonds shinin, show i got the upper hand
Fuck the middle man, current discussions with the president
And the PM with the baddest bitch AM I am Uncle Sam
Kids, Nephew, Im more on some father shit
Good nigga but don't follow him like simon says
You ain't it, but Im playing tag again, destined to be big
Greatest ever player, Im in this game to fucking win
School skipped gym, i rather get gems, dead faces on my marble table
Coppin' shit you are not able, i static it like bad cable
Get mashed, choir threwin, potato that choir sing, he won't make it

Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever
Until they realize they
Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever
Finally found the comedy, niggas title me
Got rid of the small quantity, now Im killing
Its such an irony when you weigh the same height as me but afraid to say hi to me
Goodbye to the beats, beauty lies in passenger seats
Of each flat black SUV tinted for the celebrator driver GED chauffeurin
Im...sorry for reincarnating the lord
Hence scars cover my pores safari with Tyga aboard
Horse bitches back it up, all cuz they seen the bucks
Counting 1,2,3,4 like Ray Allen was
Balances looking like Hammer's funds, past not present
Dumb fucks getting drugged up, i probably bet ya fuckin' luck
You won't get higher than us, status of a Jordan jump
Ya swaggers off a mannequin, my shit randomly tough
Nigga what? I die a today, at least I live it up
You losers don't even know what you living for nigga c'mon

Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever
Until they realize they
Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever

[Lil Wayne]

Yes, this is the end of No Ceilings

Like I said it was all for you
Thank you I appreciate you, everything about you
And again, this was and is No Ceilings
Yeah, this is just a message, your beat ain't safe
Yeah, I just like to have fun
And so they ask why did I do this, why do you keep giving out free music?
Why do you do this, why, why? Because I'm Weezy
I'm different, I have plenty of it
So it's nothing for me to share
Priceless, that's why its free

My girl the baddest, too, G.O.O.D
I'ma just keep countin'

Okay

[Hook]
I always got a grip, I never slip, I never panic
Got my Rolex set Pacific, while I fly through the Atlantic
And just like a know-it-all, I always got the upper hand
And if I listen to you bitches I would still be on the campus
But instead I'm in The Standard, with a girl who got some standards
Gettin' head in the Jacuzzi and she claim she from Los Angeles
But she ain't come up for air one time, I swear she from Atlantis

[Verse 1]
It's so fuckin' hard to have manners since I bought a manor
I never take off, I just take off her panties
To partially nominated, yeah, yeah nigga you know me
Hop on a song and kill with niggas, who just won all the trophies
Bitch I ain't playin' no more like D. Rose or Kobe, it's Kobe the beef and it's shrimp ravioli
Sean Don, you know me, my cash homophobic, I swear it's so straight
Then I double it up like I cloned it!
My homie called me like "Sean Don, look
You know I got a girl, like you, so my nigga this one's off the books
But could you hook me up with Ariana Grande?"
Seems like niggas just call me for the hook-up or to get up off the hook
I'm back in this bitch like I'm parallel parkin' (swerve swerve)
Get hit with that 18, what's that? Bitch it's two 9's, that's parallel sparkin'
I look up to the stars and God damnit I swear I can hear them shits talkin'
To you they the stars but to me they a target
She said that I'm fine and I say that I'm gorgeous
I'm livin' so lawless, I promise
We just landed, Bora Bora
Champagne, I pour, I pour
Model girls, old Kimora
Fuck more or less, it's more or more
I'm stackin' paper, safe to safe, drawer to drawer, bank to bank, floor to floor
Touch a dollar and them killas be door to door to door to door to door to door
Face to face, Hennessy, case to case
Day to day, I paper chase, amazin' grace
I've been plottin' since '86, and I was born in '88
So what the fuck that make me?
A young visionary
My secretary finna be a millionare
Imma call her military
Finally Famous militarian, I rep that, that
'Til I hit the cemetery
And I'm way too skinny for jail, ho
So I gotta stay rich enough just for the bail, ho
I'm collectin' this change like I live in a well
Heaven on Earth, I could get it through Hell
Bitch, we did it and did it ourselves
So now I'm presidential, my life, presidential, my wife
Residential, the lake, presidential estates
Like my homie Tone said, I could talk about my watch all day
But that's a fuckin' presidential debate
Man shout out to SAYITAINTTONE and Jay John
Adubb Da Gawd, Earlly Mac, Danny Brown
Oba and Boldy, Doughboyz and Vezzo

We run the city!

[Interlude]
Man, free my dog Juan, man, straight up
Lot of shit been on my mind lately, feel me?

[Verse 2]
My homie talked to me like "Man why the hell you look the way you lookin'?
How you feel the way you feel
When you got every architect in town
Man, tryna sit and build
You got every girl that's in Detroit that's hot tryna come chill
Cause I just lost my nigga Doe B and a fuckin' Uncle Phil
Nigga, Ye layed the Blueprint
So I need hundred dollar bills, new print
Hangin' from my family tree, I'm a nuisance, millionaire
Fuck your two cents, you ain't do shit
I'm a player, baby, I be wearin' zoo print
Lightin' struck like Zeus sent
Sometimes, to see the bigger picture, man you gotta zoom in
Sean cold, bitch where you been?
Motherfucka, I've been great
This for the fans that say they love the album but they fuckin' love the mixtapes
For y'all, man I do whatever it takes
Don't worry

[Hook]
I always got a grip, I never slip, I never panic
Got my Rolex set Pacific, while I fly through the Atlantic
And just like a know-it-all, I always got the upper hand
And if I listen to you bitches I would still be on the campus
But instead I'm in The Standard, with a girl who got some standards
Gettin' head in the Jacuzzi and she claim she from Los Angeles
But she ain't come up for air one time, I swear she from Atlantis

[Outro]
Finally famous
You little fuckin' bitch
And all that I just did, all my old shit, that's practice

[Verse 1: Kylie Minogue]
I’m all by myself
I don’t need anybody else
I’m all by myself
No help

I’m all on my own
Quietly sleeping in my home
I’m all on my own
My own

[Refrain: Chris Martin]
Hello
Won’t you let me come in?
Lhuna
Can’t you hear how much I’m suffering?
Hello
Won’t you let me know?
Cause I’m all alone
All alone

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Kylie Minogue]
We are dreaming
About Lhuna
The smell of her
The touch and the taste of her
Dreaming
About Lhuna
Her and me
Simultaneously

[Bridge: Kylie Minogue]
I don’t know what the time is
I don’t know where you’ve flown
And I don’t know why you’re so far
From home

[Refrain: Chris Martin]
Hello
Won’t you let me come in?
Lhuna
Can’t you hear how much I’m suffering?
Hello
Won’t you let me know?
Cause I’m all alone
All alone

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Kylie Minogue]
We are dreaming
About Lhuna
The smell of her
The touch and the taste of her
Dreaming
About Lhuna
Her and me
Simultaneously

[Outro]
Her and me
Effortlessly
Oh, her and me
Effortlessly
On Macklemore winning best rap album

It’s well deserved; he did what he did, man. He went out there and hustled and grinded. Everything happens for a reason; the universe comes back around, that’s how it go.


On the Grammys snubbing him entirely

I definitely feel like they should always have more of the culture up in there, for sure, because we definitely stand out just like any other genre. We part of the world. We part of the movement. So I think any awards, including the Grammys, should always push for more hip-hop because it’s music as a whole, it’s not just splitting different regions. Everything moves as far as sound and vibrations, and that’s how it goes. And we are a part of that.

[Verse 1]
Till the false and the fair see the light who's to care
That you live or you laugh or the sun
Came to shine in a sweet drop of dew at your feet
Such as my heart lately has done
Such as my heart lately has done

[Verse 2]
I'll cross over Jordan someday
I'll sing on that beautiful shore
If God loves me like I love you
I'll go to heaven for sure
I'll go to heaven for sure

[Verse 3]
Oh the love that was not on the lips I forgot
Nor in hearts I remember as cold
Was down in the grace of your loving embrace
Never to die but to ever unfold
Never to die but to ever unfold

[Outro]

[x2]
I'll cross over Jordan someday

I came to party like tonight will never end
Let's party again
Let's party again
Yea, I came to party like tonight will never end
Let's party again

[Chorus: Jeremih]

Say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
It's your world and I'ma touch wherever you want me to touch it
Pop that, pop that and you'll be bustin' them nuts when you want to bust it
Don't rush it mama I'ma take my time and do it slow
From the car to the counter to the bed to the couch to the tub to the flo'
Oh! No! Could it be that a G really got you sprung?
I lost my count baby how many times did I make it cum?
Run, run, run from a nigga til you can't no more like Forrest Gump
Then it's more she gets, if it's more she wants
She's spoiled rotten like bad milk
Get her hot cause I make that ass melt
She whipped cause she love gettin' whipped in the whip
And I'ma black belt
I beat the pussy to pieces, never lettin' the cat off the leashes
And I'm goin' so deep they tellin' me all of they deepest and darkest secrets

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I need party girls in my party world
Titties plastic, ass fantastic
They just brush my hair and touch me everywhere
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked
Say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Throw some ones on that
Get you wet as a waterpark I'ma have some fun with that
Make you come back to back you gon' bust like a gun with that
Like pow pow, brrr, pow pow, brrr
My bitch be gettin' down nigga how 'bout yours?
So turnt up when we in the club we don't even need a molly
Doin' so much over in this corner thought we was fuckin' in the party
My lung's filled with Marley
My hands on your body
And I'm goin' so deep I'm just lettin' you know that this me I got your face all in the pillow
You can't speak

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I need party girls in my party world
Titties plastic, ass fantastic
They just brush my hair and touch me everywhere
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked

[Verse 1]
I can't blame you, and I can't save you
But I will try
For you and I, for you and I
I won't find out all the dirty little things that you've done
But I will try
I, I

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm coming for you giants and you liars and your chariots of fire
You charmers with your anecdotes have started to show your true colors

[Chorus]
And now I'm staring at the moon wondering why the bottom fell out
Been searching for answers and there's questions I've found
Open your eyes and share this burden somehow
Are you ready to drink or are you waiting to drown?

[Verse 2]
I would break you before I let you fall into the blind
For you and I, for you and I
I will breathe in all the truth I can stomach
If it keeps you alive
I, I

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We've changed the dreamers and the preachers and the wise men on the hill
To concrete stepping smilers terrified to lose their power and control
Yeah, we've been crying for a leader to speak like the old prophets
The blood of the forgotten wasn't spilled without a purpose, or was it?

[Chorus]
And now I'm staring at the moon wondering why the bottom fell out
Been searching for answers and there's questions I've found
Open your eyes and share this burden somehow
Are you ready to drink or are you waiting to drown?

[Outro]
Yeah, you'll never be whole, yeah, you'll never be whole
Until you lose control
And think freely to smash the wall of apathy
Stop your self-importance and lift the weight off somebody else

Yeah, you'll never be whole, yeah, you'll never be whole
Until you lose control
And stop drinking the wine that's been dripping
From lips of the gluttons and envying their bloody teeth

Yeah, you'll never be whole, yeah, you'll never be whole
Until you lose control

[Intro]
DROGAS, yeah
THOT 97
THOT 97, nigga

[Verse]
Masterpiece
Threaten these niggas like the bad police
This the word of God from the pastor cheeks
And you can take a bath in the wrath of leaks, surf, baptize
Give a nigga my rap ties, metaphor, reservoir dog got cat lives
You can flip a coin, heads or tails, my nigga, bet it lands on the flat side
Always be a winner
You can be a Mac, nigga, I'mma be a printer
You can be a fat nigga, I'mma be a sprinter
Top of the world, nigga, you can ask Kenna
But trees got them paper nigga, timber
Timber timber timber
Timber timber timber
You gotta have principles, Skinner, Skinner
Or I'mma be the fat nigga, treat the finish line like a dinner time
And put on for my city like a Windy City wintertime
For as long as a one nigga wanna feel a really pretty titty line, woo!
Now let's say I get carjacked
Niggas like, "That's your new shit? Got that from who, shit? That look like Lu shit"
Then they bring the car back like it's Enterprise
Turnt when I was 18, had to start attackin' when I was 25
Nigga had the 9 at 14, I had the super V when I was 29
And I keep 30 in the 34, and I can hit the 10 like 20 times
Nigga had the fifties by the tubes, and you can count to 10 'bout 20 times!
THOT 97, THOT 97
That's a hundred-round clip and I shot 97
And I shot 90 weapons, what it doin'?
THOT 97, hundred in the chain and the watch 97
And I keep it hunnid like three more
And I'm feelin' like a boss, like Ebro
THOT 97, the coupe brand new but the drop from '97
I treat your top 10 like my bottom 97
Man I was in the trap house, nigga, watchin' 9-11
Real shit, ain't see the first one hit, but I watched 'em fly the second
Beats get slayed, like a nigga flyin' presents
Who put the flyest tapes in your fireplace?
I'mma tell you now, nigga, I ain't even tryna wait
Nigga 'fore you waste my time, I'mma tell you right now
Fahrenheit had niggas on the fire 'scapes, woo!
Superman, Batman, Space Ghost, Mighty Mouse, nigga all kinda capes
Tetsuo Season drop when it drop, nigga I don't even know the date
THOT 97, THOT 97
That's a hundred-round clip and I shot 97
It's a hundred in the chain and the watch 97, what we doin'?
THOT 97, THOT 97
And I keep it hunnid like three more
Feelin' like a boss, like Ebro

[Verse 1]
If I didn't have diamonds in my chain
That Chevy horn sounding like a train
We made a movie
And now I'm so proud of my address
We're repping Ridge Road deep down
Four doors on a Chevy

[Pre-Hook]
Cause every song was like
Nappy hair, smoke, drink, Tallahassee, what's up
Boom, know what it is, nigga fill the truck up
We don't care, look at all these Cadillacs on 20s
And every song was like
Work hard, play hard, money over everything
Cowboy hat and the hood cap or the chain
We don't care, started from the bottom, now we're here

[Hook]
Seems like yesterday we was drinking Crown Royal
We ain't really give a fuck
Now they try to hate on us
And I just party on my bus
Let me see you get loose, girl
Everything is on me
So, nigga, come through
Let me live that fantasy

[Verse 2: Young Cash]

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Yo, I am such a dancehall queen
I think somebody painted these pants on me
But when I drove past you was standin' on the bus line
Now all my bitches in the club bust, bust wine
Badder then all of them wack bitches combined
I got a lot of bad bitches inna mi bloodline
Mayday, mayday, mayday
I'm back
I rep Southside Jamaica, Queens to the fullest
Money makin' Manhattan, where's Anna? Where's Willis?
Shoutout to the Bronx, Staten Island, bitches dope, uh
Brooklyn, we go hard, Brooklyn, we go hard

[Chorus]
Fuck 'em, tell 'em fuck 'em, I fuck 'em, I never suck 'em
The deuces is what I chuck 'em, I duck 'em, I d-d-duck 'em
Fuck 'em, tell 'em fuck 'em, I fuck 'em, I never suck 'em
The deuces is what I chuck 'em, I duck 'em, d-d-d-duck 'em

[Post-Chorus]
Bring the heat back; daddy, bring the beat back

[Verse 2]
Yo! No, I'm not a freak no more
Okay, I'm lyin', daddy, I'm a freak on tour
And I keep it wet, yeah, it stay on pour
When I kick it on the jet they say the freak on board
Oh, that's fly, flyington
I was just givin' the pilot the eyeington
Mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday
I'm back

[Pre-Chorus]
Yup, tell 'em no ready, dem no ready, dem no ready yet
How them gon' be ready, ah them ah them ah, so delicate?
Now all the dope girls tryin' to recruit me
Presidential coochie, random man salute me

[Chorus]
Fuck 'em, tell 'em fuck 'em, I fuck 'em, I never suck 'em
The deuces is what I chuck 'em, I duck 'em, I d-d-duck 'em
Fuck 'em, tell 'em fuck 'em, I fuck 'em, I never suck 'em
The deuces is what I chuck 'em, I duck 'em, d-d-d-duck 'em

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
(Can I feel the vibe?)
(Can I feel the vibe?)
We used to be number ten
Now we're permanent one
Wyclef, Preacher's Son, Ichiban
Listen Mrs. Tin Can
I'm your candy handy man
Me without you is like American without the Band Stand
Cool fellow, dancehall stay mellow
All that guntalk who would have thought you died yellow
Damn, another hero wannabe
Now he sleeps with his friends in the mortuary
Dude, I find it rude, when you intrude
My pistol nozzle hits your nasal
Doo-doo comes out your anal
Just because your buff, don't play tuff
'Cause I'll reverse the earth and turn your flesh back to dust

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thing
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the natural la that the Refugees bring
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing
(She love me like she never before, ayy)

[Verse 2: John Forte]
Dig it! I stay high off the Fu-Gee-La
Bust when we rush through
You must knew Ruckus Crew got G's like the refu's
So F whoever want to test
Bring me stress, west coast back to east
Grab my toast when I reach
Truly curvin', swervin, lifestyle is urban
Sippin' bourbon, surviving
We real to keep the word when
A boy want fa test this set
Then you get wet-up
Just a bit to unprepared to to shoot him, fair bet

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
Fake bullets can't scar me
I can smell the weak out like safari
Play you out like Atari
Sacrifice you Hari Kari
And I'm sorry
To every single rapper, Dick and Harry
Saying they want to spar me
'Cause how thick my repertoire and my memoir be
Reminding me of eating Calamari in the Kalahari
With a band of Rastafari so
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you shouldn't diss refugees, and
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you whole sound set booty, and

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thing
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the remix sound that the Refugees bring
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing
(She love me like she never before, ayy)

[Verse 4: Pras]
I sit 90 degrees underneath palm trees
Sitting in the cool breeze in the West Indies
Flea to sea, ship my keys
On the Santa Maria, sip Sangria with señoritas
(They keep telling me this and telling me that)
They smile in my face then they talk behind my back
But what they lack is the facts about my stats
My rap impact will kill you softly like Roberta Flack

[Verse 5: Wyclef Jean]
Ayo, what's goin' on?
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Tryin' to front like you're down with Mount Zion
Yo, what's goin' on?
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Tryin' to front like you're down with Mount Zion (Zion)

[Verse 6: Akon]
Call Mister Martin, tell him to built a coffin
Today is death season, a hundred MCs are get murderin' (Stop it)
Call Mister Martin, tell him to built a coffin
Today is death season, a hundred MCs are get murderin', ha-ha-ha

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thing
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the remix sound that the Refugees bring
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing
(She love me like she never before, ayy)

[Verse 1]
Well, I was caught inside the wreck
Never found my way out, I was filled with indifference
The animals, they were getting tired
So I sang them a song
'Cause they promised not to take too long

Well, I can't find my way back home
I'll listen to you if you want me to
But you have to share a smoke
Yeah, I've been running against the wind
And I can hear the angels calling
The madness has been pulling me right

Back out of my stride
I feel the change in the rising tide
Blood is in the room
I buried all my wrongs there with my youth

[Chorus]
(Don't give up on me now)
I'm on the outside
(Don't give up on me now)
And I'm falling apart
Whoo, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, pleased to meet you, excuse my hands
I've been bitten by an enemy that's pretended to be my friend
No, I never wanted to be like them
I thought I was just too clever
To be brought down to their level
Of misfortuned chagrin

I don't care now what it's worth
But if you lift this burden off my back
I'll follow you to the bloody end
I've lived my life the way I want
But no one can tell me they're not afraid
Of the freedom of deliverance

Well, I take it all in stride
I feel the change in the rising tide
And someone's in the room
I buried all my guilt there with my youth

[Chorus]
(Don't give up on me now)
I'm on the outside
(Don't give up on me now)
And it's warm on the outside
(Don't give up on me now)
That's a lie
I don't want to fall apart

[Verse 3 - Outro]
Yeah, well, me? I've been afraid
I clawed and I fought like hell
The darkest days upon you

Yeah, well, me? I've gone astray
My blood was turning to sand
The darkest days upon you

Yeah, well, me? I've been afraid
The numbness was getting closer
The feverish days upon you
Yeah

Whoo
Whoo
Whoo
Whoo, ah

[Verse 1]
Daniel is travelin' tonight on a plane
I can see the red taillights headin' for Spain
Oh, and I can see Daniel wavin' goodbye
God, it looks like Daniel
Must be the clouds in my eyes

[Verse 2]
They say Spain is pretty, though I've never been
And Daniel says it's the best place he's ever seen
Oh, and he should know, he's been there enough
Lord, I miss Daniel
Oh, I miss him so much

[Chorus]
Oh, Daniel, my brother, you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died, but you see more than I
Daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky

[Chorus]
Oh, Daniel, my brother, you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died, but you see more than I
Daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky

[Verse 1]
Daniel is travelin' tonight on a plane
I can see the red taillights headin' for Spain
Oh, and I can see Daniel wavin' goodbye
God, it looks like Daniel
Must be the clouds in my eyes

[Outro]
Oh God, it looks like Daniel
Must be the clouds in my eyes

[Verse 1]
I didn't have diamonds in my chain
That Chevy horn sounded like a train
We made a movie
And I was so proud of my address
Repping Ridge Road deep down
Four doors on the Chevy

[Pre-Hook]
Cause every song was like
Nappy head, smoke, drank, Tallahassee, what's up?
Moon on Wednesday, nigga fill the truck up
We don't care, look at all these Cadillacs on 20s
And every song was like
"Work hard, play hard"  "Money over everything"
Cowboy hat and a hubcap for the chain
We don't care, started from the bottom, now we're here

[Hook 1]
Seems like yesterday we was drinking Crown Royal
We ain't really give a fuck
Now they try to hate on us
And I just party on my bus
Let me see you get loose, girl
Everything is on me
So, nigga, come through
Let me live that fantasy

[Verse 2: Young Cash]
I represent that 904 (Duval County)
And every weekend you can catch me in the runnings
And everybody who know me know
That I rep the Win Squad
And them niggas getting money

[Pre-Hook 2]
Them niggas used to say
"There go Young Cash tippin' in that Ace 2"
T-Pain call my phone, telling me to come through
But I don't care cause never ever did I dream
That Teddy Pain would grow up and now we makin' millions
Got enough money to take care of our children
And I don't care, cause we came from nothing

[Hook 2]
And most niggas ain't loyal (loyal)
My dog came back for me (came back for me)
He got me off on XRC
When I was still movin' keys
When a nigga went to prison
Everybody turned their backs on me
But it's cool
Young Cash gon keep it G

[Hook 1]
To my bedroom to the hallway
To the hallway to the alleyway
To the alleyway to the freeway
To the freeway to the highway

But here's something from me
It's music
It's music
It's music

That's, that's why we like that
That's, that's why we like that
That's, that's why we like that
That's, that's why we like that
That's, that's why we like that
That's, that's why we like that

The future backwards spells "er u tuf"
The future backwards spells "er u tuf"
That's why we do this, we do that
That's why we do this
It's the music
Pump up on the beat
Pump up, pump up on the beats
With my
Pump up on the beat
Pump up, pump up on the beats
Pump up on the beat
Pump up, pump up on the beats
With my
Pump up on the beat
Pump up, pump up on the beats

With my
Pump up on the beat
Pump up, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, bear

I'm saying it should it be freer
I'm not saying it should be freer
I'm saying the music should be free

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Water grey
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean, everywhere

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
But now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underground
Now I, now I do

[Guitar Solo: Brad Delson]

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away

All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
All you've ever wanted

The little things give you away

[Intro]
Ooooh, New York
Ooooh, New York

[Verse 1]
Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seein' my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway

[Hook 1]
Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York

[Verse 2]
On the avenue, there ain't ever a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a meltin' pot, on the corner sellin' rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge

[Hook 2]
I'ma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York

[Bridge]
One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
"Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah!"

[Hook 3]
In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York

[Pre-Hook: Rich Homie Quan]

Luxury, sunny, Young Thugger need loc's
My water heavy, I need me a float
He got them birds in a fender bender
Thugger let your bitch suck him up in rentals
Call me with the deal like a fuckin' pickle

Fresh out the yam spot, gon' pull the Lam' out
Gon' pull your cam out, never blend in
Cause I always stand out, when I came out
Brought a swag out, and some bands out
Them two cups are dirty, my necklace on a birdy
And I ball before the Hall of Fame, James Worthy
And I'm drinkin' on Magic, yellow purple
You can have a sip, if you get dirty

[Intro]
One two
One two three four!

[Verse 1]
Waking sitting upright
Can't explain the sunlight
Wondering why you're not home
Girl I go beside you
Left before you tried to
Work out all the unknowns
Blame it all on me when
I forget to defend
Everything that we worked out
Something in her wording
I cannot help searching
For what memory found

[Chorus]
Thought it stopped just as it start
But that is not what you are
You're a layer on my clothes
Made of ivy and gold

[Verse 2]
Meet me in the hallway
Bite your lip when I say
Never have you left my mind
Stop and think it over
Smiling moving closer
Oh what delicate time!
Blame it all on me when
I forget to defend
Everything that we put down
Something in her wording
I guess she was just searching
For some knowledge or sound

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Freedom fightin' dad
Bombed his pad
Called him a terror
Put him on wanted ads
Freedom fightin' dad
Bombed his pad
Called him a terror
Put him on wanted ads

[Verse 2]
Daddy's M.I.A, missing in action
Gone to start a revolution
Freedom fighter got injection
He no act, he got no reaction
M.I.A, missing in action
Gone to start a revolution
Freedom fighter got injection
He no act, he got no reaction

[Outro]
Fire! *Toy gun shots*
Don't move!
Drop the gun!

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I got what you want, want and girl, I want you
So grab a couple a friends and let's go out and if you're nasty, I'm nasty too
I've got a whole section already reserved for you
So bring your pretty ass over, to me

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter]
I say, I ain't gon' talk ya ear off (Girl)
Ain't gon' talk ya ear off (Girl)
I won't talk ya ear off (Girl)
I'm calling all the pretty ladies to the floor
Boy, don't talk my ear off (Girl)
I won't talk your ear off (Girl)
Don't talk my ear off (Girl)
But only if you follow me to the floor

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Girl, I got your heart, heart, I know what to do, baby
Just sit that big ol' thing on my lap, that big ol' booty
I'm telling the truth, baby, it's only you that I gotta have
So bring your pretty ass over to me

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter]
I say, I ain't gon' talk ya ear off (Girl)
Ain't gon' talk ya ear off (Girl)
I won't talk ya ear off (Girl)
I'm calling all the pretty ladies to the floor
Boy, don't talk my ear off (Girl)
I won't talk your ear off (Girl)
Don't talk my ear off (Girl)
But only if you follow me to the floor

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
(Talkin' 'bout it, talkin' 'bout it, baby, then be about it)
Oh no
(If you talkin' 'bout it, talkin' 'bout it, baby, then be about it)
Yeah
(If you talkin' 'bout it, talkin' 'bout it, baby, then be about it)
Be about it
(Baby, just be about it, baby, just be about it)
Woohoo!
(Talkin' 'bout it, talkin' 'bout it, baby, then be about it)
You know it
(If you talkin' 'bout it, talkin' 'bout it, baby, then be about it)
Girl
(If you talkin' 'bout it, talkin' 'bout it, baby, then be about it)
You know it
(Baby, just be about it, baby, just be about it)
You know it, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter]
I say, I ain't gon' talk ya ear off (Girl)
Ain't gon' talk ya ear off (Girl)
I won't talk ya ear off (Girl)
I'm calling all the pretty ladies to the floor
Boy, don't talk my ear off (Girl)
I won't talk your ear off (Girl)
Don't talk my ear off (Girl)
But only if you follow me to the floor

[Verse 1]
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Verse 2]
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Outro]
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
A used pink bathrobe
A rare mint snowglobe
A Smurf TV tray
I bought on eBay
My house is filled with
This crap shows up in
Bubble wrap, most every day
What I bought on eBay

[Chorus]
Tell me why
I need another pet rock
Tell me why
I got that Alf alarm clock
Tell me why
I bid on Shatner's old toupee
They had it on eBay

[Verse 2]
I'll buy your knick-knack
Just check my feedback
"A++!" they all say
They love me on eBay

[Chorus]
Gonna buy
A slightly-damaged golf bag
Gonna buy
Some Beanie Babies, new with tag
From some guy
I've never met in Norway
Found him on eBay

[Bridge]
I am the type who is liable to snipe you
With two seconds left to go, whoa
Got Paypal or Visa, what ever'll please ya
As long as I've got the dough

[Interlude]
I'll buy your tchotchkes
Sell me your watch, please
I'll buy (I'll buy, I'll buy, I'll buy)

[Bridge]
I'm highest bidder!
Junk keeps arriving in the mail
From that worldwide garage sale (Dukes Of Hazard ashtray)
Hey! A Dukes Of Hazard ashtray (Oh yeah)
I bought it on eBay

[Chorus]
Wanna buy
A Pac Man Fever lunchbox
Wanna buy
A case of vintage tube socks
Wanna buy
(A Kleenex used by Dr. Dre, Dr. Dre)
Found it on eBay

Want to buy
That Farrah Fawcet poster
Pez dispensers (and a toaster)
Don't know why
The kind of stuff you'd throw away
I'll buy on eBay

[Outro]
What I bought on eBay

[Verse 1]
As the crowd dies down, screamin' and appalause
As a bad broad opens the envelope
Lemme straighten up my tie that I worked so hard for
Already got my speech, cause this is my award
Like, thank you for the love and every look I get
Thank you to my last girlfriend cause she a bitch
She never held me down, so thank you for the lift
Cause I know she lookin' out like
Thank you to the Northline Streets where I live
Since before I got big, before they shot B.I.G
Thank you to my grandma for keeping me in line
Thank you to my momma cause she never stopped tryin'
Snatched me outta public school to keep me outta trouble
Paid for private school and picked up another hustle
Thank you for every wrong turn I made in life
Just remember, 3 lefts is the same as goin' right
As I'm goin' down this, thank you cause this is very long
Thank you for this award, that I've just won
If you goin' me you are only with some important
You know who the best is, know it all, craigslist

[?]
Hah, oh yeah I stretched out, stretched in
Checked out, checked in, sexed out, sextin'
Hey, I always was the best man
Could never had a bride cause I'm fuckin' all the best friends
Last but not least
Thank you for the rappers who all let me share a beat
Put their verse on it, thought that shit was sweet
Then I put my verse on it and I made 'em sound weak
I'm living off recordin', I hope that they recordin'
AV watch be worth a fortune, Ferrari Lambo Porsche and
Livin' dreams out of proportions, yeah bottle after bottle
But I never left the cork in, and you can't have a portion
Thank you to the devil, for tryna' bring me down
Thank you man to Kanye for bring me around
And tryna cut me off short, and run me off stage
So if you didn't hear your name, it doesn't mean I changed
Thank you to the metropolitan colleges I was rockin' with
Means more to me than oxygen, honestly, on some honest shit
Doin' them shoes, wasn't gettin' money
Still got by though, puttin' in budgets
Hell yeah, nigga, full of Benjamin hundreds
Niggas die young, Benjamin Button
I'm gone

[Intro: Bret and Jemaine]
Ahhh x 5
Mermaid x 12

[Verse 1]
Mermaid, murmur into my ear
The answers the questions I'm longing to hear
Does it relax you to hear the sound of the land?
Do you, oh mermaid, have slightly webbed hands? (ew)
Is it normal for a guy to wear a scuba apparatus when he makes love in the sea? (Make love to me!)
Would it be weird for you if I touched your fishy half?
I know it would be for me

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wadadadiya wadadadiya
Oh, oh, oh, oh boom, ba doom doom, boom, ba doom doom

[Verse 2]
Do you have mermaid parties beneath the sea? (Am I invited?)
At these mermaid parties, do you smoke sea weed?
(If so then how do you light it?)
Are you the answer to a drunken sailor's lonely wish? (Wish, wish, wish)
Or are you an optical illusion caused by a woman sitting on a rock, holding half a fish? (Half a sexy fish!)

[Chorus]

[Tonya]
Hey! Hey, stop, hey. Please stop, fuck, stop!
Thank God you stopped
Fuck, my fucking OnStar isn't working
I left my fucking phone at home!
God, I've been standing out here for like, an hour
I'm soaking wet, freezing
Thank you so much. Really, you're a life-saver, uh
What are you doing?
Fucking! Get away from me! What the fuck! Fucking asshole!
Get away from me, you motherfucker! Get away!
Get away, you fucking freak! Get away from me!
Goddammit, fuck! Help me!

[Verse 1]
I've been watching you, you've been hurting too
You give all your love, nothing left to show
I have been there too, alone in my despair
Watching life go by, no one who to share
Boy, you got it bad, but I got something good
I will treat you good in every way, yeah
You will never feel alone, my touch is such a rush
It overflows

[Chorus]
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for?
I will give to you the love you seek and more

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I will give to you the love you seek and more
You're what I'm waiting for
I will give to you the love you seek and more
You're all I really need
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for?
I will give to you the love you seek and more

[Verse 2]
Baby, here we are, standing face to face
Just the two of us, locked in your embrace
Now I got it bad, but you got something good
Won't you treat me good in every way? Yeah
Are you ready? I can feel your passion and your love
It overflows

[Chorus]
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for?
I will give to you the love you seek and more

[Bridge]
I got the love you seek
I got the love you seek
I got the love you seek
I got the love

[Chorus]
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for?
I will give to you the love you seek and more
(The love you seek, baby)
I will give to you the love you seek and more
You're what I'm waiting for baby
I will give to you the love you seek and more

[Bret and Jemaine]
Hello
Hi
Hello, man sitting in the park
I've just said hi, woman in the park

How you doing?
Mmm... Good, thanks
You're looking good!
Pardon?
I said you're looking good!
Fair enough
Jenny
Pardon?
Jenny!
No, I'm sorry, I think you've mistaken me for somebody else

No, it's me, I'm Jenny. My name is Jenny, yeah
Oh, you are? Oh. I—hahaha... (Yeah, yeah. Ah, yeah.) Oh, I thought, oh... What a hilarious misunderstanding. Nice to meet you, Jenny!
We've met before, quite a few times actually
Oh, oh yes, of course we have... I meant it was nice to meet you the time that I met you. Where was it that we met that time that I met you, when I met you?
At a party
That's right. Wasn't it one of those boring work parties?
No
That's why I said, "wasn't it." It was the party of a mutual friend, was it? Wasn't it? Was it? Wasn't it?
...Yes it was
Yeah! I thought so. Oh, Bobby's!
No
Doug's?
No
D-Dawg's?
No
Maxwell's?
No
Andy's?
Yes, Andy's
Yeah, Andy's party! (Ooh!) That's right! (Ooh!) Oh, Andy knows how to throw a party, doesn't he, Jenny?
Yeah, I love Andy's parties!
Love Andy's parties! (Yeah!) What crazy parties. How is that guy anyway?
She's good
Mmm, yeah. Oh, that's right. Andy hates it when I forget that

We watched a movie
Yeah... It was something like, but not necessarily Schindler's List. We watched it and we wept
It was Police Academy 4

We went for a walk
On our feet, if I remember correctly...
We walked to the top of the hill and we ate sandwiches!
Yeah! Oh, we just grabbed a sandwich, and put it in our mouths. Oh, that's the only way to have sandwiches! Oh Jenny, tell me? Do you still walk? Do you still get into sandwiches in a big way?
I still walk a lot, but I'm not eating as many sandwiches as back then
Oh
Do you remember what we did up there at the top of the hill?
Kind of?
We were standing at the lookout...
Oh, I remember exactly what we did at the lookout. We just looked!
...Out! Across the city from our little spot on the hilltop
Oh, it's so pretty from way up there

We talked about how the lights from the buildings and cars
Seemed like reflections of the stars
That shine out so pretty and bright
That night...

It was daytime
The daytime, of the night...

Do you remember what you said to me?
Not word for word, actually, Jenny, but I remember there were some verbs
Well, you said, "Meet me here in one year"
You just needed some time to clear your head
And you seem to have done that

La-la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la

We have a child
...Pardon?
We have a child
Why didn't you tell me, Jenny? Why didn't you tell me that day when we went to the top of the hill and we made sweet, oh, how we made such sweet, sweet sandwiches. Does it have my eyes? My way with words? Does it look like me at all?
No, not at all, 'cause we adopted him. I can't believe you don't remember, it was a very difficult process!
Oh, ooh... Oh... Eh... Are you sure that was me, Jenny?
Yes, I'm pretty sure it was you, John!
I'm Brian

Oh my god, I'm so sorry!
Oh, no worries!
Oh, no that's terrible!
Oh, don't worry!
Oh, how embarrassing!
Oh, don't worry, Jenny, actually I'm kind of relie-e-eved. That kind of thing just happens all the time. I've just got one of those faces, I suppose
So does John! Ha, he's got one of those faces as well!

Hahaha... (Oh yeah...)
Hahaha... (Oh yeah...)
Hahaha... (Hahaha...)

[Verse 1]
People, in the middle
Life's a riddle
Not a game of dice
Not for a man who rolls with ice
Days turn
Faster than a minute
How was I to know this?
Would you even notice me?
Cause they're impostors
We threw away the time

[Chorus]
Anagram
I'm just a messenger man
It's the last time around
One of these days I wish you were a anagram
If we're just passengers then
I wish it was the first time around
One of these days I wish you were a

[Verse 2]
All the people in
White stockings talk with pride
They'll be waving all the flags at night
Which will I decide?
Cause they're impostors
I'm making up an

[Chorus]
Anagram
I'm just a messenger man
It's the last time around
One of these days I wish you were a anagram
If we're just passengers then
I wish it was the first time around
One of these days I wish you were a

[Verse 3]
Collide
I stand in the light of your eyes
I'll see you another time
Come on baby roll the dice
I'm feeling like it's gonna break
This time will stars align?
I'm thinking that it's all the same

[Chorus]
Anagram
I'm just a messenger man
It's the last time around
One of these days I wish you were a anagram
If we're just passengers then
I wish it was the first time around
One of these days I wish you were a

Anagram
Anagram

[Verse 1]
It's a full moon at midnight
Running fast, out of time
It's a feeling you can't describe
Floating past the pale skylight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you look reflective
But you're so disconnected
Just think about it
What's really on your mind?
For you I would steal time
Suspicion, suspicion

[Chorus]
You're a daydreamer, oh
And it's the same thing over and over
We're running for our lives
In a slipstream, oh
You'll wake up someday and realize
You were dreaming of a life you forget
You forget

[Verse 2]
It's so affected
That color corrected night
But you're falling fast
Through plastic skies

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And you look reflective
So disconnected
It's not real life
Open your eyes and breathe
Everything's in its right place
But nothing in gold can stay
Just tell me you know my face

[Chorus]
You're a daydreamer, oh
And it's the same thing over and over
We're running for our lives
In a slipstream, oh
You'll wake up someday and realize
You were dreaming of a life you forget
You forget

[Bridge]
When the moon was high
You couldn't describe
A lucid sky
We just might die
But we feel so alive

[Chorus]
You're a daydreamer, oh
And it's the same thing over and over
We're running for our lives
In a slipstream, oh
You'll wake up someday and realize
You were dreaming of a life you forget
You forget

[Verse 1]
You fault my pride
Don't ever need to 'pologize
As your lips unfold
Shaken purple from the cold

[Chorus]
You better learn to crawl
You better learn to crawl
Before I walk away
Before I walk away

[Verse 2]
You broke my mouth
The bloody bits are spitting out
Is your grave unscathed
The worm is counting down the days

[Chorus]
He wants to see you crawl
He wants to see you crawl
Before I walk away
Before I walk away

[Post-Chorus]
The reds and the whites and abused
The crucified USA
As their hypocrisy unfolds
Oh hell is truly on its way

[Verse 3]
As the rat, and the fly
They're searching for an alibi
As we await the wrath
They never went to Sunday Mass

[Chorus]
They want to see us crawl
They want to see us crawl
Before they walk away
Before they walk away

[Post-Chorus]
The reds and the whites and abused
The crucified USA
As their hypocrisy unfolds
Oh hell is truly on its way

[Verse 1]
Looking up there's always sky
Rest your head, I'll take you high
We won't fade into darkness
Won't let you fade into darkness

[Bridge]
Why worry now? You'll be safe
Hold my hand, just in case
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

[Chorus]
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

[Verse 2]
This world can seem cool and grey
But you and I are here today
And we won't fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Nothing to fear but fear itself
We'll be okay just keep the faith

[Chorus]
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

[Outro]
Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

[Bridge:]

[Intro]
She said call me now baby and I'd come a running
She said call me now baby and I'd come a running
If you'd call me now baby I'd come a running

[Verse 1]
I'm on call to be there
One and all to be there
And when I fall to pieces
Lord you know I'll be there waiting

[Verse 1]
I'm on call to be there
One and all to be there
And when I fall to pieces
Lord you know I'll be there waiting

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna brawl so be there
One for all we'll be there
And when they fall to pieces
Lord you know I'll be there laughing

[Bridge]
I'd come a running
I'd come a running
I'd come a running

[Outro]
To be there
To be there
I'm on call to be there
I'm on call to be there
I'm on call to be there
I'm on call to be there

[Verse 1]
That taste
All I ever needed
All I ever wanted
Too dumb to surrender
She shakes
Like the morning railway
Checking me out
Someone on her shoulder

[Verse 2]
The lamp
Flickers in the bedroom
She must feel as awkward
Whorehouse Arizona
Now go
Stand up to a giant
Say that I'm a fighter
Too drunk to remember
Too drunk to
Shake hands

[Verse 3]
My face
Staring on the pavement
Tasted something awful
I hate when that happens
She waves
Thinkin that it's sexy
She must be plum crazy
I kind of think I like her
I kind of think I do

[Verse 1]
The open road, the path of greatness
Is at your fingers
Go be the one, that keeps on fighting
Go be the stranger
Just put your foot, in front the other
Crow like a rooster
Be all in all, together something
Fear is a danger

I Say

[Chorus]
Spill out on streets of stars
And ride away
Find out what you are
Face to face

[Verse 2]
The windows are, the perfect picture
They're always changing
Go on get lost, jump in the waters
When they are raging
I Say

[Chorus] (x2)
Spill out on streets of stars
And ride away
Find out what you are
Face to face
Once you've had enough
Carry on
Don't forget to love
Before you're gone

[Instrumental break]

[Outro: Kings Of Leon]
Taking to the floor with the reach to the sky
I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie
Locking down the door with the rhythm and rhyme
I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie

[Verse 1: Kings Of Leon]
Trying to recall what you want me to say
I shake your way, I shake your way
Counting on the night for a beautiful day
I shake your way, I shake your way
And I say you can't get enough
No you can't get enough

[Chorus: Kings Of Leon]
Given a chance
I'm going to be somebody
If for one dance
I'm going to be somebody
Open the door
It's going to make you love me
Facing the floor
I'm going to be somebody

[Verse 2: Kings Of Leon]
Now is your time and you know where you stand
With a gun in your hand, with a gun in your hand
Now I'm no longer an ordinary man
Was this your big plan, your gun in your hand
And I say you can't get enough
No you can't get enough

[Chorus: Kings Of Leon]
Given a chance
I'm going to be somebody
If for one dance
I'm going to be somebody
Open the door
It's going to make you love me
Facing the floor
I'm going to be somebody

[Outro: Kings Of Leon]
Be somebody
Be somebody

[Verse 1]
It's in the way she often calls me out
It's in the cut of your pretty gown
Your come on legs and your pantyhose
You look so precious with your bloody nose

[Chorus]
We're gonna come together
We're gonna celebrate
We're gonna gather round
Like it's your birthday
I don't want to know
Just what I'm gonna do
I don't care where you're going
I'm coming along with you

[Verse 2]
Walking her home with the grassy hill
Falling and laughing at the drinks we've spilled
Just one of those nights that I had to share
Chasing the death without a care

[Chorus]
We're gonna come together
We're gonna celebrate
We're gonna gather round
Like it's your birthday
I don't want to know
Just what I'm gonna do
I don't care where you're going
I'm coming along with you

[Bridge]
You know I love the way you curve

[?]

[Chorus]
We're gonna come together
We're gonna celebrate
We're gonna gather round
Like it's your birthday
I don't want to know
Just what I'm gonna do
I don't care where you're going
I'm coming along with you

[Verse 1]
Such a swine, lips like wine
But it don't matter to me
Take a turn before I burn
It don't matter to me
Like a snake, I wake and bake
It don't matter to me
I could fuck or I could fight
It don't matter to me

[Chorus]
Because it's always the same
And I'm always the same

[Verse 2]
Uncle Sam he looks god damned
But it don't matter to me
I don't know where I'm going to go
It don't matter to me
You could bleed, and stain my seed
It don't matter to me

[Chorus]
Because it's always the same
And I'm always the same

[Verse 3]
You're not a man everybody says
But it don't matter to me
Dirty feet on my seat
But it don't matter to me
Break my heart, tear me apart
It don't matter to me (no, no)
I put a shine in your eye
It don't matter to me

[Chorus]
Because it's always the same
And I'm always the same

[Intro]
Find yourself a new frontier
Because life is going, going, gone
Fly yourself away from here, into the clear
Before it's going, going, gone

[Verse 1]
Say it loud and in the light
For it's going, going, gone
Shake the hands
The hands that pick, pick the fight
Because life is going, going, gone

[Chorus]
Yes I'll find you
And cut you down
Friends and neighbors, sleepy town
If you wake up, before the blow
Pick your face up
We come, we go
We come, we go
We live until we live no more

[Verse 2]
Travel with the dead black eye
Before it's come and, come and gone
Cradles and the rocking chairs
Make a life
Before it's come and, come and gone

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I like to dance all night
It summons the day
But that's how I play
Yeah that's how I play
I said who are you
No matter who you are
So we dance all night
And dance all day

[Chorus]
I Say
I Say

[Verse 2]
We're going to fuel the fire
We're going to stoke it up
We're going to sip this wine
And pass the cup
Who needs avenues
Who needs reservoirs
We going to show this town
How to kiss these stars

[Chorus]
I Say
I Say

[Verse 3]
I'm on a hunt to kill
I'm going to skin the hide
A yelp and scream
And away I ride
I'll never top this view
I'll never follow ground
It's all for you
For what you found

[Chorus]
I Say
I Say
I Say
I Say

[Outro]
It's going to take your hand
And going to drive you home
Just going to keep on, keep on, keep on
And then forever roam

[Verse 1]
Weeds blow tall on the broken train tracks
Ruth B. draws, we're fixin' to get high
And we'll hit the bluffs
Find ourselves the same old rum

[Chorus]
Everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same, this town is pitiful
And I'll be getting out
As soon as I can fly

[Hook]
Life goes by, on a Talihina sky

[Verse 2]
Hopped up boys looking for their trouble
Knocked up girls, they've all got their share
Ruth seems out her mind, swears she won't give in this time

[Chorus]
Everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same, this town is pitiful
And I'll be getting out as soon as I can fly

[Hook]
Life goes by, on a Talihina sky
Life goes by, on a Talihina sky

[Chorus]
But everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same, this towns grown pitiful
And I'll be getting out as soon as I can fly

[Hook]
Life goes by, on a Talihina sky
Life goes by, on a Talihina sky (x2)

[Verse 1]
Aha, shake
Taper jean girl, with a motel face
Aha, shake
Bury your eyes in a secret place
Aha, shake
Black as night on a summer day

[Chorus]
Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make-up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher

[Verse 2]
Heart, Heartbreak
Knocking them down like the seventh grade
Heart, Heartbreak
Cigarettes and song with a winter's chafe
Heart, Heartbreak
Keep like my daughter and a run away

[Chorus]
Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make-up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher

[Bridge]
Aha, shake, taper jean girl kills me

[Chorus]
Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make-up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher

[Outro]
I gotta shake, shake, shake
I gotta keep on, keep on, keep on
I gotta keep on, keep on, keep on
I gotta shake, shake, shake

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Swear it isn't real
I like the way it looks, but I hate the way it feels, oh
I know what it is, uh
I've seen this before, got caught for a million
I know that I'm nervous
'Cause there really ain't a thing natural about it
Water into wine, please
She seem like a miracle, I know that's impossible

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You don't wanna love, maybe not
Baby, you gon' give me everything you got, damn right
Say you love me, ooh
Why you in my bed turning over like the graves of the ones before you, 'fore ya?

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Rihanna]
I keep looking for love (Love)
Can't find it in a party, in a whole room full of bodies (Oh)
I keep looking for love (Love)
Dying over diamonds (Oh)
Counterfeit designing
I'm not feeling these counterfeit hoes
(Fuckin' with these counterfeit bitches)
(I'm not fuckin' with these counterfeit hoes)
Feeling these counterfeit hoes
(Fuckin' with these counterfeit bitches)
Feeling these counterfeit hoes, hoes
(I'm not fuckin' with these counterfeit hoes, I'm not)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Alright
This is some old movie shit
Everything fake like a movie script
Everything I got public, so
You already know how the groupies get
Pulled up in the fakest city with the Lambo' sittin' and my Rambo with me
Plus I got a bitch so bad, with a rep so cold, big ass, big titties
Stuck in a fairy tale lifestyle
Snow White rollin' with gold diggers
Nigga say, "How much for that one?"
Shit, I ain't even know she was a ho, nigga
I meet these hoes erryday
Try to turn love like erry way
Hundred dollars bills run the color of red
So I'm countin' my dough in a private place, yikes

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You don't wanna love, maybe not
Baby, you gon' give me everything you got, damn right
Say you love me, ooh
Why you in my bed turning over like the graves of the ones before you, 'fore ya?

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Kelly Rowland, with Rihanna]
I keep looking for love (Love)
I can't find it in a party (Ooh), in a whole room full of bodies (Oh)
I keep looking for love (Love)
Dying over diamonds (Yeah)
Counterfeit designing (Yeah)
I'm not feeling these counterfeit hoes
(Fuckin' with these counterfeit bitches)
(I'm not fuckin' with these counterfeit hoes)
Feeling these counterfeit hoes
(Fuckin' with these counterfeit bitches)
Feeling these counterfeit hoes, hoes
(I'm not fuckin' with these counterfeit hoes, I'm not)

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, hold up, wait
Shoulda been on time but you showed up late
Had a little feelin' but it's gone away
Gave you a piece, you want a whole damn plate
Wanna play, wanna ball
Wanna have your cake and eat it all
Now I gotta new one outta state
So them ratchets gonna hate
But they hated Jesus, man
Runnin' around sayin' you don't need a man
You know you gon' miss them private flights
Errything high with Young Khalifa, man
Errything paid for
It's taken its course, so much back and then forth
That's a erryday thing though, woo
So I'm skatin'
Headin' straight for your replacement
'Cause your story, I couldn't take it
It had holes in it like Jason
But I stuck around and stayed patient
Mama called me up basin'
Father called me up pacin'
All your friends were all basic
Now I see right through you, woulda thought a nigga had LASIK
Extra cash, spent that so my car look like a spaceship
Wanna leave me, that's cool, I was thinkin' 'bout leavin' you
Walked out the door like poof, made it look like the thing to do

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Rihanna & Wiz Khalifa]
I keep looking for love (Hahaha, love)
Can't find it in a party (Oh), in a whole room full of bodies (Uh)
I keep looking for love (Love)
Dying over diamonds (Yeah)
Counterfeit designing (Yeah)
I'm not feeling these counterfeit hoes
(Fuckin' with these counterfeit bitches)
(I'm not fuckin' with these counterfeit hoes)
Feeling these counterfeit hoes
(Fuckin' with these counterfeit bitches)
Feeling these counterfeit hoes, hoes
(I'm not fuckin' with these counterfeit hoes, I'm not)
Ay, it's all G homie
Don't worry about it, I'll carry the load pimpin'
Oh you don't gotta take the heat, you know
God will never give you any more then you can handle

[Chorus]
Even though I'm wanted dead or alive
By the jackers and the robbers and the federal guys
I keep my head to the sky
Embrace the pain
I'm facing twenty-five but I can't complain
(It's all G) I done walked through the fire before
Hey I survived when them guys open fire before
(It's all G) Let the haters conversate on me
Since he too weak to take the heat just put the weight on me
It's all G

Hey, let me tell ya how you measure a man
When his world start to fall see how tall he stand
Will you fold under pressure when the feds come and get ya
Can you hold it together? Think so? Well, that's special
Will you have the same swagger when the world laughing at ya
Act like nothing the matter till ya girl have to ask ya
Well ya armour keep cracking, or will ya keep laughing
Be the same person even if you ain't perfect
When you hear them lame verses will you say it ain't worth
Or blow it all make a call and send them goons lurkin'
One thin
