was nobody. And when it's all said and done, when he's home at last, he sits with his wife, and he tells her the stories.

So what does it all mean? Myself and a lot of other songwriters have been influenced by these very same themes. And they can mean a lot of different things. If a song moves you, that's all that's important. I don't have to know what a song means. I've written all kinds of things into my songs. And I'm not going to worry about it – what it all means. When Melville put all his old testament, biblical references, scientific theories, Protestant doctrines, and all that knowledge of the sea and sailing ships and whales into one story, I don't think he would have worried about it either – what it all means.

John Donne as well, the poet-priest who lived in the time of Shakespeare, wrote these words, "The Sestos and Abydos of her breasts. Not of two lovers, but two loves, the nests." I don't know what it means, either. But it sounds good. And you want your songs to sound good.

When Odysseus in The Odyssey visits the famed warrior Achilles in the underworld – Achilles, who traded a long life full of peace and contentment for a short one full of honor and glory –  tells Odysseus it was all a mistake. "I just died, that's all." There was no honor. No immortality. And that if he could, he would choose to go back and be a lowly slave to a tenant farmer on Earth rather than be what he is – a king in the land of the dead – that whatever his struggles of life were, they were preferable to being here in this dead place.

That's what songs are too. Our songs are alive in the land of the living. But songs are unlike literature. They're meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare's plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, "Sing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story."
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Intro]
Oh, mama!

[Verse 1]
No stopping at the red light, girl
'Cause I want to get you said now
No going at the green light, girl
'Cause I want to be with you now
You are my special, you are my special
You are my midnight, midnight, yeah

[Chorus]
So sweet, so fine, so nice
Oh my, my-my, my-my, oh

Feel good (x7)
Change (x12)

[Verse 1: Damon Albarn]
City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got her kissing, 'cause I don't get sleep, no

[Hook: Damon Albarn]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love has freely
Turned forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Verse 2: Stephen Colbert]
Laughin' gas these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like a** cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my mayonnaise attack
S***, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (yeah)
Colbert rappin' in harder this year (yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo' sound you kill the Inc
So don't stop, get it, get it (yeah)
Until you cheddar head
And watch the way I navigate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Pre-Hook: Damon Albarn]
Sha, sha ba da, sha ba da, feel good
Sha, sha ba da, sha ba da, feel good
Sha, sha ba da, sha ba da, feel good
Sha, sha ba da, sha ba da, feel good

[Hook: Damon Albarn]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love has freely
Turned forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Outro: Stephen Colbert]
Don't stop, get it, get it
Peep how your captain's in it
Steady, watch me navigate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Don't stop, get it, get it
Peep how your captain's in it
Steady, watch me navigate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1]
All my friends are, they're on vacation
But I'm just stuck here in this parking lot
Well, looking for a mirror, I'm looking at a screen
These pixelated dreams are blowing up my pocket
I'll find some action, we'll cut the scene
I'm on a merry-go-round, I'm in a washing machine
Just spinning

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All of my friends, they don't do any favors
Unless they're partyin', then they got all of 'em
All of my friends, they blow all of the paycheck
They got no money because they're dumb and reckless

[Chorus]
But I love my friends, I love my friends
We got each other, don't need no others
All of my friends, I love my friends
We're a disaster, yeah, you know it's true

[Verse 2]
Well, I've been caught up in the action
Eating fire and smoke
It's so breezy 'til we're crashin' and I'm all alone
You know it's nothing new, yeah, we've been here before
But let's take it to my house 'cause I know we want more, mmm

[Pre-Chorus 2]
All of my friends, they're crawling on the weekend
Looking for something 'cause there's nothing to do, mmm
And all my friends, they always end up leaving
For something better when it's time to cruise

[Chorus]
I love my friends, I love my friends
We got each other, don't need no others
All of my friends, I love my friends
We're a disaster, yeah, you know it's true

[Bridge]
We're unfazed, man, we'll make it through okay
Even though the days feel long and the nights feel just the same
Well, I believe the hearts that drink from the stars stay satisfied
To live in a safer place veiled in a peaceful paradise

[Outro]
All of my friends, I love my friends
We're a disaster, yeah, you know it's true
Yeah
We're a disaster
Yeah
We're a disaster, yeah, you know it's true
We're a disaster
We're a disaster, yeah, you know it's true

[Verse 1: Mark Foster and Jena Malone]
A circuit likening, you glisten in bed
The static shifts, static shift of leather
One morning I did try to call him by his name
But my man didn't know when to come around

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Foster and Jena Malone]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Chorus: Mark Foster and Jena Malone]
How long, how long will we try to make it together?
It's too long, it's too long, we could die just hanging here forever
Hold on, hold on, we'll get by as static space lovers
And we'll be fine circling each other

[Verse 2: Mark Foster]
We placed our bets, say "Praise the Lord"
Your static lips leave me wanting more
Well, don't float too far
'Cause I won't live without your constellation
Reach out, my love
'Cause I can't hold on forever

[Pre-Chorus 2: Mark Foster]
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
But I'll try
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And we'll never have to say goodbye

[Chorus: Mark Foster and Jena Malone]
How long, how long will we try to make it together?
It's too long, it's too long, we could die just hanging here forever
Hold on, hold on, we'll get by as static space lovers
And we'll be fine circling each other

[Bridge: Mark Foster and Jena Malone]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh

[Chorus: Mark Foster and Jena Malone]
It's too long, too long, we could die just hanging here forever
Hold on, hold on, and we'll get by as static space lovers
And we'll be fine circling each other

[Verse 1]
Parading to the masses, we're coming so fresh to death
I've been stealing looks from shadows, you conjure with your purse
Yeah, you're walking in stilettos but your nose is bleeding out
I've been running from the devil but the devil's on my back
I'm decreasing, took a leave of absence from the war
If the wall is coming down, then we got to press the pedal
Got my hands up in the air, I'm saying I can't breathe
I got my hands up in the air, I'm saying

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey man, get away from me
Yeah
Hey man, get away from me
Uh
Yeah, oh

[Chorus]
Never ask for any favors, there's nothing I want from you
I've been looking for an answer to keep me from fallin' through
And I'm waiting for the voice to speak 'cause I can't see
I hope we'll hear the sound eventually

[Verse 2]
I felt their claws obstruct and refuse refugees in the new Rome
Lock our voices in the oven like S-Sylvia at home
My eyes are on the world
Yeah, my hands anxious to feel something real
True colors tend to glisten and then reveal

[Interlude]
Where's the love?
Mmm
And why are we so far from love?

[Verse 3]
Chased by badges, duckin' lights, push the dagger when it's right
Martial law, inshallah, mi casa es tuya
Ghosting like I'm Daniel Johnston and I'm locked up in the basement
Where Satan lies in satin tweets and realigns his face lift
The criminals are laughing with their empty, toothless faces
We've melted all our gold to recommence our idol worship
We all pretend one day we'll be the greatest of the Gatsbys
Growling mouths with rabies and loyal like Sid and Nancy

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey man, get away from me
You pretend you got control
Hey man, get away from me

[Chorus]
Never ask for any favors, there's nothing I want from you
I've been praying for an answer to keep me from fallin' through
Yeah
Yeah, I'm waiting for the voice to speak 'cause I can't see
Oh, we'll hear the sound eventually, yeah
We'll hear the sound, we'll hear the sound eventually

[Verse 1]
Face me and embrace the pressure
We were made for another time
(When you need me, I'll be there)
(Say my name, yeah, I'm right here)
Let's drift away in fits of pleasure
You're a beautiful design
(Say you need me, face your fears)
(Say my name, yeah, I'm right here)

Yeah, just floating with my hands up
All street and gold dust
Caught up in the flux
Tell me when I've crossed the line
(When you need me, I'll be there)
(Say my name and I'll appear)
Yeah, I'm livin' in another thought
Trap's caught me tripping out
Love, please open up
I've been gone too long
(When you need me, I'll appear)
(Say my name, yeah, I'm right here)

[Chorus]
I'll fall into you
When you give in to me
You can be my only when we lose control
I won't hold back
Are you living the truth of chasing the dream?
Just killed the lone wolf
Yeah, giving up control

[Post-Chorus]
I've been looking for an answer
I've been running out of time
I've been looking for an answer
I've been waiting for a sign
Just say that you'll be there

[Verse 2]
Free your self-reflective color
Yeah, I know how to make you shine
(When you need me, I'll be there)
(Say my name, yeah, I'm right here)
Face your fate, you pretty faker
Lay back and catch the light
(Say you need me, face your fears)
(Say my name, yeah, I'm right here)
Yeah, I'm just floating with my hands up
All street and gold dust
Love, please open up
Yeah, I've been gone too long
When I drift away, it feels so wrong

[Chorus]
I'll fall into you
When you give in to me
You can be my only when we lose control
I won't hold back
Are you living the truth of chasing the dream?
Just killed the lone wolf
Yeah, giving up control

[Bridge]
Just say that you'll be there
Just say that you'll be there

[Outro]
I'll fall into you
Just give in to me
This'll be my only
I'll fall into you
Just give in to me
Yeah, I'm giving up control now
Giving up control
This'll be my only
Yeah, I'm giving up control

[Verse 1]
If age is a trap
I wonder why I hold back (Mistakes)
A mistake to make me laugh
Only time can answer that

[Chorus 1]
Saól Aláin
Beautiful is your life
Saól Aláin
I want to live in your love forever

[Verse 2]
I'm done, I'm giving up control
So hold on, never let me go
I know we're not invincible
So I want to live, live for something more

[Chorus 2]
Saól Aláin
Beautiful is your life
Soak it in
I want to live in your love forever

[Bridge]
And I won't be afraid, it's true we'll never know
When the night will come and take us home
And people change, we fade from youth
And evolve into eternal life
Don't slip away, well, I'm begging you
To let me sing with angels

[Outro]
Wake the sleeping from their dreaming
We all want more, we all want more
Saints will sing and hearts are beating
Saying we all want more, we all want more

[Verse]
I had been hopeful
That I would have the time to get closer to you
If you wanted me to
Mmm, I feel like crying
The more I think about the times that I tried
To say the things I was thinking of
At the time

[Chorus]
I only threw this party for you
Only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I was hopin' you would come through
I was hopin' you would come through, it's true, it's true
Only threw this party for you
I only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I'm about to party on you
Watch me, watch me party on you, yeah

[Verse 1]
1000 pink balloons
DJ with your favorite tunes
Birthday cake in August
But you were born 19th of June
Champagne pourin' in your mouth
Called your friends from out of town
Got the party bag with the purple pills
And I'm waiting for you by the window, yeah
Called your digits, but the phone kept ringin'
Wish I knew what you were thinking, na-na-na
1000 pink balloons
Dancin' on to your favorite tunes
Hope you walk in the party
'Cause I threw the party just for you like woah

[Chorus]
I only threw this party for you
Only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I was hopin' you would come through
I was hopin' you would come through, it's true, it's true
Only threw this party for you
I only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I'm about to party on you
Watch me, watch me party on you, yeah

[Verse 2]
You could watch me pull up on your body
Like it's summer, take my clothes off
In the water, splash around and get you blessed like holy water
I don't know what you were waiting for
You know that I've been waiting for you
I only threw this party for you
If you saw my tears, would you touch me?
Kiss me on the mouth, say you love me?
Leave a message, tell me you're sorry?
Hit me right back, hit me right back
Why you treating me like someone that you never loved?

[Chorus]
I only threw this party for you
Only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I was hopin' you would come through
I was hopin' you would come through, it's true, it's true
Only threw this party for you
I only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I'm about to party on you
Watch me, watch me party on you, yeah
I only threw this party for you
Only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I was hopin' you would come through
I was hopin' you would come through, it's true, it's true
Only threw this party for you
I only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I'm about to party on you
Watch me, watch me party on you, yeah

Nervous energy (Party on you, party on you, party on)
My heart rate rises higher, higher up (Party on you, party on you, party on)
I wish you'd get here, kiss my face (Party on you, party on you, party on)
Instead, you're somewhere far away (Party on you, party on you, party on)
My nervous energy will stay (Party on you, party on you, party on)

And I'm not right about everything
But I got a strong feeling she'll take me a charge if we run into the narcs
And I'm seeing all your emotions, came a long way from roaches
Unwrap the birds, get to rolling

In the back of the cab, this ho sucking dick from the front seat
This her aftermath, like I got 50 Cent on me (straight stacks)

Bust on that hoe, I'm just markin'

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
You know I'm back, like I never left (I never left)
Another sprint, another step (Another step)
Another day, another breath (Another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I die
Want a piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people, or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus, searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (Oh yes it is)
You know that we been going in (Been going in)
Since we hopped out that DeLorean (DeLorean, yeah we win)
En garde, things are just things, they don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smiling down on me like "Woo, that boy got bars"
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, won't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came, woo

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag, they don't understand
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag, they don't understand
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Verse 1]
Won’t you fly high with me
There’s so much more for us to see
Won’t you guide me up on the down
Just take me there

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Won’t you fly high with me (oh high with me)
I know you’re somewhere out there waiting
And birds don't know why they fly high, but I know you do
Just take me there, Just take me there

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think I should settle down or that we could just be friends
"Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
But then we, we kissed all night as his mission beach party
And I said

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
I'm packing bags and making stacks
Like a good old time American
And I'm just tryna show my mom and dad
There's such thing as a real good man
Cause when he talks to me, you see the man that you're talking about as I see
When he puts my hand over his bathing suit
Says to me...

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Refrain]
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

[Bridge]
And then he asked me, he said
"Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother."

[Chorus 2]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Doesn't matter if your daddy gets pissed
It's you and me

[Refrain]
Baby, for life (if you go with me)
For life (see the world with me)
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

[Outro]
Russia, UK, Paris
I'm Italian, Asian combined
Africa, India, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
I'm Latin-American
I don't speak German, but I try
Someday in Jakarta
I'm American, I'm gypsy
I'm Bangkok, Australian, Malaysia
Sweden, Finland, Norway
Be my home just for the day
I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
Hey...

[Verse 1]
Put some lipstick on
Perfume your neck and slip your high heels on
Rinse and curl your hair
Plump up your lips and get a dress to wear
I'm the one who's been coming 'round
Looking to love in you
You're the medicine, I need to heal
The way you make me feel

[Chorus]
I'm gon' be MANiCURED
You wanna be man cured
Ma-ma-ma-MANiCURE
She wanna be man cured
I'm gon' be MANiCURED
You wanna be man cured
Ma-ma-ma-MANiCURE
She wanna be man cured

[Post-Chorus]
Heal me, cause I'm addicted to love (Manicure)
Save me, cause I'm addicted to love (Manicure)

[Verse 2]
Touch me in the dark
Put your hands all over my body parts
Throw me on the bed
Squeeze, tease me, please me, that's what I said!
'Cause I'm the chick who's been coming 'round
Lovin' you
You're the medicine
I need to heal the way, the way, the way you make me feel

Left him in the trunk on highway 10
Put the knife under the hood
If you find it, send it straight to Hollywood

[Verse 1]
I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa?
Behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?

[Verse 2]
Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?

[Breakdown]
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa?
Behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa?
Behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?

Just let me breathe for a minute
(You already know it's me, man)
Just let me breathe

[Verse 1]
It's too hot, drop the top off the wagon (Uh)
Lay back, blowing fire like dragon (Poof!)
Man, I'm flying past Saturn (Uh)
Fuck outta here like I ain't that savage
(No, no, no, no)
Two Uzis and a rifle (Woo!)
It's like I'm at the studio with Michael (Michael Jackson)
You can hear me dancing on the beat (Uh)
Bam Bam 'bout to put a mansion on the beach, uh
Hundred Latins in your lobby (What?)
That's what happens when you fuck around with Body (Body)
Uh, and I put that on my mami (It's on my mami)
I would never give my heart to a thotty (Never!)
If I could just make a dance that goes with this song (Uh)
Then I'ma be on (So on)
Basic bitches gon' dance to it (Everywhere)
Basic bitches everywhere gon' dance to it (Everywhere)

[Chorus]
Just let me breathe for a minute
Just let me breathe for a minute, uh
Just let me breathe for a minute
White Range Rover, blowin' trees all in it
Just let me breathe for a minute
Just let me breathe for a minute, man

White Range Rover, blowin' trees all in it

[Bridge]
You got a fat ass, baby, shake that shit
Shake that shit

[Verse 2]
I got two shows, I'm about to pitch another
Throwing alley oops to my brothers (Curry!)
We all shine, nobody victims (No)
Armani sweatsuit pimping (Uh)
Black Pippens (Uh)
I swag different (Uhh)
That's why the money in the bag different (Different)
Come up short, you'll have your motherfuckin' fam missing (Gone)
I lay on beaches and swerve in whips (Uh)
You ain't servin' shit, you just an urban myth (Woo!)
Every day get fleek (Fleek)
Riding around Queens on a jetski, it's me (You know it's me!)
Everyday get high (High)

Honey bouncin' up and down (Down)

Just let me breathe for a minute
White Range Rover, blowin' trees all in it
I got i got i got
Motivation realization in my DNA
I got
Devotion and emotion in my DNA
Eyes open wide
Yeah we only want the prize
Standing ovation and celebration for our DNA

[Verse 1]
You know it's so hard
I never freeze, sleeves rolled back like Walmart
Had bigger steez, I put in work get better shirts with better sleeves
Hit roll back like reverse when I'm putting in work for cheddar cheese
Now I'm pushin' my worth
I'm a hustler covered in letter Gs and they looking to search for something they'll never see
I invented the set, a digital pet the way I be touching keys
Pushing work like I'm pushin' the worth of having a job
Like six an hour or ninety a key, a value of a nine to five is how you decide to thrive
Whether flipping powder or having to rob, like you was mixing flour or having it hard
Now it's ninety an hour when I'm trafficking, y'all, traveling dog
And even when I rap up in arms

[Hook]
From the bottom of my heart and the top of my lugs
From the roof of my mouth to the bottom of my tongue
From a pimp's penthouse to the bottom of the slums
From the bottom of my clip to the top of my gun
From the bottom of my heart and the top of my lugs
From the roof of my mouth to the bottom of my tongue
From a pimp's penthouse to the bottom of the slums
From the bottom of my clip to the top of my gun

[Verse 2]
You see I win y'all
Where I am, where I been y'all
Can't really relate like in-laws
Where money is money, money is menthol
But money don't mean nothin', money has been y'all
See I been where its been rats like Ben who be singing like Sammy Davis
You know, ratting like Sammy when they in the bullpen
I could never do that
Not even if I was Tommy Davidson
But I feel like Sosa, I be running base and swinging like Sammy with different {?]
Hurley with the same dime, I be cuttin' base
This a lot to pour in, this is for the slicker hustlers
The quicker picker-upers
I could never spill the beans, Uncle Same never seen a dime
You could never fill the jeans, the seams
I got Big Punishers in-seams

[Hook]
From the bottom of my heart and the top of my lugs
From the roof of my mouth to the bottom of my tongue
From a pimp's penthouse to the bottom of the slums
From the bottom of my clip to the top of my gun
From the bottom of my heart and the top of my lugs
From the roof of my mouth to the bottom of my tongue
From a pimp's penthouse to the bottom of the slums
From the bottom of my clip to the top of my gun

[Verse 3]
It's the remarkable, marketable marvel
The Afro-American martial over this track of marvels
You aught to call martial arts enthusiast
Uzi is tucked in clothing articles
You see us marching through, me and my partners, my marksman, my arsenal
Starting arson with a fuse used for starting barbecues
I squeeze at your grill, heave at the wheel
'Cause niggas get gassed up and crash, it's bad
All of that adds up to ash
Niggas don't know the half of any other amount of math
It adds up to ask us to ask
What? I been knowin'
Fingernails and knuckles, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
If you don't know then you don't know what you talkin' 'bout
The hazards on, the caution's out, no walkin' out

[Hook]
From the bottom of my heart and the top of my lugs
From the roof of my mouth to the bottom of my tongue
From a pimp's penthouse to the bottom of the slums
From the bottom of my clip to the top of my gun
From the bottom of my heart and the top of my lugs
From the roof of my mouth to the bottom of my tongue
From a pimp's penthouse to the bottom of the slums
From the bottom of my clip to the top of my gun

You see, I was gonna start singin' right there but, you know

I decided that I wanted to bash him a little bit
‘Cause I don’t appreciate this non-love that I’m getting, you know?
I’m getting the non-love right now
Let’s do it like this…you know why

[Verse 1]
I keep your picture beside my bed (Alright)
And I still remember every little thing you said
(Alright—can I get an ‘alright’?) (Well, alright)
I always thought that maybe baby our love was right but guess it was wrong
(Can y’all say ‘All wrong’) (All wrong) (Yeah)
Always thought you'd be by my side papa baby but now you're gone
(And I'm not liking that, you know what I’m saying?)

[Chorus]
What I wanna know, baby
If what we had was good, then say
How come you don't call me anymore, baby
You know what I’m saying? Anymore
I’ma have to take this to the bridge I’m so mad

[Bridge]
Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me Papa
Oh, you gotta try it
I'll get down on my knees
Hoping you please please please please please please please
Ooh, ooh, won't you call me sometime, Papa

[Pre-Chorus]
You know, I don’t—I’m trying to understand
What’s taking this man so long, you know what I mean?
I mean, just pick up the phone and call me
Let me hear y’all say it, just say ‘Call me’ (Call me)
Come on, say ‘Call me’ (Call me)
Yeah, yeah, say ‘Call me’ (Call me)
Say ‘Call me’ (Call me)
Come on, say ‘Call me’ (Call me)

All I wanna know, baby, if what we had was good, then say
How come you don’t call me…
All I wanna know baby, if what we had was good, then say
How come you don’t call me
Oh, ho, I want you to call me, yeah

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
When I'm alone in my room, sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Tellin’ me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
It's like the second time around, a teenage love
I won't won't won't hurt you again
This time I'm holdin’ you down ‘til the end
We back bouncin’ again
Back seat of the jeep
Make you bounce like the 6-4 with Snoop and his friends, uh

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
Nothin’ really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Can't wait to get home
Baby, dial your number
Can your pick up the phone?
‘Cause I wanna holla
Daydreamin' ‘bout you
All day in school
Can't concentrate
Tryna keep my cool
‘Cause the lights are on outside
Wish there was somewhere to hide
I just don't want, I just don't want, to say goodbye

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
Nothin’ really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair

[Verse 3: Alicia Keys]
I love our secret meetings
On the 5th floor staircase
I wanna give you this letter
Of all the things I can't say
Want you to be
My first, my last, my ending and beginning (Yeah)
I'll write your name in my book
Your last name, my first, I'm your misses
‘Cause the lights are on outside
Wish there was somewhere to hide
I just don't want, I just don't want, to say goodbye
(LL: Damn, baby, got me feeling like I’m 17 or somethin’
Check it)

[Verse 4: LL Cool J]
Excuse me, Miss Keys, you’re on
Uh uh on; uh uh on
Back to basics before the Louis Vuitton
Hand in hand with matching sweatsuits on
I wrote you love letters to make you feel better
We'd spend the day together when you fightin’ with ya mom
Sippin’ on quarter waters, too broke for champagne
Sayin’ ‘Don't, don't, don't hurt me again’

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
Nothin’ really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair

[Outro: Alicia Keys]
A teenage love
Whoa whoa whoa
Don’t, don’t hurt me again
Don’t, don’t, don’t hurt me again

Teenage love
Whoa whoa whoa
Don’t hurt me again
Don’t, don’t hurt me again

[Slick Rick “Teenage Love” sample]
A teenage love
A teenage love
Don’t, don’t hurt me again
Don’t, don’t, don’t hurt me again
A teenage love
(Repeat until end)

(Swizz Beatz over sample)
You’re listening to the sounds of Alicia Keys
Y’all know who it is

I’m feeling nice right now

MSFTS
You are a g bro

Swaggy, swaggy, swaggy, swaggy

(Jaden Smith)
Oh, I ain’t never met a groupie
All I meet is ladies
And I like my privacy
So I got a Mercedes
Got these chokers shaking
Reminding me have hated
Sorry ’bout the security
It’s only for your safety
Cause baby I’ll be pimpin’
Holler if you see me
I’m probably in Miami
With my girl in a bikini
Text me if you need me
Touch me if you’re greedy
‘Cause you’ll probably be with Nicki
Walking while she says Waikiki
How we the illest and the youngest?
I really don’t know how we the killest and the dumbest
Swear it’s really early
But I don’t know where the sun is
And girl just take my hand
While I knock away these hundreds

Cause the crowd is going crazy
Money coming in bundles
Sorry that I couldn’t see you
It’s hard to see through my stunners
Dumb blondes be sayin’ I’m the funnest
All I’m hearing is claps
Though I don’t know where the drum is
Girl you like it
So just give me the mic
And I’ll get you so excited
Tell me what you want
I’ll go home and write it
To a old school beat
Baby take your lip and bite it
Oh jeez
Girl you got me and you gon’ make me work
Cause it’s usually a hobby
And no I really like you
And no it’s not your body
But trust me that’s a plus
Cause you’re hotter than wasabi
And I’m diggin’ on your kicks
Jokers talking ’bout karate
When I want a girl I just whip out the Maserati
No I can’t drive it
It’s only for the show
And I like to wear them diamonds
Watch them circus glow
Girl I’m on like a light bulb
Are you coming home from the night club?
‘Cause I tried to get in but I ain’t reached the height limit
That might be over but the night isn’t so I’m
So text me if you tryna chill with Wesley
Cause me and Mandy are chillin’
So don’t wear nothing dressy
Inside jokes are only funny when you get them
So (?) is the place to be (?) and I’m living in them dance halls
Alright J I think I got it from here
Justin Bieber
Headphones on yeah
Turn them up a little bit
(Justin Bieber)
Baby I’m the man
I felt that you knew that
I’m out in Japan
Just because I do that
So baby don’t you stop it
Baby can you drop it
I give you my chain
I style like Kentucky
Money on my mind
And you on my mind
Too much on my mind
Too big for my time
And everybody know that

Baby I’m the man
Can’t you understand
Keep you wondering
If I’m the wonderman
And you’re in wonderland

Hey my name is JB
I’m always rocking Vans
And if I was your boyfriend
I would love you till the end
I’d kiss your face in public
You can tell all of your friends
Baby girl you got that body
Would you like to go to France?
We can fly there on my jet babe
I can give you jetlag
I don’t do Jamaica baby
I can make you sweat babe
And if you ain’t in the crew
You’ll never get this
Posted at the crib with the MSFTS

[Intro 1]
Why are we letting things in the outside of our physical penetrate our soul, penetrate our neural wiring system, our cerebral cortex, okay? Wh-what really is a thought? Can you control when a thought arrives outside of the brain? Can you or can't you? Is free will a-a real thing or is it the philosophy of free will, see 'cause scrip-ahaha…

[Intro 2: Action Bronson]
Shit, sweep you off your feet
Like Ryu in the corner
Shit, man, haha
Smooth, man
I'm a fuckin' smooth mover, uh

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yo, if I didn't say it's me, you would probably think it's Sting
My fish go bling, what, this old thing?
I never switch up, my brother need a biscuit
Then I'm gripped up, hangin' off my shoulder, fuck the bullshit
November rain came the same day
My daughter taught me how to do the Nae Nae to Calle 13
Only compare me to Kevin Spacey
Or Rubén Blades, the blunt fat like two Kamalas
Do a world tour and scoop some dollars
Come home and hit the pool hall
I'm fishbowlin' new Impalas
Two Russian twins suck while I drive fast
It's me, man

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I'm the one that takes the wolf head, wears it on my own head
Wisdom from the old heads, you ain't gettin' no head
You ain't gettin' no bread, you ain't gettin' no shows
You ain't gettin' no dough, you ain't gettin' no hoes
Dawg, I hit the best of 'em, motherfuck the rest of 'em
Well, now I'm nestled in the Tesla eatin' pretzels, huh?
I should probably put a wetsuit on
I'll be right back…

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Young Renzel, line two
Young A.B., I got this you dig?
Yeah, yo (Maybach music)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I love my rude bitches, end up as new bitches
Skippin' school bitches, cookin' me food bitches
All my niggas down, we lookin' like Fu-Schnickens
Got a few tickets for bitches who truly digged us
College dormitories, fill 'em with smooth lyrics
Air Max 95s, grey sweats, true menace
Known as a Jonas, complex on the phoner
Simple individual, confident in the Lotus
Foreign ambitions, they go with my last wishes
As I open my eyes, surprised by seven figures
Baking soda required, decided drug dealin'
Residents is divided amongst the feds and children
Let him keep totin' drugs if he willin' to plead guilty
The star state witness, they'll hit you up for that selfie
Dro can only help me, Backwood and I'm healthy
I'm the label owner, I'm the only one can shelf me
Biggest (Maybach music) boss

[Outro]
Why are we letting things in the outside of our physical penetrate our soul, penetrate our neural wiring system, our cerebral cortex, okay? Wh-what really is a thought?

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1]
Darkness growing over me silently, it's creeping closer
Depths try to take hold of me, violently they seem to hold her
Snake, I try some wizardry, patiently you seem to bolster
Hate towards my imagery, vacantly you are the sorceress

[Chorus]
You are the sorceress, you are the sorceress, you are the sorceress
You are the sorceress, you are the sorceress, you are the sorceress
You are the sorceress, you are the sorceress, you are the sorceress
You are the sorceress, you are the sorcer—

[Verse 2]
Regain all my energy, trying to submit the holder
Momentary blasphemy, lying to your own is colder
Snake, I try some wizardry, runnin' old fools you seem to bolster
Hate towards my imagery, tell me the truth, you are the sorceress

[Chorus]
You are the sorceress, you are the sorceress, you are the sorceress
You are the sorceress, you are the sorceress, you are the sorceress
You are the sorceress, you are the sorceress, you are the sorceress
You are the sorceress, you are the sorcer—

[Verse 1]
Oh, I climbed a mountain
So I could see you coming
I dug a river to the sea
So you could sink into me
And I've got somewhere to go
But I won't go if you say you love me
But it's pretty obvious, you'll never love me

[Chorus]
If all we shared means nothing
Then all my life is empty

[Verse 2]
And when I see you outside
I have to run inside and hide
We used to turn coal into stone
And stone into gold
Oh, you didn't make it easy on me, baby

[Chorus]
If all we shared means nothing
Then all my life is empty

[Verse 3]
How do I say goodbye to
Something I love so much
This boy I cradled in my heart
Closer than anything else
I know the Dutch build dams
Oh, but this time I'm the guilty one

[Chorus]
If all we shared means nothing
Then all my life is empty

[Verse 1]
Lately I have no faith in myself
I have nothing offered but myself
And I wake up and it's lonely
And I think of you in that city
Or you're driving your car
And all the things we will do
When you are back again
It keeps me alive

[Chorus]
Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness
Your tenderness

[Verse 2]
This world is a cold one
I'll never understand
And I feel like I've been hiding
All my life
Sometimes I wish the sea would open up
And take me
But then I think of you
And how you're strong and you're delicate
And that makes it alright

[Chorus]
Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness
Your tenderness

[Bridge]
Oh if there's anyone
Who can mend my heart
It's got to be you
Oh if there's anyone
Who can mend my heart
Well it's got to be you
It's got to be you

[Chorus]
Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness is filling me with hope
Your tenderness
Your tenderness

[Chorus]
Oh, abysmal thoughts pushing me down to the ground
Oh, abysmal thoughts, please

[Verse 1]
Take me away from this dark place
All I wanted to do was love you
How could you do this to me?

[Chorus]
Oh, abysmal thoughts pushing me down to the ground
Oh, abysmal thoughts, please
Oh, beautiful thoughts where have you gone now
Oh, beautiful thoughts, please

[Verse 2]
Who have I become?
Is there no way to come back?
Oh, how could you do that to me?

[Chorus]
Oh, abysmal thoughts pushing me down to the ground
Oh, abysmal thoughts, please
Oh, beautiful thoughts where have you gone now
Oh, beautiful thoughts, please

[Outro]
Oh, abysmal, abysmal, abysmal
Oh, abysmal, abysmal, abysmal
Oh, abysmal, abysmal, abysmal
You’ve got Homer, Marge, Lisa and Bart
You got Maggie and Santa’s Little Helper to start
At Seven-Forty-Two, in a pink lil' house
Where everything’s coming up Milhouse, D’oh!

Grampa’s yelling at clouds
Willie’s really keeping busy keeping the grounds
Wiggum is commissioner, incompetent officer
And his son Ralph’s doing the un-possible

Springfielders, ask Quimby, there’s plenty
The black one is Carl, the white one is Lenny
So many seasons, you can’t seem to settle on
One, ish longer than Nahasapeemapetilon

Go to Kwik-E-Mart, learn what Apu earns
Hans Moleman was saying boo-urns
Like the Sea Captain, I’m going overboard
I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords

Like Brockman, gimme a Duff, man
I wanna take a Malk but I wanna get drunk, man
Barney’s the barfly at Moe’s who falls
Down while Mike Rotch gives phony calls
Or Otto Mann on “The Bus That Couldn’t Slow Down”
Need a dump truck of money, call Krusty the Clown
Steer clear of Nelson, he’ll laugh at you openly
It’s worse than hearing “Okilly Dokilly”

Flanders, store just for left handers
Bar in the basement, call in Rex Banner
Two sons called Todd and Rod
Whose mom Maude got t-shirt clocked to God

And she’s smoking, like Selma and Patty
Comic Book Guy’s kind of a fatty
Like Fat Tony and Uter with his chocolate
Looking for another? Did you check your pocket?

I’mma school you like Chalmers and Skinner
Serving up steamed hams for dinner
I’m on fire, well, that’s a fallacy
It’s really Aurora Borealis, see?

Burns got a bear and the bear is Bobo
Burns got goons, Crusher and Lowblow
Nothing beats stabbin’ folks with my hobo
Knife, bring back Sheriff Lobo!

Flow so sick, someone call a doctor!
Hibbert is with it but Nick is awful
Hi everybody, it’s Mr. McGreg
With a leg for an arm and an arm for a leg!
Smithers can’t enter the League of Extra-Horny Gentlemen
There’s Itchy, there’s Scratchy, and there’s Gentle Ben
They’re all animals, call the hound dogs
Which are back like Alf with the Alf Pogs

Arnie Pye, Artie Ziff and Disco Stu
Martin Prince, McBain, Kirk, LuAnn, Lou
Sideshow Bob, Troy McClure, Radioactive Man
Who had a Fallout Boy before the band

I got more lines than Bart with chalk
I spit more lines than Maggie’s talked
That’s 59 names with more to report, Bort
Until next time, “Eat my shorts!”

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Walkin' on the pavement, I chipped my pride and my teeth on
The girl I grew up with lives a couple houses down
The 8 Bus run the same, dogs howl when the train
Comes like my ex girl and next girl
Used to rock the S curl, wanted me a Nextel
But my mama copped a Razr, that's why I couldn't blame her
Flippin' through my past like I used to flip the phone
They kickin' out the blacks and all the houses getting clones
Friends used to do pills and only eat at Du's Grill
The food was pretty good but the times was better (Hmm)
These are the only days I missed, like the first shawty I kissed
I used to have dreams, now I dream

[Chorus: Aminé]
I look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood
Not satisfied, don't think I'll ever wanna stay for good
Packed up my bags, told Mom and Dad I've gotta go, go
And once I do, they'll finally see the inner me

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Everybody wanna be a star, everybody want a nice car
Everybody wanna live great, have a good damn time
Never trip with the law
The popo up in PO dirtier than BO
Bullies from the past act like I'm they fuckin' hero, uh
Livin' in LA for the weather, I FaceTime mom when I miss her
I got some homies that'll never leave my hometown
When I pull up to the corner, it smell like Miley Cyrus
I told 'em I don't smoke, they say "Boy, you fuckin' wildin'"
Innocent and young, reckless and we dumb
Our heart is like our earth and memories the sun

[Chorus: Aminé]
I look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood
Not satisfied, don't think I'll ever wanna stay for good
Packed up my bags, told Mom and Dad I've gotta go, go
And once I do, they'll finally see the inner me

[Verse 3: Aminé]
Mentality the same from my folks
Momma wanna see me happy, she don't wanna see me broke
I sip red wine, sauvignon, Rastafar, Babylon
My youth will never die if I live it like a prize (Hey!)
Who knows who I am, who knows who I are
Most people pretty sketch like a night at Echo Park
That's why I just keep it cool but my time is in a leisure
Everytime I'm home I catch emotion like a seizure

[Interlude: Recording]
(I cut the first night, we fuck around, I put my finger in her bootyhole 'cause you know you gotta test the water with hoes. A-a-and then...)

[Break: Aminé]
I slip and slide through the times in my youth
What's age? Too young to worry, too old to dream
What's age? Imagination to me, tragedy to some
What's age? I guess we'll find out when we're older. Touché

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Aminé]
I look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood
Not satisfied, don't think I'll ever wanna stay for good
Packed up my bags, told Mom and Dad I've gotta go, go
And once I do, they'll finally see the inner me

[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
Oh
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, ooh, oh yeah, ooh
Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah
Oo yeah-eah-eah-eah
Ohhhh hmm
Ohhhh hmm
Hmm
Hmm
(Turf)

[Verse 1]
Tryin' hard to recognise
Some pure motive inside of me
A creature that would horrify
Any child that I used to be
Oh, give no faith to show
Started to smile so I showed my teeth
No more than flesh and bone
Doin' so much just to watch someone bleed

[Chorus]
But I love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always

[Verse 2]
Tryin' hard, I nearly find
Innocence in spite of me
Oh, creature that would terrify
Any child left inside of me
Oh, that's a cold insight
Nothin' above us and nothin' below
Ahh, but you might be right
If there is no heaven and there is no soul

[Chorus]
I just love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always
Always, always, always
Oh, I love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always
Oh, I love the very blood of you
Leaks and squeeks you black and blue
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always

[Verse]
No longer focused on my broken ways
All I know's the only way is to get loaded paid
But funny how the changes turn page when the dough exchange
Got me trying to float away
Back to red Corolla days
Back when we used to have to scrape the door to blaze
Before the game showed us things we had the moments made
Before this shit got so insane
Before relationships caught growing pains
Back when you had to let 'em know your name
Before you realize that no two niggas gon' grow the same
Live it the way you like it, but never play with time
Feel it in the spot on my own cause I never stay in line
Things change but niggas get stuck in ways sometimes
Minutes turn to days sometimes, and love turns to hate sometimes
And to the time limits stay in the game
We just playing, we ain't creative
Found a way in this maze
Pray the vision out the way
I see the shit in my brain
While I'm gripping grain down memory lane
In my red Corolla

[Outro]
Switching lanes in my red Corolla
Switching lanes in my red Corolla
Switching lanes in my red Corolla

[Intro]
Yeah, put your motherfucking...
And smoke some motherfucking...
And get high as a bitch

[Verse 1]
Sometimes my friends be like my feelings, they come and go
Somebody spare some fucks for me to give cause I'm running low
Somebody put some fire to that bitch, yeah I wanna smoke
I'm tryna hit a lick, hit this ro, and then get a quote
You know what we coming for
Long money in short days
I break shit, they gon' pay me
Won't chill in their space, they can't cage me
I'm back to the point like playing safety
If you in the way, you just playing with safety
Ayy you should play your shit safer dog
Calculate your steps and really get what you saying off
I'm talking about some six figure plays and you ain't involved
I'm talking bout standin' in that deep water caught under the pressure you can't
The bubble guppy what the truth is
And you ain't budging when we running through them streets through kid
Misopportunist quit acting stupid
At the cup missing the game
Winning like Patrick Ewing, you blew it
I'm running through my path blasting through it
Fuck all the babble, let's get back to music
No other answer cause I have to do it
So when I creep up with my niggas five deep in the sled
With the gas still running slow
You know what we coming for...

[Break]
Money, cars, and clothes
Fine things I suppose
My right foot smashing the gas
Yeah, that's all that I know
Some niggas safe, some niggas sacrifice all for these hoes
Some niggas lose track 'fore they even go hard on this road

[Verse 2]
My niggas keep on saying they ain't heard from me
Cause I'm busy getting skrilla, I deserve to be
Man my pockets was in a state of emergency
Watch me working that clutch, I show urgency
So prolific exposing you bitches
We the game sewed in stitches
You ain't equipped and can't be coexisting
I'm making shit rattle like a broken engine
And watch them dollars multiply amongst my long division
Shit if I could have a dollar for every nigga who dirted my name
I'd probably quit rap and move somewhere deserted today
I prolly go on vacation for a permanent stay
But this work you finna get is all that's certain today
I get respect in abundance and my cash in advance
Keep that pattern in the rhythm, I done mastered this dance
So when we run down, spilling hella gas on your plans
Flicking lighters to the flame, glow
You know what we came for, bitch
(Bitch, bitch)

[Verse 1]
As long as she needs me
I know where I, I must be
I'll cling on steadfastly
As long as she needs me

As long as life is long
I'll love her, right or wrong
And, somehow, I'll be strong
As long as she needs me

[Chorus]
If you are lonely
Then you will know
When someone needs you
You love them so

[Verse 2]
I won't betray her trust
Though people say I must
I've got to stay true, just
As long as she needs me

[Chorus]
If you are lonely
Then you will know
When someone needs you
You love them so

[Verse 3]
I won't betray her trust
Though people say, say that I must
I've got to stay true, just
As long as she needs me

[Verse]
I'm feeling like the steal off the draft, I'm furious fast
Living a dash, I'm all gas, fill the ceiling with cash
We ain't smoking unless you fill it with hash
I'm a hit it, sit back and laugh at y'all gimicky trash
You ain't meant to be bad, boy, short energy last
Both feet on the pad, 112 and I'm finna speed past
But it's looking like it's slow motion
Hype Williams tight vivid bitch I'm so focused
And so hopeless if you ain't rolling with the great chosen
Flowing in sync like Justin Timberlake oh shit
Oh shit a nigga so sick
Ice the jumper right on time, they gon' have to call me Gold Wrist
Approach cleaner than soap dish
With a swag meaner than a broke bitch
Tryna get rich on green
Speaking game on some coach shit
Flag it if you try to intervene
Then it’s encroachment

[Hook]
Silly nigga, you ain't got it you late
If you ain't banging then stay out of the paint
I'm running through you, you know you not in the way
If you ain't banging then stay out of the paint
Motherfucker

[Interlude]
Hello
Hey hurry up and bring your bitch ass outside
Alright my nigga
I'm bout to pull up right now
Alright, fasho

[Verse 2]
I just did the most of what I got allowed
Ten phalanges down, I ride around my side of town
Since Bishop fell up off the roof the juice I got it now
Can't sideline it how I'm balling, niggas gotta foul
They gotta hack it boy, you never catch me out of bounds
I'm tapped into this wavelength, laying shit down like wave grease
Too savage for you niggas that cage me
Save the fake energy, I'm smoking on that sage tree for safety
Say count the digits, I'm sliding home silent
No compromising the side that I'm riding on silent
Hard body, my heart and my mind strong
Fuck alliance, get rich or die alone
In my veins ice cold
All net or I'm calling the bank
I still drill it with you all in the way
Sparking fear in the heart of the faint
If you ain't banging then get out of the paint

[Interlude 2]

[Intro]
Time goes by
Puffing on lye
Hoping that it keep me high
Got a nigga going

[Verse 1]
Ayo the limelight flicks when the time's right
This mission is mine, no lie I been spending time just getting my mind right
Remember wild nights 

[?] sick
Tryna get it cause my pockets wasn't hitting on shit
Like shit I'm thinking bout hitting these licks
Nah I'm thinking legit
We scheme for big body Beamers spending cream on my clique
See I just wanna be as clean as it gets
Let me breathe cause I did see street dreams when it drift
All I need's a shot, it's green if you feed the assist
My shit dope
Sit it on a triple beam, it's a brick
I can't miss
But life pull you in directions that be out of the way
And time til you ain't enough of me left after today
So I'm back to the scramble gas with a lackage of brake
Put like half in a stash where if anything happen I'm straight
What's the word bruh?
Shit another day, another verse
But when I stopped to roll the herb up
All I heard was...

[Hook]
Time goes by, puffing on lye
And I hope it keep a nigga high
Got a young nigga going
I'm going, I'm going out of my mind

[Verse 2]
My OG told me boy I know you feel ready but drive slow
Yeah I heard him but I hit that ground running like I ain't know
Back when the hopes for this life I was aspired was flying low
When we was still getting inspired by what niggas was dying for
I was starting to think this life wasn't meant for me
Picture me rolling, picture the days before I know I called my enemies homies
Back when my pockets was on Hector Zeroni
Before anxiety attacked up all these blessings before me
When my hardest problem was plotting on not to be hungry
When I was stressing about this money
When time would get invested like a dummy
Swore they told me to drive slow but instead I'ma ride
Getting high watching time fly
Ready to die, I'm living like I got nine lives
Time is limited, careful when I divide mines
Yeah, I tend to keep my hours, seconds, and minutes kind of preserved up
So when I stop and roll this herb up
All I heard was...

[Hook]
Time goes by, puffing on lye
And I hope it keep a nigga high
Got a young nigga going
I'm going, I'm going out of my mind

[Outro Skit]

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
The weed got me thinking shit that I shouldn't think
I'm tryna see what's next, I won't fucking blink
Honestly maybe I could be overthinking
Feel like the world against me, I know when it's sink or swim
If I'm stuck on this island, baby you know I'm leaping off the deep end, deep end aye

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Fuck it, sleep when I'm dead
Keep low and believe this vision
We share this world but I need it, I guess we see it different
I'm taking all and giving none, I don't need permission
As far as foes don't feel we need to mention
We started pitching from the mound and made a mountain out the mole hill
With soul cause most niggas get on and mine be broke still
I don't feel, it's like I went numb
My future bright so I don't blind when trying to look in the sun
Or maybe its' the high fresh off the blunt
Feel like the one
Feel alive when you smellin' the smoke you die by the gun
Like fuck it cause you only live once
We been knocking at this door
I'm trying to see the ceiling familiar with living on the floor
To my niggas we with it, kill and get rich on one accord
On the phone with my uncle to remind what we did it for
We locked in, now the whole shit in a figure four
We gon' get whatever shit in store
Sorry for cussing

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
The weed got me thinking shit that I shouldn't think
I'm tryna see what's next, I won't fucking blink
Honestly maybe I could be overthinking
Feel like the world against me, I know when it's sink or swim
If I'm stuck on this island, baby you know I'm leaping off the deep end, deep end aye

[Verse 2: Styles P]
These the last days, even the wicked pray
Anticipate the high before I hit the J
Talking to the sky, hoping it talk back
I done drove through hell, ready to walk back
You stunting on broke niggas, get off that
I'm the lone wolf from the lost pack
The weed got me thinking what I shouldn't think
Like the world move fast and I shouldn't blink
But I wouldn't light the weed if it wasn't dank
Cause then it would be dirt to me
I got homies with hammers under they shirt for me
Wouldn't let 'em put in the work for me
Merk niggas by myself that's getting merked for me
I'm just tryna see a cloud cause
I think bud was around bloods
You said it was family, you around love if not
Get a rat in your mans and get 'em round gloves, deuce

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
The weed got me thinking shit that I shouldn't think
I'm tryna see what's next, I won't fucking blink
Honestly maybe I could be overthinking
Feel like the world against me, I know when it's sink or swim
If I'm stuck on this island, baby you know I'm leaping off the deep end, deep end aye

[Verse 1]
When you cuss me out, you don't mean that shit
I keep her looking good, my bitch clean as shit
Baby girl, I love you, I mean that shit
From the bottom of my heart, see me bleeding tears
You the type to take my charge, show up at my case
When she drive my car, she see the stars in the Wraith
She be out of line but she know her place
In the morning look at her face 'cause I don't fuck with makeup
And you know I love you
No matter, I'm right here waiting for you
It ain't 'bout the money, it ain't about the fame
It ain't 'bout the chase and it ain't about the games
You play hard to get
Baby, I just need you like you need me
Falling head over heels for you is easy
Ooh, I love your name, I hope you feel the same

[Pre-Chorus]
She said she wanna chill, well come over later (yeah)
Don't worry about us, send the driver to come get you, baby
No, you don't wanna be lonely, do me a favor (yeah)
When we making love, you better put it all on me, on me

[Chorus]
Put it on me every single time (on me)
That pussy mine, yeah (you better put it all on me)
Put it on me every single time (on me)
That pussy mine (you better put it all on me)

[Verse 2]
Look at my neck, cashin' the check
She fly out to see me, hop on the jet
Now she on the west, yeah, that's my baby
Pussy makin' me crazy, yeah, the pussy the best
I love the way that she moan
And when she get excited when I go down low
And I just might dive in, that pussy is flowing
And I ain't scared to drown in it if the water is yours

[Pre-Chorus]
She said she wanna chill, well come over later (yeah)
Don't worry about us, send the driver to come get you, baby
No, you don't wanna be lonely, do me a favor (yeah)
When we making love, you better put it all on me, on me

[Chorus]
Put it on me every single time (on me)
That pussy mine, yeah (you better put it all on me)
Put it on me every single time (on me)
That pussy mine (you better put it all on me)

[Pre-Chorus]
She said she wanna chill, well come over later (yeah)
Don't worry about us, send the driver to come get you, baby
No, you don't wanna be lonely, do me a favor (yeah)
When we making love, you better put it all on me, on me

[Chorus]
Put it on me every single time (on me)
That pussy mine, yeah (you better put it all on me)
Put it on me every single time (on me)
That pussy mine (you better put it all on me)

[Chrous]
Money money money money money money uh
Money money rule the world, yeah
I guess I'm gettin' lost in the swing of things
Maybe I'm just caught up in the twirl
I mean all a nigga ever ever had to his name was a dollar and a dream
I'm rollin' all this weed young try'na figure what it means

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm cookin' up the plan, yeah it's right on the stove
Tryna cop a ticket, take my, take my life on the road
Steady rocking writing all the sights help me light in a low
Praying for flight, while tryna balance my highs and my lows
Sacrifice for the life that I chose
And when they envy light and push all they might to impose
I know it's tough but I just hope I stay tight with my bros
And even if I don't then I hope it was rightfully so
And never in spite of this dough
That's what inspire me though
I come alive when the road toughens
No cheat code but watch me beat it like it stole something
I can't be silent on my momma I'mma roll something
Over I ain't got a second to chill, I'mma road run it
Driving down the same old scenes niggas got left at
But I ain't pulling that same routine my g you can bet that
I'm tapped in a way but stay bracing for the set backs
I'm sticking in this game til I find me a place to rest at
The evil in my face I stay patience hit with a set back
Give me room, my ambition you can't suppress that
I feel this in my veins, they hoping this adrenaline drains
I'm unscathed, brush the dirt they tried to kick on my name
They only noticing it now but boy I been in my lane
From cracked in to panoramic yeah my vision has changed
Back when life was rap, riches, bad bitches and chains
Fast tracking minutes nowadays a different exchange
Flat broke used to have some sick shit on my brain
Like how I'm feeling all this hurt and still ain't getting no game?
But I just worked through my feelings
Never deserted my realness
Reimburse me for real like I deserve at least a million

[Refrain]
It's funny how they love you till its all go down right
The evil of the money make the world go round like
And even though it's ugly I get lost in a twirl
Cause money money money money rule the world
I said, how they love you till it all go down
Yeah the evil of the money make the world go round
And even though I know it's ugly I get lost in the twirl
Cause money money money money rule the world

[Chrous]
Any money money money money money money rule the world
Uh, I guess I'm getting lost in the swing of things
Maybe I'm just caught up in the twirl
Ay, all a nigga ever ever had was a dollar and a dream
Rolling up this weed

[Outro]
Know I've heard it said there's humor in misfortune
You know I wonder if they laugh when I am dead
Why am I fighting to live?
If I'm just living to fight
Why am I trying to see?
When there ain't nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give?
When no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live?
If I'm just living to die

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Life moving fast I'm hopin' this burn slow
This life movin' fast I'm hopin' this burn slow
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Keep your friends 'cause they'll turn on ya
Quick to let that ether slow burn on ya
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burner
Hit it fast or
It's not a quick fix its a slow burn
And it burn slower and slower and slower
As the world turn over and over and over

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Gettin' high the only way I know to feel closer to sober
Clear headed but the past lookin' over my shoulder
Slow burn on my heart, beatin' heavy
You can feel these bass rhythms in my sternum
You can see the drive less I'm blackin' out and swervin'
Sparkin' magic in the city would've thought my name was Earvin
Urban legend in that (skrrt)
Playin' low and drive slow
I handle my business so I think I deserve to get throwed
While you playin' with yo' time that's gon' take a big toe
You can't take it with you nigga no matter how your grip hold
Seat back, sit low it's the ride that I know
Tryna take whatever's mine I feel obliged when I smoke
The street I'm on could teach a lesson to a slow learner
Need my couple seconds to breath hope it's a slow burner
Burn slow, burn slow uh

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Keep your friends 'cause they'll turn on ya
Quick to let that ether slow burn on ya
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burner
Hit it fast or
It's not a quick fix its a slow burn

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Slow money get that all I know money
Why you acting scared money that don't make no money
Pouring out more than I make what more can they take from me
Slow burnin' to the face please get all that fake from me
Ya'll still in the same place duckin' and dodgin'
Quarterback to play until the day I run outta options
I chose my own faith from the day I broke outta college
I'm runnin' outta friends but I'm runnin' right up on knowledge
A coward dies a hunnid but this real is everlastin'
Only time is of the essence, as we speedin' through this path
Got these numbers on my mind, don't need my fingers for this math
Know that good in life is forever but as long as it lasts hope its a slow burner

[Verse 1]
Beautiful idiot
Why am I in love with you?
Stupid joke did you in
Here we go again
And if your nose was bleeding I would tell you
It's a stupid party anyway
You'll always be stupid
So I'll always be there

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to lose you
I just want to kiss you

[Chorus]
I promise you
I'll fight for your life
All through the night
I promise you
I'll fight for your life
Through the end of time
I promise you
I'll fight for your life

[Verse 2]
We barely made it out alive
And now we're on a train tonight
A different city, a different life
Will it ever feel right?
Oh, why am I complaining?
'Cause this feels so right

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to lose you
I just want to kiss you

[Chorus]
I promise you
I'll fight for your life
All through the night
I promise you
I'll fight for your life
Through the end of time
I promise you
I'll fight for your life

[Outro]
I promise you
I'll fight for your life
All through the night
I promise you
I'll fight for your life
Through the end of time
I promise you
I'll fight for your life

[Verse 1: King Chip]
Hi-Tek what up, uh, I'm always gnarly
I'm always tardy when I'm at parties
Don't need no 'Rari, bag yo' bitch in parking lot at Hardee's
I tax Carl and his junior and shit on them rumors
Of course you pay me but baby you should have paid me sooner
I'm tryna cave in your adam's apple and power slap you
I'm tryna invade them pockets after I power nap you
For all them times I heard sorry sir unfortunately
I'm tryna make sure you leave here disproportionately
I'm just tryna have a good time makin' shit last
I got some headphones on while I'm kickin' yo' ass
Bobbin' my head while I'm bobbin' and weavin'
I'm from Cleveland
Every evenin' we don't count on survivin' the evenin'
I'm might just crash on house party and leave you scorn
Drive a truck through your living room honkin' the horn
I got a chip on my shoulder only King Chip ain't over
Long as that pussy got no odor, I'm fuckin' shit over

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
I rob ironically, constantly contradicting everything you just thought of me
Look, you never catch my pattern bruh I move methodically
And fuck your feelings I ain't issuin' no apologies nah
I'm just tryna get grands like yo' mom's pop
Nonstop, gotta roll dimes gotchu on child lock
I'm all ya'll big homie
This smoke ain't fadin' at all
Nigga ya'll still know me
Try me I'ma switch to villain on 'em
Mick Foley no friends I'm on my lonely
Put the kush in the stogie
It's only business before me
Don't try to different approach me
Keep the business appropriate
How I spit that I get high, as the physics bestow me
You never hear of a slow me
Any problem I ball my way out that bitch like I'm Kobe
If you really want the business then show me
Triple double digits shit like I'm Brodie
I'm just tryna chill bitch quit chit chat- only, ah
I'm just tryna have a good time makin' shit last
I got some headphones on while I'm smokin' this grass
I'm in my zone and I ain't tryna hear words from a hater
If you ain't got nothin' to say then bitch just save it for later
Ain't take no pay cut
I ain't got time to be fuckin' around with you less deal type niggas
Bob the Builder head ass, it's over for that
Just tryna chill witchu

[Interlude: Domo Genesis]
Yeah
I'm just tryna chill
I'm just tryin'
I'm just tryin'
I got too many problems just layin' on my conscience
They say they understand but all I hear is nonsense
They say it can't be nothin' I think they baller blockin'
I say with human super patience all I know is profit
I know enough to know to focus on what's on the line
Takin' 

[?] complacency and payin' time
I make my lighter line, come check my vital signs
Show me some vital signs this little light of mine
I keep the fire high glowin'
'Cause I'm already known
Yeah I'm already

[Verse 1]
I didn't need another push towards the edge
But you did it with a casual stance
My constitution, my confidence
They left me when you did
And now I'm asking

[Pre-Chorus]
Who are you?
Who are you?

[Chorus]
I look in the mirror (Who are you?)
When the sun goes down
I ask myself (Who are you?)
Who are you now?
I look in the mirror (Who are you?)
When the sun goes down
I ask myself (Who are you?)
Who are you now?
I look in the mirror (Who are you?)
When the sun goes down
I ask myself (Who are you?)
Who are you now?

[Verse 2]
I'm not the human that I could have been
Instead I gave my heart to a breathing machine
Where there's no heartbeat and I'm freezing
And you don't care
(You just leave)

[Chorus]
I look in the mirror (Who are you?)
When the sun goes down
I ask myself (Who are you?)
Who are you now?
I look in the mirror (Who are you?)
When the sun goes down
I ask myself (Who are you?)
Who are you now?
I look in the mirror (Who are you?)
When the sun goes down
I ask myself (Who are you?)
Who are you now?

[Bridge]
I've been here before
A room without a door
A room without a door
I've been here before
A room without a door
A room without a door
I've been here before (Who are you?)
A room without a door
A room without a door
I've been here before (Who are you?)
A room without a door
A room without a door

[Chorus]
I look in the mirror (Who are you?)
When the sun goes down
I ask myself (Who are you?)
Who are you now?
I look in the mirror (Who are you?)
When the sun goes down
I ask myself (Who are you?)
Who are you now?

[Outro]
(Who are you?)
(Who are you now?) I look in the mirror
(Who are you?)
(Who are you now?)
(Who are you?)
(Who are you now?) I look in the mirror
(Who are you?)
(Who are you now?)
(Who are you?)
(Who are you now?) I look in the mirror
(Who are you?)
(Who are you now?)
(Who are you?)
(Who are you now?) I look in the mirror
(Who are you?)
(Who are you now?)

[Chorus]
I'm under the ice
My whole life
If you see me gently smiling baby
You should know I'm just trying not to cry
Under the ice
My whole life
If you see me gently smiling baby
You should know I'm just trying not to cry

[Verse 1]
I see you skating by
You look strong, you look full of life
I gather strength then change my mind
My heart goes dark
Then I fall behind

[Chorus]
I'm under the ice
My whole life
If you see me gently smiling baby
You should know I'm just trying not to cry
Under the ice
My whole life
If you see me gently smiling baby
You should know I'm just trying not to cry

[Verse 2]
We all get a chance at joy
Did mine come and go?
Every morning I quit smoking
Every night I'm bumming a light

[Chorus]
I'm under the ice
My whole life
If you see me gently smiling baby
You should know I'm just trying not to cry
Under the ice

[Bridge]
How much longer do I have to wait
For you to come and burn a hole through my soul?
I want to skate on top with you
And it's cold and it's dark and I'm scared

[Chorus]
And I'm still under the ice
My whole life
If you see me gently smiling baby
You should know I'm just trying not to cry

[Verse 1]
I woke up with your dress on
We had too much fun last night
It's the first time in a very long time
That a beautiful thought comes to mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I put a blanket over my face
I put a blanket over my face

[Chorus]
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face

[Verse 2]
Six dollars and cheap vodka
Was that all it took to unlock
Ten years of secrets
Ten years of secrets

Ten years of secrets
Ten years of secrets
Ten years of secrets
Ten years of secrets

[Verse 3]
When I was 15 years old
I would dream of someone who looked like you
Ten years of secrets
And smelled like you
Ten years of secrets
And talked like you
Ten years of secrets

[Pre-Chorus]
I put a blanket over my face
I put a blanket over my face

[Chorus]
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face

[Bridge]
Ten years of secrets
Ten years  of secrets
Ten years of secrets
Ten years  of secrets
Ten years of secrets
Ten years  of secrets

[Pre-Chorus]
I put a blanket over my face
I put a blanket over my face

[Chorus]
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face

I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face

[Verse 1]
I pulled all the carpet in my room
I lay down on the concrete cause I used to know you
Know you
Know you
Push down on my chest so I can't breathe
I ask for your hands and you gave me everything
Everything
Everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You were kind and I was cruel
Now I'm lost
Feel stupid too

[Chorus]
I'm asking are you fucked?
Cause I'm feeling fucked yeah
Are you feeling fucked?
Are you feeling fucked yeah?

[Verse 2]
I built a machine and it turned on me
I asked you to be what you shouldn't be

[Pre-Chorus]
You were kind and I was cruel
Now I'm lost
Feel stupid too

[Chorus]
I'm asking are you fucked?
Cause I'm feeling fucked yeah
Are you feeling fucked?
Are you feeling fucked yeah?

[Pre-Chorus]
You were kind and I was cruel
Now I'm lost
Feel stupid too

[Chorus]
I'm asking are you fucked?
Cause I'm feeling fucked yeah
Are you feeling fucked?
Are you feeling fucked yeah?

[Pre-Chorus]
You were kind and I was cruel
Now I'm lost
Feel stupid too

[Chorus]
I'm asking are you fucked?
Cause I'm feeling fucked yeah
Are you feeling fucked?
Are you feeling fucked yeah?

[Chorus]
Rich kids, you make me sick kids
A bunch of dickheads
Rich kids, you don't give two shits
You make me slit wrists

[Verse 1]
I found a boy with a rusty car
He smokes a regional cigarette
Factory working
Factory looking
Factory kissing
Factory doing
Lost my keys in a parking lot
Stumbled on the boy with a bad haircut
Factory working
Factory looking
Factory kissing
Factory doing

[Chorus]
Rich kids, you make me sick kids
A bunch of dickheads
Rich kids, you don't give two shits
You make me slit wrists

[Verse 2]
Catch him with a truck tire under each arm
The same arms hugging me through the night
Factory working
Factory looking
Factory kissing
Factory doing
I like to drink orange juice then give him the glass
He happily washes it then kicks my ass
Factory working
Factory looking
Factory kissing
Factory doing

[Bridge]
When I see him smile every once in a while
Every once in a while
His father will never know him
And his mother thinks she loves him
The rich kids say he's nothing
But they've got nothing on him
They've got nothing on him
They've got nothing on him

[Chorus]
Rich kids, you make me sick kids
A bunch of dickheads
Rich kids, you don't give two shits
You make me slit wrists

Watch lookin' like a glow up, when I throw up
East side Bouldercrest Road where I growed up (huh?)
Hold up, lil' homie, tone it down
‘Cause the jewelry that you rockin’ is for kids, I’m a grown up (huh?)
Sat courtside right next to the owner
Lookin' so good, make his wife pick her phone up (Wop)
Big gold boulders in my Rollie
Look like Fred Flintstone when he pick a stone up (ring!)
If everybody got a watch like that
Then why would I want that watch? I’m a loner
Damn near had the temper tantrum
'Cause he got that car ‘fore I got it, now I really don’t wanna
You never seen a nigga glow up like this
Not a nigga that was trappin’ on a corner (it's Gucci!) (Yeah)

Niggas hate me, women wanna date me
‘Cause I got on all these VVS pieces (yah)
In that great thing
2018 Rolls Royce truck, no reason (huh)
Water on my time piece wetter than a Fiji
Parked in front of the St. Regis (burr)
Artists wanna meet me
Ballin’ like an athlete, but I ball all four seasons (ooh)
Diamonds dancing just like Breezy (damn)
Take it easy Breezy, go easy (ha)
Big stones in all my pieces (ha)
Gucci Mane stunt like Meechie (Meechie)
Jewelry so cold, I’m sneezin’ (achoo!)
Pull up South Beach, no ceiling

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tone that shit down, ooh, yeah
You ain't never ball like this

Tell me what it do 'cause I’m tryna get to know you
Champagne, takin’ shots, won’t have a hangover (Yeah)

Tell me who can ball like this

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna come off too strong
But this a hit and run I take my damage and move on
I feel like in my heart I'm unconditioned to do wrong
Feel like I'm connected like
Feel like I'm just seeing the same visions when I'm -
Painkillers in my bed at night
Looking at the signs hope I read them right
Praying for the chance to get ahead of life
Praying for these flaws that we all got
I ain't finna never let the bar drop
Push against the pressure no bar spot
Always been a rock in a hard spot
In my archive filled with all drive
Like I'm on a car lot
Promise I'mma ball out
No back yard let my dawgs out
Bet I work hard and never call out
Hoping that my engine never stall out
Cause I'm heading home on the far route

[Break]
And I'ma take the long way home, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Weighing up the world ain't shit, nah
Triple check the way I press it up like, uh
Dancing to the tune of my own drum
Wait until I get mines right
I'mma never look back
Go some dumb nowadays I chuck up the deuce
I don't fuck up the juice
Ain't tryna shake hands, showing fake love
I done played it safe for too long
I done saved face for too long
I done lived racism and now they playing cases too strong
I just can't take it too long
But I'mma jump back to the basics
I'mma stay strapped for the hatred
I'mma cut back with a passion of paces
Just another young black trapped in the matrix
But they can't capture or cage us
I'm way too anxious to fly
Swerving through lanes in my ride
View the whole world through my all seeing eyes
Through the graces of God
And I got faith on my side
I'mma stay blazed for the ride

[Outro]
Imma take the long way home
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Long way, long way, long way yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Long way, long way yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Long way long home

[Intro]
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough

[Verse 1]
No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one

[Chorus]
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough

[Verse 2]
What am I supposed to do
Sit around and wait for you
Well I can't do that
And there's no turning back
I need time to move on
I need a love to feel strong
Cause I've got the time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you

[Breakdown]
Do you believe in life after love, after love, after love
Do you believe in life after love, after love, after love
Do you believe in life after love, after love, after love
Do you believe in life after love, after love, after love
Do you believe in life after love, after love, after love, after love
Do you believe in life after love, after love, after love, after love
Do you believe in life after love, after love, after love, after love
Do you believe in life after love, after love, after love, after love

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourself

[Verse 1]
I can't let go of control
I can't let go and not know
Don't know the way ahead of me
One day at a time is all I need
There was a time without trust
There was a time without love
But it took you to show me
That I could hand over the keys

[Chorus]
I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map, without a map, without a map

[Verse 2]
So let's take a walk and get lost
Let's take a chance on finding us
I wanna see the world with you
Every step feels so brand new
It's hard to jump with no net
But I've jumped and I got no regret
You're my co-pilot, yeah that’s right
Now I can just enjoy the ride

[Chorus]
I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
But we'll see more without a map (life is beautiful)
Without a map, without a map, without a map (life is beautiful, life is beautiful, life is beautiful)

[Bridge]
I know we're finally falling
Cause I was giving you half no more than
My hand's in the air while you're driving
This is living, this is living, this is living
Oh it's beautiful, beautiful
Being with you, being with you

[Chorus]
I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map, without a map, without a map (life is beautiful, life is beautiful, life is beautiful)
Without a map, without a map, without a map (life is beautiful, life is beautiful, life is beautiful)
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama she was swinging hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world, what does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way saying baby what you gonna
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest


California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true, too sad sad sad

Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true, too sad sad sad
I ain't seen anyone for days
I still have yet to leave the bed
It's impossible
Feeling safe with it now
I'm impossible
Getting used to it now

I've just got nothing left to say
I'm in no place to get it right
And I'm not dangerous now
The way I used to be once
I'm just too old for it now
At least that seems to be true

I have a penny for your thoughts
If you could keep them to yourself
About you slipping away
I feel you slipping away
Don't want to hear it all now
Of how I'm slipping away
I can't make you a promise
We're not professionals
But if you don't like what it feels like
And if you don't
Don't like where it's been

It could be over if you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
You can change your mind
You can change your mind
You couldn't make our wedding day
Too sick to travel
You fell between a friend
And a father

I owe you dinner, man
I owe you something
You talked to me
Like I was inside
We were just waking up
For a hard
Interrupt

I meant to get to you
On the turning
Things sneak up on me
Like a landslide comes

Been saving email trails
Kept together
I read them back sometimes
To remember
The time I wrote to you
From the island
Your quick replies
Made me high
I had fear in the room
So I stopped turning up
My hands kept pushing down
In my pockets
I’m bad with people things
But I should have tried more
Been watching images
From the station
Earth one from satellites
All streaming
Feels slow at seventeen thousand miles an hour
You could be anywhere
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen

You could be anywhere
On the black screen

[Verse 1]
Oh baby
Oh baby
You're having a bad dream
Here in my arms

[Verse 2]
Oh sugar
You came to me
Could all be a bad thing
Doing you harm
Oh oh oh

[Verse 3]
Oh lover
You run from me
We move like a bad scene
Shot in the dark

[Chorus 1]
Oh, but please
Please wake me
But my love lies patiently
Please baby, please
And my love life waits for me

[Verse 4]
Oh love
You came to me
You were having a bad time
There in your home

[Verse 5]
Oh sugar
Give in to me
You're just having a bad dream
Ringing alarms

[Chorus 2]
Oh, but please
Please shake me
But my love sits patiently
Please, baby, please
And my love plays wait and see

[Verse 6]
Oh, I'm on my knees
Yeah, I'm on my knees
I promise I'm clean
But my love life waits

[Bridge]
And you're already gone
Yeah, you're already gone
You're already home
And my love life stumbles on

[Outro]
Oh baby
Lean into me
There's always a side door
Into the dark
Into the dark

[James Murphy]
Your feet touch the floor
I just open the window and let the light in
The light burns your eyes
But it eases with each passing frame
Yeah your head like a block
Stuffed with unwritten letters to some
Far away friends
Oh you'd write on your hand to remember
If someone, if someone would just, pass you a pen

Make your way to the toilet
These morning ablutions are all part of the dance
And these doors all have locks on them
Like tinfoil hats, man
Made for resisting (other voices)
Time isn’t over, times aren't better
So it's letting you down
You keep dragging back to it
You keep going back to the well
Oh that shit’s a dictator
Time won't be messed with
Buddy, no no no
You can't be believed
And you cannot believe what you are told
You're still a baby now
You're still a baby now
You're still a baby with soft feet and everything
You're still a baby for better or worse
Or for an hour or so
Until it's (other voices)
Please, if you’re coming home
Take me to the side
I know that time changes
To runaway
From you

You’re still a pushover for passionate people
You're still a pushover for passionate people
And you’re just a baby now
You're just a baby now
With those soft hands and doe eyes
Resisting (other voices)

And you're still a pushover for passionate people
You're still a pushover for passionate people
You’re still a pushover for passionate people
You're still a
Tell 'em Nancy

[Nancy Whang]
This is what's happening and it's freaking you out
I've heard it, heard it
And it sounds like the nineties
Who can you trust
And who are your friends
Who is impossible
And who is the enemy
These are the halls that we're presently haunting
And these are the people we currently haunt
Push back the walls
Push back the calendar
We've got, we've got friends who are calling us home

[James Murphy]
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You should be uncomfortable
Fake like you mean it
I used to dance alone of my own volition
I used to wait all night for the rock transmissions
So where'd you go?
You led me far away
And let me go
Let me go

I used to see your hands in their weird positions
Used to like your hair when you'd watch musicians
You said we'd know
Yeah, we'd know
But that's all wrong
That's all gone

You made me throw up hands at my own traditions
And then you'd have a laugh at my inhibitions
Oh sure, we're talking tough
Yeah, we're talking tough
Yeah, we're talking tough
Put on Suburban Lawns
In prone positions
Here we go
You led me far away
And let me go
I'm never far away
Here we go
Yeah, we know
But that's all wrong
That's all wrong

I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
Now's your time to wake up

I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
Now's your time to wake up
Standing on the shore, facing east
I can't feel you

Standing on the shore, facing east
Your impermanence
You're taking water
Listing lazily out of view

I remember when we were friends
I remember calling you friend

Standing on the shore my ear aimed east
I can't hear you
I can't hear you anymore
I can't hear you
I can't hear you anymore

I still remember
Laughing and fighting
I still remember
Standing on the shore, watching for you
You're painted into a corner
Whatever fits in your pockets; you'll get your due
Just like before
With all the others

You warned me about the cocaine
Then dove straight in
Yeah, you warned me about the cocaine
Then dove straight in

In hiding, where there's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
Standing on the shore, getting old
You left me here amid the vape clowns
I must admit: I miss the laughing
But not so much you

One step forward
One step forward
One step forward
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back

Standing on the floor, facing you
I can't see you, your impermanence
This place is empty
Empty of you

And if I see you, it's like nothing went wrong
Yeah, if we meet again tomorrow, just like nothing went wrong But there I go

Erasing our chances
Just by asking
"How do you sleep?"
One step forward
One step forward
One step forward
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
Everybody's singing the same song
It goes "tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight"
I never realized these artists thought so much about dying

But truth be told we all have the same end
Could make you cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
But I'm telling you
This is the best news you're getting all week

Oh sure it's ruling the airwaves
Or what remains of the airwaves
And we're frankly thankful for the market psychology you're hipping us to

And all the hits are saying the same thing
There's only tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
And life is finite
But shit, it feels like forever
It feels like forever

Oh is everybody feeling the same stuff?
We're all wild
Except for you
And you know who you are
This is a love song
And you're getting older
I promise you this; you're getting older
And there's improvements unless
You're such a winner
That the future's a nightmare
And there's nothing I can do
Nothing anyone can do about this

And oh, I'm offering you a chance to get even
But oh, you know very well the dialect of negation
Sure enemies haunt you with spit and derision
But friends are the ones who can put you in an exile
But that's not right

And you're too sharp to be used
Or you're too shocked from being used
By these bullying children of the fabulous
Raffling off limited edition shoes

And what's it you do again?
Oh I'm a reminder
The hobbled veteran of the disk shop inquisition
Set to parry the cocksure of mem-stick filth
With my own late era middle-aged ramblings
Every lover favors the same things
It's all "touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me tonight"
We maybe realize what it is we need before we die
And luck is always better than skill at things
We're flying blind
Oh good gracious
I sound like my mom

But out of the little rooms and onto the streets
You've lost your internet and we've lost our memory
We had a paper trail that led to our secrets
But embarrassing pictures have now all been deleted
By versions of selves that we thought were the best ones
'Til versions of versions of others repeating
Come laughing at everything we thought was important
While still making mistakes that you thought you had learned from
And reasonable people know better than you
That cost in the long run but they don't know the short game
And terrible people know better than you
The use and abuse of the wants of dear listener
So you will be badgered and taunted and told that
You're missing a party that you'll never get over
You hate the idea that you're wasting your youth
That you stood in the background oh until you got older
But that's all lies
That's all lies

It's gonna have to be good enough, I can't do this anymore, my brain won't work
I caught your eye when I stepped outside with my emotional haircut
It seems that I've been misunderstood

The look of grave concern in your eyes and your surprise at my emotional haircut
It’s better to me
It's much better than it used to be

'Cause I got eyes going every which way
I got eyes all over the place
And I got tired of the hotel room and the TV

You wish that you’d been told about whatever has led to this emotional haircut
It ain't a disease
It's just hard to do whatever you please

And treat yourself tonight
To a little love life

Now we all get ideas and then shut-shut 'em down with an emotional haircut
No I ain't Dionysian, man
Oh no buddy, no need to be concerned with this emotional haircut
It's part of the game
Yeah man, it's just part of the feat

So let's raise a glass to the bodies in here
Oh, raise a glass to the bodies in here
We’re gonna toast till the bodies all soak up the bass

Man, you’re in love with the bodies in here and your emotional haircut
Oh just get on the street
Fuck the shuffle, put your shit on repeat

You've got numbers on your phone of the dead that you can’t delete
And you got life-affirming moments in your past that you can't repeat
Yeah you've numbers on your phone of your dead that you cannot delete
And you're losing all your skin in the middle when you just can’t sleep
I know you can't calm down

Out of your windows and onto the streets
Out of your windows
Out of it
Out to

Do you know what it does?
It puts me up on my feet
It puts me on the floor
But can you hear the heartbeat
Can you hear the heartbeat
Just listen to the heartbeat
But can you hear the heartbeat
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen; it's calming down

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
(Everything that's perfect, damn)
You're everything that's perfect, damn

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I know who you are
I know the type of niggas you let in your car
I know I'm not special babe
I know everything you hate
The freckles on your fuckin' face
Makes the most sense to me

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
(Everything that's perfect, damn)
You're everything that's perfect, damn

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Two, O, O, seven
Two, O, O, eight
Two, O, O, nine
You, I can't relate
You, a different place
You, a different space
You, I hesitate, for you I never wait
Never wait

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
(Everything that's perfect, damn)
You're everything that's perfect, damn
Lyrics from snippet:

[Chorus]
So take a look around and, you can settle down no

[?] blowing in the wind
So take a look around and, you can settle down no

[?] blowing in the wind
Blowing in the wind
Blowing in the wind

[Verse 2]
We can figure out tomorrow
So you've be wasting your time
It ain't fixing your sorrow
Did you say 

[?] your light
How do our lives become lighter ?
How do our eyes become brighter ?
You gotta believe in something higher
I never thought of forgiveness
Why do we really want to gain ?
Why won't we learn to be selfless ?
Wake away from all the shame

[Chorus]
So take a look around and, you can settle down no

[?] blowing in the wind
So take a look around and, you can settle down no

[?] blowing in the wind
Blowing in the wind
Blowing in the wind
Blowing in the wind
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Said you're amazing
She said you must be crazy
I said, "No, I'm not, well, a little maybe"
And I don't talk a lot
But when I do, I mean it
And I swear I know an angel
Baby when I see you
I know I do have issues
But ain't got to do with you
Not gonna lie, girl, I miss you
No, it ain't superficial
We spent beautiful moments
And some beautiful dream
But ain't nothing more beautiful
Than you were next to me
And I got a couple things

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning

And you get what you want, always from me

Howisha, you need a... baby with me, uh
And I'm takin' my time, just wait, don't leave
I can't say "No" when you say "Please," I can't say "No"
You wanna drink like Bajan and dance like Trini, yeah
You want a supermodel pose like mi real friend Winnie (Like mi real friend)
Yeah, vacation is done but I'm not finished, no

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (Slow)
I'm gone on them once I get going (Gone on them, gone on them, gone on them)

[Chorus: Drake]
She tryna take it all off for me (Close)
Tryna stay real close to me

Oh, first night, holy night, five in the morning, yeah-yeah (Yeah)
And it feels like you're mine, signs of the times, oh, what a time
Playin' it right, playin' it perfect
Laughin' it off, but I know you're hurtin'
Signs of the times, I say all the time
Taking my time, just gets harder to find it
But you're playin' it right, you're playin' me perfect

[Chorus: Drake]
She tryna take it all off for me
Tryna stay real close to me
I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself, I need to take it

[Refrain: Drake]
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy

[Outro: Young Thug]
I bet I never disrespect you, darlin'
I bet you pardon me, darlin'

[Chorus]
Young, fresh and shameless, young, fresh and shameless
About to body slam the beat, Love Wrestlemania
Love miscellaneous, fuck instantaneous
I'm busting nuts in her mouth, young macadamia
Young, rich and famous, young rich and famous
Young Money but the money so fuckin' ancient
Buy wine, drink it, by God, amen
Can't forget to thank him, young, fresh and shameless

[Verse 1]
Back to it, waste no time
Black Uzi, Draco, 9
Back room smokin' bomb
Got to feel me, pour the five
Black mamba, Kobe Bryant
Snake eyes open wide
Rat poison, you know why
Hair trigger, no salon
Can't lose, in overtime, hit Miami for LeBron
Swam through whole Ocean Drive
Smoke a stick, porcupine
All these bitches want be mine
Yeah she lit I blow her mind
Look at how I make all these looking ass niggas roll they eyes
Go retarded on them, Tunechi
Openhearted on them, Tunechi
I'm the father, I wear the pants, I'm talking Corduroy or blue jeans
Smoking harder on a doobie, holy water running through me
Polariods are tryna shoot me
I am Nino, you a pookie

[Verse 2]
Young niggas famous, my young niggas go in
My OGs are no different, identical twins
1-7 amen, that's my set, amen
Can't forget to thank him
Fuck these hoes, I blame them
Young, fresh and shameless, young, fresh and shameless
Bout to body slam your bitch
Lord, Wrestlemania
Young, rich and famous, young, rich and famous
If you hating on me you can tongue kiss the anus
Bigger picture painting, fine art framing
Don't forget to hang it, fine wine drank it
Turn a trap house to the wine house, Amy
My God, amen
Don't forget to thank him
Don't try to play him, your whole squad be dead men
We pull up in the AM, toast, waffles, bacon
More fiyah blazin', the chopper sound Jamaican
I stay armed like a cowboy
Troy Aikman

[Verse 3]
That's a Polo blanket, she under it naked
I'm under influences, got me overthinking
Got me syrup drinkin', popping Percs to painers
Niggas talking about they gods, they just Kirk Franklins
And my dreams are so big, feel like the Earth's shrinking
I wake up and chase my dreams, catch 'em and detain 'em
Still the best rapper alive, still the steel is stainless
I feel like the Yankees, boy my hittas can’t miss

[Chorus]
Young, fresh and shameless, young, fresh and shameless
About to body slam your bitch
Lord, Wrestlemania
Love miscellaneous, we fuck instantaneous
I'm busting nuts in her mouth, young macadamia
Young, rich and famous, young rich and famous
Young Money but the money so fuckin' ancient
Buy wine, drink it, by God, amen
Can't forget to thank him, young, fresh and shameless

[Outro]
Young, fresh and shameless
Stevie, Mula, yeah
Got me syrup drinkin', popping Percs to painers
Niggas talking about they gods, they just Kirk Franklins
Oh
Your eyes tell a story, such a sad story
Of the things you feel inside
Of the things you cannot hide
My friend I see trouble in your eyes

There ain't no justice
In that picture that you're painting of me in your mind
Ain't no justice 'cause that face ain't mine
There ain't no justice

Build your walls
Craw into your holes
Put out your signs
Peep through your blinds
Call me, "your kind"
I don't mind
There ain't no justice
Why can't we live our lives and be friends?
In that picture that you're painting of me in your mind
Ain't no justice 'cause that face ain't mine
There ain't no justice
Close your eyes, I want you to take an imaginary trip with me
Tomorrow!

Listen to the sound of the children playing
Their young happy hearts laughing and saying
"I care not about the color of my friend,"
"I only know I'm having fun with him."
Black, white, yellow, green or blue
What does color really mean?
Yet it keeps you and I from seeing eye to eye
If nothing else let us learn from the kids
Once again, happiness

There ain't no justice when you don't trust us!
I don't know if I need this
But I want nothing else
Trouble can bring me down
He can't tell me how
I'm gonna get to you

I'm aware what is going on
What else is there to do
When you're head over heels
For something so surreal
You don't play by the rules

This is my first romance
I'm gonna love you like I told you I would
If you give me a chance
I'm gonna love you like I told you I would
If you give me a chance

Trouble made his way into this
Yeah he started what
He told me what not to do
He said don't mess with you
Or he'll never leave me
So I made a home in my heart
For trouble to stay
No matter how nice I can be
Well I asked trouble away
He turned his back on me

This is my first romance
I'm gonna love you like I told you I would
If you give me a chance
I'm gonna love you like I told you I would
If you give me a chance

I've let him stay with me for way too long
Now I'm trouble myself
But if you liked me then
And you're ready to give in
You're gonna love me now
You're gonna love me now
Yeah you're gonna love me now

[Verse]
I want to tell you to put your weapon down
But you might lock the door and shut me out
I guess your sadness was the kind that couldn't wait
It took more courage for you to live than just to get away

[Chorus]
I'm done with the pain
I've gone mad and I've been insane
I'm just gonna miss you
I'm just gonna miss you
I'm just gonna miss you

[Verse]
I know you missed your dad, I'd miss mine too
We all find different forms for something we lose
Just wish you'd stay around for one more year
So you could find what he's left behind for you here

[Chorus]
I'm done with the pain
I've gone mad and I've been insane
I'm just gonna miss you
I'm just gonna miss you
I'm just gonna miss you

[Verse]
If you see me and I'm still searching in the crowds
Just know that I'm looking for you even thought you're not around
It's times like these when no matter what they say
I tell my mind you're out there

[Outro]
I know I'll find you one day
I know I'll find you one day
I know I'll find you one day
I know I'll find you one day

[Verse 1]
You might meet a girl from a place you never heard
She knows you but you never met her
You're so well known
People know you from the songs you sing
You're a big-shot guy
Nobody will be as good as you

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody said this would be easy
Easy comes or harder goes

[Chorus]
Well, it's hard not to go on in this world
I bet you're the only one, that's for sure
Gonna make it no matter what for

[Verse 2]
So who do you find yourself looking at?
If you don't find something, you'll go back to where you were
You can look down, but you can't look up
'Cause the spot you're in makes learning tough
That's what you're for

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody said this would be easy
Easy comes or harder goes

[Chorus]
Well, it's hard not to go on in this world
I bet you're the only one, that's for sure
Gonna make it no matter what for

[Outro]
Come time
Come time
No one knows what's coming for you
Just might
Just might
Find something else to do
So hope that nothing goes wrong

Do people wonder why you chose to go?
Do you miss your home or anything back where you're from?
Do you try and tell them all the same thing?
You don't wanna leave 'cause it's all to see how far you've come

[Verse]
This ain't what I thought and I don't know what to think
I've lost my mind for the second time letting go of dreams

[Verse]
Feels like I've gone insane making sense of what I see
It just don't look like those picture books they read to me

[Chorus]
Run and tell my father
Run and tell my father
Run and tell him I'm giving up

[Verse]
It's a part of getting old and I'm halfway there
Just one more step and I'll regret how much I care

[Verse]
Maybe it's a sign that I'm no longer a kid
'Cause I have seen almost everything life has to give

[Chorus]
Run and tell my father
Run and tell my father
Run and tell him I'm giving up

[Verse]
Guess this is just some dream that I've been making up
I feel bad for me 'cause I thought I'd be deep in love

[Chorus]
Run and tell my father
Run and tell my father
Run and tell him I'm giving up

[Verse]
Did he make the right move?
What would a man do?
Yeah he held back
And I tried to fix that
I'm in no hurry
Oh but he does not worry
'Cause time is your friend
I'm losing him again

[Chorus]
I miss you, sweet lad
I miss you, sweet lad
Miss me too
Yeah I want you, sweet lad
I want you, sweet lad
Want me too

[Bridge]
Nothing could ever go wrong
When I leave I'll take you along
I miss you sweet lad
Do you miss me too?

[Verse]
When I am lonely
I wish for him only
I want his soft touch
When I miss him too much
He is on his way
To a better place
I'm stuck here behind
I've done nothing in my life

[Chorus]
I miss you, sweet lad
I miss you, sweet lad
Miss me too
Yeah I want you, sweet lad
I want you, sweet lad
Want me too

[Bridge]
Nothing could ever go wrong
When I leave I'll take you along
I miss you, sweet lad
Do you miss me too?

[Verse]
You knew what's right
So don't do me wrong
Don't do me wrong
No don't go

[Chorus]
I miss you, sweet lad
I miss you, sweet lad
Miss me too
I want you, sweet lad
I want you, sweet lad
Want me too

I miss you, sweet lad
I miss you, sweet lad
Miss me too
Yeah I want you, sweet lad
I want you, sweet lad
Want me too

[Verse]
Nothing could ever go wrong
When I leave I'll take you along
I miss you, sweet lad
Do you miss me too?
When you see something that you love a lot
Crash and burn into sand
You wanna pick it up
You wanna take it home
But you can't cuz it falls through your hands
Can you see sadness in the air?
Can you believe it's coming after me?

And when you see rain
Do you think of tears?
God is crying, someone told me
And my teardrops are about the same size
And each one tells it's own story
Can you see sadness in the air?
Can you believe it's coming after me?

I think I've been doing too much losing
I'm afraid what's going next
I hope that I live a life of the best

When you see a light shining through your glass
Do you feel hope?
Do you think it's a sign?
You watch it disappear below the grass
It was just the sun coming in through the blinds
Can you see sadness in the air?
Can you believe it's coming after me?
I think I've been doing too much losing
I'm afraid what's going next
I hope that I live a life of the best

And now you can see
What pain has brought to me
Brought to me

I think I've been doing too much losing
I am afraid what's going next
I hope that I live a life of the best
I hope that I live the life of the best

[Verse]
I get up in the evening
I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man I'm just tired and bored with myself
But hey there baby, I could use just a little help

[Chorus]
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun is for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[Verse]
Message keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I want to change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is

[Chorus]
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun is for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[Bridge]
You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, this laugh's on me

[Verse]
Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, gimme just one look

[Outro]
You can't start a fire
Sitting round crying over a broken heart
This gun is for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun is for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You're America's most wanted tonight
I'll do my 25 to life
If I can have you by my side

Cause, You're America's most wanted tonight
And I will shout it out loud
In front of this crowd, tonight

If I just had the chance to just cup on up
Just a life will do where I'll plead
If had the chance to just rock on up
They'll be no me without you
See I'm not the type to get romantic
But you're bringing it out of me
And I'm not the type to ever cuff my chick
But I'll make sure you don't leave

Leave your ba-be-be-be
Time to be my main lad-e
By the way the way you're wearing that dress drivin me cra-cra-ze
So what you say say say
Why don't you join me me
So we can dance the night away like it's your day
You're America's most wanted tonight
I'll do my 25 to life
If I can have you by my side

Cause, you're America's most wanted tonight
And I will shout it out loud
In front of this crowd tonight

Baby you took my breath away
When I look at you, it gets so hard to just breath
And the way you move makes me wanna attack you
Especially when you on me
Got the club surrounded by all this movement moves like the waves on the sea
Like the waves on a sea
Don't ever want you to leave

Leave your ba-be-be-be
Time to be my main lad-e
By the way the way you're wearing that dress drivin me cra-cra-ze
So what you say say say
Why don't you join me me
So we can dance the night away like it's your day

You're America's most wanted tonight
I'll do my 25 to life
If I can have you by my side
Cause, You're America's most wanted tonight
And I will shout it out loud
In front of this crowd tonight

Leave your ba-be-be-be
Time to be my main lad-e
By the way the way you're wearing that dress drivin me cra-cra-ze
So what you say say say
Why don't you join me me
So we can dance the night away like it's your day
So we can dance the night away like it's your day

You're America's most wanted tonight
I'll do my 25 to life
If I can have you by my side
You're America's most wanted tonight
I'll do my 25 to life
If I can have you by my side

Cause, You're America's most wanted tonight
And I will shout it out loud
In front of this crowd tonight
Trouble's already been with me
Growing up so young
I guess it's time
To put him aside
And make you mine

Ooh give me a chance
Ooh give me a chance
Ooh give me a chance
Ooh give me a chance

Ooh give me a chance
Ooh give me a chance
Ooh give me a chance
Ooh give me a chance
I wish
I wish I was back down south with my cousins
I got a few
There wasn't much to do around
You knew every face in town
Yes you do

Oh well I
I think you know by now
I love that place
I know it sounds a little crazy but maybe
That Lone Star State could be the perfect place for me

I buy a new pack of picks every day
Or guitar strings
They would break
They'd break for sure
Whatever it was I played something new
Every town we were in tune
Yes we were
Oh and I
I think you know by now
I love that place
I know it sounds a little crazy but maybe
That Lone Star State could be the perfect place for me

Run away
Run away
I could do it
Every day
Every day
But I knew it would not be
Good for me

Oh I
I think you know by now
I love that place
I know it sounds a little crazy but maybe
That Lone Star State could be the perfect place for
I
I think you know by now
I love that place
I know it sounds a little crazy but maybe
That Lone Star State could be the perfect place for me
I can name the people that I want to meet
But I'm afraid it'll change what I think
If I could meet someone new
I'd probably choose someone I don't know too much about

That way I don't lose my hope
Of anything I think I know

I
I got this picture in my mind
This perfect figure
And I might be wrong
I don't want to know
I don't let my mind roam

I may hear their name almost every day
I could hear the goods people say
I still won't let myself give in
I know all I need to
That's gonna be it
That way I don't lose my hope
Of anything I think I know

I
I got this picture in my mind
This perfect figure
And I might be wrong
I don't want to know
I don't let my mind roam

Hold on
How long
You lost me there
What are you saying?
The words I heard just made me scared
My mind's changing

I
I got this picture in my mind
Of this perfect figure
And I might be wrong
I don't want to know
I don't let my mind
I got this picture in my mind
Of this perfect figure
And I might be wrong
I don't want to know
I don't let my mind roam
Mama I'm not sure if you have caught on
But I want you to
I might like you more than yourself
I can't help
I just do
And everything you've got you deserve
And you're earned along the way
That woman who treats you well
I can tell by the look on your face
On your face

You look happy just the way you are
I think you know this
You play a big part
On who I want to be like
When it's my time to choose
I want to be like you

I may think of you a lot more than this girl is willing to admit
But my thoughts will always be the same
They don't change one bit
And the words that are scribbled in your skin
They've been a favorite of mine
I finally found someone I know I want to grow up like
Grow up like
You look happy just the way you are
I think you know this
You play a big part
On who I want to be like
When it's my time to choose
I want to be like you

Don't have to try
I'll be by your side
And if I'm not
I'll be on my way
You're in a really good place
So mama stay

You look happy just the way you are
I think you know this
You play a big part
On who I want to be like
When it's my time
You look happy just the way you are
I think you know this
You play a big part
On who I want to be like
When it's my time to choose
I want to be like you
I want to be like you

[Verse 1]
I got my sights set on you, and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were something special when you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 2]
I've got a way of knowing when something is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection when you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-woah-woah, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 3]
I got this crazy feeling deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the sign
That you can't wait to see me again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley."
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-woah-woah, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 1]
I'm smokin' while I'm runnin' on my treadmill
But I'm comin' up roses
Could it be that I fell for another loser?
I'm cryin' while I'm cummin'
Makin' love while I'm makin' good money
Sobbin' in my cup of coffee
'Cause I fell for another loser

[Pre-Chorus]
Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wastin' my time
While you're takin' what's mine with the things that you're doin'
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no comin' back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

[Chorus]
'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feeling so much right now)
Talkin' in my sleep again
(I'm makin' no sense at all)
Talkin' while I'm screamin'
(Got me feelin' so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

[Verse 2]
I'm smokin' while I'm runnin'
This town and you better believe it, honey
I'm laughin' as I'm taking no prisoners
And taking down names
I'm cryin' while I'm gunnin'
In the smoke they can hear me comin'
If you were me, and I was you
I'd get out of my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wastin' my time while you're takin' what's mine
Well, you know what you're doin'
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no comin' back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

[Chorus]
'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feeling so much right now)
Talkin' in my sleep again
(I'm makin' no sense at all)
Talkin' while I'm screamin'
(Got me feelin' so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

[Bridge]
Got me up in this place right now
Makin' no sense at all
Got me up in this place right now, against the wall
Got me feelin' so blue
Makin' no sense at all
Gotta leave right now

[Chorus]
'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feeling so much right now)
Talkin' in my sleep again
(I'm makin' no sense at all)
Talkin' while I'm screamin'
(Got me feelin' so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
It's never too late
To be who you wanna be
(Swimmin' in my safe)
To say what you wanna say
(Tattoo on my face), (Swimmin' in my safe)
(Tattoo on my face), (Swimmin' in my safe)
And it's never too late
To leave if you wanna leave (Better not)
Or to stay if you wanna stay
But, baby (Yeah)
I got a feelin' in my bones
(Tattoo on my face), (Swimmin' in my safe)
Can't get you out of my veins (Yeah, yeah)
You can't escape my affection (Yeah, yeah)
Wrap you up in my daisy chains (What? What? What? What?)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (What? What? Yeah?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer (Summer, what? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (Summer, what? What? What?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm (What? What? What? What? What?)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky & Playboi Carti]
Uh, her sophistication make you wanna quit the bitch you datin'
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playin'
Boo, let's get acquainted (What?)
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation (Yeah)
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it (What? Ooh)
But bang it like my fingers (Ooh, what?)
She pray to God I made it (What?)
But bankin' like my Franklins (Yeah)
My neighbors stopped the hatin' (Yeah)
What? (What? They been at it, check it out)
Huh? (We been out here, yeah)
Slide inside it (What?)
Diddy Boppin'  (What?)
Milly Rockin' (What? What?)
She just might become my lover for real (Yeah that's good; For real, for real)
I might fuck with her all summer for real (For real, for real)
They better not holla if I cuff her for real (For real, for real)
Niggas better run for cover for real
Goin' bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the wheel (For real, for real)
Truthfully, between you and me, I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (What? What? Yeah?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer (Summer, what? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (Summer, what? What? What?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm (What? What? What? What? What?)

[Verse 3: Lana Del Rey]
White lies and black beaches
Miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like makin' me crazy
Tell me have patience
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons
In makin' me crazy
But you've got your reasons
White lights and black beaches

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey & A$AP Rocky]
High tops in the summer (Top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer, babe (Top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer (Top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer (Babe)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (What? What? Yeah?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer (Summer, what? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (Summer, what? What? What?)
Be my undercover lover, babe (What? What? What? What? What?)

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
Don't be a bummer, babe
Ooh ohh, ooh ohh
Ooh ohh, ooh ohh

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
You're in the bar playin' guitar
I'm trying not to let the crowd next to me
It's so hard sometimes with a star
When you have to share him with everybody
You're in the club livin' it up
I'm trying not to let the crowd notice me
It's so sweet swingin' to the beat
When I know that you're doin' it all for me

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And every time you look up
I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' of

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Time after time, writing my lines
Havin' my baby there next to me
It's so sweet pourin' you a drink
And pretendin' that nothin' means anything
This is my life, you by my side
Key lime and perfume and festivals
Taking our dreams, turning them to things
It's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful?

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And every time we hook up
I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' of

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Front row, every show like a hype man
Sing along, word for word, watchin' my bae
Side stage, fans screamin' causin' migraines
Yamborghini-high, but she ain't on my grade
God dang, got a nigga actin' irate
My babe, my babe, stay on my brain
My babe, made me sing to a fire escape
City girl, but she grew up in the tri-state
She ain't got no time for no groupie love
We don't pay no minds to the thug with a-
Love girls, you and I, so who do we trust?
You and I 'til the day we die

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & A$AP Rocky]
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
(You are my babe)
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
Groupie love

[Verse 1]
Topanga is hot tonight, the city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
The rumblin' from distant shores sends me to sleep
But the facts of life can sometimes make it hard to dream

[Pre-Chorus]
Life rocked me like Mötley
Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me ultra softly
Like the heavy metal that you wear

[Chorus]
I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
How it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
I hoped that you'd come back again
And tell me everything's okay, ay, babe, yeah

[Verse 2]
Topanga's hot today, Manson's in the air
And all my friends have gone, 'cause they still feel him here
I want to leave, I'll probably stay another year
It's hard to leave when absolutely nothing's clear

[Pre-Chorus]
Life rocked me like Mötley
Bad beginnin' to my new year
Life rocked me ultra softly
Like the heavy metal that you hear

[Chorus]
I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
And how it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on the aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
I thought that you'd come back again
To tell me everything's okay, ay, babe, yeah

[Bridge]
(It's fucking hot, hot) Winter in the city
Somethin' 'bout this weather made these kids go crazy
(It's hot) Even for February
Somethin' 'bout this sun has made these kids get scary
Oh, writin' in blood on my walls and shit
Like, ah, oh my God
Jumpin' off from the walls into the docks and shit
Oh, ho ho ho, I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't sick of it
Baby (Baby), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)

[Chorus]
I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about marzipan
Taking all my medicine to take my thoughts away
I'm getting on that aeroplane, leavin' my old man again
I hope that I come back one day
To tell you that I really changed, baby

[Outro]
(It's hot, hot) Somethin' 'bout the city
Don't know what it is, it makes my head get crazy
Oh, makes me feel like I can change
Oh, ho ho ho, all of my evil ways and shit
Oh, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it

[Verse 1]
Finally
I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly
That will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts

[Pre-Chorus]
This is my commitment
My modern manifesto
I'm doin' it for all of us
Who never got the chance
For… and for… (Shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (Shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (Shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the dance

[Chorus]
Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)

[Verse 2]
Finally
Gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no more chasing rainbows
And hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (Touch, touch)
There's nothing to hold on to (Hold, hold)
The colors used to lure you in (Shut up, shut up)
And put you in a trance (Ah, ah, ah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)

[Verse 1]
Walking on the pavement I check my pride and my teeth on
The girl I grew up with lives a couple houses down
The 8 Bus run the same, dogs howl when the train
Comes like me ex girl and next girl
Used to rock the S curl
Wanted me a Nextel but my momma copped a Razr
That's why I couldn't blame her
Flipping through my past like I used to flip the phone
They kicking out the blacks and all the houses getting clones
Friends used to do pills and only eat at Deuce Grill
The food was pretty good but the times was better
These are the only days I missed
Like the first shawty I kissed
I used to have dreams now I dream

[Chorus]
I look around and I see nothing in my neighbourhood
Not satisfied don't think I ever wanna stay for good
Packed up my bags, told mom and dad I gotta go, go
And once I do they'll finally see the enemy

[Verse 2]
Everybody wanna be a star, everybody want a nice car
Everybody wanna live great, have a good damn time, never trip with the law
The popo up in PO, dirtier than VO
Police from the past act like I'm they fucking hero
Living in LA for the weather, I facetime mom when I miss her
I got some homies that'll never leave my home
When I pull up to the corner, it smell like Miley Cyrus
I told em' I don't smoke, they say "boy, you fucking wildin'"
Innocent and young, reckless and we dumb
Our heart is like our earth and memories the sun

[Chorus]
I look around and I see nothing in my neighbourhood
Not satisfied don't think I ever wanna stay for good
Packed up my bags, told mom and dad I gotta go, go
And once I do they'll finally see the enemy

[Verse 3]
Mentality the same from my folks
Momma wanna see me happy, she don't wanna see me broke
I said "bread wine, sauvignon, rastafari, babylon"
You can never die if I live it like a prize (hey!)
Who knows who I am, who knows who I are
Most people pretty sketch like a night at Echo Park
That's why I just keep it cool but my time is in a leisure
Everytime I'm home I catch emotion like a seizure

[Interlude]
I cut the first night, we fuck around, I put my finger in her bootyhole cause you know you gotta test the water with hoes. A-a-and then.. *laughing*
I slip and slide through the times in my youth
What's the age? Too young to worry, too old to dream
What's the age? Imagination to me, tragedy to some
What's the age? I guess we'll find out when we're older. Touché

[Chorus]
I look around and I see nothing in my neighbourhood
Not satisfied don't think I ever wanna stay for good
Packed up my bags, told mom and dad I gotta go, go
And once I do they'll finally see the enemy

[Outro]
Oh
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, ooh, oh yeah, ooh
Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah
Oo yeah-eah-eah-eah
Ohhhh hmm
Ohhhh hmm
Hmm
Hmm
Turf

[Verse 1]
I never came to the beach, or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore, under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same, and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do we even exist?
That's when I make the wish, to swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

[Outro - Repeated]
Ah-ah-ah
Next to you

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
The microphone molester, machete undresser
"Stupid-dope-fresh" type shit resurrector
Top gun, miramar, best-of-the-best-er
The leave-an-MC-peace-in-rest-er

Skill tester, the flex-the-gunner
The make-funner, the adversary make runner
Make summer cold with rhymes I spit
Kick gift to lifted delinquent wit

I be prophet, my rhyme—top it? Stop it
Fly like rocket when I rock it
Lock it down with this perverse verse
Every fucking curse, a burst of hurt

Move crowds; physical fitness rhymes
Coke heads couldn't do my lines
I'm decorated like Christmas pines
My battalion rocks
MC's become silhouettes of chalk

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Reading my eyes will say it in many ways
Losing my pride will save it in many days

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Hit the dirt, 'cause the words I spit
Will do more than just rip your shirt
I'll bitch slap your soul, contact the track control!
You're coming at me? You can't hack it, though!

So ridiculous, watching my crew get sick of this
Wickedness, pitching this
Lyrical viciousness to crews and cliques
Made of men and mistresses

This is my life, the twilight in the fight night
And trying to see nothing but the highlights
When I write, these eyes on horizons
Die for my song, cry rhymes in krylon

Fire on, move men telekinetically
Esoterically beat-speaking with clarity
Feel my verity, heroism of heresy
And sever every MC I see with severity!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Reading my eyes will say it in many ways
Losing my pride will save it in many days

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
Why not, what I came
Why not, what I came
Why not, what I came

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Why not give me what I came to deserve?
Why not give me what I came to believe?
Why not give me what I came to deserve?
Why not give me what I came to believe?
Why?

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Reading my eyes will say it in many ways
Losing my pride will save it in many days

[Verse 1]
Where'd the love go?
Where's the passion, oh?
Why's it feel like
I'm better off alone?
Say it's my fault
That we're broken

[Pre-Chorus]
You know the truth, babe
What should I do, babe?
I wanted you but I don't know what to do babe
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all

[Chorus]
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh
Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh
I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh
With you with you oh without you

[Verse 2]
Where did we go from here
Did we throw it all away
Guess the end is finally near
There's nothing left to say
You got me open, now we are broken
My heart is frozen since we haven't spoken

[Pre-Chorus]
You know the truth babe
What did I do babe
I wanted you but I just don't know what to do babe
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all (at all)

[Chorus]
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh
Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh
I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh
With you with you oh without you

[Verse 3]
When I wake up in the morning and you're not right there
Girl I'm wishing that I never put your flight back
If I sent you a text, girl would you write back?
If I left you a voicemail, yeah could you like that?
It's all good, it's all g
'Cause I got more time, just to figure out me
In the meantime, girls be around me
And I was so lost, until you found me
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you, you
I’m doing better without you, you, you

[Chorus]
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh (so much better)
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh (woah)
Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh (trippin on you, trippin on you, trippin on you)
I’m so much better without you, you, you, you oh (trippin on you, tripping on you)
With you with you oh without you

[Verse 1]
Hollow one
With inverted tongue
From whence does fulfillment come?
When I expel
From this mortal shell
Will I die for living numb?

[Chorus 1]
Am I vital
If my heart is idle?
Am I doomed?
Am I vital
If my heart is idle?
Am I doomed?

[Verse 2]
I feel you
But nobody else
Though you're someone I can't see
Yet you say nothing
Of the stoic suffering
That stirs lukewarm in me
If lovelessness is godlessness
Will you cast me to the wayside?
Well, I feel the peeling of half-painted ceilings
Reveal the covering of a blank sky

[Chorus 2]
Am I vital
If my heart is idle?
Am I doomed?
Cradle me
So I can see
If I'm doomed

[Chorus 2]
Am I vital
If my heart is idle?
Am I doomed?
Cradle me
So I can see
If I'm doomed

[Outro]
Am I vital
If my heart is idle?
Am I doomed?

[Intro]
Uh, uh

[Verse]
Give it till I can't give, I lend a hand if it's needed
But these stabs got me bleeding out my back kid
Uh, keep it on the fumble we could sack shit
Hat trick, we considered Mulligan's for that shit
The proof is in the pudding and the pamphlets
The sewer and the mattress
Stupid nigga you can get it, get it
Only thing certain was the taxes
Burn me when the journey end, clergymen turn me into ashes
I move surgically, with new sermons for the masses
We too purposed for the scraps
What the verdict read? It's that courtesy of shit circumstances
The earth is my turf, but the hearse like a magnet
I be outside in some handcuffs, might be outside in the dirt, uh
Gentrifiers got the turf getting hacked up
Late nights thinking 'bout who lied to me first
Graveyard energy, tied to the job based off principle
My inner jit grinning, but my face all twisted
It's the artist at work
Greyhound tickets and some haze on my missus
Know it make no sense, I keep my heart on my shirt
When the rainstorm vicious, spend the day blowing, drinking
Tryna harvest the hurt, but it make no difference

[Intro: Desiigner]

Hair drippin', deads on me
Hair swingin', sippin' meds on 'em

Sippin' lean, and I can't stop it
Go hard nigga, no title
Nobody in this buildin' fuck with me
Niggas, niggas, know I got it
Pull up, blast the heat
Talkin' like you 'bout it, 'bout it
I blast the heat, talkin' like Master P

[Intro]
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you

[Verse 1]
Get a little closer to me too
I get a little shy when we start to move
I get a little high when I'm tryna decide if it's London or China too
Forget about the plans that you got, baby
Kiss me like you can't have too many
The Earth is like 'round and 'round we go
When it's gon' stop, you never know

[Pre-Chorus]
So in the meantime, I'm living and I'm gonna love
Because you choose me, I'm walkin' cloud 9 above

[Chorus]
Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, 'cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got
Baby's in love

[Hook]
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you

[Verse 2]
Get a little excited from across the room
I just can't seem to keep my eyes off you
Smile at me, so I smile at you
Then you feel so loved, when I dance with you
Tonight the way that you're moving
Make me wanna lose it
Round and 'round we go
When it's gon' stop, you never know

[Pre-Chorus]
So in the meantime I'm living, and I'm gonna love
Because you choose me, I'm walkin' cloud 9 above

[Chorus]
Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, 'cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got
Baby's in love

[Hook]
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you
Something about that makes me wanna dance

Take a deep breath
'Cause I don't need you to stress, hey hey
Baby don't stress
Stress out over me

[Verse 1]
So when I rise up, baby don't shy up
Open your mind, don't knock it till you try it, darling
Show off, when you come closer
Don't waste no time, we need it every minute darling
Oh, believe in me
Guarantee you'll get my loyalty
How many times have you don't want me to leave?
Want me to leave, no

[Chorus]
You're the only girl that I see

Baby don't stress
Stress out over me

[Verse 2]
Woah-oh now
Let's take it slow
From the bottom to the top, till you're up sugar
So loud
No need to turn down
Let the echo from your voice hit the wall sugar
Every goal you set will achieve
Don't hesitate to follow my lead
How many times have you don't want me to leave
You won't want me to leave, no

[Chorus]
You're the only girl that I see (only girl I see)
I'm the only guy that you need (I'm the only guy that you need)
And there's a viable term in me
Send you a text (a text)
Don't flex (don't flex)
Take a deep breath (take a deep breath)
'Cause I don't need you to stress
I don't need you to stress out over me, hey hey
Stressing over me
Baby don't stress over me

(spoken)
In every job that must be done
There is an element of fun
You find the fun
And snap!
The job's a game!

(sung)
And every task you undertake
Becomes a piece of cake
A lark, a spree, It's very clear to see

[Chorus]
That a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
Medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way

[Verse 1]
A robin feathering his nest
Has very little time to rest
While gathering his bits of twine and twig
Though quite intent in his pursuit
He's got a merry tune to toot
He knows a song will move the job along

[Chorus]
And a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
Medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way

(spoken)
All right, boys!
Uh huh

[Verse 2]
(sung)
The honey bees that fetch the nectar
From the flowers to the comb
They never tire of buzzing to and fro
Yeah, 'cause they take a little nip
From every flower that they sip

And hence
(And hence)
They find
(They find)
Their task is not a grind

(spoken)
Can't ya'll play it any faster?

[BAND]
Sure, yeah!
One, two, three!

(sung)

[Chorus]

[KACEY MUSGRAVES]
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
Medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In the most delightful way

(spoken)
Pick it up, boys!

(sung)
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
Medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way

(spoken)
Even faster!
(sung)
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
Medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way
Oh, in a most delightful way!

Damn

Bad name

All my dollars getting counted and they in the bank
And my son is living straight

How to get this cake

Watching for them undercovers
Lost a lil' piece of my heart when I lost my older brother
Gotta take care of my mother
Gotta show these niggas that my father's son ain't the one to fuck with
Taking chances and loving it
All the niggas that I started with, that's the ones I'm running with
It's Taylor Gang, nigga, fuck a bitch
Shit is real

Motherfuckin' jet, drop the top on a Bent'
Pull up to the fuckin' club and I'm smackin' on your bitch (Oh-oh-oh)
Lil' mama gon' suck me up
Hell, mama, 'cause we your season (Oh-oh-oh)
Now I got shawty on my...
Yeah, I left her for no reason
Leon DeChino gon' fuck on your bitch
I just don't remember nothing when I wake
I just put forty-thousand on my wrist
I just be like I'm a man on a mission (Oh-oh-oh)
Got a rattlesnake, keep it hissin' (rattle)
And I hold it now with no reason (ayy)

[Bridge: Post Malone]
I got a tan line, I wear my fuckin' Rollie so much
Lil' bitch, you think you somethin', but I find you in the gutter
Kinda want it, bought it with the money, oh look
With your girl you don't fuck, I can tell you wanna fuck her

[Chorus: Kanye West]
A hunnid years from now we gon' all be dead, all be dead
All be dead, so tonight, bitch, I might as well get head
A hunnid years from now, we gon' all be dead, all be dead (Boom)
So tonight, I might as well get head

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
And you talkin' that shit for no reason
When you know you comin' home this evenin'
Why you wanna come and play with my emotions?
When you know you should be going through the motions
We don't got no time to waste, whoa-oa-oa
This is not the time or place, oh-oh-ohhh
This the shit that make you wanna wow (Wow, wow)
And I really think I'm on that king shit
Make you wanna bow down (Bow down)
Ooh, I'm feelin' like I lost it now
Got me runnin' like a faucet now
Tell 'em there's a new boss in town
Girl, I'm feelin' like I'm lost and found
'Cause I'm so up and down

[Refrain: Post Malone]
Count a hunnid bands, watch it swerve on the street (Oh-oh-oh)
Count a hunnid bands, will I know? No, not me

[Chorus: Kanye West]
A hunnid years from now we gon' all be dead, all be dead (Boom)
All be dead, so tonight, bitch, I might as well get head
A hunnid years from now we gon' all be dead, all be dead (Boom)
So tonight, I might as well get head

[DOOM]
Listerine green jars, sick cleans jalla be a emma
Thick queens, mamma mia robs jalapeno peppers
Click mean large, brick seen mirage is ours
Quick mean cause, strict deen Allah
Make your quota, check your clock shock taqwa
Concoct the potion, blue liner lotion, call it aqua
Tock you on watch, sure ahk, salaat two rak'at
Four to roll in extorter mode, loose spot too hot
Here you go ma, for you boo, that's coco mango
She let her hang go, her man said "yo no tango"
Bangles jangle, no gangs is tranquil
Blank grill, real shank steel, bankroll ankle
F to the N and R, two thiefs are bummin a car
But never had no beef so Alhamdulillah
Inshallah any duties, top grillers, no Mercedes sign
Bubble nuggets with the ruby, Cop Killer 89
On a line on the third like loop on
Word is a bond that's honored, don shukran... afwan
Ram the adhan
Livin sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad alayhi as-salaam

[Insight]
Marvelous orchestras summoned the forces of power that orbited us
Dune cloud smoked orifices, Sight endorses what is glorious
Relive the first feelin of euphoria, power is in all of us
Notoriety is notorious, words scatter prefer (????)
Bros mad with first data like a dagger, slice of minimal maestro
A little nice yo, well look at the price though
Smooth rules that ooze as few as complex chemistry
And bitch and use and fizz and use with rhythms of recipe
Lesser fuse the energy to increase equity
So cinematic thoughts create a beautiful entity, envelope telepathy
And freaks the format, chop your garbage into 4-track
Recorded more facts to a stack
Only pour the pure tour back later
Years ago I stopped checkin for anyone on a major
I smack a hater with a tractor trailer use a paper

[Intro]
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true?
I get a kick out of brew

[Verse]
There's only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me, do a number on a label
Eat up all they MC's and drink 'em under the table
"It's on me. Put it on my tab kid."
However you get there, foot it, cab it, iron horse it
You're leavin on your face, forfeit
Of course the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it
Told her tell him they stole it - he told her he lost it
She told him, "Get off it," and a bunch of other more shit
Gettin money, D's be gettin no new leads
It's like he eatin watermelon, spittin seed after seed
It's the bleed, give me some of what he's droopin off
Soon as he wake up, chokin like it was whoopin cough
They group been soft
First hour at the open bar and they're troopin off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him autograph her derriere, read
“Too Wide Load, this yard bird taste like fried toad turd
Love, Villain.” Take pride in code words
Crooked eye mold nerd geek with a cold heart
Probably still be speakin in rhymes as a old fart
Study how to eat to die, by the pizza guy
No he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye
And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel
The same way she feel him when he flow with nerves of steel
They call the super when they need some back... uhh... plumbing fixed
"How it's only one left? The pack come in six!
Whatever happened to two and three?"
A herb tried to slide with four and five and got caught
Like, "What you doing G?
Don't make him have to get cuttin like truancy
Matter fact, not for nothin, right now, you and me!"
Looser than a pair of Adidas
I hope you brought your spare tweeters
MC's sound like cheerleaders
Rappin and dancin like Redhead Kingpin
DOOM came do the thing again, no matter who be blingin'
He do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time is it like it's time for Tellie Tubbies
Few got it, even fewer can sell it
Take it from the man who wear a mask like a 'tarded helmet
He plot shows like robberies
In and out, one, two, three, no bodies, please
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
Mic the shotty: nobody move, nobody get hurt
Bring heat, like your boy done gone to war
He came in the door, and "Everybody on the floor!"
A whole string of jobs, like we on tour
Every night on the score, comin to your corner store

[Verse 1]
I'm hella posted in the Trump now
I think I've finally fell in love now
Her name is Tammy, she got hella bitches
She let me fuck 'em while my niggas film it
My place so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
She cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby
Man, I love my baby, man, I love my baby
Trust me, trust me, I love my baby
Man, I love my baby, man, I love my baby
Trust me, trust me, oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, yeah
Ooh, oh, yeah, ooh

[Verse 2]
I turn the Ritz into a poor house
It's like eviction number four now
Go 'head and ash it on the floor now
Girl, go 'head and show me how you go down
And I feel my whole body peakin'
And I'm fuckin' anybody with they legs wide
Got me higher than a nigga from the West Side
East coast nigga reppin' North Side, never waste a ho's time
Bitch, I'm on my own time, fuck a nigga co-sign
'Cause I get it better like proline, baby girl, I don't lie
Used to have no money for a crib
Now my room service bill cost your whole life
Nigga try to me step me, I go all-out military
I'm camo'd all-out like I'm in the military
Free my nigga Jack, wish he was out in February
Perfect time to come out for the album drop
But this shit a throwaway

[Chorus]
I got 'em sweatin' off a throwaway
Man, this shit is such a throwaway
This ain't that album shit, man
This just a throwaway

[Verse 3]
I don't seem to have you niggas 'round me
All I do is cut niggas from 'round me
And they know the reason why they got cut
You can lie to the press just to get a buzz
'Cause these niggas know that I do everything
Puppet master over heads, I'm pullin' strings
Nigga, I'm the reason everybody gettin' high
Singin' slow, rockin' camo tees and white hoes
But they can have it, I touch any lane
Man, it don't matter, kill it anyway
Arenas in the spring, I'm hella paid
That means hella face, hella mouth, hella brain
These bitches goin' hard, they losin' shame
I got 'em trainin' like they losin' weight
I'm in Miami, I fuck every day
I never slow the pace, this shit's a throwaway

[Chorus]
Mmm, I got 'em sweatin' off a throwaway (Yeah, mhm)
Man, this shit is such a throwaway, yeah, yeah
This ain't that album shit, man
This just a throwaway

[Intro: SZA]
Oh
Where do we go?

[Chorus: SZA]
Where do we go, from here, my dear?
Where do we go?
Where do we go, from here, my dear, my dear?
Where do we go, from here, my dear?
Where do we go?
Where do we go, from here, my dear, my dear?
Oh

[Verse 1: Manhattan & SZA]
I ain’t gon’ speed up
I stay feet beneath her
Complete sentences, had to squeeze than easier (Oh, ecstasy)
Piece of burn, ask for the class time capsule
Tell 'em little rascals, I'm a bad example
Who could have a child, talkin' like a wild orchid (My, my, my)
Easier to laugh, when it's hard for you to cry
Stars in her eyes, pausin' the time (Dear)
Where I'm lower than the flies
Lord, she abides
More similar to the chords in my rhymes
Every syllable, drowns out the noise in her mind (You)
She knows, I'll be gone by the time she awakes
It's worth every penny, for a night of good sleep
I wish we could dream, over Mike C's beats
How heinous can we get? Never mean to be seen (I)
My guide sign, post me a question, a conscience
Where do MC's go after we body them?

[Chorus: SZA]
Where do we-
Where do we go, from here, my dear? (Where do we go from here?)
Where do we go?
Where do we go (From here) from here, my dear, my dear?
Where do we go? From here, my dear (Where do we go from)
Where do we go?
Where do we go, from here, my dear, my dear (Oh, oh)
(I don't know) Where do we go?
Where do we go?
I don’t know where we go from here

[Verse 2: Manhattan & SZA]
Love smells of Napalm, early in the mornin'
Call me wreckless and irresponsible (Oh, oh, oh, yeah)
Call me collect, and I'll respond to you
Call what you saw, fall far from the Nebula
X marks the spot, if you spell it in algebra (Yeah)
Tell 'em I came here, barely up pastors
Tell 'em, I asked them to pray for the rappers
Love on the rocks, got bums on the blocks (Yeah)
Heartbroken over what could happen when you on top
It's a quick drop down from the sky, believe me
Limbs never heal too evenly, really (An' I)
We are heartbroken, we saw the promise land (I'm broken)
Kicked off the Charlie chain, we didn't have the token (I'm broken)
White boy, who would fight for us, inside the trenches (I'm, oh)
Bomb went off, I don't blame the invention
Blame myself, General should prevent shit
This is my entrance into redemption (It is, I, I)
Revenge is a bitch, colder than Tibet it is
Lemonade still, popular beverage (Oh)
It ain't gon' stop, 'cause we ain't gon' stop
'lot of coonies, got to us over the promenade (Yeah)
But, this is my wish and, it didn't come true
I'ma take 'em all back, even this one for you

[Chorus: SZA]
Where do we go, from here, my dear? (Where do we go from?)
Where do we go?
Where do we go (From here) from here, my dear, my dear
(Where do we go from?) Where do we go from here, my dear
Where do we go?
Where do we go, (Oh, oh) from here, my dear, my dear
(I don't know) Where do we go?
Where do we
I don’t know where we go from here

[Verse 1: Drake]
I got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon and I don't mind sharing
We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote "Take Care" but they push me to the point where I'm just not caring
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything's a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything, I'm watching y'all close

[Hook: Drake]
I got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon and I don't mind sharing

I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
I'm just more ready than...

[Verse 2: D’African]
You
Said you were done with me, fine with me I’m on the loose
Now I can do what I want, I can fuck who I choose
Not looking for love, that shit hurt, last time you left a bruise
Riding by myself blowing smoke in the wind while I cruise
Riding by myself, yeah
I’m better by myself, yeah
I feel like being alone
But when I’m by myself, yeah
You pop up in my head, yeah
That’s when you see the text pop up on your cell like
Come through, come through

[Hook: Drake]
I got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon and I don't mind sharing
We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote "Take Care" but they push me to the point where I'm just not caring
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
I'm just more ready than...

[Bridge: D’African]
You
Said you were done with me, fine with me I’m on the loose
Now I can do what I want, I can fuck who I choose
Not looking for love, that shit hurt, last time you left a bruise
Riding by myself, blowing smoke in the wind while I

[Verse 3: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm flickin' my wrist like I'm a fisher
Diamonds on my chest like a bishop
And these lines right here ain't no pickup
These lines right here gon' really, really make you fuck
These lines really gonna make you numb like Chuck
This time is your time
I need to know if you're down
'Cause if not, I know there's more around
There's always more

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah
I got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon and I don't mind sharing
We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote "Take Care" but they push me to the point where I'm just not caring
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays

Now I can do what I want, I can fuck who I choose
Not looking for love, that shit hurt, last time you left a bruise
Riding by myself, blowing smoke in the wind while I cruise

[Verse 1]
Like a phoenix, I will rise from the flame
Sleepy eyes on the ashes that remain
You used me up
Yeah, you thought I was the same girl
But I'm not the same girl
Living in your shamed world
Like a ghost, now you live inside my head
You're barely here, I don't remember why I bled for you
You got a whole lot of things that I don't need
You're about the troubles so just go ahead and grab me

[Pre-Chorus]
You can take me anywhere you want anywhere you need it
Baby, don't be shy
I like my guys to be a little handsy
Don't have to move to the bedroom
Yeah, we can stay on the floor
I'll show you something that you ain't ever seen before

[Chorus]
1,2,3 Get up on this!
Down for it, down, I'm down for it
Down for it, down, I'm down for it
I'm down for it, down, I'm down for it
I'm down for it, yeah, I'm down for it

[Verse 2]
Slow it down, so that we can just spend time
That magic you use is swimming in my mind
You wanna be a rebel boy, are you too soft?
Don't keep me waiting
I just wish you'd rip my clothes off

[Pre-Chorus]
You can take me anywhere you want anywhere you need it
Baby, don't be shy
I like my guys to be a little handsy
Don't have to move to the bedroom
Yeah, we can stay on the floor
I'll show you something that you ain't ever seen before

[Chorus]
1,2,3 Get up on this!
Down for it, down, I'm down for it
Down for it, down, I'm down for it
I'm down for it, down, I'm down for it
I'm down for it, yeah, I'm down for it

[Bridge]
Breathing slowly, leaning closely
Don't leave me lonely out here for so long
I've been waiting for the day when you would grab a hold...

[Pre-Chorus]
You can take me anywhere you want anywhere you need it
Baby, don't be shy
I like my guys to be a little handsy
Don't have to move to the bedroom
Yeah, we can stay on the floor

[Chorus]
Down for it, down, I'm down for it
Down for it, down, I'm down for it
I'm down for it, down, I'm down for it
I'm down for it, yeah, I'm down for it

[Verse 1]
I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
You'll never reach it
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost, with no direction
My faith is shaken

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I, I got to keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

[Chorus]
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna want to make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb
It's the climb

[Verse 2]
The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just got to keep going

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I, I got to be strong
Just keep pushing on

[Chorus]
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna want to make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb
It's the climb

[Chorus]
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna want to make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb
It's the climb

[Outro]
Keep on moving
Keep climbing
Keep the faith, baby
It's all about, it's all about the climb
Keep the faith, keep your faith

[Verse 1]
Belligerent ghouls
Run Manchester schools
Spineless swines
Cemented minds
Sir leads the troops
Jealous of youth
Same old suit since 1962
He does the military two-step
Down the nape of my neck

[Chorus 1]
I want to go home
I don't want to stay
Give up education
As a bad mistake

[Verse 2]
Mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
Knees you in the groin
Elbow in the face
Bruises bigger than dinner plates

[Chorus 2]
I want to go home
I don't want to stay

[Verse 3]
Belligerent ghouls
Run Manchester schools
Spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
Jealous of youth
Same old jokes since 1902
He does the military two-step
Down the nape of my neck

[Chorus 3]
I want to go home
I don't want to stay
Give up life
As a bad mistake

[Verse 4]
Please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
He grabs and devours
He kicks me in the showers
Kicks me in the showers
And he grabs and devours

[Chorus 2]
I want to go home
I don't want to stay

[Verse]
Ay, I'm in the muthafuckin house like
A baby with its mouth wide
I'mma break the ground wide open
Lay it down
I'm overlooking town, now I'm smoking
5-0 can send them hounds
I'm pitching off the mound, struck him out
Pissed 'cause I missed him
I'm so vindictive
If the check right, I'ma go the distance
You give me two dice, I'm rolling them shits
Your boy live two lifes at home with a spliff
I'm roasting it
Other half I spent homeless on the road with a spliff
So coast to my shit
Toast to my wits when I'm gone wit em
Trimming the hedge, cobra don't live in my yard
Close to the edge, no holster the blick in my palm
I'm watching my step and holding my head
For home where the hopelessness sit
All of them roaches when you open your fridge
It's in your bones, it's what show in your ribs
Only if you're strong you resist
I'm groping my pen-stroke to fit the globe in my lens
I owned up to shit I know that I did
I hope this motion bring me close to content
My head heavy, I be over this shit
Death-ready, letting go of my cliff
Hoe, you know it's the end

[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home anymore
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home anymore

[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
To tell you

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
To tell you

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Ending]
Hello?

[Verse 1]
In the desert, you came into my mind
Mother Nature, you gave me a lifetime
I thought twenty-nine was an easy one to get through
Just to summarize, I don't think we're done with all the issues
I don't think it's me, I don't think it's you, it's the universe
I can feel a change coming over us and it's gonna hurt

Oh, my God, it took a while
Oh, my God, it took too long for me to find out if
I really am for us or this

[Refrain]
I think you and I just weren't thinking right
It's so wild, everybody went and changed overnight
Overnight (Overnight)
Overnight

[Verse 2]
Left me all the pieces, she got me fallin' outta love
I been workin' weekends, I can't tell the difference if I'm up
I'm just a satellite, I been zonin' out
This music's way too loud
There's only really one reason I know what to feel
Is that I know this weight is more than real

So we might as well be fallin' while holdin' on
So we might as well be fallin' while holdin' on

[Outro]
I think you and I just weren't thinking right
It's so wild, everybody went and changed overnight
Overnight, overnight

[Verse 1]
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Verse 2]
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Bridge]
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know
Now I'm free

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Outro]
Ooh, never let you back
Let you back, let you back
Never gonna let you back
Let you back

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yo, who dat boy? Who him is?
Him that ni-gga, I swear
Stand out guy, him don't need no chair
Well, where the fuck him at? 'Cause nigga, I'm right here
I don't shop at the mall, all y'all just
Dumb mothafucka, I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF, bitch, gonna make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drips swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him
It's Young T

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga neck chill like that
You mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the air like that?
Nigga, who dem boys?

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Who dem is? Nigga, who dem is?
Who else step in this bitch this jig?
Who else your bitch say got a bick this big?
Who else came through with a wrist this flick?
Nigga, Guess my pants, do my dance
Spin around, bitch, you could kiss my ass
Never seen a nigga in this much Raf
Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the Number (N)ine
Nigga, never mind, was another time before Vince
Had the Gucci gold tips with the letterman
Nigga, dollar sign was my favorite number at the time
Fresh freshmen 'til they skipped my ass
Senior citizen, don't forget my pass
Been that nigga and you knew that there
Make the dick disappear, how she do that there?

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga's neck chill like that
You mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the-?

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Fuck the rap, I'm tryna own a planet
From my other fuckin' business ventures
These niggas these days
Actin' like some bitches, like they're fuckin' with ya (yeah)
Teeth is glistenin', Jesus, Christmas
He just shittin', she exquisite, bitches be expensive
(Yeah, let 'em know, nigga) And I don't even need attention
WANG$AP on the bumper sticker, fuck you niggas
Fuck global warming, my neck is so frío
I'm currently lookin' for '95 Leo
My mom say she worried because I'm so ill
I should stay in bed, but got too much bread
To make, she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way güey, boy, that's McLaren
That's 0 to 60 in 2 point nueve, I'm gone

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Oh, fuck

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My thirst levels are infinity and beyond
Sippin' on that lemonade, I need a Beyoncé
Can't see straight, these shades are Céline Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah, I got a sold-out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker
If you fit description, hit me on my beeper
At that 911

[Bridge: Steve Lacy, Anna of the North & Tyler, The Creator]
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line, you know I'll answer (click)

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Chirp, chirp
Chirp, chirp
Woke up in the 'burbs, 'burbs, with the birds, birds
Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the nightline
Work line
Dial nine

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...

[Part II: Mr. Lonely]

[Intro: A$AP Rocky, ScHoolboy Q, Lionel & Tyler, The Creator]
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Forreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (That's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely (Woo)
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony (Woo)
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
My heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh (Hahaha)
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (Skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void (Void)
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (Ohh, woo)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes (Nah)
Like a vasectomy, what have I done? (Ohh)
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (Who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (Who)
The loneliest of them all (Me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit (-Posit)
Check in on me sometime (Okay)
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911

[Outro: Jasper]
Ohh!
Ohh Shit!
Fuck!
Ohh!
Shit!
Ohh!
Damn! Damn!

[Verse 1]
I never came to the beach, or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore, under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same, and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth

[Verse 1]
Every day I'm counting up my paper
Petty niggas hate, the ones in public with the vapors
Leave 'em in the dust and then we tell 'em see you later
Only people that truly know me is my mama and my maker
Shawty, you like my freeform dreads
I love it when she give a nigga freeform head
It's the banana boy, favorite color you know
Yellow is the new black, and I'm Mr. Caputo

[Chorus]
Close the blinds
I want to see me shine
Don't want to hear you chime
I want to see me glisten
Close the blinds

Couldn't afford Jordan's, talk to informant, never
I'm important, maybe I might die
Baby girl, I'm the cream of the crop (Yeah)
Creme de la creme, got the juice so they jock (True)
Women in my city treat a nigga like I'm Diddy
Pimpin' ain't a thang, I'm independent with my lane (Ay!)
Aminé very fly (Yeah), Aminé don't even try (No)
He raps and then he dips, he never singin' for no tricks (yeah)
Turn on your TV, then you might see me
Aminé don't give a fuck because I know that I'm the G

We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same, and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do we even exist?
That's when I make the wish, to swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song (hey)

[Verse 1]
I'd call you up but you wouldn't understand
I never tell you anything
I never can

It's in the movements you make
It's on your breath
You're a cold blooded killer
Or so you said

[Chorus]
When will I learn?
We are all cheated in time
And oh my god, you put me on the line
You said, “hold your breath and count to nine”

[Interlude]
I laid awake with the light coming in from outside
I'm feeling remnants of the face
Painted three hundred years ago on the ceiling

[Chorus 2]
And it looked just like you
And for a moment I was fooled
Oh my god, you told me all the time
You said, “hold your breath and count to nine”

[Refrain]
You said, “hold your breath and count to nine”
And oh my god, you put me on the line

[Outro]
And it looked just like you
And for a moment I was fooled
And it looked just like you
And for a moment I was fooled

You said, “hold your breath and count to nine”
And oh my god, you put me on the line

Why don't you let it breathe
Dancin' around til' the sun comes up in the mornin'
You got a hold on me, oh yeah
I made plans for you to see that I want it
So why don't you let it breathe
Take a breathe out

Sometimes I just don't know
Which way they want it to go
I know they have no idea
The way I'm haunted here

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just can't see
Which way she wants it to be
I know she has no idea
The way I want her here

Sometimes I just can't tell
Nothing is ringing a bell
I know I have no idea
The way I'm tossing tears

[Verse 1]
Maybe we can go to Coney Island
Maybe I can sing the national anthem
Buy a white sweater for the last white day of the summer
Like my purple hair for my mermaid video
Walk back to where I live
In my motel on Neptune Avenue (It's really fancy)

[Chorus]
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say "Take it off", take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say "Take it off", take it off

[Verse 2]
Maybe we could visit Suede Tokyo
See Van Halen at their reunion show
Heavy metal hour on TV
Diamond Dave and Ray Lee
And you salute me, Miss America
Because I am, I am

[Chorus]
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say "Take it off", take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say "Take it off", take it off

[Bridge]
All I wanna do is lie on chandeliers
I've been beautiful for more than a thousand years
All I wanna do is lie on chandeliers and stare at you, baby
Smile you to tears

[Verse 3]
Maybe we can go to Coney Island
Maybe I can sing you to sleep
God bless the universe, God bless the ocean
God bless the blue and God like them mean

[Intro]
Say some more, never want to talk about it
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, November...

[Chorus]
Take me back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup

[Verse 1]
Ayo, What if Clancy fuckin' me over?
What if "Who Dat Boy" is rhetorical and this shit is over?
What if I'm hustling backwards?
What if my accountant ain't payin' my taxes, fillin' his pockets?
And IRS show up asking me questions I couldn't answer
'Cause I was too busy tryna make classics
Boy ain't got no motherfucking classics
What if my music too weird for the masses?
And I'm only known for tweets more than beats or
All my day-ones turn to three, fours 'cause of track seven
Fuck, what if I get stuck?
What if I got comfortable? I gotta keep it buck-fifty
What if I lost it all and ended up back in Ladera
At them shitty apartments that's across from Bank of America?
Damn, I would be hurtin'
Writing all of these songs 'cause Wy-Fi wasn't working (Nah)
Last year, in total, I put out two verses
But five-seven figures since then, life's kinda perfect
Oh, is it really? Oh, is it really? Bitch, you know the dealy
Really hilly willy tilly silly, hold that billy, how I Milly Rock
When they can't relate him, when they start to hate him
They don't drive these cars, so what's their ultimatum?
Tell me, what's your November? Is it a person?
Mine was the summer, '06, I remember the... (horn)
What if I thought the brake was the gas? What if I crashed?
What if these deep thoughts was my last? Let me pull over, quick

[Chorus]
And drive back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, what's up?
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin, Taco, Kilo Kish, Christian Clancy, Syd, Lionel, Vince Staples, Julian Conesugra]
My November was those Odd Future Sundays, where we used to just skate all day
My November, and I was performing and Lil Wayne rapped with me, I think I cried that night
My November was awesome, I booked my first feature film
My November was when I was gifted this Getz and Gilberto album
My November was seeing Erykah Badu perform
My November was... my brother took me to my first concert ever, which was to Kanye West's "Glow in the Dark..."
My November was summer 2015 when I fell in love with someone who fucked my whole world up, showed me life through a different
2014, Miami 43rd Street, every day was November

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator & Vince Staples]
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
I ain't doin' fine, lost my mothafuckin' mind
Time travel back and help me find
Take me back, take me back to November, this I know
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back to November, this I kn—
"My November is right now"

[Verse 2]
I wrote a song about you, I want your opinion
Opposite of my heart rate, it slows down at the ending
'Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance
The lyrics are—
Matter of fact, I'ma just call you, so you can hear it
If you do answer, I'll play it to state facts
Although I already know the response you gon' say back
At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back
And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback

[Outro]
Hello, no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone

[Intro: R. Kelly & (Rick Ross)]
Said, it feels like a remix, yeah
(Maybach Music)
Feels like a remix, yeah
It must be a remix, yeah
(Lady Gaga, Rick Ross)
Ooh, ooh
(It's special right here)
Gotta be a remix, yeah
(You're so special right here)
Ooooh

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Photos of the boss, just post 'em on a blog
Get a lotta views 'cause they know we be the top
Jean Basquiat's in the middle of our hall
Ooh, she's my work of art so I pin her to the wall (haha)
Sex in the dark, underneath the waterfall
High as a space cadet as I'm leapin' over stars
Enemy of the state, they got a target on your boy
(Maybach Music)
'Cause I'm the hottest 'cross the board
Cruise through the ghetto, Mulsanne made of metal
Hangin' out the window, Bruce Willis on the pedal
Pool on the roof, black bottle for a model
I gotta keep it fly
Mosquito doors on the auto
Boss

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I, I feel good
I walk alone
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up
And then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart and, you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice, 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Early morning, longer nights (yeah)
Tom Ford, private flights (yeah)
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in, 'cause it's our life
(But let's slow it down)
I could be the drink in your cup (cup)
I could be the green in your blunt
Your pusher man
Yeah, I got what you want (want)
You wanna escape (oh)
All of the crazy shit (let go)
You're the Marilyn, I'm the president, -ent
And I love to hear you sing, girl

[Pre-Chorus 2: R. Kelly]
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Back in the club, taking shots, gettin' naughty
No invitations, it's a private party
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Yeah, we taking these haters and we roughin' 'em up
And we layin’ the cut like we don't give a fuck

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & (R. Kelly)]
You can't have my heart and, you won't use my mind (my mind)
But do what you want with my body (yeah)
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice, 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose, if you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body, and don't stop the party

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & R. Kelly, Both]
You can't have my heart and (help me now)
You won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body (with your body)
You can’t stop my voice, 'cause
You don't own my life (you)
But do what you want with my body
(When I want, when I want, when I want)
Do what you want with my body

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, girl
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world
Help me now
What you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
Want you want with my body, girl

[Intro: Michael]
We're gonna be starting now, baby
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Don't stop 'til you get enough (Don't Stop)

[Verse 1]
Heartbreak is the feeling now
Lovely is your body now
I don't get this feeling now
Get closer
To your body now
I don't get this feeling now
I'm done, you know you won't 

[?]

[Chorus]
Keep on with ya heart don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with ya heart don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with ya heart don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

[Verse 2]
Heartbreak is the feeling now
Lovely is your body now
I don't get this feeling now
People are standing now

I was saying now
I won't be complainin'
Our mother's love power

[Chorus]
Keep on with ya heart don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with ya heart don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with ya heart don't stop

[Verse 3]
Heartbreak is the feeling now
Lovely is your body now
I don't get this feeling now
I won't be complainin'
Our Mother's love power
(Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
Keep on with the heart don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the heart don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

[Outro]
Keep on...
You know it's... love power, keep on... yeah...
(Don't stop 'til you get enough)
Shake out your best power
(Don't stop 'til you get enough)
Keep on 'til you get enough

[Verse 1]
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Kind of mood that you wish you could sell

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore

[Verse 2]
Hands, hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
Anymore

[Verse 1]
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

[Verse 2]
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Verse 3]
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Bridge]
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Intro]
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby

[Verse 1]
You're saying that you miss me, oh well
I never even got a kiss without a countdown
It's time to face the facts, you treat me like a snack
Only text back when you're hungry
Your love's so insecure, you're never really sure
Boy, you never listen

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, babe

[Verse 2]
You're saying that you're sorry, so what?
You ask me what I want, for you to shut up
Time to come to terms, put myself first
When your bubble bursts got soap in your eye
I'm telling you it's wrong to break into my songs
Boy, you gotta listen

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, babe

[Bridge]
So take this as my last goodbye and play it when you're lonely
Don't you say I didn't try to reach your hand to hold me
I just wanna walk the line, press record then hit rewind
I've made up my mind to erase you, ooh-ooh
To erase you, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby

[Outro]
So take this as my last goodbye and play it when you're lonely
Don't you say I didn't try to reach your hand to hold me
I just wanna walk the line, press record then hit rewind
I've made up my mind to erase you, ooh-ooh
To erase you, ooh-ooh
To erase you, ooh-ooh
To erase you, ooh-ooh

[Intro]
Hey, leave a message

[Verse 1]
Hey, call me back when ya get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait, you know what?
Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked

[Pre-Chorus]
"Stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

[Chorus]
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday, by the way
"It's not you, it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don'tcha, babe?
I'm not your party favor

[Verse 2]
Look, now I know we coulda done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if you read 'em backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll hear "stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

[Chorus]
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way
"It's not you, it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don'tcha, babe?
I'm not your party favor

[Verse 1]
I wanna be alone
Alone with you, does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right, so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right, so stay a sec

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Like a hostage

[Verse 2]
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
But nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Hold you
Like a hostage
Like a hostage

[Intro: Spoken]
Yo, I don't even know man
Maybe I’m the only one that sees how whack this nigga is
You know what I’m sayin’?
Like the rest of these niggas, like this nigga or something
You know?
Fucking 33 years old, tryin’ to get respect
Nigga get a life, feed your family man
Goddamn

[Verse 1:]
Yo, yo
Why the fuck would you jump, to step to a motherfucker such as myself?
Nigga I Tec you, lay you out
Beat the shit out of you, til’ you confess to being the weakest nigga out
And homosexual shit, you jock me, and talk shit ‘cause you not me
I’m cocky, this faggot's riding my dick, a jockey
Try me, nigga, your shits jokes, you Cosby, I’m Ali
Bitch, I’m the king you Rodney, you get it?
How dare you try comparing yourself to me?
Coming in mines you embarrassing yourself
So please, ease off my dick, worry ‘bout your own shit
I got skills to pay the bills, bitch, you homeless
On this microphone, its no joke, I’m focused
So, you provoke and throat choke, then toasted
Your shit is not hot man, goddamn yo
You tied for the whackest nigga alive, besides Van Gogh
And you hate, how I get props and you can’t
Tryna rap at age 48, it’s too late
And you fake, you can fuck around, but you ain’t
You cray, son you must be slow as a screwtape
Whats wrong wit’ you? You all been out of shape
Sopping like your moms wit’ you
‘Cause I wouldn’t do a song wit’ you? Poor slut
More stuff, still rapping
How can I call you a has been, you never have been?
The most wanted, most boast, but don’t want it
The flows rugged, please know I’m cold blooded

[Verse 1]
Lights out
You're not here holding me
I count
Every tear down my cheek
Instead of sheep
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Sleepwalk
Find myself on your street
Three knocks
Ring the bell then I leave

[Chorus]
I tried
To live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like
To mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

[Verse 3]
Cold days
Frozen lake in the park
Old ways
Made mistakes, made our marks
Now we've gone dark
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 4]
Bad dreams
Might not mean anything
But you seem
Not to need anything

[Chorus]
I tried
To live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like
To mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

[Post-Chorus]
And I'm still so blue
True blue, true blue
True blue

[Outro]
I tried
To live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like
To mean it when I say I'm over you

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah
I got Lucci in this bitch with me
On some real shit, I remember we ain't had nothing
Dead broke, I'm talking pain and suffering
They ain't goin' feel my pain, they don't know where we come from

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I can talk shit 'cause I was shit
Diamonds shining on me, need a off switch
Niggas talking crazy, get 'em all hit
Put the call in from Dubai, on some boss shit
Brand new Maybach, this ain't Ross shit
This my shit, I be talking fly shit
Clean them niggas up with that mop stick
Hating on me, that'll get your baby mom hit
Turks and Caicos, spending pesos
Niggas flying private with them Draco's
Pull up in your city, like it ain't yours
Put a check up on your hitter, and it's case closed
Still change hoes like I change clothes
Chain froze, Range Rov', and I'm playin' Hov
Flashbacks, seeing cops in them plain clothes
My nigga fighting open cases and they ain’t close

[Hook: YFN Lucci]
I'm a young king
I'm a young king
Remember all them nightmares, all them bad dreams
Remember all them nights, when we didn't have a thing
So it's only right a nigga living like a king
How you goin' tell me you ain't never had dreams
If it was to be a baller or triple beam
We goin' fuck 'em all up, with the whole team
Young nigga
Y-Young nigga dream

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Niggas talking tough, we calling you bluff
Took a call, got him hit, while I'm talking to Puff
Man down, man I shouldn't be talking this stuff
The nigga that you claim a hitter, the target to us
Caught him in the morning, like it's Tom Joyner
Doc plugging cables to him like its Time Warner
Time to pull the plug on him, let his mom mourn him
Got a suicide squad like a bomb on him
Spin a block on a nigga talking rah rah
He was playin' with the birdies, now it's bye-bye
I know Jigga, I know Emory and Ty-Ty
Roc-Nation on my chain, 'cause it's Ta-Da
Nigga, I'm the truth, I'm like W'Allah
Every time I make a movie it be Sci-Fi
Looking scary in that Ghost when I ride by
Niggas sayin' I wouldn't make it, I'm like voilà
I know magic, I'm a savage
It's a plane, it's a bird, it's a bad bitch
I ain't trippin' 'bout her, you can have it
They was happy when we was broke, now we mad rich
Young nigga, talkin' cash shit
You can tell we ain't never really had shit
Turned my momma public house into a glass crib
Now my guest house bigger than my last crib

[Hook: YFN Lucci]
I'm a young king
I'm a young king
Remember all them nightmares, all them bad dreams
Remember all them nights, when we didn't have a thing
So it's only right a nigga living like a king
How you goin' tell me you ain't never had dreams
If it was to be a baller or triple beam
We goin' fuck 'em all up, with the whole team
Young nigga
Y-Young nigga dream

[Outro: Barcelini]
See, they treated us like peasants
But we always knew we had the blood of kings pumping through our veins
Dreamchasers!, we took the stone out the rubbles and built a palace
Money, power, and violence
Sippin' Spade on the Island
Killin' these niggas, moment of silence-
'Cause we done rose through the slums and beat all odds
We the poster child for every young nigga in the streets
You see us on T.V., you see who your son's aspiring to be
It was plenty nights, man, we ain't had nothin' to eat
I'm talking, cup of noodles or maybe some cream of wheat
Now it's French laundry when we feel like it
We don't even do Philippe's
I mean, you wouldn't believe me if I showed you
I'm talking 10-15 thousand dollars on the tab, that's just on wine
This lifestyle, it'll blow your mind
You know, we goin' have it our way
Young kings, living out the dream
Bossed up, on every scene
The Mobb nigga, Barcelini

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Homies dead and I miss 'em
Rest caught up in the system
Trayvon Martin in a hoodie, MAC with a fully, I won't be a victim
Pyrex stove in the kitchen
Pray the lord gon' forgive us
Go to war with the realest
For the love of Benjis, saw it in my dinner
I went from captain to K
Catchin' a bus to catchin' a Wraith
Banana boy, up in my Bape
I'm tryna catch me an eighth
They tryna touch on my safe
I cannot barely can sleep
I gotta lay with my peeps
Every single fuckin' day of the week
They killed my daddy in nine-two
I had to stay in the streets
Warrin' with niggas from down the block
I had to wake up to beef
Forty gon' wake up the neighbors
They gotta wake up to me
Smokin' dope got me paranoid like the Reaper was waitin' for me
Tell my opps that we gon' die about this shit
I come from a place where niggas die about a diss
You ain't in the hood so we can't slide by your strip
Cookin' so much fuckin' work I might get high off that brick

[Chorus: Eearz]
Can't ever forget, can't ever forget
Them haters remind me, to get back on my 

[?]
Where I come from niggas 'round here die 'bout that shit
Me and mine so fuck the other side, I am drippy
This shit that remind me, all the days I had less
Hatin' on me for what? you should go get a check
You gon' do what to who? better say it with your chest
We gon' come for your neck, I suggest you protect

[Verse 2: Eearz]
Ma died back in oh-five, it was no one but me
Popped out that pussy nine-two, fell in love with the streets
I do not do perpetuations, these real talk and the statements
Hide the masses, I hit payment
I need street participation
They said that I wouldn't be nothin'
It's just like a fuckin' nigga to be hatin'
I got business for myself and he ain't
I'm tryna pull up, make the whole block faint
The coupe stained inside, candy paint
I pass the 

[?] 'cause a nigga don't drank it
Only get faded on special occasions
Like when I get them new Ben Franks
I got niggas on the roof and the flank
For the ones who think diamonds be blank
We hit him up at the top of his tank
Strong arm who, bitch I get dank
Told him strip, let the lil baby spray
Now off rip name heavy in the race
Need no nigga, I depend on my faith
I bet they give me a Wraith and a 

[?]
Put all the play aways in the game and put a 

[?] out his ways
See niggas don't know about all the pain and see all my struggle
See I came straight out of them crevices and that gutter
These niggas don't know about it, better then not tell 'em I show 'em, yeah I show 'em

[Chorus: Eearz]
Can't ever forget, can't ever forget
Them haters remind me, to get back on my 

[?]
Where I come from niggas 'round here die 'bout that shit
Me and mine so fuck the other side, I am drippy
This shit that remind me, all the days I had less
Hatin' on me for what? you should go get a check
You gon' do what to who? better say it with your chest
We gon' come for your neck, I suggest you protect

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Yeah, they'll smoke you for a Rollie
Niggas kill him for a Cuban
Gotta watch how I'm movin'
Freddie Kruger with the Ruger
They'll kill you when you're talkin' peace
Learned that shit from Martin Luther
Gotta move with a shooter
More jewels than a jeweler
Niggas be hating for what
You should go get you a check
Diamonds they jumping like checkers
But we still moving like chess
Head shot, head shot
Bang bang, what you gon' do with that vest?
Ran off like thirty bricks
Give a fuck 'bout who the connect
We was just living to die
Now we just dying to live
They put my dog in the sky
We spilling bottles to live
You better check your homie 'fore I put a check on the top of his head
Bitches be checking for me 'cause they know a nigga on top of his bread
I drop four like Uno
Fuck a popstar, get kudos
Two bad hoes in my two door
Flooded my fleece on 

[?]
Went OG on your OG
My young nigga he a fool though
We had to go get it OT
I made a milly off two O's

[Chorus: Eearz]
Can't ever forget, can't ever forget
Them haters remind me, to get back on my 

[?]
Where I come from niggas 'round here die 'bout that shit
Me and mine so fuck the other side, I am drippy
This shit that remind me, all the days I had less
Hatin' on me for what? you should go get a check
You gon' do what to who? better say it with your chest
We gon' come for your neck, I suggest you protect

[Intro: Meek Mill]
I can hear it in your voice you wasn't never in this shit nigga
We still at war

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Young niggas totin' Glocks
Sellin' dope, poppin' wheelies
When the feds came through, they scooped the whole South Philly
When the feds came through, they scooped the whole South Philly
We was grinding, they was hating
Perfect time to get this money, I was patient
We was Gucci, they was snaking
Only one to keep it real, when they was faking
Ain't a nigga 'round me I ain't give a hundred bands to
Never falling out, about them bitches that we ran through
When you get the money, like I got it, they can't stand you
Fuck 'em, we at war with the system, in the streets
Bulletproof I'm in the trenches, niggas said that I got beef
I can't really trust these niggas 'bout this cash, and I can't sleep
And my homie lined my other homie up, 'cause he a creep
Show no love for that pussy ass nigga, it get deep
For the love of that Benji, we spillin' blood in them streets
And I know why they hate me, it ain't no love in them streets
He was hinting at work, we thought it was love it was cheap
He was sellin us that reerock, pumping us on that Reebok
Damn, thought you was all here, found out that we not
Slid up on him wit three Glocks, did him dirty for three blocks
Turn that boy to a freeze pop, shoot 'em until it decock
It's a dog-eat-dog environment
Young niggas killing, all the old heads retiring
And the sound of that 30 start to sound inspiring
When you pull up on them, I start firing
Please don't judge us, they done killed our brothers
We done starved all winter they gon feel our summers
I went drop top Dawn on 'em, we do numbers
And when we get a chance to rain on 'em, we gon' flood 'em
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em

[Chorus]
I told 'em, I'mma pray for 'em
All that drama I feel like I'm made for
Catch a body, take it to the grave for me
And if they pop you off, you'll never change on me, no
Bag talk, put a bag on her, let that cash talk
Daddy was arrested so it’s dad's fault
Killed the niggas about you, you tell them that part?
Why you take it that far?

[?] everybody, you gotta understand, dog
We the type to call the opps and have a standoff
Make a thottie call your homie, that's a man-off

[Verse 2]
We ain't never been loved, so we don't know how it feel
They so used to the fake shit, they don't know what was real
All my enemies, frenemies, I don't know who to kill
I don't know who gon' keep it silent and know who gon' squeal
I can't tell no more
I don't know who was thurl
'Cause it all got fuzzy and came down to that money
I seen niggas eatin' from me, made me watch while I'm hungry
Bitches changed for the fame, you gotta watch them they phony
I don't know where I'm going, I need navigation
They came and got a young niggas 'for they graduation
Spent some time on that Patek still ain't got no patience
Gave my nigga 20 years, put him on vacation
Every time I'm in the hood, I be on some Wraith shit
Stars all in the ceiling, feel like it's a spaceship
In them streets, we still in there, niggas think we made it
They just killed my little cousin, wish I could've saved him
'Member times out in Vegas when we did it major
Niggas turned they back on us, I feel like they played us
I feel like they try to use us, I can't do no favors
Gotta watch these niggas close 'cause they been catchin' vapors

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Pass me the lighter
Old flame callin' so she wanna light the fire
Now I'm super tired
When we get together, room sound like a choir
I'm a true lifer
Pussy make me happy and it make me inspired
Forget to read on my Bible
Go through these cycles, so...

[Chorus: Aminé]
I was up in the night
It never was known
I wanted to try
But I wasn't sure
My life was a lie
I filled it with gold
There wasn't a night
Where I wasn't sure

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Now pass me the lighter
Old flame callin' so she wanna light the fire
Now I'm super tired
When we get together, room sound like a choir
Yeah, I'm a true lifer
Pussy make me happy and it make me inspired
Forget to read on my Bible
Only God know why I go through these cycles

[Chorus: Aminé & Ty Dolla $ign]
I was up in the night
It never was known
I wanted to try
But I wasn't sure
My life was a lie
I filled it with gold
There wasn't a night
Where I wasn't sure

[Verse 3: Aminé]
Shit, bitch I'm dripped in gold (woo)

If a nigga try to stop me I'ma tell him I'ma eat (ayy)
Comma, comma, comma, commas comin' pretty commonly
If I'm being blunt, I really wanna fuck Emily (hey)
Bitch, I'm missin' your call
I don't got time for your problems at all (no)
I'm poppin' and all so she poppin' it off
I turn the other cheek, now she kissin' my jaw
So sick with it, (sick) fuck my critics (yeah)
Smile so hard like I love my dentist (teeth)
I'm that chemist, I serve it to the fiends (yeah)
Quit my 9 to 5, now I'm 95 degrees
Destined for my destiny
I sow no hate or jealousy
Niggas feel me like Hennessy
And if it's good for you
Then it's good for me (true)
Destined in my density
I only show love or empathy
'Cause karma dictates my legacy
And if it's good for you
Then it's good for me

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign & Aminé]
Gotta, always gotta keep it real with ya (true)
Even though you in your feelings
Know we've been goin' through a lot lately
But you know you're still my baby
Aminé always gotta keep it real with ya (true)
'Cause you know that they're hearin' us (yeah)Caroline, yeah, that's my baby (ayy)
But you know that she drives me crazy
And you love when I kiss it in the mornin'
You know it's real when we kissin' all in public
Now she floorin', two toned foreign (yeah)
Shawty love to tan so she lookin' like she orange

[Intro: Aminé]

Lookin' at my face, you could tell I know my place (I do)
You say, "Amen," I say, "Aminé"
Right after I say my grace

[Chorus: Aminé & Nelly]
I wanna flex, I wanna show off
Humble when I'm blunt, but I gotta go hard
You're damn right, I'm feelin' myself
You know you'd do the same if that was yourself

[Verse 2: Aminé]
I was broke (broke) now I'm stuntin' like my daddy
Flyest under the sea, I'm gettin' Krabby Patties (true)
Dukes gave me juice so this beat feel like it's caffeine
Dreadlock nigga so my hair is pretty nappy (woo)
Boppers give me love (love), I could give a fuck (no)
Young Metro said he trust her so I gave the girl a hug (hey)
Well I got a bag of tricks, I don't do the politics (true, true)
I rock yellow on some yellow like what purple is to Prince

[Chorus: Aminé & Nelly]
I wanna flex, I wanna show off
Humble when I'm blunt, but I gotta go hard
You're damn right, I'm feelin' myself
You know you'd do the same if that was yourself

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Respect, that's all I ask for
My feelings feel too
No you ain't stone cold
I know you bleed too
Head up in the clouds
My feet to the crowd
I hate all your friends
But y'all splittin' rent
So every night I'm over
I try to find some closure
But you open your jaws
And then I'm goin' raw

[Refrain: Aminé]
I wanna throw my hands up high
And forget who I used to be
I wanna throw my hands up high
And get a taste of your luxury

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé & Girlpool]
You don't wanna cry tears with me (tears)
You just wanna keep sighin' (sighin')
Sometimes I wonder if you're bad for me (you're bad)
But that's what keeps me excited
When I'm with you

[Chorus: Aminé]
You're my hero
And my heroin
I'm addicted
Ms. Excellent (ayy)

I wanna throw my hands up high
And forget who I used to be
I wanna throw my hands up high
And get a taste of your luxury

[Chorus]
I need a Spice Girl
Zig-a-zig-ah, fuck up my whole world
Posh when she talk, nothin' like old girl
Scary and Sporty, tell her what I want
What I really, really want is a Spice Girl
Zig-a-zig-ah, fuck up my whole world
Posh when she talk, nothin' like old girl
Scary and Sporty, tell her what I want
What I really, really want is a...

[Verse 1]
Spice Girl, freaky lil mama
Said she on a diet so she only eat bananas
Always in your prime, other women don't align
And when I'm off work then you know it's bed time
So let's go (hey), let's hit the I-5
Get away from B.S., don't waste no down time (hey)
I don't ever like 'em boujee, that's the type that wanna sue me
And when we get together, hit it like viva forever

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, is this real or fake?
Do I have a chance or am I pavin' ways?
I'm tryna find a reason not to say your name
Like you, there's no look-a-like

[Chorus]
I need a Spice Girl
Zig-a-zig-ah, fuck up my whole world
Posh when she talk, nothin' like old girl
Scary and Sporty, tell her what I want
What I really, really want is a Spice Girl
Zig-a-zig-ah, fuck up my whole world
Posh when she talk, nothin' like old girl
Scary and Sporty, tell her what I want
What I really, really want is a...

[Verse 2]
British girl (hey)
Got a show in London
Won't you come around? Put you on the list, it's nothin'
Say you gotta work 'cause you're studyin' for Masters
Yeah, these women fine but only on the camera (ooh)
They deceivin', super thievin'
They feelings come and go like when they weave in
I never listen to the schemin' type
I want the Sporty, Scary, Ginger spice

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, is this real or fake?
Do I have a chance or am I pavin' ways?
I'm tryna find a reason not to say your name
Like you, there's no look-a-like

[Chorus]
I need a Spice Girl

[Outro]
My girl's a Spice Girl
Her world's my world
And most of all she's fine to me
And aligned with the infatuation I feel
I need a Spice Girl

[Intro]
Ay man, say man
We starting to get really tired all that, all that hoopty hollering
Whoopty whoo, blaze blah y'all been talking lately, man
Go somewhere with all that, man, for real, shut up, shut up
All that talking y'all been doing man, for real
"I'ma do this, I'ma do that," ugh

[Verse 1]
Every day you're talking, every day you're in my ears
And every time we fighting, I gotta go and wipe your tears
'Cause if I don't do, you gon' throw your problems on me
And then we'll fuss and fight when I just really wish you'd...

[Chorus]
Shut the fuck up, don't complicate it
Shut the fuck up, you're overexaggerating
Shut the fuck up, just have some patience
Shut the fuck up, quit giving me hell

[Verse 2]
We keep locking eyes, petty so you're silent
You keep talking signs, heart is in the science
Sleep, weep, don't cry on me, don't die on me
All up in my face with the oochie wally wally
Sounding like girls at a party on the molly
I ain't tryna link or build
Bubble space, bubble space, still, nigga, chill (Move)
Oh, you got a chain? Sick
Oh, you got some fame? Sick
Got a new Rolex and you knew he had to flex
'Cause the hoes gon' check
500K in my stash
Why you flex the only couple hundreds that you have?
Screw needing security for your insecurity
Calling niggas broke, you should choke on your own words
Name dropping, pic cropping, dick hopping, bill dodging
Boy, you know who you are
Man, why you wanna try so hard?
Be yourself, be yourself and please

[Chorus]
Shut the fuck up, don't complicate it
Shut the fuck up, you're overexaggerating
Shut the fuck up, just have some patience
Shut the fuck up, get out my head

[Bridge]
I'm waiting my whole life, but I'm tired, tired of wishing for you
I'm waiting patiently, but my mischief wishing for something new

[Verse 3]
Money come right back, never had to fight that
But I come back, back
Thought it was a night cap, life hit a hijack
Girl, let's be face, face
Heartbreak Drake for my first heartbreak
I was 17 and I made mistakes
Went to dances but I never did dance
Got pretty fly, but I never did pan
Now I'm 23, loving and learning from all the lovers that I see
Nissan babes with the body burgundy
Love my car same way I used to love key
Friends need a Uber, sis need tuition
Fans want the music, but they want a politician
Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure
Shut the fuck up, I don't need the extras
Spice girls sitting in the red Mercedes
Attitude like I'm tryna have your babies
But I ain't tryna have no babies
No, I ain't tryna have no baby

[Outro]
Been waiting my whole life but I'm tired
Tired of wishing for you
I'm waiting patiently but my mischief
Wishing for something new

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé]
I was duped, didn't know the truth
Got rid of my old flame, now I got a boo
And now I'm feeling cool, I'm feeling brand new
I would pay a lot to be the nigga in my shoes (Who this for?)

[Chorus: Aminé]
This is dedicated to my ex-lovers
Hope that you hear this, never find another
Me and my friends, we don't worry or pretend
Hope you play this at your wedding
Yeah, the one I won't attend
This is dedicated to my ex-lovers
Hope that you hear this, never find another
Me and my friends, we don't worry or pretend
Hope you play this at your wedding
Yeah, the one I won't attend (Sike)

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Vultures at the altar, tell the pastor to watch his back
My girl said she wanted change and then she got a quarterback
Well, damn, I ain't no football player
But I hit it harder than a football player
The girl of my dreams just became a girl
And well, we can talk about that later
Honeymoon in your hometown, bitch, you broke now
Your mama ask about me almost every week
He can speak in tongue, talkin' bout "Forever hold your peace"
I said peace, please hurry up and kiss so I can eat, mmm
Tootsie roll and your tippy toes
So much soul that my soul got soul
Your auntie and uncle, they love me
All your bridesmaids wanna fuck me
Your groom look like a broom and it make me "hahaha"
Girl, I coulda been your Pap and you be my Remy Ma (Hey!)

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé & Offset]
I was duped, didn't know the truth (Truth)
Got rid of my old flame, now I got a boo

[Verse 2: Offset]
Yes, I've been balling, yeah, Maybachs to Lambos and 'Raris, yeah
Fresh in that Cartier, take off your clothes, we get naughty, yeah
Whole party lit, bad bitches everywhere (Lit!)
Gang in this bitch, Nawf Side extraordinaire (Gang!)
Pipe up the city, the diamonds gon' light up the city
I got your girl on the low
I slide in it and then I'ma dive in it, I got her selling her soul (Soul!)
Pick up five bags in a row (Bags!)
White diamonds look like the Pope (Pope!)
Gucci Python on the loafers
Yeah, my pinky look just like the ocean
It's colder, North Dakota, from the bowl to the chauffeurs
Having fun in a Rollster, in Milan copping Goyard, yeah!
(Woo, woo, woo, woo) Now that I'm taking over
Your hand out, but I don't owe ya, I came from the dirt, soil

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé & (Offset)]
I was duped, didn't know the truth (Truth)
Got rid of my old flame, now I got a boo
And now I'm feeling cool (Cool!), I'm feeling brand new
I would pay a lot to be the nigga in my shoes (Who this for?)

[Chorus: Aminé & (Offset)]
This is dedicated to my ex-lovers
Hope that you hear this, never find another

Whoa

[Verse 1: Aminé]
I woke up on this Sunday
With no motivation in my body
No, whoa, whoa, whoa
Phone drier than Mojave
Daddy diabetic, so he eat his pancakes with agave
Mama headed to the church now
And she left me at the house
She left me at the house
Religious but I'm lazy
Naked like a nudist
Fruity Loops and Stanley Kubrick
Peanut butter jelly
Cousin bumping Makaveli
Sipping Stellas with my fellas
Bumping nothing but Fela Kuti
Groupies say they wanna do me
Truly, that feel like a blessing
But finding one to love is getting harder every second
Niggas would rather be single than see a wedding date
Niggas will either end up at Heaven or at Kevin's gates
I bench press my problems, like add another weight
And act like it's alright when it's not, whoa

[Chorus: Aminé]
Some days we get Sundays but most days the rain comes down
And I feel like I'm bound to drown
Jesus Christ, whoa
Truth is my religion
My beliefs are not forgiven
Some days we get Sundays but most days the rain comes down
And I feel like I'm bound to drown
Jesus Christ, whoa
Truth is my religion
My beliefs are not forgiven

[Verse 2: Aminé]
I've been sipping red wine since a toddler
Blood of Christ, sacrifice for my Father
My daddy love me and hate me like Mr. Focker
My sister happy that I can afford Supreme
Mama called
She said "Don't worry 'bout me, baby, get your problems solved"
I told her "Ask me for whatever, whenever you want
I just went double platinum"
Mama say my health is more important than my album
I'm not loud, I'm Ethiopian rowdy
Sent my parents to Maui
Now they skin look like a brownie
Yo-Yo see me grind, Demitrius say he proud
My niggas lift me up, whenever I'm 'bout to drown
Fuck a Monday
I love my Sundays
I head to Costco and get a smoothie
Momma say count your blessings
So I did and now I realize who I am and who I'm not, whoa

[Chorus: Aminé]
Some days we get Sundays but most days the rain comes down
And I feel like I'm bound to drown
Jesus Christ, whoa
Truth is my religion
My beliefs are not forgiven
Some days we get Sundays but most days the rain comes down
And I feel like I'm bound to drown
Jesus Christ, whoa
Truth is my religion
My beliefs are not forgiven

[Outro: Leon Bridges]
Whoa
Sunday
Don't let him die
Don't let him die
Don't let him die
Don't let him die

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé]
Baby girl, I've had one too many
My cup ain't full, but it's got me empty
Only drink to mingle 'cause I'm single
Waiter, can you break this 20?
I'm not about the flashiness, I'm only about you and this
Drink that's in my hand, has got this plan
And has got me wasted, got me faded

[Chorus: Aminé & Charlie Wilson]
I wanna make you feel young (Feel young)
I wanna make you feel something (Feel something)
I wanna make you feel young (Feel young)
I wanna make you feel something
You know I wanna make you feel, I wanna make you feel
I wanna make you feel, I wanna make you feel
I wanna make, I wanna make
I wanna make, I wanna make you feel

[Verse 1: Aminé]
It's funny how I always find myself in Dakota
Knocking on my conscious every morning like Jehovah
I'm afraid of heights but my feelings roller coaster
So I'ma chug, chug
I'd like to pay the tab if you let me make a statement
But then she tell me "No" the same way they did David
Cabernet for my fitness sake
My confidence a raisin but I wish it was a grape
Holes in my soul 'cause I feel like Zero
Patch me up quick with a stitch like Lilo
Red wine like my red coupe, white girls want the proof
Jay Rock to a Kate Moss, get out
Fingers on the edge of my glass, making it last
Thinking about a girl from Portland all in my past
Got groupies fanning out like Dakota
But I'd rather get shy on my sofa

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé]
Baby girl, I've had one too many
My cup ain't full, but it's got me empty
Only drink to mingle 'cause I'm single
Waiter, can you break this 20?
I'm not about the flashiness, I'm only about you and this
Drink that's in my hand, has got this plan
And has got me wasted, got me faded

[Chorus: Aminé & Charlie Wilson]
I wanna make you feel young (Feel young)
I wanna make you feel something (Feel something)
I wanna make you feel young (Feel young)
I wanna make you feel something
You know I wanna make you feel
I wanna make you feel
I wanna make you feel
I wanna make you feel
I wanna make
I wanna make
I wanna make
I wanna make you feel

[Bridge: Aminé]
Compassion ain't a man's best friend
But it's somewhere next to his pride
Illuminate the bullshit and give him some time

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Gazing at the bottom of my glass
Searching for an answer to mistakes from my past
I ain't been to Saturn and I ain't been to Mars
I haven't met Elon but I have met a star
It's hard to relish how I really feel about you
Like my niggas, my feelings is really, really out here
I cry with my hands up high
Just so I can get by when I truly feel alone
I see the fire
In your eyes I wonder if this is real or if I'm underwater
Dark nights, light hearts, cold face
It makes you want to see what we could have become
But everything's meant to be

[Verse 1]
Yeah, hit up my baby girl (woo)
'Cause I thought about her (yeah)
Know we haven't talked in weeks (we haven't)
But I know you want the nana (ahh)
No this ain't no booty call (dang)
It's just a late night snack (it is)
My mama still at work (she is)
And I just got me some Trojans (protected)
Dick like ADT (yeah)
Bus too long, teleport to me
Lookin' like she red wine (yuh)
And my shawty like a 10, she a not 9 (true)
Wouldn't trade her for a jewel and pearl (woah)
Only diamonds maybe (yeah)
I'm lookin' for my Usher album (yeah)
So my chances get better when you...

[Chorus]
Slide through
Slide through
Slide through
Slide through
(Slide) slide through
(Slide) slide through
(Slide) slide through
(Slide) slide through

[Verse 2]
I wanna (woo)
Feel your tongue on my teeth, so I (true)
Do my best to keep in mind that you're human
And you trip sometimes (yeah)
Keep it a buck 250 (woo)
Let me know if you're a little bit iffy (woo)
Don't know what you want, you're complicated (yeah)
I'm frustrated, na-na-na-na na-na-na-na
I'm so wasted for (yeah)
You 'cause you perfect galore
I shoulda put more effort in it
I'm runnin' through the race to finish
I'm like, "Fuck it"
Your heart don't know what it doesn't (no)
I'm lookin' for my Michael album
So my chances get better when you...

[Chorus]
Slide through
Slide through
Slide through
Slide through
(Slide) slide through
(Slide) slide through
(Slide) slide through
(Slide) slide through (hey)

[Bridge]
Slide, slide

[Outro]
Toilet flushes
If you don't get your ass up off this couch, man, I promise you ain't ever gon' be shit, you ain't never gon' do shit. Matter of fact, you gon' sit there with a dumbass look on your face like "Why me?" Nigga, nobody care about how you feel

[Intro]
Yah-yah, yah-yah, yah, yah
Yah-yah, yah-yah, yah, yah
Woah, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday I wake up
Gotta get this cake up
Lookin' at my life like
Is this what it's made of? (made of)
Money rule the world around me
That's why it's on my mind
Everyday I wake up
Gotta get this cake up
Lookin' at my life like
Is this what it's made of? (made of)
Money rule the world around me
And now I realize...

[Chorus]
Money make the world go 'round
Money turn your best friend down
Money turn a good girl out
Money make the sun go south
And it make my self-esteem
But it never take my dream life
Money make the world go 'round
Money turn your best friend down
Money turn a good girl out
Money make the sun go south
And it make my self-esteem
But it never take my dream life

[Verse 1]
Tender love and care, I see the money with my left eye
Rubber band man like my nickname T.I
Labels wanna sign but the money so eh
And the contract iffy so Brookah tell 'em see ya
I'm most loyal to the most loyal
You can't find dirt on me 'cause I'm not soil
I wouldn't do much for money man (yeah)
Aminé ain't Juwanna Man
Not at all, women makin' calls
Like "Aminé, do you got that paper? Let me hold it"
Mama need a whip and my daddy need a crib
Got a phone, lil nigga, why the fuck I need a Rollie?
Black pepper chicken and chow mein, my favorite
Sayin' you ain't racist really sounds racist
See money give a nigga rings
Then when you get it everybody call you fake

[Bridge 1]
'Cause when it all boils down
Everything's a riddle
Everything's fickle
There's no satisfaction
There's no satisfaction
Cause when it all boils down
Everything's fickle
And little
There's no satisfaction
There's no

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I wake up
Gotta get this cake up
Lookin' at my life like, is this what it's made of? (Made of)
Money rule the world around me
That's why it's on my mind
Every day I wake up
Gotta get this cake up
Lookin' at my life like, is this what it's made of? (Made of)
Money rule the world around me
And now I realize

[Chorus]
Money make the world go 'round
Money turn your best friend down
Money turn a good girl out
Money make the sun go south
And it make my self-esteem
But it never take my dream life
Money make the world go 'round
Money turn your best friend down
Money turn a good girl out
Money make the sun go south
And it make my self-esteem
But it never take my dream life

[Verse 2]
My city never thought it'd make a nigga like me
Young lil' nigga from the 503
I'm Tom Cruise, the rap game the couch from Oprah
I'm here for my range, boy, not them Rovers
Money make my world go 'round
Money make my heartbeat pounce
Ask God for a lot
Success ain't 'bout the fame and how much jewels you rock
Success is when I can tell my mama to quit her job
Still poppin' Pellegrino 'cause my mama like my hero
Now hoes give me head cause I make banana bread
Young black boy, mi ah world so rude
Give me 40 acres with a Moscow Mule
My Señorita boricua
She smoke a lot of the reefer
I need me commas on commas if rappers want him on feature
I'm making Swiss beats so I beat it like an Alicia
Money don't make you happy, it just makes you wanna get richer

[Bridge 2]
'Cause when it all boils down
The paper bring me pleasure
There's no satisfaction
There's no satisfaction
There's nothing you can do to give me
What I really need (There's no satisfaction)
What I really need

[Chorus]
Money make the world go 'round
Money turn your best friend down
Money turn a good girl out
Money make the sun go south
And it make my self-esteem
But it never take my dream life

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna plan (woo), I just wanna dance (yeah)
Fuck a fortune teller, they can't tell me who I am
I'm a yellow mellow fellow and my cousin is the sun
I'm Aminé to my niggas and Animé to a punk (hey)
When I give her Jimmy, then my baby give me Neutron
Verses I be shoppin', you can bet I got them deals (shit)
I could die tomorrow, so my future got some pressure
Pay tuition for my sis and cop my mom a Tesla

[Pre-Chorus]
Old me is stuck in the new one
Red pill cause don't take the blue one
Wonderland doesn't seem too bad
I think I'm gonna wallow in tomorrow like yeah

[Chorus]
Who knows what the future holds?
I don't, if the truth be told
They say play it safe, young soul
Fuck that, Imma take control
I was dead until I sought out (yeah)
Took my time (woo) and then I found out (true)
Got some tears, they made me ball out (woo)
Took my fears, and threw 'em all out (all out)

[Verse 2]
Pace it, I don't ever chase it
If I need some time, I'ma stretch it like it's latex
Jesus take the wheel, I need David Copperfield
Parallel to parasails, I'm Aminé McFly
Bitter as Moana (woo), flexin' like I'm Maui (true)
I don't care what people think, I'm perfect in my psyche
Sike! Bitch, I'm not, I'm just insecure as most
Life could change in a blink, don't know what the future holds

[Pre-Chorus]
Old me is stuck in the new one
Red pill cause don't take the blue one
Wonderland doesn't seem too bad
I think I'm gonna wallow in tomorrow like yeah

[Chorus]
Who knows what the future holds?
I don't, if the truth be told
They say play it safe, young soul
Fuck that, I'ma take control
I was dead until I sought out (yeah)
Took my time (woo) and then I found out (true)
Got some tears, they made me ball out (woo)
Took my fears, and threw 'em all out (all out)

[Bridge]
All out, I'm goin' all out
If you try to stop me you can bet I'm goin' all out
Runnin' up the numbers 'cause I can and I want to
This your favorite song, you gon' sing it 'til it's past due
All out, I'm goin' all out
This your favorite song, you gon' sing it 'til I ball out
Bitch I'm in the clouds....
Runnin' in a trance, got you runnin'....

[Outro]
I don't know when I'm gonna die
My watch can't tell the time
Hopefully there's some hope in me
I won't trip if it's meant to be
I don't know when I'm gonna die
My watch can't tell the time
Hopefully there's some hope in me
I won't trip if it's meant to be
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh
I don't know when I'm gonna die
Hopefully there's... hope in me
I don't know when I'm gonna die
Hopefully there's... hope in me

[Verse 1]
Creation shows me what to do
I'm dancing on the floor with you
And when you touch my hand
I go crazy, yeah
The music tells me what to feel
I like you now, but is it real?
By the time we say goodnight
I'll know if this is right

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I feel you
Pumping through my veins
Am I into you?
Or is the music to blame?

[Chorus]
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Did you make my night?
Or did they do spinning the breaks I like?
Cause baby, if they stop the music, and I'm still into ya
Then I guess there'll be no doubt tonight
Who owns my heart?

[Verse 2]
The room is full, but all I see is
The way your eyes just blaze through me
Like fire in the dark
We're like living art

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And it hits me
Like a tidal wave
Are you feeling me?
Or is the music to blame?

[Chorus]
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Did you make my night?
Or did they do spinning the breaks I like?
Cause baby, if they stop the music, and I'm still into ya
Then I guess there'll be no doubt tonight
Who owns my heart?
(Who owns my heart?)
My heart
Who owns my heart?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And it hits me
Like a tidal wave
Are you feeling me?
Or is the music to blame?

[Chorus]
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Did you make my night?
Or did they do spinning the breaks I like?
Cause baby, if they stop the music, and I'm still into ya
Then I guess there'll be no doubt tonight
Who owns my heart?

[Intro]
Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?

Ugh, in New York like Biggie, ROC, plants on my sock
She runnin' from the cock and when I shoot I *blatttt!*

Me and woe don't really rock, evidently not, brrrr
Yuh, tell 'em it's the ROC

I'm twisted like my locks, big up to the Lox
I did a show with Ja
Yo, Pierre, you wanna come out here?
Did a show with Ja, soon as I left the spot
Pulled over by the cops, them bitches found my Glock
They threw me in the box, eight months tops
Starin' at the clock, commissary stopped
Man, when Carter 5 drop, a nigga jaw gon' drop
The bitches' drawers gon' drop and then the calls gon' drop
Hello? I ball too hard, they flop, woah
And all of these bitches got ass, how did they get it so fast?

In L.A., they gettin' shots, bitch I know the docs

[Chorus]
Hol' up, I ain't from the 'Nolia, but Tunechi still a soldier
And rest in peace to Soulja, 'cause he was real Magnolia, yeah

And I fuck these hoes

All these bitches want Young Carter, Young Carter
The fireman and firestarter, need water
Woo, all of your bitches, they poo
All of my bitches, they're new
They got more bitches than you, all of these hoes in cahoots
But my bitch keep me in the loop
She blow me like hot Campbell's soup
My woadies come out like a troop, innocent bystander, oops
Enjoying my financial fruits, I'm in a pineapple coupe
Passin' you up like juke, turnin' heads like a screw
Give that ho a tip, enough to buy a whip
Give that ho some sip, she fall asleep, I dip
I'm rich, bitch, Money, Mitch
What's in that, bag?
14 bricks (You got 14 bricks in that bag?)
Used to, used to drive a Masi'
Used to be locked up, with the dude that stalked Ashanti
Used to be in Hollygrove with goons that caught them bodies
Tunechi got so many hoes, they call me John Thotty
Tell your bitch I'm Mr. Biggs, my nigga, Ron Isley
I'm kamikaze-in' you niggas, Ronda Rousey
It's New Orleans, Milly Rock, Trukfit to the socks
OVO Jordans, the ones that haven't dropped, uh
Waitin' for Carter 5 to drop, uh
It's the, it's the Roc, uh
Tell them bitches it's the Roc, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I ain't from Magnolia, but Tunechi still a soldier
And rest in peace to Soulja, 'cause he was real Magnolia, yeah

[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh)
Hey-ay

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)
Hey-ay

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee!)

[Break]
Ah, hee-hee-hee!
Hee! Hoo!

[Chorus]
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo! (Ouw!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(You know what you did to me, baby)
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no (No-no-no, no-no-no)
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no-no)

[Outro]
She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breakin' my heart, babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
(Don't call me Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
(Hoo! She's not at the scene)
Billie Jean is not (Hee! Aaow! Ooh!)
Billie Jean is (Ooh)
Billie Jean is (Ah!) (Hoo!)
(Oh) Oh darlin'
Oh yeah (Oh babe)

You know you ain't
Not my lover (Hee!)
You know you can't
Not my lover (Hee!) (Ooh!)
Not my lover (Oh)
Not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
Billie Jean is
Billie Jean is
Billie Jean is not my lover
I want to stay South of the River
With the chains and the gold
We could be out here together;
But, you have places to go

Watching the sunshine blaze the gray
I don't know why you wouldn't stay
You should come South of the River
Where the loving is gold

You should come South of the River
This is where it all starts
I think that we could stay here forever
Lie on the roof til' it's dark

And when the last bus pulls away
I swear that I almost heard you say
"I should move South of the River."
I want to get to know
I want to get to know, oh
I want to stay South of the River

Whip it like a big booty bitch

Culinary arts, let the students in

And I whip it hard if it come easy
Whip it up like I'm Young Jeezy
Free pussy and Free Meechie
Big smoke got me deep breathin'
Deep dick got her sweet dreamin'
You ain't shit, you just pre-season
You ain't lit, you just pre-heated
Can't quit, I'ma keep leanin'
Smoke gas, I'ma keep premium
Green, green, and the money senior
Dope man with a hundred needles
No ass ever come between us
Dirty cash, not a money cleaner
Use the black card to split the coke
Jungle fever, cheatin' on the Visa
Speakin' of jungle, bitch work at Cheetahs
Had stripes since my first Adidas
Bought pints now I purchase liters
Shark bite, I'm a person eater
Walk light on the dirt beneath you
I'm in the throne and you in the bleachers
All day long, even on the weekends
Get off my lawn, cuttin' on the sprinklers, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Big house, long hallways
Got ten bathrooms, I could shit all day, nigga
Yeah, I'm the shit all day, nigga
Yeah, presidential suite or the penthouse

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Black skinny jeans, get the lint out
Damn, I left my lint roller at your bitch's house
That's his house
She sent some nude pics for me to pick out
The pussy fat and pink like a pig, I'ma pig out
Yeah I'm Blood, but I got some cool Crips that I can send out
Ain't no loose lips, take the cruise ship, ain't tryna swim out
Brrrt, brrrt, that the money counter, let it print out
Brrrt, brrrt, that's the Uzi, we call it big mouth
Huh, I lost my mind but I'm still mastermindin'
Tryna find the silver linin', found the platinum linin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]

Got ten bathrooms, I could shit all day, nigga (all day, yeah)

That's a strange sign, I can't really trust you
Ain't have a clue that I was working so hard to get where I'm at
I can vision this shit, had a dream
Call me Jay Luther King
Now I woke up and I'm living this shit
Time change, people change too
Never let the people change you
Pack made it safe, we straight
Pull off in a cocaine coupe
Got two snow bunnies with me
One Becky one named Sue
Sue don't really do what Becky do
Becky sexual with the crew (gang)
2000 at HollyGrove
This the year of the Mula
I put that on Mula
Pull out the passports, fuck a city hoe

Like when MJ dropped 69 on the Cavs in OT
Keith Moore with a low fade
Fiends still in the Stone Age
Goons in the crowd strapped hope
They don't clap while I'm on stage
Side talk, I'm immune to
Been the new kid in the new school
I ain't too fond of the new school
I'm an old soul in a young man
Bump Johnny Cash when I cruise through
Two cokes still a hot boy
But I'm too cool, I'll hold a grudge 'till I beat whoever I lose to
We the ones who had good girls, by the pool snortin' up lines
I'm the reason all the bad college bitches never showed up on time
We the one who had Cristiano in Japan throwing up signs
Born to lose but I built up, always knew growing up
I think I'm made for this shit

[Hook: Jay Jones]
Wait, I think I'm made for this shit

Hoodybaby in the kitchen when the smoke clears
I can clear 200,000 like my throat, yeah

Bitches call me Hoody bear, i'm koala-fied
Oh that went over your head? I'm over qualified
Really make them guns fly, bitch I'm stuck in overdrive
Trick or treat, live or die? Let my bro decide
All this trapping in my Jesus piece like show you right

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
L-A-T
Moms was hard on me with grades
Had to turn them B's to A's
Now im turning words to paper
Turning birds to haters fry their wings and legs
I prefer a leg, I deserve a raise
Should be overpaid, I just toast the bread
I ain't burn the bread
Made it gold instead turning more than heads
Take a lemonhead, turn it into bread
Got the golden dreads, got me on the meds
Had a talk with Tez about me on the meds
Forgot the shit he said, I'm out here on the edge
Don't try to sell me, Reg
I'll knock ya off the ledge
I'll pop off on sketch
Spraying like pledge, bullets gon' spread
Catch 'em like Dez, all in ya ass
Handguns in the console
I'm a shark in the fishbowl
Running plays on my rich hoes
Sunny days in the North Pole
I'm a play, play my part hoe
Turn a rock to the charcoal
Heart throb but my heart cold
Short ride on a long road
Long days and them long nights
Big dogs and we all bite
Big words just all hype
Small talk, large price
Alright, not nice
Heart cold, hot ice
She sucks, she wipes, she swallows, drops mic
Stop light, stop running your mouth 'fore I run in your mouth
From a hundred dollas to a hundred accounts
Got fuckin problems, tryna figure 'em out
Niggas run in your house waiting on my count
Bitches in they house waiting on my call
Mula Gang, Mula Gang, Mula Gang
Yes Lord
I think I'm made for this shit

[Intro: Gudda Gudda]
L-A-T! Gudda!

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
Ok, I'm shining, beaming, glossing
Big timing, stunting and flossing
Dangerous, approach with caution
If I sneeze, you in a coffin
Chasing paper, we do that often
Two bad bitches, thick like horses
Let 'em snort cocaine at a party
Leave 'em stiff like rigor mortis
Don't try to race, this car got horses
The pint we drink, it costs a mortgage
Flow so dope, man, you can't copy
You can't bite it, you can't forge it
I got bars with more in storage
Watch me blossom, watch me flourish
If you try to touch my porridge
You will feel my chucks like Norris
All my bitches think I'm gorgeous
Get a massage while I'm recording
Single like a dollar bill
I am a free man, call me Morgan
Come and slob on my knob like corn on the cob
Check in with me and go and do your job
Now lay in the bed and then give me head
I don't have to ask, I don't have to beg
Yeah, I'm bumping Three Six Mafia
In the Phantom of the Opera
Choppers from Yugoslavia
Bake niggas like tilapia
L.A.T., Young Money mafia
Try but it ain't no stopping us
Why? We back by popular demand
Quit baller-blocking us
Lord Gudda, praise a nigga
MOB, I'm brazy, nigga
Hard at work, I'm slaving, nigga
Yeah, surf's up, I'm wavy, nigga
Percocet and Adderall, man, I could walk on water
I got a son, his name Jaylen and he want all your daughters
I'm a landmine, got this by a landslide, I'm racing, nigga
Cruise control, I'm pacing nigga, turn around, I'm waving, nigga
Gudda!

[Verse 2: HoodyBaby]
There's a Glock clocked by my pantsline
Young dreadhead, throwing gang signs (What else?)
I got bands like it's band time
Posted up at granny house, trappin' off the landline
What's all that hootin' and hollerin'? I'm who bring the dollars in
Drop the top, it was botherin', now go let your mother in
The cocaine from Colombia, the chopper is sovereign
Got a house full of bricks, you can call it remodelin'
Bitch, grow up, it's only head if you swallowin'
Baby, get to geekin', get to geekin' and gobblin'
Your friends think I'm bad, they must be looking for trouble then
It's a foam party, I be bustin' they bubbles then
Then I hop in the whip, make a play on some bricks
My homies say pull up, we just came up on a lick
I'm in the ends with the sticks, it's the revenge of the Crips
Hoe, you know it's OHB, I brought the gang in this bitch

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Hoe, you know it's LAT, we almost famous, lil bitch
On our toes and on our feet like Usher Raymond, lil bitch
And you know Lil Wayne is the shit and you straining to shit
Fat head, long neck she 'bout to strangle this dick
I got more bang bang in a stick than butane in a bic
I got my whole gang gang in this bitch and you came with a bitch
I got more purple rain than Prince and more cocaine than Mitch
I got more shit and piss and make more money than cents (sense)
She got more hips than tits, she got more tricks than tips
She put my name on her tongue and then she licks her lips
LW, Lil Wayne, to them, to her, that's length and width
Kill you for me, she will like Jada Pinkett Smith
It's the return of the Blood, 'bout to turn up and thug
We wan' know who got the chicken and show the colonel the gun
Man, my dirty-ass stripper take a bath in ones
Make her milk these fuckin' niggas like some Cap'n Crunch
Motherfuckers try to test me, I ain't cram for one
All these fuckin' karats on me, bitch, I'm Rabbit son
Happy birthday, I already got the gift of gab at one
Motherfuckers run they mouth until they cramp they tongue
Play pussy, get fucked; play ass, get stuck
Playtime is over, that ass is grass and now that grass get cut
Duct tape and we quackin' up then beat 'em with more bats
Than a vampires and Draculas, ashes to ashes to dust
Buried just for staring, yellow tape like canaries
We all bite and no talk, my sharks breaking your aquarium
Out of the ordinaries and went to the art of hustling
When you see them thieves coming
Know that loyalty's amongst them
L.A.T.!

[Intro]
I just want everybody to have a good time
I really do

[Verse]
Take me far away
'Cause I know my words can be a waste of breath
Space is running low
She thinks I'm guilty of this crime
But I don't think I'll wait to tomorrow
Tomorrow's so far
It seems like a flaw in design
I seek you out and you never seem to have the time

Mirage, so careful now
Too close, you're finding out
Is it me being blind?
Notice that I'm high as a kite
And now I'm pacing too fast to speak
It's me, so fine
I was only looking to be with you now
So take it or leave it, take it or treat it
So high
I dunno why I do this to myself
So high, so high, so high
So high

[Outro]
"Oh hello, I didn't see you there"

[Chorus]
Been a while since I been home
It took a second 'cause my baby don't know—I
Been so hesitant, I'm such a no show—why?
My baby got fed up with my ego

Oh—wasn't even thinkin' we were going worldwide
Figured it was better than the southern life

[Verse 1]
What if I ask you 'Why?'
If you can realize
You say I never fight
Why do you want me to?

[Verse 2]
But you went and did it wrong anyway
I haven't seen your face in a while
I know you didn't wanna have me around
But why you gotta take so long?

[Verse 3]
Headed back to the Bay
People say it's crazy now
Honestly it feels the same
I need to touch the ground
I need to hit the Town
No need to plan a ride when we get down.

[Chorus]
It's been a while since I've been home
It took a second 'cause my baby don't know—I
Been so hesitant, I'm such a no show—why?
My baby got fed up with my ego, oh
Oh—wasn't even wishin' to be known worldwide
Figured it was better than the southern life

[Verse]
Grand mommy told me: "Don't run from no police" (Fuck 'em)
Grand mommy told me: "Watch out for yo partners" (I love 'em)
Saying "They too much older, won't you stay in your range?"
I been trying to sponge, been trying to know some things
See the mailman keep coming, and the bills keep on coming in
And all you wanna do is fight me on this shit
You say: "Don't go bending yo wrist, don't go being no sissy."
OK
"Don't go locking no doors, you ain't paying no rent in this bitch," OK
Checks I used to bring
They wouldn't make no difference in this bitch
Now the checks I bring, I mean
Who else paying the rent in this bitch?
Landlord see me outside, wanna take a picture
I said I gotta autograph on the check you can take it with ya
He said "The house on sale, you wanna buy it?"
I say, "Not this one."
Gotta make moves, not a ton of moves, tryna keep it simple
This summer
Said you didn't wanna go with me
That's a bumma, bumma, bumma, yeah
Boppin' at Bacchus, that was the first parade
Bounce remixes of Aaliyah had the spinal cords crackin', crackin'
Cups of methazine had 'em lean like Michael Jackson
Yeah
And you was fuckin' with your nose trying to be a Jackson
Oh yeah
Poolside convo, about your summer last night

And you like to smoke when you drink and we be cross-faded, oh baby
Yeah, when our signals get crossed, I hate it
'Cause the more you treat me royal, I adore you
That's why I don't mind doing all these things for you
It's only right we spend our lonely nights
In the 'Rari down Sunset, revving them pipes (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I ain't T.I. but you get whatever you like (Skrt)
TY, he get you the keys tonight (No, no, no, no)

[Verse 1]
On Mount Tam, we dropped it in the morning
A sudden dive into exactly who I think I am
Oh damn, I feel like I made this up
One man making choices for himself
Two shaking voices often tell a lie

[Chorus]
Is there love? (Dressed in linen)
She's a Mona Lisa gone
Is there love? (Diva within)
She's the kind to lead you on

[Verse 2]
Why's a psycho on the roof again?
Skipping therapy to make a friend
It's a hot day in the city
Don't let the heat make your decisions
You're wilting with self-pity
Change it up for next season

[Refrain]
There's another one for you
Oh there's another one for you

[Chorus]
Is there love? (Dressed in linen)
She's a Mona Lisa gone
Is there love? (Diva within)
She's the kind to lead you on

[Refrain]
There's another one for you
Oh there's another one for you
Oh, another for you
Another one for you

[Outro]
Another one for you and me too

Da na na na na, da na na na na

I'm losing my mind because
I hope that we can be more than just friends

[Chorus]
Fireworks, I feel like glitter
And every time you come around, I feel like glitter (How ya feel?)
You're the one that I needed in my life (How ya feel?)
You're the one that I needed in my life

[Verse 1]
Ayo, mirror mirror on the wall, who the brightest of them all?
I never been the darkest one 'cause my self esteem is tall
So I never seen eye-to-eye with y'all niggas, ayo
Uno peso, never paid attention to what niggas gotta say-o
So I keep that buck, I ain't give no fuck
They ain't build me up so I block 'em like Lego
Feelin' glitter, feelin' good and great
Got the burner, got the heat, like wait
Got the shit, it's all up on that hip
I'll use it on myself on the day you dip
Got that 4, 5, 7, track 8 for me
Baby doll, I hope you agree
Because you light my

[Chorus]
Fireworks, I feel like glitter (I don't even know what that means)
And every time you come around, I feel like glitter

'Cause I love having you around (I love)
'Cause I love having you around

[Verse 2]
Yeah, look at my face, look at that joy
This is one sided, yeah, I can't lie
We ain't gon' work out, we a fat boy
Yeah, sumo, got it, memo
Pale skin see-through, must be a window
'Cause you ain't an L, could be a DJ
When I see you, my heart beat changes tempo
Yeah, simple, that's what I want but I can't
That's who you are but I ain't (How ya feel?)
We can track 10 skiptrace, I'm caught in your quicksand, wait
Please don't save me

[Bridge]
Ooooh

Boy, my bedroom floor is a cereal burial, I'm serious
I ate 'em all, dry boxes, bodies, yeah I caught 'em
If we're talkin' 'bout real meals, ask my stomach, he ain't saw 'em
I've been in this fuckin' room so long
My eyeballs are turning to drywall
My friends suck, fuck 'em, I'm over 'em
"Hi y'all, y'all ain't hit me all-day
What the fuck is the problem? Is it me?
'Cause I'm not solved, I'm... bored"

[Chorus: Rex Orange County & Anna of the North]
Find some time, find some time to do something
Find some time, find some time to do something
Find some time, find some time to do something
(Oh)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Bored and getting desperate as hell
(Desperate, using, texting, amusing)
Cellular not amusing and I hope someone will
Message me with some plans that are amusing as well
'Cause I haven’t seen the exit of these walls since before this morning
Morning, morning, morning, morning
(Morning, oh, what the fuck?)
Got some cars I can handle but nowhere for performance
My stomach angry and yellin', I need some food, I could order
But I hate eating solo
Need someone, we can loiter in parking lots
As sunsets at the border, yeah
Ringy dingy dong, I can't be alone
I been starting to feel like I don't know anyone
So now I'm staring at my ceiling fuckin' blowing
Like I have no idea where I'm going
Tick tock
(Damn, gotta get outta here)

[Chorus: Rex Orange County, Anna of the North and Tyler, the Creator]
Find some time, find some time to do something
(Hey, can y'all help me right quick?)
Find some time, find some time to do something
Find some time, find some time to do something (Tick tock)
(Ti-ti-tick tock) (Oh)

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Mula!

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Like Adam in the Garden of Eve
My bitch got an apple bottom and she swallow my seeds
Follow my lead, fire I breathe, water my seed
And sit back and watch money grow on trees
Droppin' seeds like classics, these hoes drop they asses
I drop a seed in her panties if it smell like pansies
I'm a banshee in her panties, nigga, ask your mammy
Never played golf, but got a driver and a Caddy
Whole squad slammin' like Onyx, you know Sticky Fingaz
Some drop science, I'm droppin' English
Even if Tyler named the song "Flower"
No seeds in the bud, still don't trust bugs
I'm down

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Lil Wayne]
Droppin' seeds on these niggas, they can't fuck with the boy (Mula!)
I'm droppin' seeds on these bitches for the love of the sport
I'm droppin' seeds, got this garden, flowers poppin' of course
I'm droppin' seeds, motherfucker, Weezy Baby the boy, yugh!

[Intro: Shane Powers]
Right now we got some new music only here on Golf Radio!
(God I love this sample)
We're going to dance
And exercise
And have some fun

[Chorus]
I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time

[Verse 1]
Boy, I need a Kleenex
How I got this far? Boy, I can't believe it
That I got this car, so I take the scenic
Passenger a white boy, look like River Phoenix
First, happy birthday!
You bitch-ass nigga, yup, I'm thirsty
Them little shots that you threw, they ain't hurt me
I ain't fuck with your bitch-ass in the first place

[Chorus]
I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time

[Verse 2]
Nat Turner would be so proud of me
'Cause all these motherfuckers got they style from me
I bet they all looking from the crowd at me
And if I ask them, they would bow at me
But you're a house nigga, so you don't know
How that shit go, with my big lips and my big nose
And my big dick and my short hair
'Cause you already know how slow my shit grow

[Bridge]

Been the man with a pickle plan, niggas know the dill
When I sell the carnival, I bet I get a 100 mil' (Hey)
Next line will have 'em like "whoa"
I've been kissing white boys since 2004
One me, two feet, three M's
Four, five, six years ago sucked
Seven figure conversations with Converse finalized
'Cause Vans fucked up
I'ma read commas, you gon' leave comments
Saying what I shoulda did, but you ain't did nada
You ain't important
I'ma keep sporting
All smiles over here
Shout out to The Garden
(Tick-tock)
(And that's a fact boy!)
And I just handle all my business like a chessboard
(Tick tock, tick, tock)
And at them Golf boys? That's my motherfucking set, boy
Hard pill to swallow like some thick soda
Walk weird 'cause my pockets look like thick Yoda
With a Skywalker, riding 'round solar
Anakin skin Sprite, and my tint cola
Getting neck from a broad like some big shoulders
Till I bust like that 9 in ya heat holster
Everything I say is hot, bitch I speak toaster
And the bread orthodox like I eat kosher
Shout out to (shhh) they gave a big loaf of
Green bread, got me chilling like a clean sofa
What's that thick odor?
Young Millie T
A young, focused black boy, oh silly me
(I ain't got time!)

[Verse 4]
Better talk shit
'Cause I'm either in my Cons or my Golf shit
Pants got a lil flood, nigga pipe down
I'm Lil Boosie, Lil Boosie, way I wipe down
(Boy, I ain't got time!) Yeah, right now
'Cause niggas dying every day and I ain't light brown
And i-D ain't wanna give a nigga no post
So I went and did a 12-page spread in Vogue
(Nigga I ain't got time!)

[Outro]
Listen, man, I'm that boy
All you little niggas clones
Boy I fill that void
You better kill that noise
Turn around and remap route
When they see that boy with them big ears and that gap tooth
Tick, tock
Bitch
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Cause I ain't got ti-
Sugar
Oh!
You're so sweet
Fuck?
They should call you sugar
'Cause you're so s-
Hello?

[Chorus: Estelle]
Don't kill a rose
Before it could bloom
Fly, baby, fly
Out the cocoon

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
You don't have to hide
I can smell it in your eyes
That there's something more to say, baby
Them words
(Damn, run me back, yeah)

[Bridge: Estelle & Tyler, the Creator]
If I could, if I could
If you could
Find the words to say
Find the words to say
Find the words
In the garden
Shed
Go

[Chorus: Estelle]
Don't kill a rose
Before it could bloom
Fly, baby, fly
Out the cocoon

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Ayo
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
For the garden
That is where I was hidin'
That was real love I was in
Ain't no reason to pretend
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
Garden shed for the garçons
Them feelings that I was guardin'
Heavy on my mind
All my friends lost
They couldn't read the signs
I didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location
And they ain't wanna walk
Truth is, since a youth kid, thought it was a phase
Thought it'd be like the phrase; "poof," gone
But, it's still goin' on
Big fan of the beige tan
Polka dot nose, how it goes
Had to keep it on the subwoofer
A couple butterflies wanna float
But I was always like, "Eh"
Barely interested, but bagged just to brag to my boys like, "Bruh"
This is a crucial subject matter
Sensitive like cookin' batter
'Til the temperature that's risin'
Steppin' on that ladder, tryna
Grab the rings of Saturn, I'ma
Planet by the time you hear this
Shit and chatter 'bout the heat
It will not fuckin' matter

[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
Shit

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
My mother warned me that some niggas ain't my right hand
To trust her, only my heart and that elder white man
His name is Clancy, I fancy him, gotta give him props
He half the reason why dealerships even let me cop
So now I'm speedin' and tryna drive away from the fact
That she was right, so I triple left, tryna double back
The streets are filled with some clues like how I ain't notice that? (Hey, how I ain't see that?)
Fuck it, I seen some familiar stuck in the cul-de-sac
I pull up, get out, what up? I wanna help
But what you want for some, some niggas
Really don't want for themself
Now do I stay? Do I go? That's my dilemma
And traffic is picking up, if I don't leave I'ma get stuck (Skrt)
So I speed off, we talk barely and it seems awkward
And I heard through some words that you're off it
I got too much drive, don't wanna steer off path
And crash and get distracted
But I listen to that weather man 'cause it might rain
Keep my windshield wipers prepared
'Cause y'all throw so much shade (So much)
And I got jacket in trunk, but that's in the front
I also got power for both of us if you're ever in need of jump
Just let me know, my nigga

[Chorus: Jaden Smith & Tyler, the Creator]
I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em (Skrrt!)
I had to switch gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Snakes in the grass, but I walk
I got some new boots, on the back it says GOLF
So I be prepared for their bites, they're all talk
I left the condom in the grass so fuck off
Watchin' Clarence in a mansion with nobody in it
Young successful nigga, ride McLaren with no windows tinted
I drive by piggies when I'm in it 'cause it feels amazin'
The irony is I stopped eatin' bacon
Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm still hungry, oh he lonely
All my friends talk about their hoes and tenderonies
But all I can show 'em is a couple cars and more things
That I've made in the couple past month, he's on, please
Everyone is a sheep, me, a lone wolf
Nobody gon' make a peep 'cause everyone wants some wool
Since everyone is a sheep, not everyone here is cool
Man I'd rather drown in a pool by myself
Than fuck with their fleece
See, man, T-Man fans be seesaw
Wind blows, they go, which way, who knows?
One day, "Fuck no," the next day, "Okay"
But fuck y'all, I know that T is four for four
I just want that garden and that Batmobile
Good health, success, time on earth worthwhile
Find somebody who love me and raise a couple of lizards
But my vehicle's good for now, that's in a couple of miles
Now keep it pushin', nigga

[Chorus: Jaden Smith & Tyler, the Creator]
I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em (Skrrrrrt!)
I had to switch gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
Fuck, okay, next one
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Gotta watch out for the potholes
Ooh, said watch out for the potholes
Haha

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, o-

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Any time I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now, I don't wanna wake up

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator, with Kali Uchis]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, eye
Wonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my daydreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
So...

[Chorus: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
Can I get a kiss?
And can you make it last forever?
I said, I'm 'bout to go to war (Uh-huh)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said, I'm 'bout to go to war (I'm 'bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Ugh, switch it up

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I said, okay, okay, okay, okey-dokey, my infatuation
Is translating to another form of what you call it? (Love)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you, I've been looking
Stop the waiting 'fore I stop the chasing, like an alcoholic
"You don't understand me"—what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose-tinted cheeks, yeah, it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar-honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah, I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Ugh!

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator, with Kali Uchis]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, eye
Wonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my daydreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
So...

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
And can you make it last forever? (Make it last forever)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to go to war)
I don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis]
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, o—
(La la, la la la la, la la)
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, o—
(La la, la la la, la la)
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, o—
(La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la la)
One more time?

[Tyler, The Creator]
Sometimes, I sit in my room and think about us

[Shane Powers]
"It's Golf Radio, you're on the air with Shane Powers
Taking requests... Uh, What’s uh, pick that one... What's uh... What's your name? Hello? Um, okay, well, since you want to be Mr. Fucking-Secret-Agent, what song you wanna hear?"

[Wyatt Navarro]
The one about me

[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
Ayo
Let's take it back to them days
Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor
Carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured
Rent-A-Center calling everyday
Nobody home, they're knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt (Skrrt!)
In toys I only dreamed that I could afford
Now I roll through Okaga

[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Tyler the Creator]
I ride to California (Yeah)
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me (Oh, ooh)
Simp sun shinin' on me (ayy, yeah)
Slick circles float roll
Out this world
Yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The  Creator]
Run it, run it, run it, run it
I rock, I roll, I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I grow
(Let's go!)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that just may be my ego
But don't be too cool, you might freeze
Because niggas get stuck in the cold (Man, look at this ice)
Shit weighs a ton
Water your garden, my nigga (Stunt on these niggas!)
Tell these black kids they could be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too (What the fuck?)
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mall grip with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that, man, it feels like I'm winning (I'm winnin', nigga)
Went from statistic to millionaire
CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark
Then they forget when I get in my car

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me (Oh, ooh)
Simp sun shinin' on me
Slick circles roll float
Out this world
Yeah, yeah
Run it, run it, run it, yeah
(Ohh, ohh!)

[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The  Creator]
I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I—
(Let's go!)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Flower boy T, nigga, that's me
Rooted from the bottom, bloomed into a tree
Took a lil' while, nigga makin' leaves
Keep it in my branches so my family can eat
Favorite color green, energy is skrong
Giving niggas life, birdies and the beez
Droppin' them seeds, not what you want
You don't know what I keep in the trunk

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Ah, shit!

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Ahh, ahh
Ahh
Run it, run it, run it, run it
Run it
Run it
Run it

[Intro]
Bitch, fuck! (Uh, uh, fuck)
You have a question?

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
How many cars can I buy 'til I run outta drive?
How much drive can I have until I run outta road?
How much road can they pave until I run outta land?
How much land can it be until I run in the ocean?
Niggas go with the motions and all the plans
See, I was never into the beaches and all the sands
See, I was in the woods with flowers, rainbows, and posies
Fallin' outta my pocket, but y'all want to know if I swam to cool down
How much cooler can I get until I run out of fans?
How many fans can I have until they turn on the AC?
If the AC blow up, well then I'm TNT, I'm gone

[Bridge: Rex Orange County]
I'm gone and I'm finished
And I ain't seen my friends in a minute
Guessing nothing lasts forever
Yeah, nothing lasts forever
Nothing sticks together
Sick of sitting in doubt
Please let me figure this out, out

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Shout out to the girls that I led on
For occasional head and always keepin' my bed warm
And tryin' their hardest to keep my head on straight
And keepin' me up enough 'til I had thought I was airborne
How many raps can I write 'til I get me a chain?
How many chains can I wear 'til I'm considered a slave?
How many slaves can it be 'til Nat Turner arise?
How many riots can it be until them Black lives matter?
Niggas click-clack splatter, (Pew) pew that nigga
Life a game of basketball, you better shoot that nigga
'Cause if that cop got trigger, he better pull (Yeah)
'Cause when I get pulled over, I usually play it cool (Skrt)
'Cause I know what I'm drivin' is usually paid in full
And my ego and possessions, will not let me be one (Nah)
Because I got a mansion, my mansion got some rooms
Them rooms got some windows and my windows got some views (Yup)
Them views get some stares and my backyard does too
And if you walk to the bottom you'll prolly see a pool
You better not drown, keep them ten toes up
'Cause if them ten toes down, that mean that you fucked up
And that's what I swim in

[Outro: Rex Orange County]
And if I drown and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
And if I crash and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
And if I fall and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
I'm wondering if I don't come back
Maybe then I'll know
Don't come back
Don't come back
Ayy, don't come back
Don't come back
No, no

[Verse 4: Money Mark]
Let's take it to the streets, where young niggas like me
Come through 7-3 lord draw in the breeze
With a pocket full of cheese, trying get me a beat
Pull up to the club on duces
Only way you get in the front bitch, you best be elusive
No more truce, and all those hoes
Tryna get a nigga dough with some rabbit ass hands
Do me favor, climb in the back of da dunk
Let me pump up da funk, and hit your chin with my jaw
Keep a tech in the trunk
Lay back bitch, but the beat keep me crunk
Come to your spot, two Glocks in the pump

[Verse]
Okay, love is only funny when you're tongue tied
Find out if it's you that's really cross eyed
Woke up only 'cause I thought I had to
Person in the picture's really not you

[Refrain]
Missed it when you said you can't make it
Listen, if it's me I know how that goes
Give me no ideas, I just waste them
Give me no ideas, I just waste them

[Hook]
Don't try to understand what you are
Don't try to make it more than it is
Don't try to understand what you are
Don't try to make it more than it is

[Refrain]
Missed it when you said you can't make it (try it again)
Listen, if it's me I know how that goes (wake up)
Give me no ideas, I just waste them

[Outro]
Oh yeah

[Intro]
Ah yeah
Ah yeah

[?]
Have you ever heard a sweet sound too?

[?]

[Verse 1]
I need a new attitude, with a frame of mind
Got a backseat view, with a pastel sunset
And you still feel blue (let me turn it around now)
Baby give me something, a new attitude

[Hook]
Got me staring out my window (tryna find myself)
Watching shadows touch the light
Got me staring out my window (tryna find love)
Got me staring out my window (tryna find myself)
Watching shadows touch the light
Got me staring out my window

[Verse 2]
This is not fantasy
This is as real as me
I would not lie
It's a sign I just threw my cellphone
Overstayed my welcome
I think I could've left you standing there alone
I think there's somethings that are better off unknown
(ah-ah-ah, tryna find that one)
(ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah)
(ay ay)

[Hook]
Got me staring out my window
Watching shadows touch the light
Got me staring out my window
Got me staring out my window
Watching shadows touch the light
Got me staring out my window

[Outro: Chaz]
I'm just trying to paint my picture as best I can
I got all this weight falling in my hands
I don't wanna diss your love
But, I gotta let this go

[Verse 1]
You really wanna be with her
You wanted someone who was different
You run across the city with her
You end up in a labyrinth

[Verse 2]
Again, I kept you up too late
You lay down in bed and say
"I don't even know but I've got to go"

This apocalypse is never ending
Starting a second life and keep moving

A shake in your voice is all I hear when you tell me you can't decide
Who's gonna wipe away those tears if you come out alive?
You say there's a missing piece
Are you searching for both of us?
Did you want me to kiss and leave?
I can do this without a shove

[Chorus]
I left my baby down in San Francisco
I can never leave another one like her
Slowed down somewhere outside of Reno
Situations making me tired

[Verse 1]
I swear I spent most my night just looking
Up in the sky while my mind imagines
Given where I stand now, I'm alone in a crowd
Whereabout, I don't know, I couldn't tell you where I'll go

[Bridge]
Got a tendency to stay inside my head
Wanna get a piece of what they have instead
Got a tendency to stay inside my head
Wanna get a piece of what they have instead

[Chorus]
I left my baby down in San Francisco
I can never leave another one like her
Slowed down somewhere outside of Reno
Situations making me tired

[Verse 2]
I swear I spent most my night just looking
Up in the sky while my mind imagines
Given where I stand now, I'm alone in a crowd
Whereabout, I dunno, I couldn't tell you where I'll go

[Bridge]
Got a tendency to stay inside my head
Wanna get a piece of what they have instead
Got a tendency to stay inside my head
Wanna get a piece of what they have instead
Got a tendency to stay inside my head
Wanna get a piece of what they have instead
Got a tendency to stay inside my head
Wanna get a piece of what they have instead

[Part 1: W.I.W.W.T.W.]

[Toro y Moi]

[Verse 1]
Know that nothing's after you
Change it up, it's just a view
Can you visualize?

How can you hold it inside?
Sad how it makes me cry

Made it wherever you are
Every second feels a blur
I turn it off, it turns on
First it was here, now it's gone

[Chorus]
Alright I lied when I said that you weren't on my mind
As if I hadn't called, as if you were worried
What is wrong with this world?
It's got me thinking too much

[Verse 2]
Life got in the way again
(Thinking is a disease)
Black and white images
And all I could do is cry
Oh, how could you hold it inside?
Dare you to say something, say it while they're watching
Scary truth is no one can find what has happened
I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
Alright I lied when I said that you weren't on my mind
As if I hadn't called, as if you were worried
What is wrong with this world?
It's got me thinking too much

[Part 2: Be]

[Madeline Kenney]

[Chorus]
And I know there's no reason
Why does there have to be?
And I know there's no answer
When I call don't pick up

[Verse]
It's coming now
It's got me laughing
I'm on the floor
No guessing now
I'm in the corner
I can't get up

Don't call me back
Don't get me laughing
I can't shut up

[Chorus]
I know there's no reason
Why does there have to be?
I know there's no answer
When I call don't hang up

[Intro]
Dawg I used to fuck her on the weekend
And I swear that pussy smell like peaches
Instagram the photo with no filter
Or SnapChat me that pussy with no features

[Chorus]
She let me fuck her on the weekday
And told me not to tell nobody
Left the party with her three friends
We smokin' since I hit the lobby
All these bitches want is trues
And some music they can do 'em too
We on this fuckin' tour bus
Made it this far, now what are you gon' do, for me?

[Verse]
What happened to this?
'Cause we got it in
And we get it in on the side of the city
And you gotta feel me
I'm smellin' like hundreds and 20s and 50s
Inside of the buildin'
She got on money, it's time to come get it
Come ask for these digits
All this time that I spent on you
Now you gon' tell me 

[?]
All this time that I spent on you
Girl you know you have to give me some
All this money that I spent on you
Just for you to tell me that it's wrong
For all the time that I spent on you
Girl you know I had to write this song

[Chorus]
She let me fuck her on the weekend
And told me not to tell nobody
Left the party with her three friends
We smokin' since I hit the lobby
All these bitches want is trues
And some music they can do 'em too
We on this fuckin' tour bus
Made it this far, now what are you gon' do, for me?

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Is really just making a transition of being a street hustler nigga to like a quote on quote star
Jahlil Beats, holla at me

[Verse: Snoop Dogg]
Me and my homeboys walked up in the strip club
37 deep, Long Beach, 20 crip, cous'
I could really give a fuck about a bitch, cous'
We in this motherfucker tryna hit a lick, cous'
Pouring drinks in a bitch face, tryna pop a bottle with a model
I bought a whole case
Glasses up, asses up
They paying homage to a nigga like a 

[?]
VIP scene looking like a massacre
This little bitch got mad 'cause I wouldn't dance with her
It's all a setup, I sat up, get up, and listen to the 

[?]
Balls up, real nigga, punk bitch move back
Let me get my vape on
Don't trip, super crip with my cape on
Bacon, how much am I gon' take on?
It don't matter at all, no ladder to fall
You either the bat or the ball
Through the heart of it all, true heart of it all
Sipping on this liquor, tryna hit this lick up
And when it's done, I make the pick up, kick up more dust
Word on the street's the shit had to be us
Now they wanna see us, so we LBC ya
I take off the 

[?] and I spin it on my rear
Yeah motherfucker, we up
Shoe box money with two Glocks on me
In case y'all put the motherfucking pigs on me
The little homie with the shit, homie
Tiny cous', big cous' look stoney
All he ever wanted was the money, but we'll take it all
And we never hesitate to break it off
So cold on the pole, baby shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off (shake it, shake it)
Yeah, shake it off, shake it off (take it off)
I see you get money, more dollars
No money, no pussy, no habla (no habla Ingles)

No money, no pussy, no habla (no habla Ingles)

So when you see a nigga sitting up in a ace of diamonds
Or you may see me

[Outro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It's really just making a transition of being a street hustler nigga to like a

[Intro: B.o.B]
Yo, If you are listening into this right now, that means you’ve, that means you have picked up on the transmission
Bobby Ray, bandz
London Jae, bandz
Zayto, bandz
Yah, Bandz
East side want some more
West side want some more
North side want some more
South side want some more

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Everybody ain’t a free thinker
(SHH calm down)
Every doc ain’t got a clean needle
(SHH calm down)
Every chopper ain’t a street sweeper
(SHH calm down)
Whips so foreign it ain’t street legal

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, and I’m passing by, like a UFO, like an astronaut
Saw a news report on channel 5
I done cracked the code with an open mind
They done tapped my phone, tapped my line
Spying on my notes, I can’t type shit down
On televisions they’ve reversed the lenses, now they’re watching you
While you sleep inside in your crib tonight!
Could be the CIA
Or the NSA
Or the DEA
Or the FBI
NWO, better stay awoke or get left behind
Nigga THEY
Who are they?
They the reason that Obama hair done turned grey
Nigga THEY
They the reason Malcolm loaded up the AK
(Goddamn 47)
They be passing laws every time a hurricane happens
Or a plane crashes, or a school shooting
Grey magic, that’s what they practice while you change classes!
Hire shooters, MK Ultra college students

[?] in your spinal fluid, how they do it?

[Interlude: B.o.B]
American health care victims
American death care system
Cancer can be cured in many ways
But chemo will always kill ya
They say Eazy-E had AIDS
But it ain't affect none of them children
Feel like we all feel played
Like someone should solve this riddle
Fuck it, ima go back in

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
To be known is to be a stone
That’s why I am stoned
And I’m never home
My phone be on roam
I get it I’m gone
She say I’m a dog
I give her the what?
I give her that bone
I get in my zone
I look in the sky
We are not alone
Now is it a message or is it a blessing?
Could it be from heaven, or just a projection?
I’m sick of this guessin, this shit get depressin
We should walk up to the presses
We should walk up to the president’s office
Demanding they answer these questions! (BOW BOW)
Fuckin your mom with these backward flows
Ain’t rappin them same old Jurassic flows
Cities and tunnels that’s underground
Pyramids on the ocean floor
Ey, I wonder what NASA knows
I wonder what NASA knows
I wonder if what’s really out there
Is really what NASA shows, Bandz

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Everybody ain’t a free thinker
(SHH calm down) (I know, I know)
Every doc ain’t got a clean needle
(SHH calm down) (I know, I know)
Every chopper ain’t a street sweeper
(SHH calm down) (I know, I know)
Whips so foreign it ain’t street legal

[Outro: B.o.B]
East side want some more
West side want some more
North side want some more
South side want some more

[Refrain]
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the?

[Verse 1]
A tiger don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions from a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated, I got your number
'Cause you're a joker and I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe

[Pre-Chorus]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning, lay 'em up like

[Chorus]
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

[Verse 2]
Your game is tired, you should retire
You're 'bout cute as an old coupon expired
And karma's not a liar
She keeps receipts

[Pre-Chorus]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like

[Chorus]
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

[Refrain]
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the...?

[Chorus]
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

[Refrain]
They know what is what
Do they know?
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the...

[Verse 1]
Get a little drunk, get a little loud
Stupid me and my rebel mouth
Ain't all wrong but I ain't alright
Don't see the world in black and white
My grandma cried when I pierced my nose
I never liked doing what I was told
Don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause I ain't walkin' in your shoes

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't one to knock religion
Though it's always knockin' me
Always runnin' with the wrong crowd
Right where I want to be
And I ain't good at being careful
I just say what's on my mind
Like my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine

[Verse 2]
And maybe he would sit awhile
And render me an illegal smile
And I bet that he would understand
Just how I feel and who I am

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't one to knock religion
Though it's always knockin' me
Always runnin' with the wrong crowd
Right where I want to be
And I ain't good at being careful
I just say what's on my mind
Like my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine

[Bridge]
And I play my life like truth or dare
I'm not all here but I'm all there, yeah
And all the colors people paint me
Don't they know they'll never change me, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't one to knock religion
Though it's always knockin' me
Always runnin' with the wrong crowd
Right where I want to be
And I ain't good at being careful
I just say what's on my mind
Like my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine
Yeah, my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine

[Intro]
Ah yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh, lady, when you come on down
Won't you come on down
I said, to my town?
Oh, mama, when you come on down
Won't you come on down
I said, to my home?
Oh, lady, won't you move my way?
Can't you move my way?
I'm getting hazy
Oh, mama, when you give your lovin'
When you give your love
You drive me crazy

[Chorus]
Ah, mama, what you gonna do
With all that love in your heart?
Ah, mama, what you gotta say
About that love in your heart?
Oh, mama, when you walk this way
Why don't you give some lovin'?
Oh, mama, what you gonna do
With all that lovin' in your heart?

[Verse 2]
See, mama, gotta feel your everything
I feel your everything
I really wanna know
See, mama, when you shine, you're shinin' bright
Give your given right
I really want our love to grow
See, mama, when your heart is in its place
See that smilin' face
It's all I wanna do
See, mama, every time that you are near
It's when you're gonna fear
You're never wanna come back home

[Chorus]
Ah, mama, what you gonna do
With all that love in your heart?
Ah, mama, what you gotta say
About that love in your heart?
Oh, mama, when you walk this way
Why don't you give some lovin'?
Oh, mama, what you gonna do
With all that lovin' in your heart?

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Do you remember what I said
When I got down on my knees?
Gotta get your lovin', baby
Loving's all I need
Don't make me beg now, baby
Don't make me bleed
I gave you all a man could give
And you still walked out on me

[Chorus]
Ah, mama, what you gonna do
With all that love in your heart?
Ah, mama, what you gotta say
About that love in your heart?
Oh, mama, when you walk this way
Why don't you give some lovin'?
Oh, mama, what you gonna do
With all that lovin' in your heart?

[Outro]
Your heart
Your heart
Your heart
Your heart
Lovin'
Burnin'
Fire
Aw yeah

[Verse 1]
I didn't know there was a tower
Where they look out to the land
To see the people quickly passing by
This is for their own desire
As they spit down to the earth
To feel the power boiling in their veins

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah
Woah oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah!

[Chorus]
And the black smoke rises
From the fires, we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
Stand up in the cold

[Verse 2]
Many people are dividing
And a world apart with just one heart
Is bound to keel and fade away
None of us will be deciding
And the fate of man is in the hands
Of he who stands and heeds the call

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah
Woah oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah!

[Chorus]
And the black smoke rises
From the fires, we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
Stand up in the cold

[Bridge]
Oh oh, woah-woah
Oh oh, woah-woah
(We won't stand alone, we will stand up in the cold)
(We won't stand alone, we will stand up in the cold)
Stand up in the cold
We won't stand, yeah!

[Chorus]
And the black smoke rises
From the fires, we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
And the black smoke rises
From the fires, we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
Stand up in the cold

[Verse 1]
She is a lady, comes from all around
She's many places, but she's homeward bound
And now she walks kinda funny
I think she knows
Day by day by day
Our love grows
She's a lantern in the night
She's outta sight

[Pre-Chorus]
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma
Hey

[Chorus]
Turn to night, firelight
Star shines in her eye
Makes me feel like I'm alive
She's outta sight, yeah
Aw yeah
She's alright, she's alright, she's alright
She's outta sight, outta sight

[Verse 2]
Electric gold our love with tender care
Hills of satin grass and maiden's fair
Now she rides through the night
On a silver storm
Sword in hand
Our fate's torn
She's a sparrow of the dawn
Our love is born

[Pre-Chorus]
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma
Hey

[Chorus]
Turn to night, firelight
Star shines in her eye
Makes me feel like I'm alive
She's outta sight, yeah
Aw yeah
She's alright, she's alright, she's alright
She's outta sight, outta sight

[Bridge]
Yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
As the days pass by my mind
Are the wrong, the right
You are my sunshine
And as the night begins to die
We are the morning birds that sing against the sky

My head's killing me (Oh), I'm losing sleep

Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance

[Verse 1]
First things first: I, Poppa, freaks all the honeys
Dummies, Playboy bunnies, those wanting money
Those the ones I like cause they don't get nathan but penetration
Unless it smells like sanitation
Gar-bage
I turn like doorknobs
Heart throb never, Black and ugly as ever
However, I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi
Girls pee-pee when they see me
Navajos creep me in they teepee
As I lay down laws like Alan Kopit
Stop it - if you think they gonna make a profit
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns, get it?
Now tell your friends Poppa hit it, then split it
In two as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A
I don't know what the hell is stopping ya
I'm clocking ya, Versace shades watching ya
Once ya grin, I'm in—game begins
First I talk about how I dress in this
Diamond necklaces, stretch Lexuses
The sex is just immaculate from the back
I get
Deeper and deeper, help you reach the
Climax that your man can't make
Call him, tell him you'll be home real late
And sing the break, uh)

[Chorus: Total (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
Biggie, give me (I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
One more
Give me one more
Chance, and make me
Gimme one more chance (uh)
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
She's sick of that song on how it's so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is, Major Payne like Damon Wayans
Low Down Dirty, even, like his brother Keenan
Schemin', don't leave your girl around me!
True player for real, ask Puff Daddy
You ringing bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell
She beeped me meet me at twelve
Where you at? Flipping jobs, paying car notes?
While I'm swimming in your women like the breast stroke
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke—tongue all down her throat
Nothing left to do but send her home to you
I'm through—can you sing the song for me boo?

[Chorus: Total (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
Biggie, give me, one more
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Give me one more
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Chance, and make me
Gimme one more chance (uh)
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
So what's it gonna be? Him or me? (uh)
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crushed linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in ’em
The finest women I love with a passion
Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin'
High fashion, flying into all states
Sexing me while your man masturbates
Isn't this great?
Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only a client, I'm the player President (uh)

[Chorus: Total (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
Biggie, give me, one more
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Give me one more
Chance, and make me
Gimme one more chance (uh)
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance

[Outro: Total (The Notorious B.I.G.)]

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys (XCX)
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 1]
I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
And when they finally leave me, I'm all alone but
I'm lookin' down and my girls are blowin' my phone up
Them twenty questions, they askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I had to trash the hotel lobby

[Chorus]
But I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 2]
In every city I've got one with different ringtones
Flyin' from L.A. all the way to Puerto Rico
My girls are callin' me askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I can't even lie, you got me

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Bridge]
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
Darling, I can't stop it even if I wanted
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
Missed what you were sayin', I was miles away, yeah
Don't be mad, don't be mad
Not like I had a choice
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 1]
Now will there ever be a day that my niggas won't ride for me? For me?
Nah, nah, nah
And will there ever be a day that your bitch won't slide with me? Homie?
Nah, nah, nah
And will it ever be a day that your hands ain't up when a nigga on stage
I been rollin' up haze in the studio for days just to work for a wage
Now I'm on, fuckin' paid in this mothafucka
Who got a hit just like this? And got heart and rich like this?
Never failed, 20 years and he still got grip like this
And got kids with a super hot bitch like this
You spendin' time tryna get like this
I wrote a script like this, I'm on some shit like
I'm at home on the track, nigga, this my shit
Try to spit my clip, you might get hit and divided

[Refrain]
Uh, kill shit, I'ma talk about it
Laid out with the chalk around him
Came back as kings, came back with rings
What if we fall? I never thought about it, nigga

[Chorus]
Gunfire, gunfire, nah, nah, nah
Run at yah, run at yah, nah, nah, nah
We come for yah, come for yah, nah, nah, nah
Set fire to my enemies
Fuck a rasclaat, or a enemy
Me got a few chains worth a hundred ki's
Them say they waan romp, me say, "Pussy, please"
Pussy boy never worried me
My clips up on the streets
Nuh call the police pon me
A hundred keys in these streets
Pussy boy, no wan romp wit me

[Refrain]
Uh, kill shit, I'ma talk about it
Laid it out with the chalk around him
Came back as kings, came back with rings
What if we fall? I never thought about it, nigga

[Verse 2]
How you spell C.E.O.? D.R.E
What a nigga dream he could try to be
Uh, even though I'm from a place where
Niggas got TECs, don't mean technology
Grew up 'round Blood niggas, real camaraderie
Plus Crip niggas on the other side of me
But I'm the only nigga that I ever tried to be
Winner never sins, you know these niggas tired of me
Not to it if you want crap shootin' in your home
Where a nigga came from, my life changed
'Cause a nigga made hits while my homies flipped bricks
Lot of them ain't here, can't complain
Tried to survive 9 to the 5
You ain't alive if you ain't not willin' to die
The lower the low, the higher the high
Do or you don't, you fall or you fly
I mean you ride or die, nigga

[Refrain]
Uh, kill shit, I'ma talk about it
Laid out with the chalk around him
Came back as kings, came back with rings
What if we fall? I never thought about it, nigga

[Chorus]
Gunfire, gunfire, nah, nah, nah
Run at yah, run at yah, nah, nah, nah
We come for yah, come for yah, nah, nah, nah
Set fire to my enemies
Fuck a rasclaat, those our enemies
Mi got a few chains worth a hundred keys
Them say they waan ride, mi say, "Pussy, please"
Pussy boy never worried me
My clips up on hundred streets
Nuh call the police pon me
A hundred keys in these streets
Pussy boy, now I walk with weed

[Intro: Duggie]
If you ain't dreaming big, then what you close your eyes for?
Woke up in the wind next to the encore
Mama still feelin' like she could've done more
My goal was to make it the opposite of being poor
Dear lord!
See the vision when nobody else do
When time get hard, see who come and help you
See who come and help you
Mama told me when you focused you can stand out
Gotta cut some niggas off with their hand out
Made it this far, no handouts
I'm the man now, yeah
Yeah, I'm the man now

Pocket full of bread like a dinner roll
Hopped up out the Porsche right into the Rolls
All these diamonds on me wet like Cancún
'Bout to take my dog up like a damn balloon
Hunnid racks inside the club, I'm the tycoon
Ain't no need for you never, I'll one night you
I put P's in the pot, only got back a few
Real diamond, closet full of Christian Loubs
Stack it tall like Yao Ming
Everyday a young nigga dream
Real boss without the suit, Balmain jeans
Red cross, come to Cleveland everybody me
'Bout to switch this shit up like I'm Mase
I beat this case, I don't drink, but I bought a case
My diamonds loud, call me parade

You can see the difference in my mug shots
I got my cash up, hunnid duffle bags up

[Intro: Ricky P]
Good one Richard
There you go Richard
That was it Richard

[Verse 1]
So what do you do? So what do you do?
When all you know is flexin'
So what do you do? So what do you do?
Well, go keep on guessin'
So what you got ice? So what you got change?
It's all a perception
So what you do when all of it's gone?
They come for collection
So what you do when niggas you call just don't got connections?
So what you do?
You thought you was right, life taught you a lesson
So what you do when you got your word?
You make 'em respect it
So what you do?
Whenever you wrong, you try to correct it
So what you do?
When you down and out, you count up your blessings
So what you do?
When you fuck around with feelings, don't catch 'em
So what you do?
If this one ain't right move, on to the next one
So what you do?
If you get the chance, you gon' be the best one

[Chorus]
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
Countin' up all of these checks, smokin' weed is my profession (profession)
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
Countin' up all of these checks, livin' life is a blessin' (blessin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')

[Verse 2]
I'm way too cool for these haters, way too high for my neighbors
I'm way too hard on my job, I do it now and not later
Way too cool for these niggas, I got too many flavors
Way too wide on my mind, not smoke too many papers
Way too out of the country, do anything I want
Way too out of control, pull up anywhere and stunt
I'm way too smooth for the police, now they act like they don't know me
It's way too clean to be stolen, Cartier and not the Rollie
I'm way too real to be fake, too much love to feel hate
You way too tired to work, I get tired of waitin'
I'm way too tall to ever think about doin' it small
I'm way too into myself to even be fuckin' with y'all

[Chorus]
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
Countin' up all of these checks, smokin' weed is my profession (profession)
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')
Countin' up all of these checks, livin' life is a blessin' (blessin')
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')

[Outro: Ricky P]
Ye-ah
It's your driver Mr. Eazy Wider
Picking you up in a brand spanking new Doober
Brought to you by the Doober app
Make sure you hit code 4/20 for 50% percent off
And a pack of Khalifa cones for the ride y'all
You can smoke in this car
As long you rate your Doober driver before you leave
And leave a tip too, bomb weed only
Don't smoke no blunts in my Doober
And see the joints, dabs, or bong rips, for the long trips
My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My love
I've crossed the line I feel alright
My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My love
Will you come home with me- tonight
I've never worn you, you've never worn me
I've never worn you, you've never worn me

My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My love
The fit is fine, I feel alright
My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My love
Will you come home with me tonight
I've never worn you, you've never worn me
I've never worn you, you've never worn me
If I lived the past over
Saw today from yesterday
I would be in love anyway

If I knew that you'd leave me
If I knew you wouldn't stay
I would be in love anyway

Sometimes I think think about before
Sometimes I think
If I knew then what I know now
I don't believe I'd ever change
Somehow

Though you'll never be with me
And there are no words to say
I'll still be in love anyway

If I knew then
What I know now
I don't believe I'd ever change
Somehow...

[Verse 1]
Stop, don't tell me how to feel
These scars will never heal, overnight
I'm just searching for what's real
It's hard enough to deal with life

[Pre-Chorus]
Learn to say fuck it, take my time
Life's a bitch, but I'll make it mine
Make it, make it, make it mine
Learn to take it as a sign
If you don't like me, get in line
You won't break me, break me with your lies

[Chorus]
Sometimes you bleed for who you are
It's hard to love with a heart full of scars
I won't feed into your dark
I'll keep loving with a heart full of scars (heart full of scars)
You're never gonna keep me down
Doesn't really matter what you say
I'm not living for yesterday (heart full of scars)
I'll figure out how to turn it around
I'm learning how to bend not break
A full life is give not take (heart full of scars)

[Verse 2]
Done with doubt and overthinking
Wait for it to sink in, "I'm enough"
Sick of trying to be your perfect
The pain is never worth it, never was

[Pre-Chorus]
Learn to say fuck it, take my time
Life's a bitch but I'll make it mine
Make it, make it, make it mine
Learn to take it as a sign
If you don't like me get in line
You won't break me, break me with your lies

[Chorus]
Sometimes you bleed for who you are
It's hard to love with a heart full of scars
I won't feed into your dark
I'll keep loving with a heart full of scars (heart full of scars)
You're never gonna keep me down
Doesn't really matter what you say
I'm not living for yesterday (heart full of scars)
I'll figure out how to turn it around
I'm learning how to bend not break
A full life is give not take (heart full of scars)

[Breakdown]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Heart full of scars)
(Heart full of scars)
(Heart full of scars)

[Chorus]
You're never gonna keep me down
Doesn't really matter what you say
I'm not living for yesterday (heart full of scars)
I'll figure out how to turn it around
I'm learning how to bend not break
A full life is give not take (heart full of scars)

[Verse 1: John Legend & Jennifer Nettles]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be all right

[Pre-Chorus: John Legend and Jennifer Nettles]
My head's under water but I’m breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus: John Legend & Jennifer Nettles]
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges both
All your perfect imperfections both
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I’m winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

[Verse 2: John Legend & Jennifer Nettles, Both]
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I’m around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you

[Pre-Chorus: John Legend & Jennifer Nettles]
My head's under water, but I’m breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus: John Legend & Jennifer Nettles]
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I’m winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

[Bridge: John Legend & Jennifer Nettles]
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it’s hard

[Chorus John Legend & Jennifer Nettles]
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I’m winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh, of you

[Outro: John Legend & Jennifer Nettles]
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh, of you

[Verse]
Yeah, okay
All my young boys is shooting, they with the shootouts
One Umbrella crew out, nigga what you gon' do 'bout
My dog Jay say he just tryna find him a new route
I'm tryna do me the same, my bitches do be insane
Got that Mulsuanne glidin', I'm riding it through the rain
Through the pain, we do change, niggas won't do a thing
And me, I do thangs, nigga, hot like blue flame
And my wrist saying, "bitch, come kick it" like Liu Kang
Look, nigga I don't play no games, I'm a general
Lifetime ties, I ain't fucking with the federal
White wine vibe, five bitches on my genitals
I pedal to the metal, she don't put me on a pedestal
I hit her with the finishing touch
I diminish them bad bitches and hit em' like a cinnamon dutch
I touch bad bitches with mad riches, they dad riches
And I'm in they back so much nigga I'm ad-libbin'
Big timer, dough proper, show stopper
Bad bitches, actresses in soap operas
Getting so much dough, ya'll niggas owe papa
I get paid to put you on a stretcher, old doctor
We be moving militant, whole squad real and shit
10 rollies, 30 chains, whole squad killin' shit
Went to Rolls Royce, drove the Wraith out the dealership
Bought the shit cash, you can tell em' that I'm still legit
Y'all say y'all ball with payments to make
On the G4 cigar with plane flicks to take
G5 private plane away from jakes
Yeah, nigga, I do lear from state to state
Gotta yellow presidenti and I baked the face
My chick yellow den confetti, got her laced in grape
Treat my dates like, "fuck it, if we late, we late"
And if you fucking and you saying you relate, we great
Okay, why them niggas hating on Tory, can't chance it
Why they all sick of my face, that's cancer
Why they in the backroom dissing like the dancers
Well, me and Sway are the same cause we don't got the answers
I was with the scammers, trigger pullers and jammers
Night time shooters will do you in they pajamas
Then eat Oodles and Noodles and go to sleep vampin'
Toss hammers in water and lay in East Hampton
Me, Sosa, and Brooks, that's the three champions
Give your bitch a three point foul, three chances
Your bitch say I'm lying, I ain't fucking, she dancin'
I knew she was fucking from the first three glances
Heard she gotta twin that heard I ball, Steve Francis
Fuck her and then I'm taking her sis, Steve Nash shit
Relax nigga, I'm on my relapse nigga
And I already won the race, these just re-laps nigga
Mind your bitch and your bees wax nigga
I keep three straps cause we done hit some cats that's gone be back, nigga
After the Wraith Wraith talk, the "Wah gwaan, Popcaan?"
I'm still with real niggas saying, "Wah pop? Wah gwaan?"
Pull in something foreign with the top all chopped on
Niggas knocking lights, clap on, clap on
Bedsheets top on, Ralph Lauren I'm killing it
Linen all out there touring with foreign models
More bottles ordered, them bitches is gon' swallow
And I swear I got so many hollow tips, I'm going hollow
If I aim, shoot, bang, my nigga, it's gon' follow
When that shit is full throttle, I drink the full bottle
Of Patron, when it's on my nigga then it's on
So I'm gone, ready to kill 'em niggas, gon' feel 'em
And I made your bitch pay, ain't nobody gon' bill 'em
And I'm good in the Chi, ain't nobody gon' drill 'em
And my goons going gorilla, my niggas cold killas
August 19th, you niggas is gon' feel us

Pop up and make another mil' and call that going pop, nigga
Yeah, and you know you gon' flop, nigga
Uh, and all you haters gon' drop, niggas
Uh, and you know I'm on my 

[?]
All you niggas mighty gon' duck like Bombay
Big time killer, big time seller

[Verse 1]
Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Sentimental drivel, clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so, so disappointing

[Chorus]
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

[Verse 2]
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel

[Pre-Chorus]
One day I am gonna grow wings
Chemical reactions
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

[Chorus]
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

(Attention) A wishful spit in the eye to
A smiling brotherhood
(Attention) The unacceptable face of

A brief release of hope

[Chorus]
Yeah if we stand up they'll
Mow us down again

Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

[Refrain]
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

[Verse 2]
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life

[Verse 3]
Beautiful angel
Pulled apart at birth
Limbless and helpless
I can't even recognise you

[Refrain]
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life
I am the key to locking your dress
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll find you came out where you went in
So tuck the kids in safe tonight
And shut the eyes in the cupboard
I am the weapon that you needed
Keep an eye out for the neighbours
Anyway you turn
I'll be there
Open your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
I am the club and carving knife
We are friends til we die
You should not walk alone at night
You must show me your care
In the time when the lights go out
I am her face when she sleeps
I can't remember how it happened
Fifteen blows to the brain
I am the face on the news
I will strike when the- I will strike anytime
I will knock fifteen times
I have the smell of a local man
I can strike anytime
I am the pick in the ice in the quiet country lanes
I am the newspaper round
I am the eyes in the cupboard
I am the creak in the floorboards
I am the crack of the hammer
Overhead powerlines
I am the old, frightened
I am the years, ever... poording
(Ever parading)
Ever parading
(Ok, thanks Dan)
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself

["Fred"]
Big Bird
Whilst on a walking holiday in remote regions
I chance upon a secluded valley
Away from the popular walking routes
Some distance along the valley
I come across a scene so breathtakingly beautiful
That I drop to my knees in wonder

There  is something about the serried ranks
Of deciduous and coniferous trees
Standing tall on the opposite bank
Of the river that sets my heart ablaze

The colours of the foliage are poetic
Whilst the arrangement of species seems divinely inspired
Clouds swoop and whirl above the topmost branches
And the river sparkles through an uncertain reflection below
Suddenly, the sky darkens, and along the river advances a flotilla of huge birds with menacing eyes

The size of the birds staggers me; one is as tall as a bus, and the others not much smaller
Their plumage is a shimmering blue
But their eyes are full of hate and looming disaster
With a horrible sinking feeling
I realise that the birds have noticed me
One of them clambers up the nearside bank
And waddles towards me
I take to my heels, and scramble along the path
Gaining speed, I run at full tilt
Then I see people in front of me, running towards me

First one passes, then another, then another
They are wide-eyed with terror, and keep taking quick
Fearful looks behind them
There must, I realise, be something unutterably horrible in front of me, but my fear of the big birds compels me to carry on

More people run past me, all with the same frightened expression. They are running towards the birds, away from something unknown
I am running from the birds, towards something unknown. Not for the first time in my life, I curse my bad luck

[Intro]
Can you hit me with that note?
Should I stop, then?

[Verse 1]
He was sick of his clock stopping
It winds him up, that girl still
Snoring next to him
He was sick of his excuses
To not take off her dress when
Bleeding in the bathroom
The watch smashed, and he got restless
He sighs in broken English

[Chorus]
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises

[Verse 2]
He was, he was
He was your final fit
Your final bellyache

[Chorus]
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
And they dole out all I possess, or even give my body to be burnt
But if I have no love, I am none the better
Just gonna do a quick version of that last track?
Yeah
Alright, huh
Was that bad?
Yes
It's correct 

[?] first chord
Oh, hm
Alright?
Yeah, that's the right thing

One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Are you lonely?
Are you living on the seat of your pants?
Are you happy?
Wipe that smile off your face
Are you someone?
Lose my pinball eyes
Are you lonely?
Are you broken all in a vice?

[Chorus 1]
Try what you shouldn't say
And I'll help you

[Verse 2]
Here's the detective
He's in charge of your case
Here's the detective
And he's hoping to waste my name

[Chorus 2]
And he's trying what is in his arm, but I don't mind
He's trying what is in his arm, but I don't mind

[Bridge]
The strength for living, losing
No one inside of my head

[Verse 3]
Are you crazy?
Are you blessed in bed in his arm?
Is there mumbling?
Will you cry us a play in it?
Are you happy?
Your crossed legs

[Chorus 3]
Try what you want from me, I'll spit it back
Soft as a denim hand, spit it back

[Outro]
Then this world

[stinmehbwoud] and it hurts
Leaving it on a nose

[Verse 1]
I am the key to the door in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you look too hard in your mind
You'll often see my reflection
It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
But if you stick with me we'll go far
The girls will fall by the wayside

[Chorus]
And anywhere you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

[Verse 2]
I am the key to the lock in your dress
I am the weapon that you needed
And if you look too hard within
You'll only find yourself believing
So get yourself in the seat of the car
And drive as fast as you can
If you get too far inside
You'll find you came out where you went in

[Chorus]
Either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

[Outro]
Climbing up the walls

[Verse 1]
And as I'm falling down, I beg to disagree
So long
You're dressed up to go away and talk with people

[Chorus]
A clockwork man

[Verse 2]
You tumble off my chair and break, everything you say
You tumble- that should be-
There was, there was, there was
There was, there was, there was
There was, there was, there was
There was, there was, there was(?)

You obviously don't think so, you obviously have dup—

[Verse 1]
In the next World War
An angel at my door
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again

[Chorus]
In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe

[Verse 2]
In a deep deep sleep
Of the innocent
An airbag saved my life
In a fast German car
I'm amazed I'm still alive
I am born again

[Chorus]
In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus]
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
Huh?
Shoo
Right lets do, shall we do-yea, we'll do the job first
One, two, three, four
Ah, that's completely wrong
One, two, three, one, two, three

[Verse 1]
Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holding on
Holding on

[Verse 2]
Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
And holding on
Holding on

[Verse 1]
Drift all you like from ocean to ocean
Search the whole world
But drunken confessions and hijacked affairs
Will just make you more alone

[Verse 2]
If you come home I’ll bake you a cake
Made of all their eyes
I wish you could see me dressed for the kill, kill

[Refrain]
You’re my man of war
You’re my man of war
Yeah, the worms will eat you whole, big boots

[Verse 3]
So unplug the phones, stop all the taps
It all comes flooding back
To poison clouds and poisoned dwarves

[Refrain]
You’re my man of war
You’re my man of war
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
For you, big boots

[Intro]
Hit me...
I like that...
Hit me again!

[Verse 1]
Okay!
I go by Weezy F. B., that's who I be
You don't wanna lose me like new I.D
I beat up the track like the new Ali
And leave an eye black and blue and green
They tell me I can do it, just do it clean
But I'm from the dirty South, I don't know what that mean
Eminem I am a money machine
Two girls in the bed with son inbetween
Now I treat women like a nun or a queen
If she got nice legs she can run on my team
Yeah, I stick her up like a gun in her spleen
My name is Lil Wayne and I'm a microfiend!
Hit me again!

[Verse 2]
Alright I'm going back in like...
B-back on my 1, 2, now watch me snap like a jumpsuit
I'm country like gold on your front tooth
And I work all day like the phone booth
Sometimes shit get to thick for me to come through
And I just needa relax and some shampoo
Spitta, Dizzy and Mack they with the camp too
We get money and we smoke like candles
When we do it I let her keep on her sandals
She just wanna get used like samples
And you know I jumps in it like a trampo...leen!
Wayne, the microfiend!
Hit me!
Hit me again!

[Verse 3]
And my car goes *carsound*
Jumped out the driver lookin' like lava
Stickin' to the script like Java
Holla at ya gualla, infected with money and power
And I be the teacher like Steve Vital-ah!
Got my Vans on but these Marc Jacobs
And I'm so high, I thought I saw spaceships
A-list, number one on your playlist
Flow poisonous like snake spit
And I gotta little money where my safe is
For my babys babys babys
Babys babys babys
Babys babys babys, baby!

[Outro]
My name is Lil Wayne and I'm a microfiend
I said my name is Lil Wayne and I'm a microfiend

[Intro: Lana Del Rey]
Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
White lies and black beaches
Miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like making me crazy
Tell me, "Have patience"
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks, just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons
In making me crazy
But you've got your reasons
White lies and black beaches

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
I got a feeling in my bones
Can't get you out of my veins (Yeah, yeah)
You can't escape my affection (Yah, yeah)

Uh, her sophistication makes you wanna quit the bitch you datin'

Boo, let's get acquainted (What?)
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation (Yeah)
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it (What? Ooh)
But bang it like my fingers (Ooh, what?)
She pray to God I made it (What?)
But bankin' like my Franklins (Yeah)
My neighbors stopped the hatin' (Yeah)
What? (What? They been at it, check it out)
Huh? (We been out here, yeah)
Slide inside it (What?)
Diddy Boppin'  (What?)
Milly Rockin' (What? What?)

They better not holla if I cuff her for real (When you're into your affliction)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Wrap you up in my daisy chains (What? What? What? What?)
Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (What? What? Yeah?)

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky,  Lana Del Rey & Playboi Carti]
Goin' bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal (Hmm, hmm, hmm)
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real  (Hmm, hmm, hmm) (For real)
Truthfully between you and me I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey & A$AP Rocky]
High tops in the summer (Top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer, babe (Top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer (Top out, hop out, hop out)

Don't be a bummer, babe

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
Ooh ohh, ooh ohh
Ooh ohh, ooh ohh

[Verse 1]
I see you here all of the time
You never come to me while feelings lie
Oh, why do you wanna be my girl?
Oh, why do you wanna be my girl?

[Verse 2]
I used to call you by name
You always feel the same
Oh, why do you wanna be?
Oh, why do you wanna be?

[Verse 3]
I see you here all of the time
You’re wearing that french bread up to that spine
Why do you call me? But I…
Oh, I thought you’d be releasing

[Verse 4]
Oh, why do you come here so much?
Oh, I used to love you so much
Oh, why do you come here so much?
Oh, I used to love you so much

[Chorus]
Indulge me
Indulge me

[Verse]
All my old lovers have found others
I was lost in the rapture
Dead Sea as barren as a stutter
And colored laughter
I don't trouble nobody
Nobody troubles my body after
All my old others have found lovers

[Chorus]
Indulge me
Indulge me

[Chorus]
Indulge me
Indulge me

[Chorus 1]
Don’t bother calling, I’ll call you
Don’t bother calling, I’ll call you

[Verse 1]
I’m not a body, the body is but a shell
I disembody but suffering is sovereign
Still no grasp of reality
The world is a wonderland scene
I don’t know what we are
But every cell in the corpus resembles stars
Signal into the sky
God sings to me in reply

[Chorus 1]
Don’t bother calling, I’ll call you
Don’t bother calling, I’ll call you

[Verse 2]
I’m not somebody, somebody would savor us
You need a solid, but I’m made of liquid
Trust in me, I am the son of the sea
And I’ll call you when I feel finally free
I don’t know what we are
But all I know is I can’t go away with you with half a heart

[Chorus 2]
Don’t bother calling, I’ll call you
Don’t bother asking for the truth
Don’t bother calling, I’ll call you
Don’t bother calling, I’ll call you

[Outro]
Well, I tried

[Verse 1]
He who asks for much has much to give
I don't ask for much, just enough to live
But in the light, morning will reveal the spoils of night
Through the walls of Jericho lies a heart of stone
With you, half the battle is proving that we're at war
I would give my life just for the privilege to ignore

[Chorus]
Don't call it a Lovers' Quarrel
Don't call it a Lovers' Quarrel

[Verse 2]
To whom much is given, much is required
Luxurious liver, you never inquire
It ain't right, you see, who is your family?
If I don't have tools to fight, calling this a quarrel isn't right
Quoting this a quarrel so immorally implies
We're equal opponents and we both antagonize

[Chorus]
Don't call it a Lovers' Quarrel
Don't call it a Lovers' Quarrel

[Chorus]
Don't call it a Lovers' Quarrel
Don't call it a Lovers' Quarrel

[Interlude]
We cannot be lovers
'Cause I am the other
We cannot be lovers
Long as I'm the other

[Instrumental Outro]
So, as a mild-mannered child
My mom would drop me off in our family's second-hand Mitsubishi caravan
And I would glance back, before my descent, to mutter, "I love you."
In turn she'd nod her head and turn to the road ahead and sigh
"...Thank you." Thank you
I’m not tryna go to bed with you
I just wanna make out in my car
I’m not tryna go to bed with you
I just wanna make out in my car
I’m not tryna go to bed with you
I just wanna make out in my car
I’m not tryna go to bed with you
I just wanna make out in my car
We scrawl unwritten law of the land
On scroll that’s rolled up and rolled in
The cocoon-eyed baby's swollen, clenched hand

The baby cries out in protest
A scream raw and grotesque
That soon he learns to suppress

[Verse 1: John Legend]
Yeah we used to flirt with freedom
'Fore everybody knew our names
We became their favorite secret
Love for love and not for fame
Oh, when I was your user, your FaceTime abuser
Dose after dose 'til we crashed
Now they bet on our game, say we'll go down in flames
It's too good but we never could last

[Chorus: John Legend & Gallant]
But oh, we were undercover 'til it overflowed, overexposed
Oh, chained our love together, never took it slow
And now we know life on overload, (love, love)
Don't we always make a show of love, (love, love, yeah)

[Verse 2: Gallant]
Let that cellphone ring, let that bluebird sing, let that message say unread
Let them talk about us, let them talk too much
While we rule the whole world from our bed

[Chorus: John Legend & Gallant]
And oh, we were undercover 'til it overflowed, overexposed
Oh, chained our life together, never took it slow
And now we know life on overload
Don't we always make a show of love?
Life on overload, must we make a spectacle of love?

[Pre-Chorus]
Make it disappear like it's magic, magic
Bend it over, stretch it out, elastic, 'lastic
What if I said that you the one? Bring your friend, make it two for one
This the kinda shit, I do for fun, do for fun

[Chorus]
I'm with Mary and Molly (Two hoes on one fuckin' pole)
Every day this how we do it (Two hoes on my fuckin' pole)
Take off your clothes (Two hoes on one fuckin' pole)

And take it off, take it off

[Verse 1]
When I pop them bands, wanna make you dance, yeah, yeah
And all the girls, they be screaming out, "He the man," yeah, yeah
You got all my love, you know that I'm tippin' but I don't wanna trick it out
When you throw that ass around, I sit down, you givin' me that stripper love
You about to get all that, table dance on me
Girl, he ain't got it like me, he ain't gonna pop your pussy like me
When that alcohol wears off, I'ma still be fly
I don't really get fucked up like this, nigga, feelin' all up on your shit, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Make it disappear like it's magic, magic
Bend it over, stretch it out, elastic, 'lastic
What if I said that you the one? Bring your friend, make it two for one

[Post-Chorus]
And take it off, take it off
Take, take, take, take it, take it off
Take, take, take, take it, take it off (Yeah, haha)
Take, take, take, take it, take it off

[Verse 2]
Okay, a ten-hut, I'm at attention
Bitch, stand up, I'm payin' pensions
I throw a hunnid racks on these bad bitches
And a hunnid more for my niggas who's ain't quittin'
Oh no, I took away the top, I'm in a four-door
Your bitch givin' me top, all in her photos
And all the niggas see
Is them limo tints and them low pros
You really wanna do it like me, that's a no go
Got a bad bitch bouncin' on my pogo
Up and down, up and down
She put that booty on the 'gram, now she got me spendin' more, more
Feelin' that dick
Growlin' like a dog, when I'm in that bitch
One night with me, baby, and now you rich
Give a dog a bone, no kids shit 'cause I'm grown

[Pre-Chorus]
Make it disappear like it's magic, magic
Bend it over, stretch it out, elastic, 'lastic
What if I said that you the one? Bring your friend, make it two for one (Yeah)
This the kinda shit, I do for fun, penthouse suite, where we acting up (Mary and Molly)

[Chorus]

Two hoes on one fuckin' pole
Two hoes on my fuckin' pole
Two hoes on one fuckin' pole
Two hoes on my fuckin' pole
Two hoes on one fuckin' pole
Two hoes on my—

[Verse 1]
Hey
Do you remember we said, "Hello"?
And you asked me about my Levi's T-shirt
Said, "You are a friend of mine"
My, oh my
You must have saved me about a thousand times
I wouldn't be the one I am today
If you hadn't been a friend of mine

[Chorus]
I ain't misbehaving
I'm just telling you the truth
Take my love for granted
Yeah, I'll give it all to you
Made me count for something
Yeah, I feel it in my heart
God only knows what I'd have been if you hadn't been

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
A friend of mine

[Verse 2]
Hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I haven't seen you around since high school
How you doin', do you still remember me?
Are you still a friend of mine?
Guess you're still a friend of mine
Guess you're still a friend of mine
Now I see
I see
Why I get nervous when you look at me
It's like your eyes are trying to tell me something
That you're more than just a friend of mine
That you're more than just a friend of mine, oh my

[Chorus]
I ain't misbehaving
I'm just telling you the truth
Take my love for granted
Yeah, I'll give it all to you
Made me count for something
Yeah, I feel it in my heart
God only knows what I'd have been if you hadn't been

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
A friend of mine

[Chorus]
I gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)
Always kept it real from the very start (very start)
Niggas ain't thorough like I always thought
Damn, the game left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Niggas said they with you when they really not (really not)
Niggas plot on everything you got (everything you got)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)

[Verse 1]
Uh, I kept it triller from the very start
Seen so many people crossed me, don't know where to start
Uh, that bitch left me with a heavy heart
Yeah, still on them papers, they won't let me off
Never thought we'd make it out the ghetto, now look where we are
Fucking famous bitches and that pussy taste like caviar
I done gave these niggas everything and that was from the heart
Rollie, chain, every car, all it did was left me scarred
Heard my dog talk behind my back and I'm like let him talk
I won't say his name but he gone feel this shit in every bar
Feel this shit in all my verses
Was it really worth it
Cut the grass and all the snakes gone surface
Nobody's perfect
Showed them cash, he kinda made me nervous
Maybe I'm trippin'
Hoping this paranoia from all this shit that we been in
Watched you pour gasoline, and burned out all of your bridges
Nigga, you sunk the friendship, something you got to live with
Fuck it!

[Chorus]
I gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)
Always kept it real from the very start (very start)
Niggas ain't thorough like I always thought
Damn, the game left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Niggas said they with you when they really not (really not)
Niggas plot on everything you got (everything you got)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)

[Verse 2]
Tears falling like the water when the levies drop
Boyz in the Hood, these niggas Tre' they screaming let me out
No they ain't riding, it was drama, I'm like yeah we out
Trying to please these niggas, shit gone prolly wear me out
Drive me crazy, I been by myself lately
40 on my belt lately, I ain't need no help lately
Nigga cross me, I cut him off and I felt crazy
'Cause I got a purple heart
Shit I'd rather work and walk 'fore I ride luxury with niggas that don't fuck with me
I'm startin' to hate this fame shit look what it done to me
Seen half these niggas turn they back when rappers tried to come for me
Don't want them in my company just want to be a company
Hunnit mill'
Dream chasers, chasing dreams
Hate is fake, and love is real
Niggas said I wouldn't win told them yes the fuck I will
Hit the studio with all my feeling and I let 'em spill
Forever thorough, be a sucka nigga, no I never will (No!)

[Chorus]
I gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)
Always kept it real from the very start (very start)
Niggas ain't thorough like I always thought
Damn, the game left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Niggas said they with you when they really not (really not)
Niggas plot on everything you got (everything you got)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)

[Verse 3]
Uh, my heart heavy, my soul cleaner
When shorty got a big head, I was like hol' Gina
I made a mil, I got a deal, I lift the whole team up
I had the whole squad lit, I had the city poppin'
I told my dog don't listen to them, get caught up in that gossip
They wanna see you in the hood back when you ain't got shit
Remember nights was on the 'gram, toasting with the pilot
Then everything went sour, this little thing of ours

[Chorus]
I gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)
Always kept it real from the very start (very start)
Niggas ain't thorough like I always thought
Damn, the game left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Niggas said they with you when they really not (really not)
Niggas plot on everything you got (everything you got)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)

[Verse 1]
Started off poor with plans to own more
Now we own stores and fuck the baddest whores
I was on tour with niggas that sold raw
Started sellin' white, we won't sell it no more
I'm like, Trump ain't feelin' us, cops still killin' us
Niggas takin' shots, can't stop me, they ain't real enough
Cut her off, act like she's dead and it's killin' her
New Dawn, Hermes seat, I let the ceiling up
Just to kill 'em softly, ooh, get 'em off me
Try to crucify me like I'm Jesus the way she cross me
I'm too bossy and too thorough
To move like a weirdo, on point like an arrow
We started off with zero, now I'm seein' M's
Diamonds like water and they jumpin' out the gym
Shootin' like Harden if your head was the rim
'Cause niggas wanna line me like a shape up and a trim, damn
Back when I was broke, they was cool with it
Now every move I make I'm in the news with it
Even if I ain't do it they be like "You did it!"
My teacher always used to tell me "You gon' lose nigga!"
That's why I never went to school nigga
And why I'm rappin' like I got somethin' to prove nigga
Went and bought the mansion with the pool in it
Billy with the stamp, I get two with it
Move with it 'cause these niggas wanna take my life
No weapon formed against me every time I pray at night
Scoopin' thotties in the Phantom, that's the way of life
And make 'em fuck their best friends like they was dykes
Reachin' for the Glock every time I play the light
I'm on 12 o'clock every time I play them bikes
I'm with the pack, uh, gettin' back, yeah
Spendin' dope, nigga, sellin' smack, gang
I'm gettin' chips off music like Rap Snacks
Yeah, 10 mil in cash of Ethika, that's a fact
Money, power, respect, eatin' breakfast on a jet
I know these niggas upset, they ain't see me fall yet
Wins and losses!

[Chorus]
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
And I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us

[Verse 2]
Bloggers in a frenzy, truck to the Bentley
Ain't doin' no interviews, I'm busy, nigga we litty
So when you see me out don't ask me about no Nicki
Fuck I look like tellin' my business on Wendy
Niggas gossip like queens, we was servin' fiends
.40 bust your windows out: Jazmine Sullivan
They told 'em pop Mollys, I told 'em to be kings
Sippin' 1942 like it's lean
I done seen all these niggas try to downplay my dreams
So I'ma give it to 'em every time I'm on the scene
Pull up Ghost Ghost, Wraith Wraith when you see me
Some suckers wanna be me and some suckers wanna leave me
I know it, I go through it, don't show it
I told niggas who wrote it, ain't takin' back what I quoted
Started off with a quarter, flipped that to a half
Turned that to an ounce, got some shit in the stash
Nigga say that he gon' rob me, put a brick on his ass
Now every killer in my city tryna look for his ass
And one thing 'bout Meek Milly, I'ma get to a bag
Had to starve all day just to get to it fast
Like Ramadan, totin' K's like it's Palestine
Real niggas in my ambiance, bottom line
Ever since I met Ross and signed the dotted line
I gave my momma 10,000 at least a thousand times
Do the math on it!

[Chorus]
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
And I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us

[Verse 3]
Talkin', this my cocky flow
Damn Daniel, why you son him? Mr Miyagi though
This that rose gold Patek, call me like '94
Mean nothin' to me, I tell you how it gotta go
Rain, sleet, on that corner when the block was slow
Everybody was tryna trap, we started poppin' though
Heard that bitch say she cut me, I was like "¡adiós!"
In the field, knock 'em down, it look like dominoes
Young nigga, I turned my Impala to a Wraith
When you get a dollar they gon' hate
Bought my mom the crib with that gate
Private school for all them babies, now they straight, nigga

[Chorus]
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
And I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, gang
Chasers, Chasers, Chasers, Chasers, gang
Chasers, Chasers, Chasers, Chasers, gang
Ayy

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Brand new Glock .40 with a ladder in that bitch (okay)
32 deep so it don't matter who you get (no way)
All my niggas hittin', it don't matter who you with (okay)
We gon' whack you if you tellin', it don't matter if you snitch
You done told on your homie, you a pussy (you a pussy)
In the kitchen with the Pyrex, baking cookies (cookin' work)
Every time you see me out, I got it with me (know I got it)
Bending through that Bentley truck, they couldn't miss me
Bought his baby mama a Patek now that nigga wanna kill me (oh man)
Yeah, bitch I'm talking fifty
If I stand up on my money, they can't never overlook me
White come straight from 'cross the border, you can never overcook it
This that raw, this that raw, bitch I ball like Chris Paul
I switch it to Blake Griffin, they gon' bang that shit on y'all
Homie said that he a Blood, we gon' paint that shit on dawg
Told my bro to bring his hit, we gon' hang it on the wall
All my shooters trained to go, they've been waitin' on my call
They've been waitin' on that ring to pull that thing and chop it off
To knock you off, brrrt!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Connect the dots, connect the dots
Link with the connect and we collect them blocks (that white perico)
Running to a pussy and collect his watch
When we catch him, headshot, disconnect his top, woo!

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Let's talk about the trap, let's talk about the streets (What's up)
You looked up to Jordan, we looked up to Meech (Meech)
Clean a nigga block, leave that bitch bleached (brrrt!)
Spend a half a quarter on a pair of sneaks (whoo)
What type of boss is you? You gave your dawg a Draco (Draco, Draco)
Real bosses put their dawgs on the payroll (payroll, payroll)
Drop Rolls Royce, that's a don nigga (don nigga)
I got pumpkin seats, them bitches orange, nigga (Hermes)
We CMG grizzly, we just sold out the forum
Yeah, hit a button on that new don and watch it transform (transform)
Yeah, you been misinformed
Think you can disrespect the king and hate don't come with harm
Quarter milly on the diamond chain, no charm
Milly Rockin' in the kitchen, tryna make it form (fuck it up, fuck it up)
My religion get this money, Christian or Islam
And my tradition send the money, soon they said it's bond
And my lifestyle, don't leave your house without your fucking gun
The goal is leave the hood but not forget where you from

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Connect the dots, connect the dots
Link with the connect and we collect them blocks (that white perico)
Running to a pussy and collect his watch
When we catch him, headshot, disconnect his top, woo!

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
All about the timing and I'm feeling so correct
Got all these diamonds, bitches say I seem possessed
You scared of violence so you gotta cut the check
We always styling so my niggas fresh to death
No need for wallets, ball that shit up in my fist
Get out the projects, that's the first one on the list (mama)
Pack up your bags, mama your lil son is shit (mama)
We impeaching niggas then we hit them with the blitz
Speaking in silence, it's okay to talk in code
It's still lil' Boobie Boys and gotta shout the zoes
We one of one therefore I tailor-made the clothes
I got the dome setted on D's and the lows
Still fly commercial but I don't do TV shows
Fucking a actress so she gotta play the role
You seein' money, what you know, you see the most
Versace diners at a Donatella toast
Black in a 'Vetty, got IG out, watchin' post
They gave him life for living life, that boy was sauce
Who you fadin'? Pussy boy, go get a body bag
Renzel records with your Tina Turner contracts
Still war ready, never run with rats
Once again, the dope boys running rap

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Connect the dots, connect the dots
Link with the connect and we collect them blocks (that white perico)
Running to a pussy and collect his watch
When we catch him, headshot, disconnect his top, woo!

[Intro]
Yeah
Sad to say it but I love you
Don't take no offense but you're my bitch

[Chorus]
Yeah, you gone fall through every time a nigga call you
That's why I ball how I ball when I spoil you
We was in Miami, first time I saw you
I was in a Phantom when I pulled up on you
It was late nights, late nights in the bando
Fucking on you good got you bustin' like you Rambo
And you keep it hood so you really understand though
You was there through my ups and downs like a camel

[Verse 1]
Ass all fat say she get it from her mama
She just want the money, she ain't fuckin' with no bloggers
Fuck you on a PJ the whole way to the Bahamas
Gucci, Valentino, baby, I can be your stylist
Fuck me with your friend, yeah yeah, you was wildin'
1942 shots turn you to a monster
Thuggin' like you 2Pac, you know that I got you
Love the way you ride it, move them hips like you Rihanna
I was supposed to hit, I was never s'pose to cuff you
Put you on my homie 'cause he say he wanna fuck you
When he asked me 'bout you, I just told him that I want you
But now its quiet for you, 'cause I told him that I loved you

[Chorus]
You gone fall through every time a nigga call you
That's why I ball how I ball when I spoil you
We was in Miami, first time I saw you

It was late nights, late nights in the bando
Fucking on you good got you bustin' like you Rambo
And you keep it hood so you really understand though
You was there through my ups and downs like a camel

[Verse 2]
I was locked up, I remember when I hit you
Used to write me back every letter that I sent you
You wasn't my girl but you used to pretend to
When I came home, let me beat it instrumental
Lame left you scarred so I had to reinvent you
If you was car, shit, you ride it like a Benz do
Wraith it with the stars, every time I come and get you
We be goin' hard every time you on that Hen' too
I was in the mix, actin' like a savage
Got another bitch and you told me I could have it
I know you was sick so I doubled back to grab you
So anything you wish, yeah yeah, you can have it

[Chorus]
You gone fall through every time a nigga call you
That's why I ball how I ball when I spoil you
We was in Miami, first time I saw you
I was in a Phantom when I pulled up on you
It was late nights, late nights in the bando
Fucking on you good got you bustin' like you Rambo
And you keep it hood so you really understand though
You was there through my ups and downs like a camel

[Bridge]
Whoa, she just want a ride with a shotta, though
I'm an original don dada, though
Knock them all down like dominoes
Make me tell them other bitches, vamonos
Whoa, good gal, bad gal, small city, mad world
She just wanna shine, whoa
And last night was mad real, sunshades, advils, fuck you all the time

[Chorus]
You gone fall through every time a nigga call you
That's why I ball how I ball when I spoil you
We was in Miami, first time I saw you

It was late nights, late nights in the bando
Fucking on you good got you bustin' like you Rambo
And you keep it hood so you really understand though
You was there through my ups and downs like a camel

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Baby, just open, like I got the password to your heart
Got you wide open
You can open wide, you can take it off
Open, open, baby just open
Can you keep it open?

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, fucking you like I just got out the pen
I got you open like I got the pin
Fly out the city and I'll fly you in
Girl, yeah, she bought her homie and I got a friend
She throw it back, dirty whining again
Instant replay, I rewind it again
Shawty bust it open, lay it down
Had to brush up on it, tell her say it now
Niggas hatin' on me, throwin' shade now
'Cause I'm gettin' money and I'm paid now
Had to run it up, on my way now
Only jealous 'cause them niggas lay it down
Got her in a Maybach with her pants down
Put the curtains up and put your head down
Do a headstand, put your ass up
If the pussy good, I get a cash out
If you fucking with me, better answer
Balling in the six like I'm a Raptor
She be only fucking with the trappers
Know the hatin' shit ain't gettin' past us
'Cause you only told her that I only want to hit it
Preachin' to the choir, you the baddest (Ohh)

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Baby, just open, like I got the password to your heart
Got you wide open
You can open wide, you can take it off
Open, open, baby just open
Can you keep it open?

[Verse 2: Verse Simmonds]
Shawty, keep it open like it's 7/11
We might make a scene and shoot that movie wherever
I'm gonna write my name with my tongue, tongue, tongue
All over your body, yeah I know what you want
Keeps them legs up in the air
All this room in the Panemera, girl, that's enough for me
I know we just did it, like do it again, girl, that wasn't enough for me
All these tender kisses, all the way, girl
Then I put them kisses below your waistline
You know I don't play around
Do you better than the last time
Going it like Curry from the baseline
Triple up and dip it low, lay it down
Hit it like I just got out of fed time
Got her thanking mama for that ass now
Got her thanking daddy 'cause you classy
Got her thanking mouth 'cause you nasty

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Baby, just open, like I got the password to your heart
Got you wide open
You can open wide, you can take it off
Open, open, baby just open
Can you keep it open?

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Lil' fish talk (Ah ha ha)
Ah, told her that I would protect her
Went to the jeweler, Patek'd her
Patek Phillipe, she grabbing it deep
She caught it like OD Beckham, pause
Had it, but she never let 'em, ah
Hit it 'cause I do it better, ah
I'm in here, changing the weather, ah
Level up, change for the better, ah
Fuck around and be on TMZ
Paparazzi popping when you be with me
I be flexin' on 'em like it's GNC see
Got that bomb, bomb, call you T.N.T
Only pom-poms when I'm ballin'
Talking bron-bron when I hit the three
Got you open when we coastin'
Talking wraith talk when we rolling like

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Baby, just open, like I got the password to your heart
Got you wide open
You can open wide, you can take it off
Open, open, baby just open
Can you keep it open?

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
I know you thought I wouldn't shine like this
They know I took my time with the shit
Diamonds on my neck, I blind them with the wrist
Hey, it feels good when you make it from nothing
I grind like this
So I can shine like this
Them diamonds on my wrist
It feels good when you make it from nothing

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, North Philly in my bloodstream, nigga
South Philly from my dad genes, nigga
I could wear my dad jeans
Bought my mom and sister a new crib when that cash came
Nigga, put some respect up on my last name
No better feelin' than seeing my cousin serve his last fiend
No better feelin' seein' lil Papi talkin French to me
All this money, these pussies will never get to me
Why you think you never hear 'bout what they did to me?
Hunnid bands, quarter milli, talking big money
I'm want you dead and nobody stopping shit, homie
Cause honestly we give a fuck about your big homie
Fuck it, posted in the jungle with a ladder
How can they compare me to a rapper?
Did it for attention 'cause he had to
Niggas broke, their opinions never mattered
Fuck 'em!

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Damn, it feels good from way up here
Damn, it feels good, baby
Yeah, from way up here

[Chorusk: Teyana Taylor]
I know you thought I wouldn't shine like this
They know I took my time with the shit
Diamonds on my neck, I blind them with the wrist
Hey, it feels good when you make it from nothin'
I grind like this
So I can shine like this
Them diamonds on my wrist
It feels good when you make it from nothin'

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Dreamchasers, accomplishments are remarkable
Big fish, little fish
I always need a prayer before we do the toast
My circle competitive, let's see who move the most
I gave my niggas game before they knew the ropes
Now let's talk about numbers, I really do 'em both
I still got two real uncles who still be doing dope
One of them used to run with a fluky stokes
So many new faces sometimes I do get ghosts
Still one call away from ones who really knew me most
Staying in my lane out of the uzi smoke
You only beating cases based on who you know
Public defender gave him a funeral
Juvenile sent to Rikers, he never knew the rules
Assesin' religions, he don’t know who to choose
Let's bow our head over these Ramen noodles
God is the greatest and I pray for peace
Still rolling up that leaf, Mr. Drew Ali, I salute you

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Damn, it feels good from way up here
Damn, it feels good, baby
Yeah, from way up here

[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
I just want the money, baby, yeah yeah yeah, hey
What they want from me, baby? Yeah yeah yeah, whoa
And we still want it, baby
Money is coming, we still run dough
Niggas run up but we never lay low
Niggas kept it real so we never lay low, never lay low
Run through the money, going way up
Money on the wheels go way up
The doors on the coupe go way up
It's so easy to hate us
Niggas in the club spilling Aces of Spades
Popping on the bub' and they love a check
Niggas going somewhere, I'ma make it
If you ain't got my money, I'ma take that
They probably thought a nigga wouldn't shine like this
Got deals so I signed like this
Diamonds on my neck, I blind them with the wrist
Hey, yeah
I'ma change my mind on you
You know how we do
I'm eating lobster on a plate now

[Verse 1]
Lord, forgive me for my sins, used to pray to get a brick
Nigga icy like it's hockey, and I'm playin' with them sticks
He don't like me, but he gotta respect the fact we gettin' rich
Nigga threw a shot and missed me, threw 'em back and he got hit
Brrrt, brrrt
Went from public housing to a glass house (Glass house)
Fuckin' famous bitches in my trap house
My main bitch fight my side bitch, Kash Doll
The only way to keep them quiet when I cash out (Woo!)
What you doin'? Gettin' paid, young nigga
How you in the mob? 'Cause I'm made, young nigga
Say you need a job, come my way, young nigga
And if I point 'em out, better spray them niggas, bop!
I'm a bad influence (Bad influence, ho)
Talkin' money and I speak it fluent (Speak it fluent, ho)
Paid a couple mill' to wear Puma (Wearing Puma)
I thank God for all this sauce, hallelujah, woo (Amen, amen, amen)
Yeah I knew it, hatin' on me, yeah, I knew it (Yeah, I knew it)
Come down to that check, I'm like Nike, I just do it (I just do it)

She said, "Meek, you know my boyfriend

Yeah I know him, mhmm, he a lame (He a lame)
Don't you ever bring that fuckboy up again

[Chorus]
Poppin' all this shit, need some tissue
I can't trust a bitch 'cause I got issues
Young rich nigga so official
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you (Woah)
Bunch of bad broads on the menu
Bunch of foreign cars when we been through
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you
When it's time for war we send the missiles (Woah)

[Verse 2]
Hangin' by the rope buy some dope (Buy some dope)
Pretty hoe, deep throat 'til she choke (Ooh)
Pussy good, super wet, need a boat (Need a boat)
Niggas tryna ride my wave, let 'em float (Let 'em die)
Put my young bull on the chain 'cause I miss Snupe (Miss Snupe)
Fuck a bad broad, make her kiss Snupe (Kiss Snupe)
I can't ever tell a bitch, "I miss you" (Miss you)
Better not tell nobody if I kiss you (Bitch, you)
Kiss and tell, fuck you good, hit you well (Hit you well)
I just made like 20 M's, they say it's an L (What?)
Niggas prayin' that I fall and I wish 'em well
Bitch you crazy, I'm too wavy, I'm like Biggavel'

[Chorus]
Poppin' all this shit, need some tissue
I can't trust a bitch 'cause I got issues
Young rich nigga so official
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you (Woah)
Bunch of bad broads on the menu
Bunch of foreign cars when we bend through
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you
When it's time for war we send the missiles (Woah)

[Bridge]
Hit 'em with finesse, kill 'em with success
Nigga lookin' broke, give them niggas stress (Broke)
Don't do some shit you know that you gon' regret
Reachin' for my neck, that'll get you stretched (Brrrt, brrrt)

[Chorus]
Poppin' all this shit, need some tissue
I can't trust a bitch 'cause I got issues
Young rich nigga so official
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you (Woah)
Bunch of bad broads on the menu
Bunch of foreign cars when we bend through
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you
When it's time for war we send the missiles (Brrrt, brrrt)

But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Drop: Steven Redant]

[Verse 2: Christina Aguilera]
My bones hurt from all the shows, mmm
But I don't feel the pain, 'cause I'm a pro

'Cause my body belongs to you when I'm on stage, hey
Hey
Do what you want, do want you want
Ohh

But do what you want with my body

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose, if you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body
And don't stop the party

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Christina Aguilera]
You can't have my heart (help me now) and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body

But I don't feel the pain, 'cause I'm a pro
I, I sink in
Then I'm okay
'Cause my body belongs to you when I'm on stage, hey

[Interlude: Lady Gaga + (Christina Aguilera)]
Print some shit, print some shit (do what you want)
Print some shit, make me wanna scream
Print some shit, print some shit (do what you want)
Print some shit, make me wanna scream
Print some shit,  print some shit (do what you want)

Print some shit,  print some shit (do what you want)
Print some shit, make me wanna scream (scream, scream)

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Do what you want with my body

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You, you, you, can't have my heart and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You, can't have my heart and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body

Body, body, body....
Album dropped when I was overseas, data plans & coverage limitations wouldn't allow a decent listen, usually like to oversee when I be whippin, back from china on a American, long story I'll take you back there again, for now let's just focus on the pair of twins times 3, the 13th Jigga, had to make the review rhyme this time for you niggas, shit takes me back like Royal slippers, with sublime glimpses of that old spitter, baseline bully, he wouldn't freestyle a whole album would he?, leave the speculation to the bookies, push me back to when we was rookies, chip off the old Roc, presenting my cookies to the cutter, the album is better than yours motherfuckers, hence why I peruse swift, and curse all ya gifts, Smile is the shit, 4:44 too personal for my opinion, but makes me wanna go up and apologize to random women, Blame Jay, the vibe checkered but dirty beats make it hard to sneak past the first 5 records, looped up the jewels viewing the clarity during a layover, right now awesome, give you the rest when I get to Boston...👍🏾

The second half meditation, sounds like what happens when education meets decorations for mass that met black witchcraft and when half on calf, holy cow, MARCY ME!, had to put it in all caps, the artistry separates the bullshit from the Bulls Chips, partially, all facts, how he gone take it there? The beat feel like Sanaa Lathan hair...in slow motion, next to the ocean, wordplay gorgeous, 5 mics no sources, I ain't publicly leaned back bopped in a while especially to this style of a portrait, vulnerable but not tortured, a fortress ain't gotta force it, real time classic, a revival of the corpus, the Tribeca Jay cool but he like for the masses, the Brooklyn Jay a ghoul only suitable for the masters, MARCY ME so fucking stupid! Funny part is I know exactly how he do it, can even reproduce it, but just cuz you can imitate the bruises that don't mean they Bruce's, message to the hearer, Lee that boy alone, he's fighting without fighting we just cuts inside his mirror!
10/10

Get a little beat and I'll loop that
Get a little money, I'll oop that
Split it with my niggas in the group chat
Left for a minute then I flew back
Had to ask Bruce, "Where the truth at?"
Had to ask Rahm, "Where the truth at?"
Now I can't ride with the roof back
Tell 'em I don't play around with other people's kids
Got an office in the steakhouse, gotta bid for the ribs
Got a meeting at the Ritz, gave a crib to my rib
'Cause she leaving where I live but I see her in a min'
Got a Michael prayer card for the good luck, ayy
Bra push up when I pull up, ayy

Big old Bentley, bitch I mix the Henny with the Simply
Lemonade exterior, Lorenzos under Bentleys

Wake up real early but I eat late
Go and hit the streets with that briefcase
Time to shake down another cheapskate
You could tell he's lying, cheesecake, uh

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Make a nigga bitch tap out, then put 24's on a real big body
Bitch-ass nigga need to stop it
Got a hundred racks on me, can't fit in my pocket

Told y'all niggas I ain't stopping
Black card in my wallet, I'ma feed my partner (Feed partner)
I was at one of my shows feeling like Cam'ron with the pink Margielas (Margielas)
We was tryna beat a murder capital, riding 'round the town with the pink Beretta (Beretta)
When I got in touch with the money, me and shawty fucked around and filled my schedule (My schedule)
Mama just sent me a picture, got Indian in my family through my goddamn nana (Through my nana)
Young nigga fucked 'round, dropped out school, learned it all through the ID channel ('D channel)
Young nigga fucked around and ran out of bullets in the .40, gotta get a banana (Banana)
These young niggas go brazy, done got that money, they still might pop (Brrat)
So many blue faces on me right now, young nigga still gamble
Thirty-five racks for the factories, I steal mammals, sheesh
I ain't no rat but, nigga, I cheese up

Boomerang your bitch, swee, she coming back

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
Please, please

Bitch, I know who I am, uh
Don't you know that I love
Honest I do

No one else above

Please tell me you love me
Stop driving me mad
You're the sweetest little one
That I ever had

I don't know how to love
Stop driving me mad
When Iwoke up this morning
I never felt so bad
Well, my baby's gone
Won't be back no more
Well, my baby's gone
Won't be back no more
She left me soon this morning
Like she did the night before
I don't want no woman
One that treat me wrong all the time
I don't want no woman
One that treat me wrong all the time
Well, I got a me doin' baby
She 'bout to drive me out my mind

[Verse 1]
Blew a kiss with a shotgun
Then I swallowed your pill straight down, down, down
Yeah, the love's coming undone
But we can't let it die we drown, drown, drown

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the final time
Got to give up 'cause it's over
This is so over
Look out, it's a car crash
Yeah, I'm gonna take off over and out

[Chorus]
We're making a mess here together
We drilled a hole in the roof
Because of a misunderstanding
Never been further from you
We're bringing out horses and lasers
We act like we're sniffing glue
So sick of the stranger within me
Sick of the stranger in you

[Post-Chorus]
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess

[Verse 2]
Burn a hole in the paper
But we can't let a fire start to spread
'Cause we locked up our bodies
Might as well start sleeping with the dead

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the final time
Got to give up 'cause it's over
This is so over
Put your hand on your mouth boy
'Cause I'm blocking out all those words you said

[Chorus]
We're making a mess here together
We drilled a hole in the roof
Because of a misunderstanding
Never been further from you
We're bringing out horses and lasers
We act like we're sniffing glue
So sick of the stranger within me
Sick of the stranger in you

[Post-Chorus]
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess

[Bridge]
Let's make a mess here together
Let's drill a hole in the roof
I'm loving this misunderstanding
Never been further from you
Let's bring out the horses and lasers
Let's act like we're sniffing glue
So sick of the stranger within me
Sick of the stranger in you

[Chorus]
We're making a mess here together
We drilled a hole in the roof
Because of a misunderstanding
Never been further from you
We're bringing out horses and lasers
We act like we're sniffing glue
So sick of the stranger within me
Sick of the stranger in you

[Outro]
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess

[Verse 1]
Let me begin where it began
When I first met you
You had me blind with all your charms
And your French perfume
And when we kissed your spit
It always tasted like roses and wine

[Verse 2]
A few months on
And everything started to fall through
Like when we took that trip
The rain poured through your sunroof
Now when we kiss your spit is poisoned
I still don't mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Hurt me bad but I still come back
I can't break away
All these bruises turn me blue but
I still like the pain

[Chorus]
Baby, I gotta be a little bit crazy
To fall back in love with you
All the trouble that you gave me
I must be coo coo coo crazy
Baby, I gotta be a little bit crazy
To fall back in love with you
Left me hanging on a maybe
I must be coo coo coo crazy

[Verse 3]
Now, lets fast forward to today
All you do is ignore me (ahh)
Never want to pick the phone up
When you see me callin'
Why is that? What did I do?
I gave you all my secrets (my secrets)
Even though you told me lies
I promised that I'd keep them

[Verse 4]
You laughed at me
At all my clothes
You said that I looked stupid
But I can't help the way I feel
I've been attacked by Cupid
There's an arrow in my heart (heart)
I'm about to fall apart (part)
I wish that we could hit rewind
Why can't we go back to the start?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hurt me bad but I still come back
I can't break away (away-away-away-ahh)
All these bruises turn me blue but
I still like the pain, ahh

[Chorus]
Baby, I gotta be a little bit crazy
To fall back in love with you
All the trouble that you gave me
I must be coo coo coo crazy
Baby, I gotta be a little bit crazy
To fall back in love with you (in love)
Left me hanging on a maybe (ahh)
I must be coo coo coo crazy

Oh, oh, oh, aah, oh, oh, ohh aah, oh, oh
Oh aah, ohh, ohhhh, ohhh, ohh aah
Crazy, crazy, crazy
Ohh aah
Coo coo coo crazy

[Bridge]
Baby I'm crazy
I hope that you know
Baby I'm crazy
I can't let you go
Oh, baby I'm crazy
I hope that you know-oh-ohh-ohh ahh

[Chorus]
Baby, I gotta be a little bit crazy
To fall back in love with you
All the trouble that you gave me
I must be coo coo coo crazy
Baby, I gotta be a little bit crazy
To fall back in love with you
Left me hanging on a maybe
I must be coo coo coo crazy

[Outro]
Crazy, crazy, crazy
Ohh aah
Coo coo coo crazy

[Verse 1]
When you make time
To clear the cobwebs off your mind
You may find yourself unwind
When all the ticking stops dead
You may find your time instead
And you can be your silhouette

[Verse 2]
When you just stop
And take a look around your shop
You may feel your blues all drop
You can't sell your glum to me
But I can help you til' you see
That you can be your silhouette

[Verse 3]
It may be dark
It may be shadowy and stark
But don't be scared of what you've met
Your dance with it is no threat
In fact it is an asset
You can be your silhouette

[Verse 1]
Bedtime for the birds as night cloaks the earth
Then the moon smiles at the sun's birth
Faceless night cowers underneath
The ever-changing moonlit sky
Can you believe the way night falls away
As the sun starts a new day?

[Verse 2]
Plants raise their leaves as the sun waves goodbye
Dusk greets the horizon as day fades
Black lines bend round a cityscape
While trailing off in the sunset's wake
I can foresee that dawn will bring the light
As the sun gives way to night

[Intro]
Oh, uh, oh
Oh, yee, yeah, get it
We got London on the track
Oh, uh, uh, shit, fuck, shit

[Chorus]
You remind me of a Jeep
When I took a ride, ride on them guys
Left 'em hypnotized
Girl, you remind me of a Jeep
When we took a ride, we slid on them guys
Too gangsta to disguise it, ayy (Jeffery)

[Verse 1]
Pull up on the block, leave damage (yeah)
Peer pressure make a nigga panic (bitch)
No brainer, I'm like I'm on a Xanny (on a Xanny)
Shoot an AK with a Patek (yeah, blip, blip, blip)
An' I'm very good at mathematics (yeah, an' I'm very good at)
Young nigga whole body tatted (young nigga, whole body)
YSL, a nigga want static? (YSL)
No plug, let 'em earn a casket (yea, no plug)
All these hoes tryna play me (bitch)
All these niggas tryna play me (tryna pimp)
I heard that you ball like it’s Grady (I heard)
I'ma put a nigga to your grave (brr)
These niggas say they can’t ride with snakes (facts)
Metallic Balmain like I'm Drake (like I'm Drake)
Moonwalkin' like I'm Michael J. (Michael J.)
Jeffery a real OG (OG)
Well, the bitch 23, ooh-wee (young Jeffery)
23, Molly, Michael J. (Michael J.)
I'ma take my talents to outer space (outer space)
Top bankrolls outta Js (outta Js)
YSL clearing out the place (yeah, we clear that)
I'ma put the barrel in his face (brr)
Never treat a freak like bae (uh-uh, brr)
'Prised still beat a nigga case

[Chorus]
You remind me of a Jeep
When I took a ride, ride on them guys
Left 'em hypnotized
Girl, you remind me of a Jeep
When we took a ride, we slid on them guys
Too gangsta to disguise it, ayy

[Verse 2]
I’ma take the ball, make the basket (made the basket)
I ain't wearing Robbins, Baskin (nigga, Baskin)
Fifth-grade, ballin' like a Maverick (in fifth-grade)
Pussy niggas steal a nigga swagger (a nigga swag)
Weddin' ring, they wasn’t even married (weddin' ring)
Blowin' up over these fabrics (priceless)
Real talent never get a chance (get a chance)
Still wearing platinum like a can (like a can)
Gotta freshen' up, black Ken (I'm up)
Red flag on my chin like a hen (priceless)
20/20 bubblin' out the Benz (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Young nigga ballin’ out a gym (out a gym)
Lapdance, wrinkle on my pants (pants)
All four pockets rubber bands  (priceless)
Bought the bitch some water, she’ll swim (priceless)
Big diamonds, Adult Swim (Adult, nigga)
YSL saggin’ on the Timbs (YSL)
An' my bank account on blimp (priceless)
Boolin' by the shore with the shrimps (by the shore)
New York whore with the brim (woo)
Every day, a whole 'nother timepiece (time piece)
And she ain't a ten, she a dime piece (woo)
Hundred thousand dollars on a fine piece (priceless)
If you look for diamonds, you'll find me (facts)

[Chorus]
You remind me of a Jeep
When I took a ride, ride on them guys
Left 'em hypnotized
Girl, you remind me of a Jeep
When we took a ride, we slid on them guys
Too gangsta to disguise it, ayy

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
I don't know if I can take it
But I know I love it when you get naked, naked
Breakfast in bed when I taste it
Good head, pussy wet just to chase it
Girl, I'm wasted, you're my favorite
Nigga couldn't play you if you was on a playlist
Shawty, you know you're my favorite
She my side piece she ain't even gotta say shit
She give me good vibrations
So bad, she deserve a good citation
Wish a bitch would try hatin'
She can get a one-way ticket , I'm the hood Live Nation
I'm not a good boy, baby
I fuck her like a rude boy, baby
And If I ever throw this at you
Better catch it like you knew Tom Brady
I'm in the mood for some whoosah, baby
Good head on her like whoosah. baby
I see the future
Me and you fucking in the bedroom
Now tell me what you saw, baby
Shawty tell the truth, I'm wavy
Stars in the ceiling, baby, roof goin' crazy
Swimming in it, I feel like I live in the Matrix, baby
That pussy A-list, red-bottom, baby
New Celine on you, you deserve a whole news crew and team on you
You and me is looking like the Eulogy
I'm 'bout to get you wetter than Katrina, going New Orleans on you
Why, oh why
You got that my, oh my
You got that water, by the water when I slide, I glide, oh why, yeah
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Heard that pussy for the taking
Know that pussy feel a-motherfuckin-mazin'
Baby sweeter than a pastry
Cake, cake, cake, like a mother fucking bakery
Let me put my face in your waist
Put my taste in your face
Choose on trip like your second set of lips
Put your juice on my stick, first, let me get a sip
Quick, no Trick Daddy, but daddy got dollars
Ain't that why you wanna be my baby momma?
No kiss, is that something you can swallow
Got her leg shaking like my vibrato
When I put it all in, no lie, I think I'm fallin'
Drive me crazy with no hands
Goin' HAM, no romance or slow jams
Goddamn, with the waves in your ocean
This the ride of your life, rollercoaster
Took a ride on the pipe, water flowing
Got your eyes looking blind, how they rollin'
Keep you cumming every time that we go in
Talking dirty and that pussy well spoken
Death Row that pussy, I'm West Coastin'
Pray for niggas that's less fortunate
Slay all day, I'm that focused (I like it)
Call her "bae," like that's Oakland, yeah
I'm not a new boy, baby
I see the future and you are, baby
Stains on the sheets, she's on the floor
Busting all night like an UR, baby
I get around like 2Pac, baby
But, when I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts

[Intro: Waiter talking]
Here you are, sir, just how you like
Careful, it's hot
Enjoy...

[Verse 1]
Okay, come be my appetizer
My fruit, my apple cider, my colada
My papaya, how you want it?
I told the waiter what I wanted
I told him don't bring me a plate
If it don't have a rapper on it
Chef Angel on the beat
And me I'm just snackin' on it
Yeah, I'm eatin' with my hands
I'm gonna need a napkin, homie
You lookin' like a glazed pig
With an apple on it
I'mma need a Snapple, homie
And another after, homie
Snap crackle, homie
There goes another rapper
Just consider that bologna
You are just a macaroni
In my tuna casserole

Bowl of french of fries
Tell 'em bitches bonjour
Boy, I eat your food
Hot and cold
And I'm no where near full

[Interlude: Waiter talking]
Hope you enjoyed your appetizer
Here's your main course...

[Verse 2]
Good 'cause I'm bout hungrier than a mothafucka
Finger lickin' good never been a thumb sucker
I eat your ass good, never leave a crumb sucka
Never been a club hopper I'm a club jumper
That mean I get the club jumpin', I'm grubbin
Rappers say, "Hello Wayne", I reply, "What up supper?"
I could fry your ass up a saute
Marinade ya all day

'Cause all the rappers salty
'Cause all the rappers fault me
For bein' the best of all thee

Because I if no one else deserve
Now where is my dessert?

[Interlude: Waiter talking]
And now for dessert...

[Verse 3]
Yes, this is dessert
For his and hers
I'll take his her
Kiss her
Make her pussy purr
Wet zipper
Never tip her
Never fall in love with a stripper
Like strawberries, I dip her
In whip cream, I whip her
I let her melt, then sip her
Like sizzurp, I'm tryna quit the sizzurp
'Cause moms say quit the sizzurp
But my auntie mom trippin', she a tripper
And I can eat you quicker
But I'm gonna take my time with it
Like a 3 legged cake I gotta climb in it
But ain't shit sweet when I'm in it
When I'm in it, I told her you gonna miss me
If I hit it
I'm done with it
And can't nobody else  do what I done with it
Not what I done did it
My tongue drippin'
Feed me rappers or feed me beats

[Digests]

[Outro]
Young Mula Baby, hehe

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin', it's September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I never knew that love was blind
'Til I was hers, but she was never mine
Yeah, I was reckless
But I let it burn, I let it burn, yeah
The feelin', it was bittersweet
Realizin' I was in too deep
She was a lesson
I had to learn, I had to learn, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember
Ooh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin' in September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey
Ooh, like a whiskey, ooh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Would've left this world behind
Just to wake up by your side
Every mornin', I would've sold my soul for a lil' more time
Would've waited a thousand nights
If she never said goodbye
I admit that I
Would've sold my soul for a little more time
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin', it's September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
I ain't like the other Cognacs
Or type of cat that'd never call back
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
(Feelin' light and dizzy, might be tipsy)
All of that tequila's a killer, little vodka
Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle
(Every time you kiss me, like some whiskey)
Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom Pérignon, she the fine wine
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time
She done got off with my heart

[Chorus: Adam Levine & (A$AP Rocky)]
Leaves are fallin', it's September (oh)
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young (so young)
'Til she kissed me (yeah)
Like a whiskey (yeah)
And I was so young (so young)
'Til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

[Verse 1]
Goodbye kinsman, polygon
I'm goin' abroad, gondwana
Drift until I, polygon
Get to my stop, gondwanaland
Grand and never been
Seen by man, veil of a dream

[Chorus]
We're gonna get there
We don't need a whereabouts
We're gonna get there
Follow where the river runs
We're gonna get there
Polygondwanaland

[Verse 2]
Exit snow melts, polygon
Float on rain drops, gondwana
It will get hot, polygon
Fasten seatbelts, gondwanaland
Sand and mountains
Unbosom its hidden hand

We're gonna get there
We don't need a whereabouts

Follow where the river runs

Polygondwanaland

[Verse 1]
Don't you treat like I'm anybody
Not average, I'm not everyone
You criticize me like you're something special
But you're not
This is who I am, not ordinary
If you want the prize, better pay the price
Pointing out all the flaws in me like you were perfect
But you're not

[Chorus]
There you go
Didn't you make a convenient exit?
I'd rather be on my own
I'd rather be all alone
There's something you didn't know
Here you come
Trying to make a convenient entrance
I'm turning my heart into stone
I'd rather be all alone
Than be alone with you

[Verse 2]
Try to shoot me down, it'll ricochet
You can't escape, always hear my name
I'd like to raise the glass to all your arrogance (Look it up)
Call it what you want, you're history
I'll never understand, you're a mystery
You lied with every kiss
It all comes down to this

[Chorus]
There you go
Didn't you make a convenient exit?
I'd rather be on my own
I'd rather be all alone
There's something you didn't know
Here you come
Trying to make a convenient entrance
I'm turning my heart into stone
I'd rather be all alone
Than be alone with

[Outro]
I'd rather be all alone
Now I'm free
I'd rather be all alone
I'd rather be all alone
Now I'm free
I'd rather be all alone
You can't handle me

[Chorus]
You're under my attack
There's no turning back
Look into my eyes and love me through the midnight

[Verse 1]
Anything that you want
I can be everything that you're gonna need
This can be easy
Let me drink all your blood
I'm the love that will keep you down on your knees
This can be easy

[Pre-Chorus]
I reflect in the mirror, shimmer
(As my glitter falls on your skin)
Hold your heart in my fingers, linger
(I'll defile your soul within)

[Chorus]
You're under my attack
There's no turning back
Look into my eyes and love me through the midnight
Don't stop until we're through
Say "I love you”
Hold my body tight and love me through the midnight

[Verse 2]
It's not gonna hurt at all
If you please let me take over all control
Can you just trust me?
I'll carry your broken bones
Never going, never leave you out in the cold
I know that you love me

[Pre-Chorus]
I would give you my last breath, helpless
(Won't you stay with me in this place?)

[Chorus]
You're under my attack
There's no turning back
Look into my eyes and love me through the midnight
Don't stop until we're through
Say "I love you"
Hold my body tight and love me through the midnight

[Bridge]
It's beautiful
Our hearts glow pink and sapphire
Our bodies dance like burning wings of fire
We're tainted by the one thing we desire
It's alright, it's alright

[Chorus]
Don't stop until we're through
Say "I love you"
Hold my body tight and love me through the midnight

[Chorus]
You're under my attack
There's no turning back
Look into my eyes and love me through the midnight
Don't stop until we're through
Say I love you
Hold my body tight and love me through the midnight

[Outro]
Say "I love you"
Say "I love you"
Say "I love you"
Say "I love you"

[Verse 1]
God gave me a sign
He put it in my glass of wine
A great theophany
He told me every sinner had to die
So I set up my sign
And tell the passersby
We are a sacrifice
Like it or not, I live by the book

[Chorus]
These aren't fables
Between pages
My book's ageless
And it's pageless
The book
The book
The book

[Verse 2]
God gave me a knife
And wrote seppuku underlined
Godly suicide
He told me everyone will die
So judge me by the page
But not by my cover
You’ll learn more with age
Like it or not, I live by the book

[Chorus]
These aren't fables
Between pages
My book's ageless
And it's pageless
The book
The book
The book

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
These aren't fables
Between pages
My book's ageless
And it's pageless

Laze in the afternoon sun
Gazing at each other's beauty
The huntsman's heart forever beats
Our union is forever

[Verse 2]
Love for my spider is nothing stranger
Than my admiring
Love of nature
Am I a hippie if I have this love?
We are the same stuff
From the same cloth

[Refrain]
Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me (Spider and me)

[Bridge]
Laze in the afternoon sun
Gazing at each other's beauty
The huntsman's heart forever beats
Our union is forever

Let me just introduce you to my friend
Under the tree

Uh, they better watch what they say to me
Niggas still gettin' popped on the day to day

Ride 'round listen to Sade, nigga
If you ain't with us, you in our way, nigga

People lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJs
Made the release date a police date
People sayin', "Ye, Ye, take it easy"
20 Gs for the Yeezys off of eBay
Niggas do the most and they ain't done shit

Faded (drank), faded (drank)

[Verse 1]
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Hook]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience
If you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe
I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

[Hook]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

If you've got a little I'ma share a thought
You from Compton? Get your uncle, poppa
He a gangster, he know how to party
You ain't nothing like him
You a stranger to this
G shit
Fuck a sip, nigga
Take it to the neck, nigga
Take it for the dead homies
Homie, just a set
This the business
Many bitches, alcohol
Deal with it
Be a Navy Seal with it
Swim until you feel (drunk)

[Verse 1]
I hate you for what you did
And I miss you like a little kid
I faked it every time
But that's alright
I can hardly feel anything
I hardly feel anything at all

[Verse 2]
You gave me fifteen hundred
To see your hypnotherapist
I only went one time
You let it slide
Fell on hard times a year ago
Was hoping you would let it go, and you did

[Chorus]
I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out

[Verse 3]
I'm on the outside looking through
You're throwing rocks around your room
And while you're bleeding on your back
In the glass
I'll be glad that I made it out
And sorry that it all went down like it did

[Chorus]
I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out
Hey, why do you sing with an English accent?
I guess it's too late to change it now
You know I'm never gonna let you have it
But I will try to drown you out

[Bridge]
You said when you met me, you were bored
You said when you met me, you were bored
And you, you were in a band when I was born

[Chorus]
I have emotional motion sickness
I try to stay clean and live without
And I want to know what would happen
If I surrender to the sound
Surrender to the sound

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
1996, I left it all behind
Cause I ain't got no roof on mine
I had to jump ship, I double back for my
My accountant handle my shit
I never been the losing kind
Grind
I'm feeling like it's year one
I'm a fool anywhere, near square one
But ain't no glass ceilings, I crash through 'em
Ain't no cold spells, I light a match to 'em
Ain't no haters, right, just say congrats to 'em
This is Detox, this rehab to 'em
I bring it back years later, let it flow through 'em
Putting that chronic in their system like I used to do 'em
Respected, so it's proven that's what I been doing
Moving the game like weight and everybody been using
Bitch, it ain't really nothing left to say
You're tuned in to Detox, I'm Dr. Dre

[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
(Pow) Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
(Pow) Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now

[Verse 2: Nas]
Your skin's your travelling bag of your existence
Yours is shabby and scab, while mine's glistenin'
Vivid on my skin, how many continents I visit then
You can journey with me to different places by listenin'
Shitting on them, your brother got it covered
We can slug it, knuckle it, however you want it, I love it
A hustler's wit, the grit, the grind
My genetic code make up, murderer by design
On Mayan calendar time, when night meets day
I'm in the light grey Bugatti like a high speed chase
Adrenaline like jogger, the jumping rope in place
Muhammed Ali hobbies, no Pilates, tryna keep the ocean by me
Hit a rich man's wife, see what these hoes can buy me
Looking forward, but it's nice to see the road behind me
Hotel's a seven star, Baguette's glowing
Keep your lid, yet dawg, the private jet Boeing, topless

[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
(Pow) Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
(Pow) Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Last night was mad real
Popping Percs like they was Advils
And I've been putting on for my city
Seven summers and they acting like they mad still
Damn, I showed these niggas how that cash feel
I even let 'em eat my last meal
And any nigga go against the squad, you know I gotta make a call and get that man killed (let me pop my shit, uh)
Two Maybachs, couple milli, I'm feeling great
So much love when you barely can feel the hate
Them hoes love when you pulling up in that Wraith
For the love of that money your dog'll turn to a snake
Your homie turned to a rat, he is fighting his case
They talked in that federal and he praying they keep his state
He praying to make it home
But you ain't answer your phone
Cause it's word on the street, them people didn't put him on
He got your name to 'em like several times
Trying to put you in a cell 'til you 75
Should've knew it when that nigga said "I'm telling my mom"
Them people grabbed you and you wasn't surprised
What a nightmare
I'm having flashes about that corner selling, that right there
Cops riding past, '40 on me I got it right here
And I ain't trying to lose nigga
Play it by the rules nigga
When you get that money watch the way them bitches choose nigga
Fuck you like a porn star, just don't lose your cool nigga
Pussy taste good, but it won't feed you like no food nigga
We was putting work in 'til we had to keep that tool with us
Took that shit to school with us (yeah, let me tell 'em)
Pulled up in my hood and I jump out the Wraith
Bust down, Patek, diamonds jump out the face
Fear of god on me, I got nothing but faith
Like where the love, I'm feeling nothing but hate
I'm from a hood where before you make it to the morgue niggas will come to your place
Day 1's all in your crib trying to touch in your safe
They shiesty, got a nerve to even come to the wake
Seen your son and give a fuck if he ain't
That's why I'm cutthroat
New Benz truck ghost, I move
Get the upmost respect when I come through
Nigga, i get up close and personal
I bang on you vertical when I up toast
Move like a I'm ghost get the pie or your cell go, gang

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Put some respect on my name
They got me feeling like Baby
Diamonds they on me go crazy
Saint Laurent on me no wavy
Fucking around we ain't fucking around I can't fuck with these niggas they shady
I know your jewelry fugazi
I know the jeweler who made it \, fraud
I know these niggas gone talk about us
We getting money they talk about us
We never ever gone talk about us
We only trapping to tuck a dollar
Wait, wait, wait
I'm tryna flip and get all the profits
I had his bitch and I ain't call him bout her
I tell that nigga ''I'm sorry about her"
Shotty popping in the dog filter
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, nigga
I'ma shoot him, I don't call niggas
On the deuce like Wall nigga
Cross her over hit her with the oooh
In the Wraith, stars in the roof
Light her up like Pikachu
In the ghost playing peek-a-boo
Wait, Niggas can't figure me out, hey
I keep a stick in the house, ay
I got a brick in the couch, ay
Sit on that shit in the drought, ay
Sell it for trip of the mount, ay
Stack it up, bag it up, add it up, ready for shipment, we sending 'em out , gang
I just got some brand new shmoney
I just got some brand new shmoney

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
We went from selling cocaina to selling out arenas
Yeah, get Louis flip flops pulling yachts out the marinas
Dirty young bulls living like you've never seen a
Flows on jalapena
My hoes on Aquafina
I goes to La Marina
The scoop and Spanish broad
I met me a Spanish plug
He getting Evander off, that Holyfield I hand him the cash
Throw me a raw, you know it's real
Ducking them indictments, it was so excitin'
Serving pipers that go to Vegas, back when Floyd was fightin'
Carbon fiber Rari the tire when we floor I'm buying
Bitches used to tell us we ugly now we being biased
We survivors, we beat them streets, young nigga we surviving
Walk in the building, look at the sheep when they see a lion
Totin' choppers, ducking narcotics, and we being beating bodies
Man I be getting niggas pussy just from being biased
Tell me I'm losing what do you mean?
Westbrook baby, no switching teams
Drop this triple double every time I'm on the scene
I won't claim that bitch, that's Billie Jean
She's not my lover
Lethal weapon, Danny Glover
O.J style when I cut her
Put my gloves up, say I'm not guilty I lucked up
These niggas got me fucked up
Ball on these niggas every time I cop
Coming down Collins in a brand new drop
Hermes seats, with my son lil pop
Watching cartoons in the back, SpongeBob
Wins and Losses, we in the building you already know its New York City
It's your boy Meek Milly
IT'S YOUR BOY MEEK MILLY IN THIS BITCH FATBOY WHAT'S UP

[Fatboy SSE]
MEEK MILL IS IN THE BUILDING
ONE OF THE MOST CONSISTENT RAPPERS IN THE GAME
HE DROPS HEAT EVERY DAY
LETS GO
PHILLY
MEEK MILL STOP PLAYING
STOP PLAYING
STOP PLAYING WITH ME
MEEK MILL IN THE BUILDING
LEGEND
DC COME ON
MEEK MILL IS IN THE BUILDING
COME ON
COME ON
STOP PLAYING
HE'S A LEGEND
Say when are you gonna come back home?
Can't you forgive this one who has done you wrong?
Well, I let temptation
Get the best of me
Now I'm sorry
I caused you misery
Say when, oh darling
Say when

I was swayed by a smile
And some loving charms
And like a fool, I was drawn
To another's arms
Blinded by her kisses
I couldn't see that with you
Was where I really wanted to be
So please say when
Baby, say when

I know I acted just like
A selfish child
Taking all and giving none
All the while
But now I've grown up
And I want to prove I can
Love you more than any other man
So, please, forgive me
And say when
Oh, baby
I was wrong
Forgive me

[Fading]
I was swayed by a smile
Forgive me
Forgive me
The more I see you
The more I want you
Somehow this feeling
Just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you
And so it goes

Can you imagine
How much I love you?
The more I see you
As years go by
I know the only one for me
Can only be you
My arms won't free you
My heart won't try

I know the only one for me
Can only be you
My arms won't free you, baby
My hear won't try, baby
Hey, my heart won't try

[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1]
Thinking about the way she looked, the way she leapt right out of bed
I can't seem to stop that day from replaying inside my head
Ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
Cause this house ain't no home, yeah this house ain't no home, yeah this house ain't no home
Without she, lying next to me
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
She walks with such grace, she'll never be replaced

[Chorus]
I wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss but more than this
I wish you love

And in July, lemonade
To cool you in some leafy place
I wish you health and more than wealth
I wish you love

My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So with my best, my very best
I set you free

I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
I wish you love

Well, my breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never, never be
So with my best, my very best
I set you free
I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
I wish you love, love, love

[Verse]
Quiet nights of quiet stars
Quiet chords from my guitars
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And the window that looks out on the mountains and the seas, how lovely
This is where I want to be here
With you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember
I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke, have found with you, yeah
The meaning of existence, oh my love

[Outro]
Oh, I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke, have found with you, baby
The meaning of existence, oh my love
Oh my love

[Verse]
Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of May
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play
Say "Emily, Emily, Emily"
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily, Emily, ooh

[Outro]
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images, yes, in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily, Emily
Emily, too

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
I watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
Sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon’s gonna owe it one
Makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors then rapidly
Just turn around and start asking me
About things that you want back from me

[Pre-Chorus 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
I’m sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick)
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place, to feed your greed (Find!)
While I find a place to rest

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don’t understand
(You’ll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A Place for My Head

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Maybe someday I’ll be just like you and
Step on people like you do and
Run away the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
Used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should’ve known
That you’d wear out your welcome
And now you see how quiet it is, all alone

[Pre-Chorus 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (Aah)
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (Aah)
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest (Kill it!)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don’t understand
(You’ll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A Place for My Head

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
You try to take the best of me (Go away)
You try to take the best of me (Go away)
You try to take the best of me (Go away)
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don’t understand
(You’ll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A Place for My Head

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Ugh!
Shut!
Up!
Why!
I am so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (Go!)
Sick of you acting like I owe you this (Oh!)
Find another place to feed your greed (Why!)
While I find a place to rest
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
(Stay away from me!) Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest (Motherfucker!)

[Verse 2]
I'm drinking a soy latte
I get a double shoté
It goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my mini cooper, and I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes
This metaphysic's shit is dope, and if all this can give me hope
You know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver, and a jet
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard, or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American Dream
American dream, American dream
American dream, American dream

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Verse 1]
I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
That's why I wrote this song
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?

[Verse 2]
So, I went into a bar
Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said
It's always been the same
This type of modern life, is not for me
This type of modern life, is not for free

[Chorus]
American Life
(American Life)
I live the American Dream
(American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream

[Verse 3]
I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more
This type of modern life, is not for me
This type of modern life, is not for free

[Refrain]
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I going to be a star?

I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I tried to find a friend
I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
Fuck it

[Verse 5]
I'm drinking a soy latte

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]

I got the key to the streets
I got the key to the safe
He wanna see what I'm selling
I put the key in his face
I just got back from the dealer, i got the key to the Wraith
I got the key to the Bentley Truck
When I leave the booth, I'm gone pick it up
Facts, when I'm in my hood, shit I do what I wanna
250 im spinnin'  the corner
You better get busy you running up on us, no rat
Ain't no rat nigga
Play on my nigga you know you a goner
Play on my nigga you know they gone hit you
These niggas be hating the fuck is they issue?
They mad, ah damn, busting it down on my real ones
They kill each other for lil ones
We tryna set up the lil ones
Loyalty only thing matter to me
We bout to bust up some millions
Niggas is ready civilians
We the type never to 

[?]
Wait, wait wait, walk in and blow when I step in it
I'm from the P and I'm repping it
Seen it with me that's a definite
That was your chick, better check on it
I write a name, put a check on it
She suck my dick get a check for it
Im tripping
Maybach, Maybach, Maybach, Maybach in this bitch
Back to back and the black on black Maybach Maybach getting rich
Maybach, Maybach, Maybach, when she suck this Maybach dick
Maybach Maybach does that shit
Timing is money and money is time
Hustle like I'm bout to run out of time
Step to a chump in the front of the line
Get on my level I been in the mix
Blue on Rick 'Rari like Optimus Prime
Most of these niggas be popping these pills
Don't know what they talking, they out of they mind
They sipping that lean and popping them percys a thousand a time
They said that they goons get not full bodied they dropping a dime
You said he a hitter, why you was lying?
He hit the district, he posting them pictures and crying for mom
Niggas is rats, gang
Living that shit I was rapping and rapping this shit I was trapping
We catch them niggas in traffic
That F N 5 7 drop 21 on 'em no savage
I ain't not doing no rapping
That 2500 my sneakers three thousand my jacket
Niggas be thinking that I'm into fashion
I'm being Neiman's just ball in the snap
Double M G, we gone crush y'all
If it's fuck me, you know its fuck y'all
Bitch ass niggas, they don't want war
All these choppers in the crib look like a gun store
And the rose gold look like duck sauce in the Maybach
With a young broad why the fuck would I give a fuck for?
We don't lose sleep by the fuck boy
Sending hits like a drug lord, Pablo
Dog food like Ralo
If they all move then they die slow, pronto
Mixing that Louis, that Gucci, that east Saint Laurent with diamond Milano
Feeling that shit that I ride for
Pop a wheelie when we see the 5-0
Who motivate niggas if I go?
Name one at the ClearPort, where you can't come
Eating, finger-licking on the G5
Prime state with the A1
When it come to rappers, I don't be with niggas
I'm still mobbing on them with my day ones
Lil shorty try to play the kid (KIdd) but I'm Jason
Handle that rod like it's And 1
Talking hot sauce when I pop off with the top off
Finna Wraith fan from a popstar
Man I live a life niggas would die for
This that young nigga talk at the dealer shit
When you killing shit, on some winner shit
At the VMA's with the 30 on me
In the front row and who with the shits
Cause these fuck niggas say they want smoke
When we run into 'em we gone kill the shit
Talking really quick
Keep the strap on me like a nigga bitch
All these racks on me I feel nigga rich
Yeah you know, all these racks on me, I feel nigga rich
All these racks on me, I feel nigga rich
I'm tired this the end of the night
I swear to God I ain't go to sleep last night
Hey Clue, I swear to God you better stop doing your show at nighttime too Clue
Wins and Losses is in stores right now, Meek Milly its your boy checking in
NYC, you already know what it is we in this bitch, gang

Back to back and the black on black Maybach Maybach getting rich
Maybach, Maybach, Maybach, when she suck this Maybach dick
Maybach Maybach does that shit, GANG

[Verse 1]
I was compressed into a pixel
Reifications right up the road, my dear
It's hot as hell, lickin' my elbow
But you know I sing like a bird, my love, the cage

[Bridge 1]
Oh, what— Oh, what the hell can I say?
T-T-Tyncopate the way it turned out
T-T-Tyncopate the way, take the—
I syncopate the way it turned out
Resolute with God on my side, I synthesized

[Chorus]
Oh no, I can tell
The impasse is real
There's no need to find the key
Oh no, I can tell
The impasse is real
There's no hand in this world that can cure

[Verse 2]
The peace of mind to render slowly
Was dullin' my sense of time and urgency
To reify was still my goal
But I don't rush the long haul, ba-ba-baby

[Bridge 2]
Oh no, I can tell
No hand in this world
No hand in this world
Oh no, I can tell
No hand in this world
No hand in this world

[Chorus]
Oh no, I can tell
The impasse is real
There's no need to find the key
Oh no, I can tell
The impasse is real
There's no hand in this world that can cure me
The air isn't real
It's made in a lab, shipped in a bag
Reflections aren't real
When digital lights refracting on me
The pain isn't real
Just chemicals telling my brain how I ought to be
How I ought to be
Oh, what's the point in tellin' if you're never gonna listen
What's the point in telling you why?
Our children will be buried under blankets of snow
And you'll be in your technicolor home

Conscious says
Yeah we spoke of this before in a dream of course
It was clear to me then babe but now it seems you still want more

He'll regret it
He said he's never felt that
So I'm wondering if you'd let him
He thinks it's coming easy
I know you are prone to dancing when nobody is home
Feels good to be alone
People free in his own words

[And it just keeps rolling, rolling, rolling along]

It's not always what it seems to be
I've wandered far too long to tell apart but now
All I want to do is be
All I want to say is how
All I want to do is you

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You-You see how it is when you pick out a pet
How can you make up your mind what to get?
But what if we took one of each kind of pet then our home would be full of the pets we would get

[Interlude: Jimmy Kimmel & Tyler, The Creator]
Tyler? Hey man, how you doing?
Hey, Jimmy
It's good to have you here
You look nice, oh thanks
I was thinking that, uh, maybe if you just did it a little more, uh
I don't know, like, rhythmically, like, if you did, like
Ohhhh, okay, okay
You know what I'm saying
Like a, yeah, like a rap, like kinda, you know?
Uh, cool, cool
Yeah, cool, okay, alright, alright

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
No! Dad would be mad, we can only have one
If we don't choose, we will end up with none
Jimmy, Ji-

[Interlude: Jimmy Kimmel & Tyler, The Creator]
Tyler? Um, hmm
You look- You look really nice, thank you
I guess what I, you know, I just was hoping it would have, uh
What is the word I'm looking for, a little more, um
Uh, I don't know what the word I'm looking for is
Swag?, no, oh, not swag, flow
Matthew McCon-, no?
No, not Matthew McConaughey, no
No, but like, a little more flow
Ohh
You know, so, like, it would rhyme, like, you know, what pet, should I get
Okay, okay, I thin-, you guys think I got it?
*Crowd cheers*
Okay, um

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
I'll do it right now, I'll do what I said
I'll make up my mind, that's up in my head
The dog or a rabbit, the fish or the cat
I'll pick it up fast and that was this and that was that
Jimmy Kimmel this segment was wack

[Outro: Jimmy Kimmel]
No, that was good, that was actually really good
You did a lot better at the end
I think we really have something here
Dr. Seuss would be really proud
WAIT, aren't you supposed to drop the mic...I guess I'll just drop it, alright

[Part I: Close To You]

I’ll be honest
I wasn’t devastated
But you could’ve
Held my hands through it baby
Let my mind
Run underneath warms jets, jet-jets

I run my hands through what’s left
But we’re getting older baby
Don’t have much longer baby

Why am I preaching
To this choir, to this atheist?
But just like mine
Versions of these belong to you
And after a while
They're keeping me close to you

[Part II:  Never Can Say]
And that is why
I never can say goodbye, oh no no I
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache seems to
Follow me wherever I go
Try to hide the feelings but they
Always seem to show
You say "Turn around you fool
You know I love you more and more"
Tell me why is it so
I don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye, no no no no no I
Never can say goodbye, ooh yeah yes
I never can say goodbye, no no no
I never can say goodbye, no
No no no no no
Never can, never, never can say, nev-nev-never can say
Never can say goodbye
No

[Intro: Timbaland]
There's nothing wrong with getting a buzz going

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
And light up like a motherfucker hot
And light up when this motherfucker drops
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado
And light up, lock and motherfuckin' load
And light up, let this motherfucker glow
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And let me hit that before it goes out
Don't be so, so stingy (Just pass it on the left)
And let me hit that before it goes out
Ooh, like a motherfucker hot (Now everybody put one in the air)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Let's go, I did this one for the stone-heads
And the motherfuckers with the strong weed
Oh shit, my weed man's phone dead
See that's why I need to start growing my own weed
I'm like, "Oh my goodness, I don't smoke bullshit"
If you sober, don't judge me, leave it up to the jury
Smoke medicinal weed like I'm tryna cure shit
And I feel better than alligators with good skin
She roll my weed for me, hold my weed for me
She hold that shit, them other bitches got weak stomachs
I don't smoke hookah, I don't know the future
But last night was nuts, and it never got neutered
It go, "Smell it like you buy it, light it, hit it
Mix it with the hash, now we getting scientific
Psychedelic grass, I feel like the highest cricket
Just a pot-head, weed stinking like a pot to piss in," holla at me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
And light up like a motherfucker hot
And light up when this motherfucker drops
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado
And light up, lock and motherfuckin' load
And light up, let this motherfucker glow
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And let me hit that before it goes out
Don't be so, so stingy (Just pass it on the left)
And let me hit that before it goes out
Ooh, like a motherfucker hot (Now everybody put one in the air)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Okay, I'm smokin' strong, we smokin' strong
Living that pot head life, my nigga, my stove is on
I got them suicide doors, and they look like open arms
My nigga T in this bitch, I save all my rolls just for him
Okay, my pusher stay lowkey, my kush is a OG
I don't smoke regular like I don't eat whole wheat
I don't smoke mid neither, I got two bad bitches
Named Indica and Sativa, and we 'bout to have a threesome
Alright, I'ma need a light
My high coming down, I feel like I'm eating right
Marijuana should be legal, I'ma fight for equal rights
"I think I can, I think I can," got a nigga thinking twice
Coming straight from Cloud 9 like a lightning strike
Hit the blunt two times, then go nighty-night
She just want to open up, girl, hit this blunt and be you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do," yeah

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
And light up like a motherfucker hot
And light up when this motherfucker drops
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado
And light up, lock and motherfuckin' load
And light up, let this motherfucker glow
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And let me hit that before it goes out
Don't be so, so stingy (Just pass it on the left)
And let me hit that before it goes out
Ooh, like a motherfucker hot (Now everybody put one in the air)

[Bridge: Lil Wayne & Timbaland]
I get my weed from the west, where the weed is the best
I take a hit and inhale and take the deepest of breaths
I'm a hippie, my nigga, I be like, "Peace and respect"
And be the same motherfucker that'll beat you to death, oh
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado (Alright)
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado (Woo)
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky (JT, holla at me back)

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
And light up like a motherfucker hot
And light up when this motherfucker drops
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado
And light up, lock and motherfuckin' load
And light up, let this motherfucker glow
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado

[Outro: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
And let me hit that before it goes out
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum... Bu-bu-bu-bu)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum... Bu-bu-bu-bu)

[Verse 1]
Sitting by my window
Watching the moonlight
In my home
Suddenly my mind
Is bringing out desire
In my home
So I got a new man
To put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Chorus]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire

[Verse 2]
So I had a phone call
From a new man
In my home
He was burning
Burning of desire
Just like I do
He wanted me to
Put out this fire
Burning in his soul

[Chorus]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Verse 3]
Suddenly my new man
Was in my arms
In my home
He was loving me
69 times
In my home
So I got a new man
To put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Chorus]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
These niggas take me for granted, what would hap' if I vanish?
Bet a hunnid they'd panic, my shooters only speak Spanish
Keep my heart with my dogs, keep my car in the yard
I can't drive it nowhere so I'll let you niggas take off
Seen the shit that they drop, that shit not instantly hot
I give that instant re-bop, that replay value go off
That make my value go up, I keep that bow in my cup
My niggas rolling, got that going with a thousand to bust
"That nigga Kevin can't rap, he too sappy with his shit
He don't rep me with his shit, he on that teenage bullshit
And he 'bout 20 and shit? When he let go of that shit?
He'll prolly be a little colder, y'all agree with me? Shit
That nigga need to act his age, he ain't acting like a grown up
Ain't that boy from Texas? He ain't acting like a soldier
Knew that boy in high school, man, that nigga wasn't awkward
And I know his mama, man, that nigga just a liar"

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me

[Post-Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Crashed my last Benz, Benz
Cashed my last check, check
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Crashed my last Benz, Benz
Cashed my last check, check
Cash don't mean shit, shit

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
Call me King of the Niggas, I need a crown made of thorns
God said, "Let there be light" on the day I was born
Step off the ship with the slaves, then I go hit the stage
I just left in a whip, all I need is a chain
I don't trust no niggas and I don't trust no bitch
'Cause people talk too much, I bought a black fo'-fifth
And a brand new clip, that's my new best friend
'Cause I'm a brand new nigga, in a brand new crib
I ain't sellin' no more, but got my hand in the zip
Whitey gave me the check, I ain't ask for the fame
I used to deal with the grams 'til they put the cam on my face
Now I'm evading the law, I'm on a high-speed chase
I'm in a big-ass truck, I tell 'em, "Get out the way"
I gotta couple of warrants, so I'm leaving my state
Now I'm in Cali today, with the sun on my face
I got a bag of the gas, and a blunt I can face

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
How I'm gon' move at your pace? I'm busy settin' the tone
You think we runnin' together? I'm in a lane of my own
Don't got no friends in this game, it's me and my brothers alone
They thinkin' that we competing, that shit depletin' my bones
I don't need all that energy, they just fuck up my chakras
I put my heart in a locker, they love me when I'm a martyr
They hate me when I'm myself, I can't barter with that
You watch us charter these tracks, it's sticking like tartar and plaque
I need a parlour of plaques, need lobsters and helicopters
I need peace for my niggas, need darker skin for all my doctors
I like to speak like a scholar, like to think like a nigga
In this world I can't wander, no honor behind the trigger
I could get shot in my back and they'd tell the world that I fought 'em
"We ain't taught 'em nothin' new, but somehow they been gettin' smarter"
That's what they sayin' in private, speaking from that entitlement
We still workin' for titles and makin' tidal environments

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
Fuck, put ya ante up, riding in the limousine
I'm stuck on some bud I hit, under concrete canopy
Fuck all this energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck all your energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck, put the windows up, blowin' past the exit now
Up like a money shot, swerve into the sunset
Me and all my boys jet, swerving like a doughnut
Off, off, off, off, swerving like a doughnut

[Outro: Kevin Abstract & JOBA]
Nigga, what?
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to
Nigga, what?
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to
Nigga, what?
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to
Nigga, what? Y-yo

[Verse 1]
Yo, 2Pac once asked, "Is there a Heaven for a G?"
Well, now there is, word, 'cause he's up there to see
Moving around, he's chilling with Prince and James Brown
If our people are up in Heaven, their loving is raining down
The only force to save us from city was hip-hop
The only force that made us grimy and gritty was hip-hop
We all respect the world's religions and the laws they laid
But I know Scott La Rock's gonna come to my aid
See, these saints are great, but they're not where my heart be
When I call on the angels, I'm calling on Marcus Garvey
I'd rather call on Bob Marley, oh yes, sir
Kwame Ture, that's my real ancestor
Why call upon the spirits of oppressors
When you can call your own angels when you under pressure
See, when it comes to hip-hop, here's the lesson
Start praising your own people, hip-hop speaks from Heaven

[Chorus]
Hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo
Hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo
Go, hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo
Hey, hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo

[Verse 2]
So when I think of California, I'm seeing Eazy-E
When I think of Brooklyn, New York, I'm seeing B.I.G
When I'm thinking about the Bronx, I'm seeing Scott La Rock
We gon' praise they name forever and we gon' never stop
It's forever 2Pac, it's forever Heavy D
It's forever Big Pun, it's forever O.D.B
They was live, now deceased, from the West to the East
It's forever Phife Dawg, Big L rest in peace
What happens next, we shouting out Professor X
Shout out to Freaky Tah, shout out to Proof, big respect
We can't forget, so we bubble with joy
When we reminisce over you, Trouble T-Roy
Shout out to Keith Cowboy, Ms. Melodie all day
Shout out to J Dilla and Jam Master Jay
It's love I'm sending to you
Shout out to Guru, and Mr. Magic from the Juice Crew

[Chorus]
Hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo
Hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo
Go, hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo
Hey, hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo

[Verse 3]
Forget who's the best guy
This that time to think about Pimp C, Buffy, and Lisa Left Eye
Frosty Freeze breaking in the breeze
Big Bank Hank still inspiring MC's
We'll never be free until we free up our mind
We praising our enemy's God's fallen behind
Yo, it's all in the rhyme, the past is gone
But I can still feel the spirit of Master Don
Yo, many have been lied to, so here's what the wise do
Praise your own people, the force is inside you
Like a late fog in the mist
I see MCA and rest in peace Nate Dogg
They names and they natures will last
Like Chris Lighty and my man Bill Blass
When it comes to hip hop, here's the lesson
Start praising your own people, hip hop speaks from Heaven

[Chorus]
Hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo
Hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo
Go, hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo
Hey, hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo

[Verse 1]
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Outro]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Can’t nobody get up in my car today
Back seat feeling like a charter plane
Bumping Silkk Da Shocker Charge It 2 Da Game
Paint dripping like I’m whipping marmalade (whoa)
Look at the way that I’m shining
I don’t be checking the mileage
She said how much is that Rolie?
I said don’t worry I’m timeless
Watching Toy Story 3, that’s a great fucking movie
City of Jimi, Kurt, Quincy
City of me, Eddie, and Bruce Lee (whoa)
King of the road I drive slow like whoa
And I just switched over to Geico like whoa
Celebrating these life goals
But you ain’t getting no ride home

[Chorus]
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can’t see my face
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
All eyes on me now
I be riding through Seatown
Taking pics when I eat out
Girls ask me to freestyle
Neighbors hate it when I speed out
I ain’t turning these beats down
GPS and I reroute
Chuck the deuce and I peace out
Sun roof tinted, don't need your opinions
I be on my business, and you be on Tinder
And if I was single, I’d be right there with ya
But I’m committed, keep my dick in my britches
The women are moving their bodies
Sunset through numerous palm trees
Followed by the paparazzi
But they don’t get into our party
Tell the bell hop that I’m sorry
We 40 deep in the lobby
Travel the world with a posse
But soon I’ll be home
So call up my momma and tell her to pick up the phone
Cause I need that homemade lasagna that’s fresh out the stove
Grabbing the keys and I’m fresh out the door
King of my city whose next on the throne

[Chorus]
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can’t see my face
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
When you hear that speaker sound, ound, ound
You know who it is, Lil Boat in your town
Whoa this beat so happy I will never frown
And my hair so nappy it’s gonna be a problem braiding it down
Oh no, oh no, we been grinding from the go
Jump start, I just bought a new whip, push start
Push the coup down the highway like a go kart
All my niggas keep that toaster with them like a Pop Tart
Make her moan and she sound just like Mozart
Pure art
I think they mad because I broke into the game with a crowbar
Top the charts, Hip Hop ain’t the same we the new stars
Rock stars, look at all my chains call them ice pops
Ring pops, let the rain drop on the wrist watch
Fuck the cops, and fuck Donald Trump, bitch it’s Macklemore and Lil Boat
Anything else you need to know

[Chorus]
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can’t see my face
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town
Can stop at the clouds
Watching the world.. spin around

Something looks familiar in the color of the sky
Reminds me of the best thing that I made last night
It's blue at the ocean, as wild as time

I'm home!
In your arms is where I belong
Please don't let me go, thank god that I'm finally home

Here I go again, to where I have been
Now for awhile it feels so damn good
To let off a smile, Can't remember the last that I fell in love
With you skin, touching mine, How I feel so strong
When I look in your eyes, When I look into your soul?
If you don't holding me, I can't breath, I rather die

I'm home!
In your arms is where I belong
Please don't let me go, thank god that I'm finally home

He breaks your heart?
He's got you thinking you'll never part
But one day you'll find you're all alone
Who's gonna kiss you and hold you?
And tell you how much he cares?
Open wide his arms and say
"Baby, baby, come home."

Come home, baby

Whose shoulder are you gonna cry on
When you've lost your way
And you discover that he's gone to stay
Then maybe you'll see you're needing me
I want you to call me
Don't stall me
Baby, I'm with you all the way
There's just one thing I'd like to say
"Baby, baby, come home."
Come home, oh

Come home, I pray
And this time I'm gonna make you stay
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby wooh!

Who's gonna do the fixing?
You gon' need somebody's shoulder to cry on
Every time I see you (Oh, my darling)
I wanna take you in my arms (Let me hold you)
And squeeze you tighter all my life

If you would only do this one thing for me (Oh, my darling)
I wonder if you'd let me (Let me call you)
Sweet names like baby, sweetheart, all my life

My darling, I offer you my heart and soul
If you will have me, well, baby, I'm yours

Just one more thing I wanna say (Oh, my darling)
I'll give my life to you (Let me love you)
I need you to (love me)
Cherish you, always, all my life

My darling, I offer you my heart and soul
If you will have me, well, baby, I'm yours

Just one more thing I wanna say (Oh, my darling)
I'll give my life to you (Let me love you)
I need you to (love me)
Cherish you always, wooh, all my life
I need you, I love you, baby
All my life
Yes, I will
I need you, baby, always
She never treats me sweet and gentle
The way she should
I've got it bad and that ain't good

My poor heart is sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it bad
And that ain't good

But when the weekend's over
And old Monday rolls around
I end up like I start out
Just crying my heart out

Lord above me, make her love me
The way she should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good

But when the weekend's over
And I say Monday rolls around
I end up like I start out
Just crying my heart out
Lord above me, make this woman love me
The way she should
Hey, hey, I've got it bad
And that ain't good

No, no, no baby
I, I've got it bad
And that ain't good
So I walk a little too fast
And I drive a little too fast
And I'm reckless, it's true
But what else can you do
At the end of a love affair?

So I talk a little too much
And I laugh a little too much
And my voice is too proud
When I'm out in a crowd
So that people are apt to stare

Do they know, do they care
That it's only that I'm lonely
And low as can be?
And the smile on my face
Isn't really a smile at all

So I smoke a little too much
Yes, I joke a little too much
And the tunes I request
Are not always the best
But the ones where the trumpets blare!
So I go at a maddening pace
And I pretend that it's taking her place
But what else can you do
At the end of a love affair?

So I go at a maddening pace
And I pretend that it's taking her place
But what else can you do
At the end of a love affair?
Strange dear
But true dear
When I'm close to you dear
The stars fill the sky
So in love with you am I
Yes, I am

Even without you
My arms fold about you
You know, darling, why
So in love with you am I

In love with the night
Mysterious, yeah baby
When you first were there
In love with my joy
Delirious, when I knew that you
Could care

So taunt me and hurt me
Deceive me, desert me
I'm yours till I die
So in love, so in love, so in love
With you, my love
Well, my... I'm so in love with you
Oh, in love...
The sun that shines would stop its climb
And swiftly fade from view
I don't know what I would do
If I had to go on without you

The darkest night would be so bright
There'd be no more to do
The sky would never be blue
If I had to go on without you

You can't imagine how lost I would be
I can't imagine no you without me

Father time would get behind
And lose an hour or two
But I'd never someone new
If I had to go on without you

I'd never want someone new
If I had to go on without you
Baby please don't cry
When we say goodbye
'Cause it's only for a while, you see
You're all that matters to me

So, baby, hold your head way up high
I know it's really hard, but try
And this is the reason why
You're all that matters to me

For God only knows
The things my heart never shows
You're the best thing that ever happened to me
Can't you see

So wipe the tears from your eyes
There'll be no more cloudy skies
As long as you realize
You're all that matters to me
To me
Baby, to me
To me
I'll never forget you
I'll never forget you
I'll never forget you
I'll never forget how we promised that day
To love one another forever that way

We said we'd never say goodbye
But that was long ago
Now you've forgotten
I know

No use to wonder why
Let's say farewell with a sigh
Let love die
But we'll go on living
Our own way of living

Baby, you take the high road
And I'll take the low
It's time that we parted
It's much better so
But, kiss me as you go
Goodbye
Goodbye
Kiss me as you go
Goodbye

[Verse]
Only you, long as I may live, Fanny
Fanny, Fanny
You, long as I may live, Fanny
If I could love, that's what I would say
But my heart isn't mine to give, Fanny
Fanny, Fanny
No, no, not mine to give, Fanny
For it is gone, given long away

[Bridge]
To the sea, my one love in her gray green clothes
Deep with wonders beyond the shore
To the isles 'neath the winds where the spice wood grows
I must know them all, or sleep no more

[Outro]
Here's a boy with no heart to give, Fanny
Fanny, Fanny
Not worth one tear you'll cry, Fanny
Oh, Fanny, goodbye

[Verse]
Dear heart, wish you were here to warm this night
My dear heart, seems like a year since you've been out of my sight
A single room, a table for one
It's a lonesome town all right
Soon I'll kiss you hello at our front door
And dear heart, want you to know
I'll leave your loving arms never more

[Outro]
A single room, a table for one
It's a lonesome town all right
But soon I'll kiss you hello at our front door
And dear heart, I want you to know
I'll leave your loving arms never more

[Verse]
What's new? How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit
Lovely as ever, I must admit
What's new? How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then
Gee, but it's nice to see you again
What's new? Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand
I understand, adieu
Pardon my asking what's new
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed, I still love you so

[Outro]
I understand, adieu
Pardon my asking what's new
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed, I still love you so
Oh my darling, I'll still love you so

[Verse 1]
When somebody loves you
It's no good unless she loves you all the way

[Bridge]
Happy to be near you when you need someone to cheer you all the way
Taller than the tallest tree is, that's how it's got to be
And deeper than the deep blue sea is, that's how deep it goes if it's real

[Verse 2]
When somebody needs you it's no good unless she needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years, and for all the in between years, come what may
Who knows where the love will lead us only a fool would say
But if you let me love you it's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, baby
All the way, uh-huh

[Outro]
Ooh, who knows where the love will lead us only a fool would say
But if you let me love you, it's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, baby
All the way

[Verse]
Mmm, mmm, more than the greatest love the whole wide world has known
Darling, this is the love I'm gonna give to you, you alone
Well, more than the simple words, the little things I try to say
Darling, I'm gonna love you, love you more each day
More than you'll ever know
Sugar, my arms long to hold you so
Darling, my life will be in your keeping
Waking, sleeping, honey, laughing, weeping
Longer than always, I know that's a pretty long time
But far beyond forever, well, I know, I know you'll be mine
I know I've never, darling, I've never lived before
And my heart, my heart is so sure
No one else could love you more

[Verse 1]
Where are you?
Where have you gone without me?
I thought you cared about me
Where are you?
Where's my heart?
Where is the dream we started?
I can't believe we're parted
Where are you?

[Bridge]
When we said goodbye love
What had we to gain?
When I gave you my love
Was it all in vain?

[Verse 2]
All life through
Must I go on pretending?
Where is my happy ending?
Where are you?

[Bridge]
When we said goodbye love
What had we to gain?
When I gave you my love
Was it all in vain?

[Outro]
All life through
Must I go on pretending?
Where is that happy ending?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Mmm-hmm

[Intro]
One, two, a-one, two, three
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've got your number
I know you inside out
You ain't no Eagle Scout
You're all at sea

[Bridge]
Oh yes, you brag a lot
Wave your own flag a lot
But you're unsure a lot
You're a lot like me, oh

[Verse 2]
I've got your number
And what you're looking for
And what you're looking for
Just suits me fine

[Bridge]
We'll break the rules a lot
We'll be damn fools a lot
But then why should we not
How could we not combine when

[Verse 3]
I've got your number
I've got the glow you've got
I've got your number
Baby, you know
You've got mine, yeah
Well, alright

[Scatting]

[Bridge]
Oh, we'll break the rules a lot
We'll be damn fools a lot
But then why should we not
How could we not combine when

[Verse 4]
I've got your number
I've got the glow you've got
I've got your number
And baby, you know
You've got mine

[Outro]
I've got your number
I've got your number
And you've got mine

[Verse 1]
On a wonderful day like today
I defy any cloud to appear in the sky
Dare any raindrop to plop in my eye
On a wonderful day like today
On a wonderful morning like this
When the sun is as big as a yellow balloon
Even the sparrows are singing in tune
On a wonderful morning like this

[Bridge]
On a morning like this I could kiss everybody
I'm so full of love and good will
Let me say furthermore I'd adore everybody
To come and dine, the pleasure's mine and I will pay the bill

[Verse 2]
May I take this occasion to say
That the whole human race should go down on its knees
And show that we're grateful for mornings like these
For the world's in a wonderful way, on a wonderful day like today

[Bridge]
On a morning like this I could kiss everybody
I'm so full of love and good will
Let me say furthermore I'd adore everybody
To come and dine, the pleasure's mine and I will pay the bill

[Outro]
May I take this occasion to say
That the whole human race should go down on its knees
Show that we're grateful for mornings like these
For the world's in a wonderful way
On a Monday, on a Tuesday
On a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
When you're alive, every day's a wonderful day
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
You're a shot in the dark
And you're dancing in the danger zone
Tearing bits for your heart
I don't care, you're not the one I want
We're just playing around
Let's take a chance on our bodies to feel the rush
And when we lay in your bed, we're never talking
'Cause we only have time to touch

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
You and me are young and free
We'll burn forever
You and me are young and free
Don't need those three words

[Chorus: Charli XCX + Noonie Bao]
I'm not in love
I'm just messing around, just wanna live a little
I'm not in love
Wait a minute, I swear I'm never gonna listen
Not now, no no
I'm not in love (hey, hey)
We're just messing around
We're not falling in love, woah-woah, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
Never wanna be bored
Don't wanna spend time with you on my own
Staying under the sun
We gotta fly, let's run away from home
I'm so sick of the TV
And the movies when they all seem to end the same
No, I don't wanna keep you in a photograph
Locked in a silver frame

[Chorus: Charli XCX + Noonie Bao]
I'm not in love
I'm just messing around, just wanna live a little
I'm not in love
Wait a minute, I swear I'm never gonna listen
Not now, no no
I'm not in love (hey, hey)
We're just messing around
We're not falling in love, woah-woah, oh-oh

[Interlude: Noonie Bao]
We don't feel a thing
We don't feel a thing
We don't feel a thing
We're just messing around
We're not falling in love, woah-woah, oh-oh

[Bridge: Charli XCX]
(Hey) Woah-woah, oh-oh
(Hey, hey) Woah-woah, oh-oh
You and me are young and free
We'll run forever (woah-woah, oh-oh)
You and me are young and free
Don't need those three words

[Chorus: Charli XCX + Noonie Bao]
I'm not in love
I'm just messing around, just wanna live a little
I'm not in love
Wait a minute, I swear I'm never gonna listen
Not now, no no
I'm not in love (hey, hey)
We're just messing around
We're not falling in love, woah-woah, oh-oh

[Outro: Noonie Bao]
We don't feel a thing, oh oh
We're not falling in love, oah-woah, oh-oh
We are free

[Chorus]
Every night she said she wanted foreplay
She don't let her be her fuckin' self
Xannied out and I just popped a molly
Doctor say he worried 'bout my health
Ask me who I love I say myself
I just wanna be my fuckin' self
Ask me who I love I say myself
I just wanna be my fuckin' self
I just wanna be my fuckin' self
I just wanna be my fuckin' self

[Verse 1]
Talk about rap niggas, talk about trap niggas
Know I'm the bitch but they sit on my lap niggas
I never cared even if they had figures
Walk in the crib with a dime and a Hilfiger
They ask me who I wanna be, I say my fuckin' self
Please just mind your business and don't worry 'bout my health
Sit me down, sit up, sit up, sit up
Stood up on and work it out
Pull up, push up, pull up
Pull up on 'em, sit me down
Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up on it
Don't catch the wave
We do not go with the flow, we create
We gon' look back just to see what we made
Bein' myself while you fake to get paid
To get paid, paid
Damn that sucks, they slaved us up
They watch us die, while they preach Pablo
We'll beat the system, we'll fuck it up
One more thing, fuck Donald Trump

[Chorus]
Every night she said she wanted foreplay
She don't let her be her fuckin' self
Xannied out and I just popped a molly
Doctor say he worried 'bout my health
Ask me who I love I say myself
I just wanna be my fuckin' self
Ask me who I love I say myself
I just wanna be my fuckin' self
I just wanna be my fuckin' self
I just wanna be my fuckin' self
I just wanna be myself
I just wanna be myself

[Verse 2]
E and J drippin' on my phone screen
I am in my zone so don't bug me
They see my flu's cold so they bring scene
My niggas see I'm loose so they bring trees
We do illegal things so don't bring these
Fuck twelve, fuck twelve, baby fuck twelve
Myself, myself, baby, myself
Fuck twelve, fuck twelve, baby fuck twelve
Fuck twelve, fuck twelve, fuck twelve, fuck twelve
Let me be myself, myself, myself
Will not get away
Free me from the fakes
Free me from the wealth
Leave me by myself
Psych, 070, 'til the fuckin' top
Put my nigga up, shawty give him top
Niggas tryna join, boy you gotta stop
Treat her like a bus, now you gotta hop
Blowin' them trees, we need them cuffs, gotta stay clean
Bringin' 'em out, everyone jump
Knowing you will accomplish it
Oh I heard some comp, it's lit, yeah
You niggas gon' fold, we trip, hey

[Interlude]
Trippy life, trippy life, trippy life
Call us the Beatles, the hippy life
Trippy life, trippy life, trippy life
Call us the Beatles, the hippy life
Uptown, uptown, uptown where I stay
Uptown, uptown, uptown where I stay
Uptown, uptown, uptown where I stay
Uptown, uptown, uptown where I stay
Uptown, uptown, uptown where I stay
Uptown, uptown, uptown where I stay

[Outro]
Oh I feel the drip right now, ooh
I think I should sip right now, ooh
They just wanna change me
I'm still gettin' lit right now, yeah
I just wanna be my fuckin' self, yeah
I just wanna be my fuckin' self, yeah
I just wanna be my fuckin'

[Verse 1]
It's you and your world and I'm caught in the middle
I caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can't be your friend
It's my head or my heart, and I'm caught in the middle

[Pre-Chorus]
My hands are tied, but not tight enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

[Chorus]
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

[Verse 2]
Eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time (Oh)
Before the rush to my blood was too much and we flatlined (Oh)
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends
Now I'm all messed up and it feels like the first time (Oh)

[Chorus]
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

[Pre-Chorus]
My hands are tied, but not tight enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

[Chorus]
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
A little less lonely now
A little less lonely now
A little less lonely now

[Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

[Pre-Drop]
Could roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
I remember you

[Drop]

(Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me)
(Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?)

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain

Would roses bloom?
(They're playing our sound
Laying us down tonight)
Could roses bloom?
(And all of these clouds
Bringing us back to life)
But I remember you

[Drop]

(Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me)
(Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?)

I remember you

[Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

[Drop]
Could roses...
Could roses...
Could roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

[Verse 2]
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?

[Chorus 2]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain

[Drop]
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain

[Outro]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you

[Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses...

[Drop]
Could roses...

[Verse 2]
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses...

[Drop]
Could roses...
Could roses...

[Bridge]
They're playing our sound
Laying us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Bringing us back to life
But you're cold as a night

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?

[Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom

[Verse 2]
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?

Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

[Intro]
Yeah (You don't even know me)
Yeah, yeah, ah (You don't even know me)
Ah-ha (You don't even know me)
It's me, yeah (You don't even know me)

[Verse 1]
Yo, these sixteen bars cost sixteen cars
Kiss these balls, bitch, we stars
Fuck that shit, you ain't hot like Prince
You got a little shine, but not like this
Time crumbles when the jet black M5 rumbles
All from what I did last summer?
But motherfuckers forget, till I'm back up on the set
And every motherfucking jump shot wet
Same outfit every day like a cartoon (That's me!)
Uh, they'll never find you in a shark soup (Nope)
And there will never be a part two
Shit, you're looking at some motherfucking art, boo

[Verse 2]
Two pumps from the inhaler got me feeling like Lawrence Taylor
Two kisses on the cheek for my tailor (Mwah!)
I got the soul of an Amazon healer
Better be sure to put them cameras on (Please)
Turn dreams into real shit
Yeah, I might be sick
Sitting court side, I'm likely lit
Draw blood, I'm already made (Uh)
But little man will cut your face like wedding cake (Aaah!)

[Chorus]
You don't even know me
You don't even know me
You don't even know me
You don't even know me

[Bridge]
Switchin' lanes on these bitches like (Whoop!)
Switchin' lanes on these bitches like (Whoop!)
Watch the fifth wheel fall
From this top floor view, I can see it all
Yeah, man
From this top floor view, I can see it all
I can see it all, uh

[Verse 3]
I started clapping when the chef brought the duck to the table (Phenomenal!)
Uh, that shit was shining like an angel (Whoo!)
I never trust a dude named Angel (Nah)
Long steel 4/5s turn him to an angel
The sky opened up and down came me
Young AB, floatin' in a Jag from the '80s (Uh)
Tanned like I just left Haiti (Uh)
Looking like I had mad plastic surgery (Aaah! Damn)
They turned Bam Bam Chinese
And that's fine by me (True)
Shit, I need some time to realign my chi (So?)
So bitch, please pass that bombazee
Before I get upset

[Chorus]
You don't even know me
You don't even know me
You don't even know me
You don't even know me

[Verse 1: Jordan Rakei]
Danger creepin' through the backdoor
You lie asleep at bay
Locking through the misty steam
Down the dark hallway
As the tip-toe gets louder and louder
I figure, too late now
'Cause they grab you by the arm
Thrown onto the couch

[Chorus: Jordan Rakei]
You a snitch, you a snitch
You've been working undercover all this time
Forming fake friendships, telling them lies
Taking all what's left to mine

[Post-Chorus: Jordan Rakei]
But she don't wanna see, no
It's for my wellbeing
'Cause she don't understand
I'm a midnight kind of man

[Verse 2: Jordan Rakei]
"Where's the money? Where's the money, mister?"
Y'all with vengeance
You say, "Down by the shoe stash"
You remembered
"Let it be known", they say
"If it happens again
We'll be coming back with violence
And bringing harm, my friend"

[Chorus: Jordan Rakei]
You a snitch, you a snitch
You've been working undercover all this time
Forming fake friendships, telling them lies
Taking all what's left to mine

[Post-Chorus: Jordan Rakei]
But she don't wanna see, no
It's for my wellbeing
'Cause she don't understand
I'm a midnight kind of man

[Verse 3: Remi Kolawole]
Yeah, yeah
Yes, yes
Darling, if this was Grand Theft Auto
I would have been sent by Salvatore the Don to
Rock you with aluminium bolt 'cause your allegiance
Isn’t to the family, it's to the courts of law
And Lord knows, I can't have any leaks
This operation I'm running is a well-oiled machine
P-pressing up that cocaina in the form of CDs
And selling it to the fiends, so I can feed all my peeps
And you would have it all
Flushed like a stash when the cops come
I crash into the front door of the laboratory
'Cause this ain't your passion, it's mine
And the fact is, you don't give flying fuck about me
That's why you're clowning, and running 'round the village
Running your mouth, doing your best to pillage my image
Ah-ah, but those lips are going to sink ships, son
Cutting you off, not letting you finish, I'll finish now
I'm not letting you finish, I'm finished now
I'm not letting you finish, I'm finished now

[Verse 1]
I can tell myself that I'm just like you
That I understand love, but it's just not true
Cause you're always on my mind
And I can talk a girl right out of her clothes
I can talk myself into kissing your ghost
But you're always on my mind

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna miss you
No, I really don't wanna miss you
And I don't wanna miss you
If I could be with you

[Verse 2]
Well I got a lot of problems but it's no big deal
Psychoanalytic literature explains all that I feel
Why you're always on my mind
And I walk by myself on Cemetery Hill
And I play a little game called "Which plot should I fill?"
Cause you're always on my mind

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna miss you
No, I really don't wanna miss you
And I d-d-don't wanna miss you
If I could be with you

[Intro: Action Bronson & Funk Flex]
Just put my motherfucking album out man
Just put- yo, Flex man you- (let's get up?)
Just put my motherfucking album out man (yeah, let's get up?)
Just put my motherfucking album out

[Verse: Action Bronson & Funk Flex]
Neck tattoos of praying hands couldn't help me
But I still smile for they selfie
Ah
Nah we could do it again, we could do it again
Nah we don't do anything again man
You wanna go from there?
I just wanna let them know something
I just wanna let you know (uh huh)
I'm back (be clear)
Queens is in the motherfucking building man
What up Mr. Baklava, we haven't seen you in a while
It's great to see that smile
Your hair looks wonderful, let me push this chair up under you
The weather's beautiful, you must have brought the sun with you
You're getting slimmer and you're tanner huh?
And you're speaking perfect Spanish, must have spent some time in Panama
I gotta tell you that you're absolutely glowing
All that fishing and relaxing that you're doing, it's showing
Uh, I might take up rowing, lay low until it's snowing
Then pop up looking Samoan
Mad suede covers my toes and my fancy words keep me frozen
Uh, it's so easy being me, 'cause I'm that same OG
All I wanna do is blow my weed and stroke my queen
And buy a fleet of blue boats for the team
Fuck man, yo, my BMW scrape the floor
You understand? (I'm clear)
My BMW
The side of my crib looking like Wrigley Field, covered wit' ivy
I could have been one of the Isley's
Nothing surprises me I'm obviously high in the driver's seat
It's like I'm rhyming on a silent beat
The groove move like voodoo put a needle in the doll
Yo is that Don Cheadle in the car? It looks just like him
About to watch the documentary that Spike did on Tyson
Shouts to Tracey Morgan you inspire me, man
I fucking love you
Blue Chips 7000, "Fuck, That's Delicious" book
We out here, you understand me?
Queens in this motherfucker, (clear)
Always (be clear)
Always man
Yo, listen, one more time
Yo, in front of 50,000 screaming, higher than I ever been
Eyes closed, mommy I'm a rock star
No one knows that I just woke up
Got doped up, I just grab the mic and go nuts
Eat donuts because I'm robust
I like to sit on women's shoulders
Red karate outfits like I'm Sho'nuff

[Intro: The Weeknd, Young Thug & A$AP Rocky]
Know me, know me
Ho-ohh-ohh-oh
Know me, know me
Oh, na-na-na-na-na
Know me, know me
Woah-woah-oh-oh
Know me, know me (Uh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I used to pray to hear my songs on the radio
Growin' up, my folk was on, ain't have to kick a door
Keep sixty bitches backstage, at like every show
Ain’t no more Hanes on my balls, these are Kenneth Cole
All these squares in my pictures, yeah, we croppin' those
Let lil' shawty lick my dick, I had my boxers on
Everybody 'round me poppin, bitch, we kettle corn
Fly the PJ on the e-way with the P1
Carat and a half drippin' on my neck, son (Ho-oh-oh-oh)
Take a bubble bath with a rapper's baby mama (Oh, na-na-na-na-na)
Young dirty nigga rockin' water like a swamp (Woah-woah-oh-oh)
Yeah, I just fucked her last night, didn't tell her my name (Na-na-na-na-na-na)
All these hip-hop rappers down to be Drake (Na-na)
All my double cups purple like the soul plane (Na-na-na-na-na)
Diamonds on me loud, got you silent (Hoo-ayy)
Got her bouncin' on this dick like hydraulics

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
'Cause you know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
You know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (Pow-pow)
You know me

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly, we gone let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go low, mane

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
(Oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
You know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (Pow-pow)
You know me

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
(Uh)
Young, young nigga, same OG, stayin' lowkey
Stand ten toes deep, roll fleeces
G says, made a thesis, I'm a G
I'm a weakness like The Weeknd, so the remix...
I beg your pardon? It's true
The rumors that they start could make us break apart
Assumin' it influenced, all this sudden change of heart
Divorce in court and take off with the whole thing
'Mind 'em that they know me
No way you think if ever I decide to cut my hair like Abel did
Like Jaden Smith I'd prolly walk around all day with it
Okay, you lame, I'm a-okay with it
Might take the whip around my old ways
'Mind them that they know me

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
'Cause you know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
You know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (Pow-pow)
You know me (Know me, know me)

[Verse]
I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
'Til the landslide took me down
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
I'm getting older too

[Verse]
I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
'Til the landslide took me down
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
And time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older too
Oh, I'm getting older too
I took my love, I took it down
Mama Mavis, oh
Mama, they tried my patience (x3)

Mama Mavis, oh
Mama, they calling favours

You say I'm dangerous, I speak for the nameless
I fly with the vultures, I be with them bangers
If change don't come, then the change won't come
If the bands make 'em dance, then the rain gon' come

Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?) Look into your eyes
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark, let me out)
You got to die a little if you wanna live (If you wanna live)
Change come to pass
Change come to pass
You'd best be ready for it
Something...

[Beat drop]

Let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
But I won't get tired at all (x4)

Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?) Look into your eyes
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark, let me out)
You got to die a little if you wanna live (If you wanna live)
Change come to pass
Change come to pass
You'd best be ready for it
Something...

[Beat drop]

Be ready (uh-huh, uh-huh), ready for it
Be ready, be ready
Oooh, oooh oooh
(Let me out)

And I can tell you, she wants me
She wants me, she wants me, she wants me

[Verse 1: Drake]
I swear to you every time I sees her, I seizure
Keep running through my mind, jog my memories; amnesia
Touch ya, tease ya, nervous? Don't freeze up
She let me take control, I run a woman like a Visa
She always run back to me saying he's a dog
Off the leash, he got this other girl Alicia
She tell me she's in hell, I tell her, "Take a breather"
I'm nothing like your man, but I can't love you neither
It's wifey over bitches, but money's over her
'Cause money's under nothing, my life is such a blur
It's not the way it has to go, it's just what I prefer
And any Young Money nigga I know would concur
Weezy, talk to 'em!

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
And she wants me
She wants me yeah
And I want her too
Yeah, I want her too

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]

[Verse 3: Kid-Kid]
Just as long as we know whats good on both ends
I'm loving ya like I'm ya man though we just friends
If ya shy come see me for ya comfortin' I got a comfortable suite at the Comfort Inn
I tell her
I don't own a boat baby but I can float
And I don't own a plane but there's a mary jane and we can float
Your man ain't worrying about what's going on over here
You could get penalized the way you blowin' below the rear
Now this game like a analog I don't sweat cause it show how fake you are
She stressin', ya she testin' ya, she just tryin' to see what kinda level ya on
You don't make it bounce like a basketball, you ain't even get no ass at all
Now you sittin at the club trying to laugh it off, she done found her mid glam boy
You messin up, you messed up, wasn't easy to clean your Mess up
She found me and I blessed her, I applied to her pressure
She call me a professor, I went gave her her lecture
I bet she says I'm better, than her man was ever

[Hook 1: Drake]
Shawty got a man, but I got a plan
Look, homie, I ain't trying to force your hand
But I'ma take your girl
I'ma take your girl

[Hook 2: Lil Wayne] (x2)
And I can tell you, she wants me
She wants me, she wants me, she wants me
And yes I want her too
I'ma take your girl

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Shit, nigga, this what I does
I sware I ain't lyon, like this is my cubs
This is my tub, and I'm dirty in the summer, bitch
Weezy F Baby, and I lookin like I does some shit
You ain't know nothin bitch, you better know who you fuckin with
Try to fuck me, I kill you, and who you comin with
No homo, T, I had to go stupid
I'm on the high heels, but I am no Boosie
Hollands Avenue, ridin; with the roof gone
On the Mayback, 2 tone, and my rims are too grown
That mean they 24's, boy, what you on
I'm richer than a bitch without the gray coupon
I'm talkin' out of my head, I make a blue eyed bitch just admire my red
I'm a Blood, motherfucker, a Blood, motherfucker
Forever, like ETC period, motherfucker

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm so unsigned, it would blow one's mind
Cause every single record I am so unkind
There is no holes bard, there is no love lost
Nigga, this that crack and you know rugs cost
So PAY UP, I don't think you will ever find another nigga like me
Never LIE, I got everything I tell them I got
This young nigga show boat like I'm sellin' a yacht
Who else tryna' smoke, yeah nigga, me too
Cause take my mind off the Pressure, that's what weed do
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a Ski-do
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite down, hoe, or get the right dentist
I told Wayne I'm going in, like a life sentence
And understand, I send shots at who it's meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that, 10 4

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
Kidd Kidd!
Put on my OJ gloves and go and kill this shit
Make a plumber throw his plunger, I can't deal with this shit, uh
You say I'm throwed off, I stay on pitch
The flow ain't formal, I don't slack on shit
Bitch, I'm back on my shit, like a fly
Since you wan' be fly, throw you off the roof, fly (ha)
Like Pooky, take a Dooky on a rap producer, loose leaf
Throw his trash ass out the window like Lukey
To a shark, you just sushi
You ain't hard, you coochie
Wally Oochie, soft as newborn booty
I say I'm movin slow, I'm just thinkin fast
Look back, I ain't behind you, about to lap your ass
And nigga, I don't rest, I'm up, till my times up
I be the tech chef, all my beef prime cut
This ain't chorus lines, nigga, your choruses lyon
Cause the only point you ever gained, was a one

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Intro]
Yeah
Alright
Paige, I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind me, uhm havin' a little fun you know?
I know this your joint I just I always liked this song so I figured I may as well throw in
Here we go

[Chorus]
I'm still fly, (Yeah) I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings (Ah)
I'm still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters can't stand 'em (That's me singin' by the way)
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing (In case you didn't know)
I'm still fly, (Yeah) I'm sky high (It's some new shit, it's some new shit I'm on)
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings (I promise I got 'em though)
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around (Love)
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing (Here we go)
I'm still

[Verse]
Responsible for everything you listen to, a mediocre talent, let me see if I can condition you
Took over my city, and I never asked permission to
Started poppin' bottles, cause it's ATL tradition to
Celebrate with Bob Ma, fuck him at the So-ho
If there ain't an elevator in it, it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin', and these bitches wanna snow blow
And they just give me head, while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ should've won that
Listen and respect, man, the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, halla at me when you're done laps
Roll around with Neego, Party with Azooka
Shout goes out to 1Da, shout goes out to Future
Shout goes out to Getti, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch, just can't seem to hold it steady
'Cause I see the flame flickering, x girls bickering
Got these women jockin' me from Holly Grove all the way to Picker Ring
I tryed to send my nigga Short some syrup out in Michigan, but my connect said it'd take a minute if you listening
Please start doing you, I been doing me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody, even if you suin' me
My brother P-rain know, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot an officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hopin' on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just halla if you got me, fuck you if you had me
Shout goes out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver, and 40, man, you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to B Plus
The names I mention are crucial, you gonna need us
And life is good, everything is just fine
I am so sure of my rhymes, I could sacrifice a line
Yeah, I swear, I really fuckin' does it
I had these niggas trippin, no luggage

[Chorus]
I'm still fly, I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
I'm still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters can't stand 'em
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing
I'm still fly, I'm sky high (Yeah)
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing
I'm still

[Intro: Drake & M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Yeah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Right
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Haaaah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Aight
No one on the corner has swagger like us
I'm 'bout to do my thing
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
You ready?
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Here I go

[Chorus: M.I.A. & Drake]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Yeah

It's October's Very Own
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Drizzy
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Tez, you ain't even got nothin' to worry about, man
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Yeah
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Check
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh
Are you listening? Is anybody listening?
Walk into the room and you can smell the Clive Christian scent
A lot of niggas is threatened by my positioning
Thrilling bars, you'd think I'm writin' with John Grisham pen
I need rosé, never mind the pricing
Know we brought cake to the party, no icing
No ice on, big Phantom, no license
Fuck if you feelin' me as long as your wife is
No one in my city got a pocket like Drizzy
I could rock fitted jeans 'cause my credit card skinny
It's pitch black and covers all incidentals
And, Ms. Wrong, sorry you ain't notice my potential
Fuck y'all rappers and your self-proclaimed status
I can only see green now, happy St. Paddy's
Yeah, I know you waitin' on the last quote
Check the SoundScan, you can see that I'm the last hope

[Chorus: M.I.A. & Drake]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Yeah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Oh, I'm not done
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Ye, what up?
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Don C, what up, homeboy?
No one on the corner has swagger like us
G-hop
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
I got 'em
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Uh
Look

[Verse 2: Drake]
By the way, I'm Jewish
And turnin' 22 gets depressin' when you see your favorite rappers goin' through it
Tryna reinvent themselves, showin' no improvement
Gettin' crushed by this light-skinned youngin on some new shit
40, just record it and we'll drop this here
'Cause I'm tryna fuck Megan Fox this year
And if you got a stylist to cop you gear
You in my age bracket, you are not my peer
Yeah, fuck you really know about a Eames couch?
Frette sheets, perfect touch to a clean house
Wide awake but a nigga livin' ya dreams out
Lookin' like a photoshoot every time the team's out
Yeah, and is the realest nigga still I?
A woman could love me to death but I still die
So I'm about us now
Smith and Wesson flow, you should tell them boys duck down

[Chorus: M.I.A. & Drake]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Yeah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
You know what it is
No one on the corner has swagger like us
October's Own, ATF
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Reps Up, holla at me
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Yeah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
We do this day in and day out, man
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Dead serious
Azooka, I see you boy
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Yeah!

[Outro: M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
How could I fly, but lose it all
I'm a cannonball
Maybe you'll walk away, maybe you'll walk away
Set me up, and let me off
I'm a cannonball

[Verse: Drake]
Like my big bro say, I'm goin in
Olimpic loser money, I just glad I learned to swim
CAnnonball, bitch, I hope dive untill it's 30
And I hope when dinners cold, my fingers do not dessert me
And these haters like, damb m
Gave a lot of women they first ride in the phantom
And yeah, I got a deal now, and I'm secure with it
And yet my life is so exciting, I get bored with it
I'm the best one out of my peers, and everybody pray I'm running out of ideas
Past my MOs, cause I shine so bright
And I'm the result of when it all goes right
So many pictures, man, the floor is a collage
Critics have hard time pointing out the flaws
All this slick talk, I just hope I don't fall
Right out of the sky, through the roof of your garage

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
How could I fly, but lose it all
I'm a cannonball
Maybe you'll walk away, maybe you'll walk away
Set me up, and let me off
I'm a cannonball

[Verse 1]
I always get it wrong
I leave the ones I love
There's something in my brain
That pushes you away
I wish I could rewind
And live a moment twice
I threw it all away
But I still feel the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I need you to stay
I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' down
I'm broken and bent
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I promise I'll change, I'll do anything
Don't throw me away

[Chorus]
People come and people pass by
Like the seasons, life will always change
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for
Photographs turn old and dusty
Roses rot, but memories never fade
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

[Verse 2]
I think about your heart
And how I broke it up
I always will regret
The secrets that I kept

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I need you to stay
I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' down
I'm broken and bent
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I promise I'll change, I'll do anything
Don't throw me away

[Chorus]
People come and people pass by
Like the seasons, life will always change
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for
Photographs turn old and dusty
Roses rot, but memories never fade
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

[Bridge]
Ahh-ahh-ohh-ohh
Ahh-ahh-ohh-ohh
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for
Ahh-ahh-ohh-ohh
Ahh-ahh-ohh-ohh
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

[Outro]
People come and people pass by
Like the seasons, life will always change
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

Breath is like it's made me, test it all back
Come take me home
You can't see my patience, breathless again
But i'm still beating home
Time awaits my lady, the sovereign
Keep on breathing
You were there I take it, where the place it could 

[?]
Then I'll say

[Chorus]
Never hold back on yourself, leave it all behind
Never hold back on yourself, leave it all behind

[Verse 2]
You thought I'm mistaken, bless it all by
This vacancy
Try to show my patience, breathless again
But i'm still beating

[Chorus]
Never hold back on yourself, leave it all behind
Never hold back on yourself, leave it all behind

[Outro]
Love to save my soul...
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough love to save my soul?
Isn't there enough?

[Verse 1]
Don't seem surprised
I saw you slippin', I caught the glimpse of your disguise
It's in your eyes
You've been silently working in denial

[Verse 2]
Don't act innocent
You've lost your place, you won't get in again
I've lost my patience
You're saving face, you're saving face
No no

[Chorus]
"Guess we're sworn enemies", you said
So let me leave you dead

[Verse 3]
Don't get complacent
You're no longer the way I'm facing
I've lost my patience
You're saving face, you're saving face
No no

[Chorus]
"Guess we're sworn enemies", you said
So let me leave you dead
"Guess we're sworn enemies", you said
So let me leave you dead
"Guess we're sworn enemies", you said
So let me leave you dead
"Guess we're sworn enemies", you said
So let me leave you dead

[Verse 1]
Perfect daylight, painted from majestic skies
Cause it's spread further than it's urban structure
Baiting all these righteous lies
Oh I, I, I, I see the vine
Take it's course through the stars tonight
'Cause it's beauty in the air, no
Let the journey take its own mind

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I know, it's not ready to come down slow
You see it's dangerous (dangerous)
'Cause we used to take the easy road
Oh I, I, I, I care, because I can, about the system that we fight, no
'Cause it's beauty in the air, woah yeah
Let the burning lamp fuel its road

[Chorus]
On the street, like a dog. Full of peace, like a dove
On the radio, full of shame. On the moon, say my name
On the street, like a dog. Full of peace, like a dove
On the radio, full of shame. On the moon, say my name

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1 : Jordan Rakei]
Gracious love is falling down
Down the flights of steps in Babylon
Cupid's aiming for the crown
Focusing upon the ready gone

[Chorus]
When a storm's in the street tonight
Love lays flat like a rag doll
Flesh gave possessions of the brain
When a storm's in the street tonight
Love lays flat like a rag doll
Flesh gave possessions of the brain
Possessions of the brain

[Chorus]
When a storm's in the street tonight
Love lays flat like a rag doll
Flesh gave possessions of the brain
When a storm's in the street tonight (oh tonight)
Love lays flat like a rag doll
Flesh gave possessions of the brain
Possessions of the brain

[Verse 2 : Ngaiire]
Eavesdrop, will become forever
Dance, with y'all
Under, alter praise, ancient statute union
Fortune teller making beggars out of love
Ungrateful living, weeping for the dead

[Instrumental Outro]

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Waiting for the last goodbye, or so it seems
Taking all what's left to mystify my fantasy
Watching how the time flies (time flies) inside of me
Personal identity of mine, it's separate, it's separate

[verse 2]
Witness as I float into the night, my lucid dream
Take this life, my sinner, my hand, myself, and soul, it's yours
Take it as you would, my source divine, my symmetry
Personal identity of mine, it's separate, it's separate

[Bridge]
I take it out on myself, I've heard it all before
No stress without the meaning, dreaming to be adored
I saw the animosity, I felt a lot of pain
I told myself the opposite, I didn't know my name
I saw the animosity, I felt a lot of pain
I told myself the opposite, I didn't know my name
I didn't know my name, I didn't know my name
But now I know my name, I didn't know my name
But now I know my name, I didn't know my name

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
I lost my soul too young to find it again
I know to stand with my eyes wide open
I lost myself amongst the valley of men
I dreamt a place so silent

[Chorus]
I can see the darkness of the mind, I can see it prey
I can feel the rain, fall down (fall down)
I can see the darkness of the mind, I can see it pray (see the rain)
I can feel the rain (feel the rain), fall down
I can see the darkness of the mind (darkness of the mind), I can see it prey
I can feel the rain (rain on it now), fall down (fall down)
I can see the darkness of the mind (darkness of the mind), I can see it prey (I can see it prey)
I can feel the rain (can feel the rain), fall down

[Verse 1]
You and I collide
No, not you, necessarily so but your soul
You and I can dream
But my dreams are more vivid, be still with no limitations
You and I are one
But your ego says no, there's no room to fight
You and I are here
But you're not taking over
Rapture, let it simmer
Rapture, let it simmer

[Chorus]
As the bliss comes, as the thoughts slide under
Focus in 'em once, please take me under
Reminisce once, appreciate the darkness
I'm at peace now
As the bliss comes, as the thoughts slide under
Focus in 'em once, please take me under
Reminisce once, appreciate the darkness
I'm at peace now

[Intro]

[Intro]
*Coughing*
Yo, TreeJ (Haha)
Man, you get me too high in here, man
Ah, look
So, as y'all should know, 4/20, the day of smokin' weed
My homie TreeJ gon' drop a mixtape called Sour Hour
So y'all can just listen to it, smoke to it
But I had to cut up on this one, you feel me? (Haha)

[Chorus]
I keep on smokin' up my weed
'Til I'm out of bud
Now I got nothin' but this high
And the roach of a blunt

[Verse 1]
You seen me blow, I'm rollin' up, I'm tryna smoke
I'ma be high 'cause I don't give a fuck
Take one hit for the round, just one time for your mind
This lemon and lime got me feelin' divine, I'm way up in the sky

[Chorus]
I keep on smokin' up my weed
'Til I'm out of bud
Now I got nothin' but this high
And the roach of a blunt

[Verse 2]
I'm up in the clouds
I'm not comin' down
Thousands of miles in the air, and I ain't ever close to the ground
We smokin' the pounds, pounds, pounds
Breakin' it down, down, down
Just me and the homies (Homies)
'Til the hoes come around

[Chorus]
I keep on smokin' up my weed
'Til I'm out of bud
Now I got nothin' but this high
And the roach of a blunt
I keep on smokin' up my weed
'Til I'm out of bud
Now I got nothin' but this high
And the roach of a blunt

[Outro]
Keep smokin', smokin', smokin', smokin' my weed
(Aight, yo)

[Chorus (Turntablism): KOF & KRS-One]
W-Welcome to the—my life—
Be respect—be respect—be respect—
Out for fame (Yeah)
Everybody knew my style
I’m a fiend, recognize me
Out for fame (Yeah)

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
I got twenty-five cans in my knapsack
Crossin’ out the wick-wack
Puttin up my name with a fat cap
Suckers that want to be in my face, I smack that
Big respect to Artifacts
Fat Joey Crack and Mack
And Bio, and Brim, come again
With B.G. 183, recognize me
I’m a fiend… for the spray paint
Laugh if you wanna, I don’t really care if you ain’t
Cuz you don’t know me, and I don’t know you
But I do know Cope2, he hittin’ walls too
It’s the underground community of what we call writers
Worldwide burners gettin’ hotter, gettin’ brighter
Whattup Nicer, whattup Nasa, whattup Chino
Masta Ace in the place with the bass
You know we know
My man Rican, my man Zorro, taught me how to draw
In the yards of the 5 train and the 4
So when I'm on tour I rep that hardcore
I'm taggin’ up your black-book sure
I'm out for fame

[Chorus (Turntablism): KOF & KRS-One]
W-Welcome to the—my life—
Be respect—be respect—be respect—
Out for fame (Yeah)
Everybody knew my style
I’m a fiend, recognize me
Out for fame (Yeah)

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Bombin’, taggin’, black-book braggin’
Throw ups, pieces, aerosol all graphin’
Takin’ my space in this place, I ain’t askin’
Art is a passion, something you can’t cash-in
Back in the past, when we made our own fashion
Aerosol art—it revealed what we imagined
When “The Back” was the crew, on the buckle was the name
Bubble letters, other letters, wild style, out for fame
On the highway, taggin’ it my way
Hittin’ up the freight trains as they go by me
Never the cop-ay, somebody stop me!
I’m hittin’ up everything, hope the cameras don’t spot me

[Chorus (Turntablism): KOF & KRS-One]
W-Welcome to the—my life—
Be respect—be respect—be respect—
Out for fame (Yeah)
Everybody knew my style
I’m a fiend, recognize me
Out for fame (Yeah)
I took three more
I don't think I know you anymore
I took three more
I don't think I know you anymore

I took three more
I don't think I know you anymore
I took three more
I don't think I know you anymore

This is where I am
This is where I am
This is where I am

This is where I am
This is where I am
This is where I am

I took three more
I don't think I know you anymore
I took three more
I don't think I know you anymore
I took three more
I don't think I know you anymore
I took three more
I don't think I know you like before

This is where I am
This is where I am
This is where I am

This is where I am
This is where I am
This is where I am
Sign on the road
It wants to know
The difference
Between you and me

You can pretend
That you know
Better
Like I know you do

Dust in my eye
I don't know why
You hurt me
You hurt me
You hurt me
You hurt me

I wanna be your baby
I wanted you to hate me
I wanted you to play with me
I wanna be your plaything

First time up I couldn't feel nothing
Second time up I bought my coffin
Third time up I couldn't stop crying
Fourth time up I wanted to die

I wanna be your baby
I wanna be your baby
I wanna be your baby
So many big problems for such a little girl
She wants to tell me all about her broken world
Sometimes I give a shit but I just don't know why
I'll take another one, let me go outside

Somebody told me that I shouldn't go to school
I should just play guitar and try to break the rules
I thought I'd do it but I didn't even start
I couldn't bring myself to break my mommy's heart

Last night I saw her staring through the tv screen
Into another world no one has ever seen
There's something wrong but then again maybe there's not
I guess it's all okay as long as she forgot
This one's my fort under there
I think no one can see me
Are you a boy or a girl
You tell or you're leaving

Blood makes my brain start to hurt
And I know it baby
And I know it baby
Blood makes my brain start to hurt
And I know it baby
And I know it baby

I think once I hit you too hard
Cause I couldn't say fuck you
Remember I knocked on your wall
No one would believe you

This time it wasn't my fault
It's true, it was Matthew
I wanted to jump off the rails
But I can't so I spit through
Blood makes my brain start to hurt
And I know it baby
And I know it baby
Blood makes my brain start to hurt
And I know it baby
And I know it baby
Thirty-five dollars is way too much
Baby talk to this guy
Get his stuff
I don't have to deal with this shit anymore
I got paradise waiting in my drawer

Sometimes I just wanna be happy
Sometimes I just wanna be happy
Sometimes I just wanna be happy
Sometimes I just wanna be happy

Call you on the phone and I know you know
Call you on the phone
You just tell me not to go
Baby I don't wanna be alone anymore
All you gotta do is let me lock this door

Something special about you girl
You make me wanna break up my world
It's funny baby
Sometimes I just wanna be happy
Sometimes I just wanna be happy
Sometimes I just wanna be happy
Sometimes I just wanna be happy
He was numb so he looked it up
Nothing wrong with the name in the book
Mommy and daddy want to call the cops
He thinks she looks better when he drops

Is she in the bathroom
I think I'll tell her I should go soon
I think I'll call her when we get home
But really all I wanna do is feel this swell in my head
Leave me alone

He can make believe that he's not making things up
He can make believe that he can be just like us
He can make believe that he wont make such a fuss

Leave me in the basement
I'll never tell you what I really meant
I'll never tell you why I don't speak
But really all I wanna do is break a bone in my brain
And get happy
You know when it gets too hot to touch
We think you've had enough
It makes me feel like I don't need
To make my body bleed

Would you stop hitting so hard?
Hitting so hard
Hitting so hard
Hitting so hard

I swung until I broke my hand
Then I got mad again
You said it makes you want to die
But that still feels alright

I won't stop hitting so hard
Hitting so hard
Hitting so hard
Hitting so hard
Talk it down one more time
So you can forget what made you better then
Cause you're fucking up pretty bad now

Maybe it'll take some time
Maybe it'll take some time
Baby I know what's on your mind
Baby I know what's on your mind

Don't you leave him alone
He's just a kid
Another wrecking ball
Thinking he's bigger than god

Maybe it'll take some time
Maybe it'll take some time
Baby I know what's on your mind
Baby I know what's on your mind
He knows now
What he knew back then
When he could tell
The only meaning
That he really felt

She says she knows
What's up his nose
And she stays
'Cause she wouldn't have him
Any other way

When he gets her alone
He'll make her bed a gravestone
And he'll dig til he can't think
Another awful thing

What she goes through
To be with you
You ought to give her the world
When she wakes up
She's in love with the thought
Of her boy
Never ending sick special toy

When she gets enough
She can't wait to show how tough
She can be
What she can teach you with her body

If it's what you want
Baby I'll go down
For you

What you tell me to
I won't fight
I will do

What you tell me to
It's not wrong
If it's for you

What you do too
Sticks in me sticks in you
You stay true
Sticks in me sticks in you
Ooo
I'll make
A twenty dollar bet
Adam won't get
His lunchbox back

I took it
An hour ago
He's crying in the snow
I'll never let it go

I hope
When Adam goes home
He hides it from his mom
He thinks of me alone

And when
We're swimming at the Y
I'll splash him in the eye
I'll dunk him til he cries

I'll make
A twenty dollar bet
Adam won't get
His lunchbox back
I took it
An hour ago
He's crying in the snow
I want him so

[Intro]
Oh, my lovely
Baby, you're all I see
Lady, love you
Maybe it's all I do

[Verse 1]
It's cold out, it's past eight
And I just lost my keys again
I don't know how I'll make it
Through the year and
When you're comin' home
I'm stuck here but I don't feel all alone
'Cause I burned the dinner that we two are waitin' on
One more to come right through, back to

[Chorus]
Well, I want you
Baby, it's all I do
Come to meet you
Baby, it's all I do
Oh, my lovely
Baby, you're all I see
Let's get ready, maybe I might be

[Bridge]
Well, you know, I've never really done this
No way
Well, I know you really haven't either – so what?
Can't tell you why

[Verse 2]
I feel like I'm eighty and confused without my pants
Somebody takes my hand
Tell me we're goin' home
I don't need a new invention on my phone
'Cause I'm really tired of the way we're movin' on
Just lay me on the lawn

[Chorus]
Well, I want you
Baby, it's all I do
Come to meet you
Baby, it's all I do
Oh, my lovely
Baby, you're all I see
Let's get ready, well, I might be

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I've overheard your theory "Nostalgia's for geeks"
I guess sir, if you say so
Some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art’s in pop culture, in me

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause

I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)

[Post-Chorus]
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E

[Verse 2]
I've overheard your theory "Nostalgia's for geeks" (A-P-P-L-A-U)
I guess sir, if you say so
Some of us just like to read (A-P-P-L-A-U)
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me (A-P-P-L-A-U)
Pop culture was in art, now art’s in pop culture, in me

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the...
Turn the lights out
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Post-Chorus]
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (put your hands up, make 'em touch)
A-A

[Outro]
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

[Verse 1]
I'm America's Sweetheart
Trying to get away
You make it hard to leave
But it's easier for me to stay
I am so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the fighting, baby, we're
Not fooling anyone these days
I don't wanna stray
But boy, I'm so afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear

[Chorus]
So I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
Thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid

[Verse 2]
We were just teenagers when we fell in love
Driving in your fast car
Looking at the stars above
But it was not enough
You should never come between
A woman and her dream
And a man that never knew his place
There's no easy way
To come back from where you came

[Chorus]
So, baby, now I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
I-I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
Nothing in your heart, boy
I thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid

[Bridge]
And it's not love, it's just the fear
That you've put down for all these years

[Chorus]
But I'm leaving now
I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
I am done being afraid
Oh, I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
I thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid

[Outro]
Oh, it's not love that keeps me here
It's not love that keeps me here
I'm done being afraid
I'm done being afraid
Oh, oh, oh

[Intro]
Yeah, YSL, Lady V, what the fuck goin' on, man?

[Verse 1]
Start off sooner than the rest of them
Kick that pebble down the avenue
Thought that I had got the best of them
Stick that metal down that steep canoe yeah
Hands as flippers down the war bredren
Tipping thoughtful motions that I knew
“Easy oar” I told the rest of them
Memories of what come true

[Chorus]
Conflict of interest, I guess
It’s all to do with the cosmology
You thought you knew it best, but no
It’s simple like the roots of tree

[Verse 2]
Take this like you would my gentleman
Knowing all we are, are misconstrued
Let the freedom melt my gentle skin
To a portion of my broken view
Take it as it is, a simple plan
Knowing all we are, are misconstrued
Lie among this timeless ambience
Realise it starts within our youth

[Chorus]
Conflict of interest, I guess
It’s all to do with the cosmology
You thought you knew it best, but no
It’s simple like the roots of tree

[Verse 3]
Separate from your soul, let it lean on
Separate from your mind, let it dream on
Hold it for a ransom, time to keep on, yeah
Please put forth that helping hand

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Once I borrowed the canvas to my lover's heart
But the stone was too full, and that envelope had a letter
In that scarcely room
Back in silence is when it all began falling apart
I was always a clumsy speaker, and we couldn't find one another
In that scarcely room
Mark my words, I say I'm guilty of no poetry
I was working, I confess, I see the courage in her eyes
In that scarcely room
There were words of disagreement
But we talked to find the answers, in a mutual disposition
In that scarcely room

[Chorus]
How can I find a reason to love you, when I don't love myself
How can I find a reason to love you, when I don't love myself, self
How can I find a reason to love you, when I don't love myself
How can I find a reason to love you, when I don't love myself, self

[Verse 2]
Shout at me and mirror traits of insecurity
See the man had stole her fire, so was her who put the flame out
In that scarcely room
Courted dress for the occasion, yet not filled with glee
His hands reaching for the curtain, she was quick to put the light out
In that scarcely room

[Chorus]
How can I find a reason to love you, when I don't love myself
How can I find a reason to love you, when I don't love myself, self
How can I find a reason to love you, when I don't love myself
How can I find a reason to love you, when I don't love myself, self
How can I find a reason to love you, when I don't love myself
How can I find a reason to love you, when I don't love myself, self

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
It’s the birth of a star, earlier than sunset
It’s the galaxy's water, flowing like a river bed
It’s the rain, oh the rain
Drowning 'pon this summer day
Grown into a super nova
Back to where we used to play
It’s an infinite deep, as it feasts on time
‘Cause it constantly leaps, perpetual design
‘Cause we worship the keep
The tide is going out now
As we look out to sea
Legs sprawled and head-down

[Bridge]
Yes they shine bright like a million, let them bleed twice for a minute
Pleasure to have met you, you’re my star tonight
To have felt this oh sublime, like a grain of sand travelling through time
Pleasure to have met you, you’re my star tonight
Yes they shine bright like a million, let them bleed twice for a minute
Pleasure to have met you, you’re my star tonight
To have felt this oh sublime, like a grain of sand travelling through time
Pleasure to have met you, you’re my star tonight

[Chorus]
We don’t see eye to eye, we don’t see eye to eye
We don’t see eye to eye, we don’t see eye to eye

[Verse 2]
The time it took to realise
What you say bears weight on my soul
Compliments with no surprises
Naked roots straight to their home

[Chorus]
We don’t see eye to eye, we don’t see eye to eye
We don’t see eye to eye, We don’t see eye to eye

[Verse 3]
Rusty nail showing bruises
Not quite holding firmly now
Complications, falling useless
Alone until I work it out

[Chorus]
We don’t see eye to eye, we don’t see eye to eye
We don’t see eye to eye, We don’t see eye to eye

[Instrumental outro]

[Verse 1]
It was a dark night, when I heard the news
Rolled up my sleeves and walked
Like a landslide, overly abused
Yet told myself to call
Yes my mother, vaguely confused
She told me not to ball
Ball my eyes, ‘cause my eyes are red
With nothing left at all
So I gather, my composure
Head quickly for the door
But alarm bells ring, they ring louder now
Frequent the lady called
Called me her grandmother, I loved her so much more
Than nobody else, left on this earth
I’m in this state of awe

[Chorus]
As we March through the madness
April was unclear
Suddenly it turned to sadness
Hopes turned into fears
And it was May, it was May, it was May, it was May

[Verse 2]
Guess it was a day, the day of reckoning
Six feet beneath us all
Yet we held on, held each other tight
Withstand this winter storm
‘Cause we’re here now, yes we’re here now
Moments like this are raw
It's my family tree planting it's roots stronger than before

[Chorus]
As we March through the madness
April was unclear
Suddenly it turned to sadness
Hopes turned into fears
And it was May, it was May, it was May, it was May

[Bridge]
You left
You left
Without a chance to say
Without a chance to say goodbye at all
A chance to say goodbye at all

[Chorus]
As we March through the madness
April was unclear
Suddenly it turned to sadness
Hopes turned into fears
And it was May, it was May, it was May, it was May

[Verse 1]
Yes I was flaking on you
'Cause i was sturdy about it last night
No need to take away from it
You flew, I surrender to the moment
You washed away the sadness
Your world had no minimum requirements
So tender, hands off a sweet machine
I spot the soul of a masquerade-rade

[Chorus]
Unnecessary goodbyes
You’ve taken your time
I'm wrestled by the moment
Hung by the thread of your mind

[Verse 2]
Toe deep to test the water
3 inches too far and too slow
I stepped right into order
You welcome the subtle overthrow
Ice cubes melting like rain drops, rain drops
Clouds of guilt built like the nimbus
I’m weakest at your mercy
Control me like a circus, the circus

[Chorus]
Unnecessary goodbyes
You’ve taken your time
I'm wrestled by the moment
Hung by the thread of your mind

Unnecessary goodbyes
You’ve taken your time
I'm wrestled by the moment
Hung by the thread of your mind

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Skeletons in my closet, dusting out the place
Holes in my pockets, wrong pants - my mistake
Sneaking down the hallway, hard floor hard shoes
Finding out what’s wrong with her, finding out the truth
Messing with my conscience, hard act to prove
Sick of all the nonsense, sick of all the news
It’s not about the doctorate, it’s about those who choose

[Chorus]
Blues clues, Blues clues
Blues clues, Blues clues
Blues clues, Blues clues
Blues clues, Blues clues

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 2]
I want to be a kid again, explosive like I’m dynamite
Waiting for worlds to end, but that don’t keep me up at night
No stress, no pain, no cause, no sane
No one to please, no time to waste
Just live it like, live it like you’re a g-god
Standing on the clouds, but told you're not allowed
Just live it like, live it like you’re on M-Mars
Staring at the sun, ‘cause that’s what we’ve become

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Just live it like, live it like you’re a g-god
Standing on the clouds, but told you're not allowed
Just live it like, live it like you’re on M-Mars
Staring at the sun, ‘cause that’s what we’ve become

[Instrumental bridge + Outro]
‘Cause that’s what we’ve become

[Verse 1]
My memory told me a secret
A breath of its last cigarette
A smokey haze, a scene was set
To question my own interest

My conditioning was fighting now
No butts were asked, so when and how
The settled dust vibrated out
The necessary walk about

My hat bears shade upon my face
The moon creeping my distant gaze
My soul begins an endless chase
To trap the memory in the maze

I held it tight up by the neck
And rose my arms, it's dangling legs
The wind whispered one final check
Dead it lies at peace, at rest

[Chorus]
Capsules will sink before they swim, inform your next of kin
Capsules will sink before they swim, inform your next of kin

[Verse 2]
On board the ship to manic state
The pill was stored within the freight
She aimed to score but fairly late
She missed the shot, such is to take

I saw she wanted temporary
Guarded it as complementary
Disused all my commentary
Trapped by her own memory

[Chorus]
Capsules will sink before they swim, inform your next of kin
Capsules will sink before they swim, inform your next of kin

[Chorus]
Capsules will sink before they swim, inform your next of kin
Capsules will sink before they swim, inform your next of kin

[Outro]
It’s taking a hold of me
Oh with my hands tied
It’s taking a hold of me
Oh with my hands tied

[Intro]
It was all
Something or nothing
To me

[Verse 1]
Wake from this dream
It was all something
And nothing to me
I'll make you believe
That it was all something
And nothing to me
Take hold of me
Always, forever a fantasy
Wake from this dream
It was all something
And nothing to me

[Pre-Chorus]
I was scared and unaware
Moving out of darkness
Darkness
I was trapped in the flesh
Moving out of darkness

[Chorus]
Caught amongst the flames
And now my heart's ablaze
Broken down and now
I'm stranded here
Oh, the light
Shines on me
Shines on me too much

[Bridge]
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 3]
Finding myself now
I was all something
And nothing to you
Birth to the storm cloud
They were all something
And nothing to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I was scared and unaware, no
Moving out of darkness
Darkness
I was trapped in the flesh
Moving out of darkness

[Chorus]
Caught amongst the flames
Now my heart's ablaze
Broken down
And now I'm stranded here
Oh, the light
Shines on me
Shines on me too much

[Outro]
Oh, the light
Oh, the light

[Verse 1]
I’ve come here alone, watch me cry, all night long
I’m not coming home at all tonight, oh tonight, oh
The heat of the stove warm these lies, oh these lies, oh these lies
Clutch to the sword, grip it tight, oh so tight

[Chorus]
See me hide into the dark place
The rows of wicked thoughts trapped within the maze
Hopelessly I’m desperate
See me hide into the dark place
The rows of wicked thoughts trapped within the maze
Hopelessly I’m desperate

[Verse 2]
Trapped in this dream, the current is taking me, oh taking me
I thought I was dreaming, woke to a wet secret

[Chorus]
See me hide into the dark place
The rows of wicked thoughts trapped within the maze
Hopelessly I’m desperate
See me hide into the dark place
The rows of wicked thoughts trapped within the maze
Hopelessly I’m desperate

[Outro]
Hopelessly I’m desperate
Hopelessly I’m desperate
Hopelessly I’m desperate
Hopelessly I’m desperate

[Verse 1 : Jordan Rakei]
It was the bad old days
Where the warriors came out to play
Where the visitors outstayed their welcome
Aspirations filled with fear and doubt
Whose turn to make the move, who’s left it all to you
I’m not ideal in situation of confrontation
I don’t prefer to raise my voice
I’m still trapped by the cages of my lips
And you hold the key
So allow me to be free
It’s been 24 years, 24 years
It’s been 24 years, 24 years

[Verse 2 : Kaya Thomas-Dyke]
24 years, and you know me now
Like the willow tree knows the sea
You withstand
Don’t you try to get under ‘cause you can’t set me free
And if you know what I see
I would lie to me
But don’t worry about your soul
Don’t worry about your soul
I was, I was just...

[Chorus : Jordan Rakei & Kaya Thomas-Dyke]
I was just a wallflower
I was just a wallflower
I was just a wallflower
I was just a wallflower
I'm sorry I'm not strong
I'm not like the other girls
Yeah I won't get along
I won't talk to them, I'm sorry
He's always around
Sometimes he touches me
But I don't really mind
It's nice to know somebody loves me

But don't leave me alone
Don't you leave me alone
Don't you leave me alone
Cause I don't wanna be around my mind
For too long

So don't leave me alone
Please don't leave me alone
Please don't leave me alone
Please don't

(Should I keep going?)
I hate wearing my clothes
I want everyone to see
That I'm so beautiful
Please don't take me home
You know I love you more than God
Cause he won't return my calls
Yeah he never returns my calls
I'm not a slut, I'm not a tramp, I'm not a hoe
But I'mma get my dough
Ain't selling ass, just take a cash before kissin back
Gotta get my dough

[Verse 1]
I know I messed up and I was wrong
I thought it over and over for so long
I know you hate me, but can’t you see
I made some changes?

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Oh, baby, it’s true
I wanna be with you (you)

[Chorus]
I wanna be real
I wanna be more
I know I must love
And this time I’m sure, ooh
I wanna be with you

[Verse 2]
Everything I did makes no sense
Always listen to the voices in my head
I know it’s long gone, but let me try
I need you near me

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Oh, baby, it’s true
I wanna be with you (you)

[Chorus]
I wanna be real
I wanna be more
I know I must love
And this time I’m sure, ooh
I wanna be with you

[Break]
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you

[Drop]
I wanna be with you

[Refrain 2]
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Oh, baby, it’s true
I wanna be with
I wanna be with
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Oh, baby, it’s true
I wanna be with
I wanna be with
I wanna be with you

[Outro]
I wanna be with you

[Verse 1]
Be sure you know what you are after
Open up every scar
I've been known to strike like disaster
They say I hit hard

[Pre-Chorus]
Think anyone, anyone but you
Anyone, anyone but
Think anyone, anyone but you
Should have known what you were after

[Chorus]
When you fell in love
The interior design of my (Fell in love)
The interior design of my (Fell in love)
The interior design of my (Fell in love)
The interior design of my heart

[Verse 2]
Now I've got you where I want you
Never say you were not warned
I'll make you wish you were never born
The harder you fight, the harder you fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Think anyone, anyone but you
Anyone, anyone but
Think anyone, anyone but you
Should have known what you were after

[Chorus]
When you fell in love
The interior design of my (Fell in love)
The interior design of my (Fell in love)
The interior design of my (Fell in love)
The interior design of my heart

[Bridge]
Thought I was processed, thought I was packaged
Just like an apple pie wrapped in the plastic (Yeah)
Got love but you're never gonna have it
Fell so hard like Alice and the rabbit
Locked down (Yeah) Can't move (Okay)
Now you don't know what to do
Took a bite of the apple, went straight to the core
Fell in love with my interior

[Pre-Chorus]
Think anyone, anyone but you
Anyone, anyone but
Think anyone, anyone but you
Should have known what you were after

[Chorus]
When you fell in love
The interior design of my (Fell in love)
The interior design of my (Fell in love)
The interior design of my (Fell in love)
The interior design

[Outro]
When you fell in love
Fell in love
Fell in love
Fell in love

[Chorus]
Don't you know what you do, when you do it well?
Don't you know what you do, when you do it well? Yeah

[Verse 1]
You make me move my feet like a stereotype
I got my hands in the air and my eyes open wide
You make my mind move fast but my brain move slow
Yeah, I'm vicious and delicious but they just can't let me go
You got me under your spell, but I know I can break it
'Cause I'll take it and control it and then I'll just x-ray it
But I've got your world in my telephone book
And I'll admit you get me going when you do it that good

[Chorus]
Don't you know what you do, when you do it well?
Don't you know what you do, when you do it well? Yeah
Don't you know what you do, when you do it well?
Don't you know what you do, when you do it well? Yeah

[Verse 2]
You got me thinking like a number, not like an individual
I'm like all them other girls with my back against the wall
Got me sipping a Smirnoff and taking off my shoes
You got me playing these games but I'm never gonna lose
'Cause your logic's all fucked up like your head
But I'll enjoy, destroy it, then I'll put this thing to bed
But I got to admit, you got me going pretty good
I'm like a puppet and I'm dancing like you knew that I would

[Chorus]
Don't you know what you do, when you do it well?
Don't you know what you do, when you do it well? Yeah
Don't you know what you do, when you do it well?
Don't you know what you do, when you do it well? Yeah

[Bridge]
You make the stars in the sky seem trippy
You make the sketty girls at the bar seem pretty
You make all the clockwork tick like magic
You make me wanna see you get down and get graphic
You make the stars in the sky seem trippy
You make the sketty girls at the bar seem pretty
You make all the clockwork tick like magic
You make me wanna see you get down and get graphic

[Chorus]
Don't you know what you do, when you do it well?
Don't you know what you do, when you do it well? Yeah
Don't you know what you do, when you do it well?
Don't you know what you do, when you do it well? Yeah

[Outro]
Do it well
Yeah
Do it well
Everyone's an authority
On who and what is good for me
Who I see, what I wear

Everyone's a specialist
On where I've been
And who I've kissed
Choices I should make
The lovers I should take

Everyone's a connaisseur
How do they know?
What makes them so sure?
Do they know what's right for me?

Everyone's a know-it-all
But will they be there
To catch me when I fall
Or have they just come along for the show?

The me nobody knows
Just what it's like, nobody sees
If they could just walk along in my shoes for a while
Then they could see just what it's like
Everyone's a specialist
On where I've been
And who I've kissed
Choices I should make
The lovers I should take

The me nobody knows
Just what it's like, nobody sees
If they could just walk along in my shoes for a while
Then they could see just what it's like

The me nobody knows
Just what it's like
The me nobody knows
Just what it's like

Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

If they could just walk along in my shoes for a while...

[Verse 1]
Wooo!
Alright...
The gutter was filled with flowers, yeah
And our bodies were filled with wine
And the wine was filled with a secret power
And it filled your hand with mine

And now we walk together
Down a dark road, unafraid
With our shadows intertwined forever
On a moonlit promenade

[Chorus]
And now I'm yours!
(La la la la la la la la la  La la la la la la la laaa)
And now you're mine!
(La la la la la la la la la  La la la la la la la laaa)
And now we are
(La la la la la la la la la  La la la la la la la laaa)
Under the pines
(La la la la la la la la la  La la la la la la la laaa)
Oh yeah!

[Verse 2]
And now we lie together, ah lord
In a dark world, unafraid
With our bodies intertwined forever, yeah
Oh, is all that will remain

And the gutter was filled with fireworks
And our bodies were filled with wine
And the wine was filled with a secret power
And it filled your body with mine

[Chorus]
And now I'm yours!
(La la la la la la la la la  La la la la la la la laaa)
And now you're mine!
(La la la la la la la la la  La la la la la la la laaa)
And we'll be fine
(La la la la la la la la la  La la la la la la la laaa)
Under the pines
(La la la la la la la la la  La la la la la la la laaa)
Ahh yeah!


Sha-la-la-la!  Sha-la-la-la-leee

Woo!
You know I've tried, yeah
You know I gotta be free, yeah

[Verse 1: Jake, with Nathan]
Lost to these linens
My tasteless affections
Are buried in the past
Feelings so fleeting
Yet never completing
The thoughts I quelled to last
I saw too
I saw to it, Anna
I saw too
I saw to it, Anna
I caught a line, I caught a line
Clinging to my own devices

[Verse 2: Jake]
Craving sleep when the evening comes
Strip me down to a heart and lungs
I always sang about ya
Terrified of how waking life walks
Frightened frame with a shirt that talks
I tripped over the moon about ya
Steadfast in nature
The scenes on my pages
Were all mirages now
Everything's vexing
I'm more unconvincing
Than both my parents now

[Bridge: Jake]
Oh, oh, oh, I waited up for you
Oh, oh, oh, you said that you wanted me too
Oh, oh, oh, I waited up for you
Oh, oh, oh, twenty-one years for you
Twenty-one years for you

[Verse 3: Jake]
I woke with a headache
My bones and my body
Screamed, "Son, where the hell is your head?"
I reached for some water
To quench the fire
That's burning up in my bed
Haze like a fever
I fell like a dreamer
For sweet tea and lemonade
It clings to my T-shirt
It's loud and it lingers
Designed to suffocate

[Pre-Chorus: Jake, Nathan]
I light up to find
What I've known all this time
There's some beauty here yet
The folks in town
Have the kindest eyes
But you'll drown in the ways you set
I'll flee like that fever (You're a traveler)
Lost to that dreamer
All pale-faced for leaving be (Your heart is heavy now)
Our time is a-coming (You're a traveler)
But my heart is humming
For a girl that I can't see (Fresh out of your mother's house)
Lost to these feelings
(You're a traveler)
They're uncompromising
(Your heart is heavy now)
I'll do as I will to be 

[?]
The future's uncertain
(You're a traveler)
My heart is hurting
For a girl that I can't see (Fresh out of your mother's house)

[Chorus: Jake, Nathan]
For a girl that I can't see (You're a traveler)
For a girl that I can't see (Your heart is heavy now)
For a girl that I can't see (You're a traveler)
For a girl that I can't see (Fresh out of your mother's house)
For a girl that I can't see (ooh)
For a girl that I can't see (You're a traveler)
For a girl that I can't see

[Verse 1]
Steady yourself even though you know that you're falling
Maybe you're falling, but you're still alive
Ready yourself, that's quite enough of your bawlin'
'Cause baby, you're bawling, but you'll survive
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried
Losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried

[Chorus]
Forever trading places with the same old me
I'm racking up the cases of who I failed to be
Why would I replace the sky?
Why would I recreate that perfect blue?
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
You can copy and paste your head on a new body
But that new body's still made of flesh
And cutting corners gets you where you're going
But how you get there is the real test

[Pre-Chorus]
And losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried
And losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried

[Chorus]
Forever trading places with the same old me
I'm racking up the cases of who I failed to be
Why would I replace the sky?
Why would I recreate that perfect blue?
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Hey boy
Why so down?
Smokin' all of your teeth brown
It's gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be good

Hey boy
Whatchu doin?
Drinkin' yourself to ruin
It's gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be good

[Chorus]
In a moment
I'll be walkin' over
You'll forget you know her
When I kiss your world apart

In a moment
I know that I'll be the only girl
To shake your lonely heart
To shake your lonely heart

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Hey boy...
Hey boy
Why oh why?
You're making all your girlfriends cry
It's gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be good

Hey boy
How bout this?
I'll get right to the gist
It's gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be good

[Chorus]
In a moment
I'll be walkin' over
You'll forget you know her
When I kiss your world apart

In a moment
I know that I'll be the only girl
To shake your lonely heart
To shake your lonely heart

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
To shake your lonely
To shake your lonely heart
To shake your lonely head
To shake your lonely heart
To shake your lonely
To shake your lonely heart
To shake your lonely
To shake your lonely heart

Bitch, you outta line, why you waste my time?

I know she playin' both sides, that bitch tellin' lies
But my dick give her a high, she down for the ride
Them hatin' bitches kill the vibe, fuck it, live your life
Bad bitches in Hawaii, umbrella with ice
10 bad bitches on my side, make 'em all my wife
Smokin' on the finest ganja, she like China white
Poppin' all these pills she said she used to it
She wanna go way up, okay baby, if you used to it
And I know that you a grown woman
And I know that you know what you're doing

Really wanna be faithful but this shit hard, baby
Yup, I got the pussy first and then I ignored you (Ignored you)
You fucked another nigga, you ain't loyal (Loyal)
I told you bring a friend, this shit gettin' borin' (Borin')
She asked me what we are, we just cordial
I'm a gangsta I can make a wet, wet turn into a pool (Splash)
She help me count the money in the trap then she go back to school (School, school, school)
If a nigga ever play with bae, shit it's breaking news (Pow)

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I just wanna show you off, I don't wanna do you wrong
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the flyest of 'em all?
I get money when I want, I can fuck her if I want
Baby, you can take it off, I'm that nigga with the sauce (Ayy, yeah)
Whole lot of Saint Laurent, can't remember what it cost (Ayy, yeah)
Bitch, I'm feelin' like a boss, spit on it and lick it off (Ayy, yeah)
You know we can run it up, tell me what you really want
I know I can break you off, come and let me break you off
If you ever wanna fuck, can I be the one you call?
If you wanna be a star, I can tell you what it cost
I was gonna put you on, I was gonna put you on
I was gonna change your life, girl but I don't wanna break your heart

Now you dealin' with a boss, I might treat you rightly (Nah)
No more Macy jewelry, baby, now you drippin' icy (Ayy)
You keep hangin' 'round me, baby, you'll start talkin' like me
Got my own lingo, I can change your whole lil' ego
I be swimmin' in the money, baby, whish torpedo
I ain't like these rapper niggas, they is not my stylo (Uh)
I'ma call you back, I'm with my niggas shootin' cee-lo

[Verse 1]
Comes through my back door
Tells me what he's seen and heard about me
What is all this for?
Who is it that they expect me to be?

[Chorus]
We've all been waiting
But totally unsure of what for
Patiently awaiting
To see what sorta shit is in store

[Verse 2]
Open up my eyes
How on Earth is it that I was surprised?
Beneath the red and yellow sky
I rest my head and shed myself of this guy

[Chorus]
We've all been waiting

[?] to open that door
Patiently awaiting
To see what washes up on the shore
I've been wading through the echoes of my life
Look down stream...
Dip my feet in

[Verse 3]
Breathe a heavy sigh
Wondering if this is where I should be
Relief within my eyes
I see an outcome no one else could have seen

[Chorus]
We've all been waiting
But totally unsure of what for
Patiently awaiting
To see what sort of shit is in store

I've been wading through the echoes of my life
And look down stream...
Dip my feet in

[Verse]
Ask me why
I feel I'd be better off dead
I never seem to wait and see

Help me to find a place I can rest my head
You never seem to wait on me

I wish I had a girlfriend
We’d lay beneath the sun and the trees
A baby, such a bad friend
I’ve only ever known what I’ve seen

(instrumental)

[Verse 1]
My feelings are true
With ease they allow
The flow of my will
And good sake for you
And good sake for you

[Chorus]
This is your past
Before you’re born
For you to see
You deserve it

[Verse 2]
These things I won’t change
They keep me relaxed
It’s always my way
They keep me relaxed
It’s always my way
(yeah ay) my ex blew my best man
She took my wallet and my vans
I pulled that thot out of her man's place
He finna catch these hands; he better get out my face
I wore fresh j's to her apps
The bitch damn took my chicken wrap

Yeah the bitch stole the wrap
And now she finna bite my ass

That picture of my dick finna be on insta
Got kicked in the nads
Now her friend be wildin' on the finsta

Got the bitch's new man peeping the ads
Got my cash money, face on the billboard can't even touch me
In my new jacuzzi can't touch my own fucking ipad
I be sippin' lean with the squad on the xany

Yeah the bitch stole the wrap
And now she finna bite my ass
The plant gets me higher than Cheech and Chong
Freer than my boy OJ Simpson
Boy I really wish that my bitch and squad would fucking hit the bong

[Refrain: Beyonce & Ne-Yo]
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting

Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
It's 6 o'clock
And seconds feel like hours as I sit here
And watch them tick away
And just the thought
Of seeing you again I wanna sing
I've been longing for this day

[Chorus]
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't smile untill I see your smile
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do

Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I'll wait right here for you

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
It's 12 am
The crowd is getting thin but it's okay
'Cause I'm not here for them no, no, no
And I refuse
To move from the spot
Until I feel your heart
Pressed against mine again
I'm waiting!

[Chorus]
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't smile until I see your smile
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do

'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you

[Bridge: Beyonce & Ne-Yo]
I don't care how long it takes
I don't mind I'm alright I'll sit and wait
'Til the sun comes down and rise
And come right back up again
You're the best thing that's happened in my life
When your absent in the borders is my life
And it just ain't right
So take as long as you like
I'm waiting

[Refrain: Beyonce & Ne-Yo]
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Oh yes, I love her like Egyptian, want a description?
My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can’t be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill boi, because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that, man, fuck them niggas, I’m going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw ‘em
With these old ghetto poems
Thinking it's better for ‘em
When they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call the body
Now everybody got it, had it
Talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes
Even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mamas of our chill'un
They fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to
I’m willing to go the extra kilo-meter
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no girl ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it’s real Jazzy Belle

[Chorus: Babyface]
Jazzy Belle
If you really want to be my star
Maybe we can mend a broken heart
Jazzy Belle
If you really want to be my boo
Straighten up your shit
I’ll be with you

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
See, what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
Having the very best of life: lobster, steak and Perignon
Smoking an ounce of weed and every single day was personal FreakNik
Tricking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception
Looking into your eyes I see your weapon and it’s depressing
They're digging up in your thighs, leaving deposits
Keeping your closets open, knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds
Steadily calling me Antwan
‘Cause you thinking that you my lady
Bitch, don’t play me 'cause you’re janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie, we got danky
So thank thee, for running that Southerplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame
A nigga don’t even know your name, it’s a shame
You cracking ‘em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up
I’m leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don’t get me
See, I gotta be feeding my daughter
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
‘Cause she’ll be Waiting to Exhale
While you other hoes be Dumb and Dumber

[Chorus: Babyface]
Jazzy Belle
If you really want to be my star
Maybe we can mend a broken heart
Jazzy Belle
If you really want to be my boo
Straighten up your shit
I’ll be with you

[Verse 3: André 3000]
See me and ol' girl in the black on black 'Lac Northstar
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga, guaranteed to snap like bra
Straps, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog-eat-dog world
Kitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to earl
‘Cause most of the girls that we was liking in high school
Now they dyking
Nasty bitch

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Having no mercy for the disrespect-ful ones, some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be, asking me all about mine
How she doing, how she be
I know she’s sipping that wine
Behind my back they squawk like vultures
Off and On like Trends of Cultures, baby
Hey he, faking it like these sculptured nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer
‘Cause they burning anyway, Big Boi use her and abuse her

[Chorus: Babyface]
Jazzy Belle
If you really want to be my star
Maybe we can mend a broken heart
Jazzy Belle
If you really want to be my boo
Straighten up your shit
I’ll be with you
Jazzy Belle
If you really want to be my star
Maybe we can mend a broken heart
Jazzy Belle
If you really want to be my boo
Straighten up your shit
I’ll be with you

[Verse 1]
Melanie
Looks a lot like Stephanie
She looks a lot like Jane
Who looks a lot like Amy
Who looks a lot like Emily

Melanie
I wonder what she's tellin' me now
How she's twenty grand in debt, or someone famous that she slept with
Or how everybody loves her, what drugs she doesn't take, but
I don't really know why I talk to her
I guess 'cause she has big fat eyes
Swallows awkward silences so you don't even have to try
Besides, she never really talks to you
She's always looking 'cross the room
At someone who just came inside

[Chorus]
Melanie
How the hell'd she get to be the way that she is?
How could anyone ever say they really loved her?
I feel sorry for her unborn kids

[Verse 2]
Melanie
She looks so heavenly, she's nature's great creation
She better be
She has no female friends, and she's not much for conversation

Melanie
Are you really as mentally as dead as you seem?
I wanna rip you apart at the seams
Just to know what's inside but I'm afraid of what I'll see
I know I know I know I know she'll be in the front row at the show
She used to date someone in the band
She drinks until she can hardly stand
Some sucker holds her hand
While she throws up in the van

[Chorus]
Melanie
How the hell'd she get to be the way that she is?
How could anyone ever say they really loved her?
I feel sorry for her unborn kids

Melanie
Looks a lot like Bethany
She looks a lot like Tiffany
She looks a lot like Natalie

[Bridge]
They ought to put you away
'Cause you're too good-looking
They ought to put you in chains
Before you get your hooks in
They ought to smack you around, they ought to cut off your tongue
They ought to shave off your eyebrows, send you to a nun
They ought to get you a job 'cause you have too much fun
They ought to carve you in marble, sell you by the ton, oh

[Outro]
Melanie
Melanie
Melanie
Melanie
Woo!
Ahhhhh

[Verse 1]
I could tell myself that I'm just like you
That I understand love, but it's just not true
Cause you're always on my mind
And I could talk a girl right out of her clothes
I could talk myself into kissing your ghost
But you're always on my mind

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna miss you
No, I really don't wanna miss you
And I don't wanna miss you
If I could be with you

[Verse 2]
Well I got a lot of problems but it's no big deal
Psychoanalytic literature explains all that I feel
Why you're always on my mind
And I'd walk by myself on Cemetery Hill
And I played a little game called "Which plot should I fill?"
Cause you're always on my mind

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna miss you
No, I really don't wanna miss you
And I d-d-don't wanna miss you
If I could be with you
And I don't wanna miss you
No, I really don't wanna miss you
And I don't wanna miss you
If I could be with you

[Verse 1]
I would run a marathon
To make it all up to you
And I was wrong
Yeah, I was dumb
I can tell my body's numb

[Pre-Chorus]
But for the best
It’s time I surrender the past
There’s no defeat
A blistered heart does not bleed

[Chorus]
I fought so long
I tried to catch up to your heart
I'm left for dust
Forgive me for running from us
And now I feel
Trying to capture all I need
A marathon
When I’m with you I’ve already won

[Verse 2]
I give my, my finish line
I am gonna make you mine
So ready for, to ruin my life
Pray you won’t let me die

[Pre-Chorus]
But for the best
It’s time I surrender the past
There’s no defeat
A blistered heart does not bleed

[Chorus]
I fought so long
I tried to catch up to your heart
I'm left for dust
Forgive me for running from us
And now I feel
Trying to capture all I need
A marathon
When I’m with you I’ve already won

Pussy juice on my beard, James Harden

Why they crucify Cosby? (Yeah)
Why they scrutinize my peeps? (Yeah)

Why they keep fuckin' with Yasiin?
Why they break all of our leaders? (Yeah)
To make us all nonbelievers? (Uh)
To make us all nonbelievers? (Uh)
This ain't all for no reason (Yeah)

Hood Pope, I'm the new Jesus (Right)

Hood Pope, I'm the new Jesus

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Okay
I tell a bitch quit playing
Stick to the plan (Uh)
Then I take you out the dirt and turn it into sand
Just trust in what I'm saying (And quit)
Quit asking what's gotten into me
You don't need a nigga with them tender tendencies
I think you need a lil' more Hennessy
Fuck your man, I'll be your sensei
I could teach you how to keep the rent paid
Got the schedule boomin', I mean poppin'
Poppin' to the point the phone die in mid-day (Brrt)
But I call you late night just to fall through
Bust a nut and then regret it like a nigga always do
But don't I always hit you with the hit back
And if I ever fucked another bitch I pretended it was you
I admit that, not saying that I did that
Chill, chill, chill, take it easy, Yeezy, don't be going all Kill Bill
Show respect to the whole squad and Yeezy Yeezy
I'ma give you everything you fucking needed

[Outro: Big Sean]
Believe it
Straight up
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Refrain]
I wanna dance
With you all night
When it's dark
Until it is bright
They're playin' the music that we love
Just can't get enough of you, you, you

[Refrain]
I wanna dance
With you all night
When it's dark
Until it is bright
They're playin' the music that we love
Just can't get enough of you, you, you

[Snippet]

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
This club is too packed
I love it
Bitch telling on me, that's too whack
I don't love it
This club is too packed
I love it
Bitch telling on me, that's too whack
I love it

[Verse: Pusha T]
Section full of drug dealers

[Verse 1]
Allison, put down your sword
Give up what you're fighting for
'Cause he's been waiting at the shore
His feet are in the water
He's waiting for an answer
Of your boat in the water
But you're not on the sea

[Verse 2]
Allison, I'll tell you something
You just broke this child's heart
'Cause he won't ever see those dreams
I'm waiting at the subway
Waiting for the next train
'Cause you're not on the next train
You're waiting for your own
You've been waiting for your own
You've been waiting for your own
You've been waiting for your own
You've been waiting for your own

[Verse 1]
So sweet when you wanna be
But you don't really care about me
If you did you would let me breathe
But you don't even try
Not the girl that you thought I'd be
My make up stains on your white tees
Bite my nails 'til my fingers bleed
And I can't always hide

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel stupid now
Keeping you around
And you don't know me now
I think you don't know how

[Chorus]
You made your love like a forest fire
I wanted someone to keep me warm
You were the difference after a while
I'm sick of living in the eye of the storm
I want the feeling of being admired
You only taught me to be out worn
This ain't the love that I had desired
I'm sick of living in your eyes

[Verse 2]
So sweet when you wanna be
I almost thought you cared 'bout me
But you got off when you watched me sink
Drowning in a lie
And you remind me of my dad
He'd throw me straws that break my back
You know just how to make me mad
It's almost like you try

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm just sick and tired
Of feeling undesired
Cause you don't love me now
I think you don't know how

[Chorus]
You made your love like a forest fire
I wanted someone to keep me warm
You were the difference after a while
I'm sick of living in the eye of the storm
I want the feeling of being admired
You only taught me to be out worn
This ain't the love that I had desired
I'm sick of living in your eyes

[Video Intro: Ameer Vann & Robert Ontenient]
I could be here all day. You're gonna tell me what I need to know. You're gonna tell me! Are you gonna tell me? C'mon, spit it out...
Me Ilamo Roberto, y este es el camino al éxito.

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Matt Champion]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
My daddy taught me how to sell dope
Turn grams into elbows
Light it up when the L rolled
Black mask, used to kick doors
Wasn't no bullets in the guns though
Niggas still never argued
Raid the house like the task force
Me and my niggas like drug dogs
Find the dope then we take off
Fuck my girl with my chain on
Then she tatted my name on it
Yellowstone, I was raised on it
Actavis in my baby bottle
Baby stroller was an Impala
Niggas like to talk down on me
When I see 'em, I don't hear about it

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Matt Champion]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
(Merlyn! Merlyn!)
Never would've met my friends if not for satellites
Yeah, I'll cuff her even if she do not suck me right (suck me, suck me!)
Always planned to be a rapper when I failed at life
Luckily professor failed me at the proper time (yee! yee!)
Shh-shh, shh, I say "please" all the time, bitch
Shh-shh, shh, I like white collar crime, bitch
Shh-shh, shh, money digital broke and
Shh-shh, shh, Ghana prince in your messages

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I know you hate me for leavin'
Then let's go crazy together
When I tell ya all the things that I'm thinking
Just so that we could get better
But you wanna put my heart on the stretcher
I don't got insurance for this pressure
Wanna find the benefits, I can't measure
Trying not to run out on my temper
I can see the ash and the ember
That was made from emotional texture
I don't know why I took this endeavor
Don't identify with oppressors
Don't identify with surrender
All of my old friends fair-weather
Gotta treat my heart like a treasure
'Cause all I know is no one else will

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Matt Champion]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?

[Verse 4: Joba]
You do not know me, don't speak of my homies, you are a phony
Quit pinnin' shit on me, you gon' bring out the old me
You don't wanna know what I wanna do when y'all talk down on my name
I don't wanna see you in the street 'cause I might catch a case
People smile when they face to face (woo, woo, woo!)
Then turn their back and switch up words you say (ah, ah, ah!)
Running to the papers everyday (woo, woo, woo!)
I'm running to the paper anyway (ah, ah, ah!)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Matt Champion]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?

But hey now, you know girl

But I will take my chances

Oh we don't need no wings to fly
Just take, my hand

[Verse 1]
I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful

I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will

[Verse 2]
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful

I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will

[Intro: Turntan]
If you wanna ride, you can come out and see me
I could be home by now
If you wanna ride, you can come out and see me
I could be home by now

[Verse 1: Turntan]
When the whistle blows
And we pull out slow
This is where I build my home
And I wait for you so patiently
Letting you find your own

[Chorus: Turntan, Turntan & Stitches]
If you wanna try, you can come out and see me
I could be home by now
But anywhere I am, tell me you're waiting for me
I could be home by now

If you wanna try, you can come out and see me
I could be home by now
If you wanna try, you can come out and see me
I could be home by now

[Verse 2]
I'll remember long drives, sitting in the back
Looking out at endless snow, waiting in the silence
If you won't spill your heart, I'll chase you for the words you owe

[Outro: Turntan & Stitches]
And you know and you know and they're begging "come home"
And you know and you know and they're begging "come home"
And you know and you know and they're begging "come home"
And you know and you know and they're begging "come home"
And you know and you know and they're begging "come home"
And you know and you know and they're begging "come home"
And you know and you know and they're begging "come home"

[Verse 1]
Night loots us of our time
Hints of defeat through me
Yielding to one final pun
And shared flashing glaze

[Chorus]
But our will stays cloaked
As we take a step back
Our hearts talking low
A fading Morse code

[Chorus]
But our will stays cloaked
As we take a step back
Our hearts talking low
A fading Morse code

[Verse 2]
"Quick!", says a darting bird
Fierce is nature’s way
Trophies bared up high
Strong men do have firm grips

[Verse 3]
And though I seize the high-prized advise
Distracted by labor and wraiths
I just can’t set my mind with it
Keeping me away from heap

[Chorus]
And our will stays cloaked
As we take a step back
Our hearts talking low
A fading Morse code

[Chorus]
And our will stays cloaked
As we take a step back
Our hearts talking low
A fading Morse code

[Verse 1]
In need of some time out
A haven for insight
Mind a self-aware thought
In dread cabalist night

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear a standing rumble
In expansion and contraction
Our mutual awe is subtle
Delicate in higher action

[Chorus]
Relax
Are those thoughts sincere?
I Relax
My inner tone is clear
Relax
Are those thoughts sincere?
I Relax
Rare witness of my sphere

[Verse 2]
Loves I found delightful
Poised in any likely way
Pulses I know are joyful
They never caused dismay

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear a standing rumble
In expansion and contraction
Our mutual awe is subtle
Delicate in higher action

[Chorus]
Relax
Are those thoughts sincere?
I Relax
My inner tone is clear
Relax
Are those thoughts sincere?
I Relax
Rare witness of my sphere

[Verse 1]
A trail looks even
Rising with ease
And it's gradually stretching
In fair daylight view

[Chorus]
As cool winds
Bare my vague thoughts,
A quiet journey
I embrace again,
Oh I embrace again

[Verse 2]
Slowed my pace down
(Somatic burden)
I see a wide sphere
A table I thought

[Verse 3]
Things now look idle
Leaving reserved
Sparsely aware
Of this new lapse

[Chorus]
As cool winds
Bare my vague thoughts,
A quiet journey
I embrace again,
Oh I embrace again

[Chorus]
As cool winds
Bare my vague thoughts,
A quiet journey
I embrace again,
Oh I embrace again

[Verse 1]
Easy and composed
Retired in some place
Containing its mood
From urging its pace

[Verse 2]
Shoulders and neck
Are much more at rest
When numbers are small
And grasp you, I shall

[Chorus]
And then
I breathe
Intone
And I rest…
Alone,
I breathe
Intone
And I rest…

[Chorus]
And then
I breathe
Intone
And I rest…
Alone,
I breathe
Intone
And I rest…

[Verse 3]
Fingers clap. Snap!
Was it my turn,
Add my tepid talk
To the rowdy flock?

[Verse 4]
I care only to loose
Myself in reserve
If waves around clash
I leave in mild thoughts

[Chorus]
And then
I breathe
Intone
And I rest…
Alone,
I breathe
Intone
And I rest…

[Chorus]
And then
I breathe
Intone
And I rest…
Alone,
I breathe
Intone
And I rest…

[Verse 1]
Glass too thick couldn’t see through,
I’ve been waiting something new
But it felt true
My heart is true

[Verse 2]
Curious fish sought distant light;
Shiny trophies caught its sight
I fell to love
I’m fond of love

[Verse 3]
As if limestone wore my heed,
It seemed fair to trust this lead
But it felt true
My heart is true

[Verse 4]
Blushing means I know too well
Fish meets light from its lone shell
I fell to love
I’m fond of love

[Verse 1]
You’ve seen all my mistakes
And I know you're there, I’ve seen you
You left blood on your face
I know, It’s over now

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I try to fix myself by drinking more
By smoking good, but paranoia
Just give me substance, that'll fix me good
Fix me good
I know that you’re there, I know that you’re there
I know that you’re there, I know that you’re there

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Bridge]
Just fix me good (fix me good)
Just fix me good (fix me good)

[Instrumental Chorus + Outro]
Fix me good in the morning
Fix me good in the evening
Fix me good in the morning when I wake up
Fix me good in the evening before I sleep

[Verse 1]
Remember the time
When everything was yours and mine?
Oh yes, those were the days
The flowers bloom, even at dawn
And all around you
Oh yes, those were the days

[Saxophone Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You stayed around
Growing with me inside of the snow
Your voice gave me the light
It was so cold in the house, when It seeks me
You kept me warm under the trees
Oh yes, those were the days

[Saxophone Chorus & Outro]

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
No limit in the sky
That I won't fly for ya
No amount of tears in my eyes
That I won't cry for ya, oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There's no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When it comes to you
There's no crime
Let's take both of our souls
And intertwine
When it comes to you
Don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
Comes to you

[Break: R3HAB]

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Cupid ain't a lie
Arrow got your name on it, oh yeah
Don't miss out on a love
And regret yourself on it, oh
Open up your mind, clear your head
Ain't gotta wake up to an empty bed
Share my life, it's yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, oh

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When it comes to you
There's no crime
Let's take both of our souls
And intertwine
When it comes to you
Don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
Comes to you

[Break: R3HAB]
Lyrics From Snippet

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]

[?]
Trappin', flippin', stackin' like some Legos, hell yeah
And my bitch she bad, she came from Turks and Caicos, hell nah
And my brother pour a 4 up in a Faygo, hell yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Fuck all that Twitter talk

[?]

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]

[?]
Trappin', flippin', stackin' like some Legos, hell yeah
And my bitch she bad, she came from Turks and Caicos, hell nah
And my brother pour a 4 up in a Faygo, hell yeah

[Verse 2: Ski Mask The Slump God]
My diamonds are so pink just like a pimple
You sensitive like a nipple
Just like Elmo make me giggle
Ha, haha haha
Hold my diamond hold my water 

[?]

[?] L'Eggo, just a Eggo

[?] on yo' lawn, like manure, I am the shit you know
Ayy, lean in the Faygo
She want some dick from 

[?]
Tell 'em shout-out my mucus, a slimy motherfucker

[?] and no I am not Chris Tucker
People choose not to like me 'cause I'm a motherfucker

[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Oh, they say people come, say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial
And I should, but I can’t let you go

[Chorus 1: Chris Martin]
But when I’m cold, cold
Yeah, when I’m cold, cold
There’s a light that you give me when I’m in shadow
There’s a feelin' within me, everglow

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
Ye' we swore on that night we’d be friends 'til we die
But the changin' of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the fallin' of snow
And I’m gonna miss you, I know

[Chorus 2: Chris Martin]
But when I’m cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know you’re always with me and the way you will show
And you’re with me wherever I go
And you give me this feelin', this everglow

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feelin', this everglow

[Outro: Chris Martin]
So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow

[Piano Outro]

[Spoken-Word Outro: Muhammad Ali]
God is watching me
God is- God don't praise me because I beat Joe Frazier
God don't give nothin' about Joe Frazier
God don't care nothin' about England or America as far as real wealth… it's all His
He wants to know how do we treat each other?
How do we help each other?
So, I'm gon' dedicate my life to usin' my name and popularity to helpin' charities, helpin' people, unitin' people
People bombin' each other because of religious beliefs
We need somebody in the world to help us all make peace
So when I die – if there's a heaven – I'm gonna see it
I knew when I laid my eyes on you
The lights from above seemed to shine on only you
And you made me feel like I was flying
When I made you sparkle in your eyes
We ain't even 20 baby
I ain't learned to love you right, yeah
Umm, good thing I thought I was the shit back then
I sang in your ear 'cause I wanted you to know
That I had soul baby
I called you all the time
I guess I tried too hard to make you mine
You'd have nothing to do with me baby
Thank God that you changed your mind

For the rest of my life you know I'm gonna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine
Finally convinced you to come over and just say hi
I say forever my lady
And kissed you for the very first time
After months, holidays, holding hands in the park
Normally I'll just play basketball
With someone in the park
And I messed up like boys tend to do
It'd be a year till I got back with you
Thank God that you called me back baby
'Cause I'd never be the man that I am today

For the rest of my life you know I'm gonna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine

Then one night upon the phone
You said you were at home alone
I wasn't even old enough to drive
I saw my only chance just to keep it alive
Keep love alive
Good thing for you I stole my daddy's car
'Cause no one's ever gonna love you back
Better than I do
For the rest of my life you know I'm gonna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine

I'm gon' love you baby
Gon' love you baby
Gon' love you right, for the rest of my life
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine

[Verse 1]
Feels like I've been waiting so long for tonight
'Cause I just can't get you out of my mind
Can you feel my heart's beating so fast?
Now you're here, know there's no turning back

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I think I'm falling
Can't hold on no more
Enough is enough
Enough is enough
Just gotta let go
And as my grip unwinds
I feel your hand in mine
No, I've never felt, never felt like this before

[Chorus]
Come on babe, don't give up on us (don't give up on us)
Choose me and I'll show you love (and I'll show you love)

If you're lost, I'll be there shining my light
'Cause every touch lifts me up to the stars
'Cause nothing could ever keep us apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I think I'm falling
Can't hold on no more
Enough is enough
Enough is enough
Just gotta let go
And as my grip unwinds
I feel your hand in mine
No, I've never felt, never felt like this before

[Verse 1]
When we realise we are only to die then we're out of here
We're just skirting on the surface
We have only to click our fingers and we disappear
We're just skirting on the surface

[Chorus]
Dull eyes trying to pull you through the ice
Being drawn to the ledge
When we realise that once we're broke then nothing mends
We're just skirting on the surface

[Verse 2]
When we realise we're only held in suspension
Till someone comes along and shakes us
And as the pattern lines cross their fingers like a web
Will we die upon the surface

[Chorus]
Dull eyes trying to pull you through the ice
Being drawn to the ledge
When we realise that once we're broke then nothing mends
We're just skirting on the surface

[Intro: Lil Yachty]

Sound of the craftmatic seat
When I lean in the panoramic coupe
Uh, burp
Niggas feel a little bit gassy
Stomach on knot knot
Sippin' on Wock Wock
Rollie on a nigga don't tick-tock
I smell Fugazi coming from your wristwatch, ayeee
Niggas mad, bitch I'm glad like a bag, thirty-thousand

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat
Straight in your face

[Verse 1]
It's you and your world and I'm caught in the middle
I caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can't be your friend
It's my head or my heart, and I'm caught in the middle

[Pre-Chorus]
My hands are tied, but not tied enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

[Chorus]
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
Let's be lonely together

[Verse 2]
Eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time
Before the rush to my blood was too much and we flatlined
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends
Now I'm all messed up and it feels like the first time

[Chorus]
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
Let's be lonely together
Let's be lonely together

[Pre-Chorus]
My hands are tied, but not tied enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

[Chorus]
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
Let's be lonely together
Let's be lonely together
When your problem seems
More than you can bear
You just call on him
And he'll be right there
Hold onto God's hand
Doing the best you can
With happiness that leads
To the promised land
They can't bring you down
From this higher ground
Well happiness it leads
To safe, sound, found
I cried many tears
Through years and years and years
If you just stand still
He'll fight your fears
Jesus is my all
He's my all 'n all
He will hear my call
And never ever let me fall
Jesus is my all
He's my all 'n all
He will hear my call
And never ever let me fall
I feel so good
Won't you clap your hands

Father bless the one
For try and make me cry
Cause the hallowed peace are theirs
Wed deep down inside
They can't bring you down
From your higher ground
Well happiness that leads
To your safe, sound, and saved
I cried some tears
Through years and years and years
If you just stand still
He'll fight your fears
Oh God almighty
Send a helping hand
See I'm trying to do
Do the best I can
If you let me I will
Climb the highest hill
While I sing this song
That gives my heart a chill
I'm gonna fight on
For the life on high
Jesus is my all
He's my all 'n all
He will hear my call
And never ever let me fall
Jesus is my all
He's my all 'n all
He will hear my call
And never ever let me fall

[Verse 1]
What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn 'round quick and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh, no! Oh!

[Verse 2]
Big black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh, God, please, help me! Oh, no! No!

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Child cries out for its mother
Mother's screaming in the fire
Satan points at me again
Opens the door to push me in
Oh no! Oh, God!

[Outro]
Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please God, no!

[Verse 1]
Turn off all the lights and I can see you in the dark
Maybe not with eyes but I can sense you with my heart
The fact that they don't understand us is my favorite part
I hope the world can hear me when I say

[Chorus]
You just gotta kiss somebody, just kiss somebody
Kiss somebody, just kiss somebody, babe
Accept your obsessions and learn all the lessons of your heart
You just gotta kiss somebody, just kiss somebody
Kiss somebody, just kiss somebody
Turn your aggression into a blessing, play your part, yeah

[Verse 2]
I don't, I don't ever have to know what lonely is
Baby, baby, I remember when you told me this
Told me, told me that you love me and you showed me it
They won't ever, ever know it

[Chorus]
Only if you kiss somebody, just kiss somebody
Kiss somebody, just kiss somebody
Kiss somebody, just kiss somebody
Kiss somebody, babe, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
No limit in the sky
That I won't fly for ya
No amount of tears in my eyes
That I won't cry for ya, oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There's no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When it comes to you
There's no crime
Let's take both of our souls
And intertwine
When it comes to you
Don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
Comes to you

[Drop: FRNDS]

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Cupid ain't a lie
Arrow got your name on it, oh yeah
Don't miss out on a love
And regret yourself on it, oh
Open up your mind, clear your head
Ain't gotta wake up to an empty bed
Share my life, it's yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, oh

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When it comes to you
There's no crime
Let's take both of our souls
And intertwine
When it comes to you
Don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
Comes to you

[Drop: FRNDS]

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When it comes to you
There's no crime
Let's take both of our souls
And intertwine
When it comes to you
Don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
Comes to you

[Verse 1]
See my face on your TV screen
Boom boom just like TNT
We glide right past security
Car bomb poppin' in your wet daydream
I don't wear leather, I wear C4
Hand on the trigger, blowing off the doors
Candy taste like electrolytes
With a petrol fetish and a match to light

[Pre-Chorus]
Just hold me like your hand grenade
The clock is ticking, no time for games
Will you just push the button and flick the switch?
'Cause playing with fire can be dangerous

[Chorus]
I'm just like dynamite, I'll blow you up sky high
I'm just like dynamite, I'll set the night on fire
I'm just like dynamite, show stops when I gotta blow up
Come on catch my gold burst
I'm just like dynamite

[Post-Chorus]
Fire cracker, fire cracker, bing bang boom
I'm TNT, dynamite, light my fuse

[Verse 2]
See my face in the magazine
Know me as the bomb machine
Big reward if you catch me
Blowin' up faster than the NYC
I don't eat snacks, I eat gun powder
Lazer blastin', gettin' louder
Try and get me if you can
But my bombs go boom, bigger than Japan

[Pre-Chorus]
Just hold me like your hand grenade
The clock is ticking, no time for games
Will you just push the button and flick the switch?
'Cause playing with fire can be dangerous

[Chorus]
I'm just like dynamite, I'll blow you up sky high
I'm just like dynamite, I'll set the night on fire
I'm just like dynamite, show stops when I gotta blow up
Come on catch my gold burst
I'm just like dynamite

[Bridge]
My lipstick is ballistic
I'm blowin' up your mind
My kisses are death wishes
I'm lightin' up the sky

[Chorus]
I'm just like dynamite, I'll blow you up sky high
I'm just like dynamite, I'll set the night on fire
I'm just like dynamite, show stops when I gotta blow up
Come on catch my gold burst
I'm just like dynamite

[Chorus]
I'm just like dynamite, I'll blow you up sky high
I'm just like dynamite, I'll set the night on fire
I'm just like dynamite, show stops when I gotta blow up
Come on catch my gold burst
I'm just like dynamite

[Post-Chorus]
Fire cracker, fire cracker, bing bang boom
I'm TNT, dynamite, light my fuse
Fire cracker, fire cracker, bing bang boom
I'm TNT, dynamite, light my fuse

[Verse 1]
Everybody's watching me, watching you
But this ain't gonna go the way I want it to
I've played this night a thousand times in my dreams
But standing here in front of you
I can't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't need to admit this to know that it's true
There's fire in your eyes and I'm blinded by you
I'm searching for something better to say
I wanna be gold but you turn me to grey

[Chorus]
And all that fire it burns right through
And I can't fight it, I'm losing my cool
And all that glitter, like wasted jewels
It all falls down because I'm losing my cool
I'm losing my cool, losing my cool
Losing my cool, losing my cool

[Verse 2]
Standing on the dark side of the dance floor
Trying to find protection from your smile
My heart is like a drum beat in the jungle
It's running with the tigers, running wild

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm back in the corner, I'm covered with lies
I'm praying for water to put out the fires
And my imagination is burning away
I wanna be gold but you turn me to grey

[Chorus]
And all that fire it burns right through
And I can't fight it, I'm losing my cool
And all that glitter, like wasted jewels
It all falls down because I'm losing my cool
It's too late, yeah, the rest is truth
I know this time, I'm, I'm losing my cool
My heart's unfrozen, the ice runs through
And I can't stop myself, I'm losing my cool

[Bridge: Spoken]
My heart starts to beat faster
As I see you move towards me
I think, "This is it, what will you say?"
But you walk straight past me
Into the arms of somebody else
And I'm left alone, again

[Chorus]
And all that fire it burns right through
And I can't fight it, I'm losing my cool
And all that glitter, like wasted jewels
It all falls down because I'm losing my cool
It's too late, yeah, the rest is truth
I know this time, I'm, I'm losing my cool
My heart's unfrozen, the ice runs through
And I can't stop myself, I'm losing my cool
Losing my cool, I'm losing my cool
Losing my cool

[Verse 1]
Locked away but not today
We're out to play tonight
The dark starts, they always high
But we're alive tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
So come on baby, come on dive in

[Chorus]
We'll go dancin' in the breeze
We're dancin' in the breeze
Magic flowin' through my hair, my hair
We'll go burnin' through the skies
We're burnin' through the sky
Colors burstin' everywhere
You know that we're just like
Tulips in the fields
Tulips in the fields
We're just like
Tulips in the fields
Like tulips in the fields

[Verse 2]
Watch my face, we'll change the pace
We're here to stay tonight
Now stars rely when we arrive
We're so alive tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
So come on baby, come on dive in

[Chorus]
We'll go dancin' in the breeze
We're dancin' in the breeze
Magic flowin' through my hair, my hair
We'll go burnin' through the skies
We're burnin' through the sky
Colors burstin' everywhere
You know that we're just like
Tulips in the fields
Tulips in the fields
We're just like
Tulips in the fields
Tulips in the fields

[Bridge]
It's time to stop the clocks and run
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
But the heartbeat still goes on and on
We'll go dancin' in the breeze
We're dancin' in the breeze
Magic flowin' through my hair, my hair

[Chorus]
We'll go dancin' in the breeze
We're dancin' in the breeze
Magic flowin' through my hair, my hair
We'll go burnin' through the skies
We're burnin' through the sky
Colors burstin' everywhere
You know that we're just like
Tulips in the fields
Tulips in the fields
We're just like
Tulips in the fields
Tulips in the fields

[Verse 1]
I know they've got a loose talk 

[?]
Tongues are tied and their lips are all locked
All I've wanted to know is what's on my mind

These beggars run away with it all 

[?]
Stood on top, it was a feeling too tall
All I want is for someone to come on their own

[Chorus]
Don't know who it's gonna be
Don't know who it's gonna be
Don't know who it's gonna be
But sure enough, they're waiting on me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Looked down at the trash on the street
Kicked it round, hopped the bus and took a seat
Headed down to a place I can take my time
I stepped up and I opened that door
No one was round, don't think they live there anymore
All I want is a face I can call my own

[Chorus]
Don't know who it's gonna be
Don't know who it's gonna be
Don't know who it's gonna be
Sure enough, they're waiting on me

[Verse 1]
Just lift me up from here
I said I wonder where I'll go
When I'll leave this crazy place
Where will my soul reside?
And will I find happiness?

[Chorus]
Where will I go?
Just lift me up from here
Where will I go?
Just lift me up from here

[Verse 2]
Just lift me up from here
I said I don't want the day to go
What will tomorrow be
And you shine you light on me
You shine you light on me

[Verse 1]
Just let me out from here
Said I wonder where I'll go
When I'll leave this crazy place
Where will my soul reside?
And will I find happiness?

[Chorus]
Where will I go?
Just lift me up from here
Where will I go?
Just lift me up from here
Where will I go?
Just lift me up from here
Where will I go?
Just lift me up from here
You see it ain't safe pumping weight,  it's trouble
So they gotta turn to muscle,  like they pumpin weights
Cuz it ain't soft in the turnbuckle, you could get jacked like a pumpkin face
Catch a sleepy hollow, or poke ya head pumping weight
'Specially if you woofin- pumping base
Or you doing dirt looking clean
It could jump off like The Ultimate Warrior- what you laying on the floor of the ring
Or catch cage match after report to the bing
See a muscle give a dap to the vice tag-team
If I could never own it- why would I catch a bullet, dye my clothes and die on it
I warn ya, Shorty
It's corny on the corner, I'm saying my piece
Only turn my back on The West when I pray to The East

[My favorite corner]

[Verse 1]
Feels like I just woke up
Like all this time I've been asleep
Even though it's not who I am
I'm not afraid of who I used to be

[Chorus]
No one stays the same (Oh, oh)
You know what goes up must come down (Oh, oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (Oh, oh)
I feel so much younger now (oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Feels like I've been living in a dream
But never make it to the end
My eyes open when they feel the light
It's always right before I'm about to scream

[Chorus]
No one stays the same (Oh, oh)
You know what goes up must come down (Oh, oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (Oh, oh)
I feel so much younger now (Oh, oh)

[Bridge]
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down (Yeah)

[Chorus]
No one stays the same (Oh, oh)
You know what goes comes back around (Oh, oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (Oh, oh)
I feel so much younger now (Oh, oh)

[Outro]
I feel so much younger now (Yeah)
I feel so much younger now

[Verse 1]
I've got your money
You're dead and gone
You think it's funny

[?] lasts too long
No I don't care
We'll do it anywhere
Life's just a moment passin' by

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Your nose is running
What was dead and gone
But it ain't funny
I'll keep laughin' on
Cause I don't care
We'll do it anywhere
Life's just a moment, then it's gone

Ooohh ahhh ahhhh
Ooohh ahhh ahhhh
Ooohh ahhh ahhhh
Ooohh ahhh ahhhh

[Verse 3]
You've got no money
It's spent and gone
You think it's funny

Cause we don't care, yeah
We'll do it anywhere
Life's just a moment bleedin' out

Verse 1:
You was just crackin' the surface
I stepped it up
I am sapphire crystal
All your scratchin' is worthless
I live it up
While you was rappin' your verses
I was in the back buyin' straps wrapped in them verses
I leveled up
Cause y'all don't carry biscuits like churches
Just row
Homie the bricks so Sony
Colombian D it's money to me
You one day later I'm Sunday paper, how funny is he?
From Chicago
Hungry and

Keep his hand in his waist
Al Bundy is me

Every two bars is like a hunnid' grand (Cool)

[?] hand (Huge)
Gunnin' hand
Y'all bustas (Who)
Wanna ram and I question mark
Who's upperhand?
Stay in your motherland
Might lose your dome if you come outside your zone
Like runnin' man (Run it man)
Chorus:
You don't know what you got yourself into!
Nooooo No!
And you don't know what that boy done been through!
Nooooo No!

Bright bright land
Got my right hand lookin' like Ice man

Verse 3:
Yeah I know my worth niggas
How I work niggas
In the underground like earth ninjas
Now it's pro
I get the dough like lurch niggas
First in fifteens
First figure for might hurt niggas (Yo)
Call polices
I increase it till' I lose leases
Had to sleep in the park
Lose used blues speakers a part
You get the piece
Not two fingers apart
If I release prepare to lose pieces and parts
And nephews, nieces and aunts
The boy speaks it
With the flus fevers and coughs
There's no teas
Or remedies
To ease
The injuries
Within this entity
I'm lost
I never play with you sorta thugs
I just chuck em' like pay to the order of

Dreaming of enhanced feelings
Words with no loss of meaning
Known limits shall give away
Fresh apples that won’t decay
Breathing craft and will

Sun pursues eternal extols
Rotating spheres, shifting poles
Deposed kings and queens
Against new competing machines
Standing marveled… in awe

Massive tides carefully smooth domain(s)
Nature reveals itself to mankind again
Cirrhosis removed from patient men
Who dare… come back flesh and bone
To reclaim the world as their own
All lives, all lives you say
I can see you are afraid
Your skin is so thin
Your heart has escaped
All lives, all lives you say

You were born at the end of a noose
What was up came down with your blues
But you don't know how to sing anything anyway
So all lives, all lives you say

My mind, my mind is gone
It's too hard for me to know when I'm wrong
This is the last dying gasp of a deadly lung
Turning blue on a lawn in the sun

[Video Intro: Robert Ontenient]
Me Ilamo Roberto y estamos buscando a Jaden Smith

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick, and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap, and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay; why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub' deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund a business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know, like, closet niggas, masc-type?
"Why don't you take that mask off?" That's the thought I had last night
"Why you always rap about bein' gay?"
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay
Where I come from, niggas get called "faggot" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my head off, and
And my legs off, and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head gone, yeah

[Bridge: Ameer Vann]
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crackin’ sounds
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crackin’ sounds
Break, break, break the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crack, crack, crack
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crack

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I don't trust nobody 'cause they don't deserve it
Niggas run in your house, they know you doin' dirty
(Go 'head, now)
I got my hand on an ounce, and I got money servin'
I just bought me a fifth and now I'm speedin', swervin'
(Go 'head, now)
I took an eighth of them shrooms, and now I'm hearin' voices
I took like two of them pills, I can't remember nothing
(Go 'head, now)
I ain't under control, I'm losin' motor function
I need an intervention, I need an exorcism
I need a therapist, paranoia and drug addiction
It's very scary, my momma don't even recognize me
I'm goin' crazy, don't need nobody to say they love me
My acts of desperation, I'm on an empty stomach
So fuck the consequences, I ain't runnin' from them

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Feelin' like a goner, put my life in locker
Hotbox in the Hummer
Hot bars in the summer (Merlyn, Merlyn!)
If I had the option, I would do it all again
If I had the option, I would do it all again
I just wanna feel like I did the right program
I just want to appeal to my dad and my cousins (Again)
When I cut the veil, I do not think 'bout diplomas
Love is knowin' that you didn’t do it by your lonesome
So I forgive my mommy, daddy, auntie, and my uncles
For guilt-tripping feelings whenever they call my number
They see men dream, they see men fallin'
But when I dream, I'm smashing on a Lana

[Bridge: Matt Champion & Joba]
Both pessimistic, drug addicted, caught in our feelings
We spit venom then stare at the ceiling, wondering, "why?"
My mom's no alcoholic, she just wanna drown her sorrows
Love her to death and soon enough, I'll give back all I borrowed
Both so submissive, take turns dominating, the light has been faded
This hate-fueled love, we don't fake it, no givin', just takin'

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
I took some steps to be a bigger person
I should've thrown ya off the highway, the cars swerving
Ain't no burden, ain't no sermon, ain't no motherfuckin' plaque
I hate these hospitals and police and the smell of death—all that
I hate these shady folk that want it ladylike
But don't treat lady right, but they be sayin', like ("Just the tip!")
And yeah, you mad 'cause she ain't fuck, mad 'cause she ain't suck
Beat your ass before you got time to say "Why not?"
Here to catch you slip up, wish you could just rewind
Timing all fucked up, thought you had just lucked up
Where the respect? Is your ass human?
I look you in your eyes, say, "Fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?"
Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boy
I get my 9-9, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off
Better hope my aim off, better hope the range off
Better hope my tame off before I blow your brains off, boy

[Outro: Dom McLennon]
Ugh, no hands with the stunts
Jump off the roof like I do what I want
All of my life in my past wanna haunt
And my sight of the future beginning to taunt my ambition
Man on the moon, I'm marooned, I ain't trippin', I'm on a mission
Every time that I speak, they ain't skippin'
Turned my inspiration to a vision, that's a given, no slippin'
Gonna get in the car
Drive away
Drive so fast
No one's gonna find me
Put my foot on the gas
Accelerate
Drive so fast
And no one's gonna find me, find me, find me

Gonna get in the
Drive away
Drive so fast
And no one's gonna find me
Put my foot on the gas
Accelerate
Drive so fast
And no one's gonna find me, find me, find me, oh, oh

Drive so
Drive so fast
Get in the car
Drive away
Drive so fast
No one's gonna find me
Put my foot on the gas
Accelerate
Drive so

Drive my
Drive so fast
Accelerate

[Chorus]
It's Young Boat, put a nigga in they place
Rich as fuck, out the window, free Tay-K
First show I did I got less than 10K
Saw Tay-K, now he who he is today

[Verse]
All that fake gangbanging get you slayed
Think you hard, you get robbed for your chain
Nigga snatch my chain, that's a man down, mayday
In a race bitch, always first place
Nah for real bitch, first place always
Shout out Diego Money, Mitch, and Lil Jay
SKTDDG, that's always
Free Big Reese, they're tryna give him more days
Never been shot and truthfully I do not want to
If she not fuckin', boy respect that she don't want you
Say fuck the bitch and keep it movin' 'fore it haunt you
Don't fuck many, circle tighter than a bantu, let's get it
Hate these niggas, they fake weird and they fake emo
I'm 'bout my money, give a fuck about your friendzone
These niggas tryna clique it up and run against me
I have respect but now it's nothing else against me
Had that truck buck, I turned it to a tar heel
She ride dick like a bike, wheelie back wheel
They say don't fuck your homie bitch, that's a no-no
I took my old homie bitch and kicked it dolo
Told my nigga's mom I'm sorry, yeah he still broke (bye bye)
But buddy got up in his feelings so it's fuck bro
She pop six, now she ride dick like a Volvo
And snorting way more lines than a barcode
I'm not buckin' but I'm ready with the arsenal
Hit his chest, now his name in an article

[Chorus]
It's Young Boat, put a nigga in they place
Rich as fuck out the window, free Tay-K
First show I did I got less than 10K
Saw Tay-K, now he who he is today
See it in my mother-fuckin' face (Lil' Boat)

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
I felt awesome when you walked in
You caught me doin' something
That I should've never been caught with
I played the forest, my far trip
I tripped and I fell, still think I'm living in Austin
Remember when I was trippin' off some wack shit
When I thought the automatic had an answer?
When I was jammin' out Beyonce like Sampha
And you broke up with me 'cause I'm a Cancer?
Our relationship was toxic, cancer
I fell in love with a dancer in Atlanta
I'm lying, I ain't a Drake-ass nigga
I'm more like Troye Sivan
With a whole lotta mela-nahn
Sendin' bombs to your lawn
Grew up on Rockafella, so I'ma get a chain
And sing every song in the vain of your name
And this'll...

[Outro: bearface]
Be there when they call me up
Save me wishin' for you, I'm missing you too
Miss the way we talk, miss the way we stop
Miss the way we talk, ooh
Be there when they call me up
Save me wishin' for you, I'm missing you too
Miss the way we talk, miss the way we stop
Miss the way we talk, ooh

[Verse 1]
If your baby lives away across town
(Away across town)
And the hustle and bustle of life
Keeps getting you down
(Keeps getting you down)

[Chorus]
Just take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Ahhh take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Yeah no matter what you're doing, yeah yeah
Take some time out for love
Hoo! hoo! hoo! hoo!

[Verse 2]
If your hands are tied
And you just can't get them free (get them free)
'Cause your old folks boss
Won't show you no sympathy (show you no sympathy)

[Chorus]
Just take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Ahhh take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Yeah no matter what you're doing, yeah yeah
Take some time out for love
Hoo! hoo! hoo! hoo!

[Post-Chorus]
Baby I want you
(Take some time out)
Baby I want you
Baby I need you
Hoo! hoo! hoo! hoo!

[Verse 3]
Now you know your baby loves you
You don't have to worry
(You don't have to worry)
Just dial the telephone
And baby come running in a hurry
(Come running in a hurry)

[Chorus]
Just take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Ahhh take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Yeah no matter what you're doing, yeah yeah
Take some time out for love
Hoo! hoo! hoo! hoo!
Just take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Ahhh take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Yeah no matter what you're doing, yeah yeah
Take some time out for love
Hoo! hoo! hoo! hoo!
Just take some time out
(Take some time out baby)

[Chorus]
Well, baby don't you do it, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe
Don't break my heart

[Verse 1]
Well, I sacrifice to make you happy
Kept nothing for myself
Now you wanna leave me
For the love of someone else
My pride is all gone, whether right or wrong
I need you, baby, you'd better keep on keeping on

[Chorus]
But I tried to do my best
Tried and tried to do my best
Baby don't you do it, don't break my heart
Please don't do it baby

[Verse 2]
Well, my biggest mistake was loving you too much
And letting you know
'Cause now you've got me where you want me
And you won't let me go
If my heart was made of glass, then you would surely see
Heartaches and misery you've been causing me
But I tried to do my best
Tried and tried to do my best

[Chorus]
But I tried to do my best
Tried and tried to do my best
Baby don't you do it, don't break my heart
Please don't do it baby

[Outro]
Go down to the river and there I'll be
I'm gonna jump in, baby, if you don't see about me
Open up your eyes; can't you see I love you?
Open up your heart baby; can't you see I need you?
Can't go on without you; I'm no good without you
Life's no good without you, what I'm gonna do without you?
Hey, baby don't do it, oh, don't break my heart
Oh, don't you do it, don't break my heart
Life's no good without you
What I'm gonna do without you?
Can't go on without you
Life's no good without you
Oh, don't do it baby, yeah
Hey, don't you do it

[Verse 1]
A love gone bad is a heartbreaking pain
Like a chilling cold in the midst of spring
That last goodbye brings a flow of tears
Oh, it hurts to lose someone you held dear

[Chorus]
Might as well kiss love goodbye, dry my eyes
She don't love me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)
She don't need me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)

[Verse 2]
I kissed her cheek, and sadly walked away
The words haunted me every step of the way
Wondering "Can I go on?" without her affections
As I slowly walk in some strange direction

[Chorus]
Wondering "What am I gonna do? Where can I go?"
She don't love me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)
She don't need me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)

[Verse 3]
Simply I ask, give our love another chance
But she said our love is in the past
The words kept ringing in my ear
I cannot believe it, you told me, my dear

[Chorus]
But she turned and slowly walked away, and I could hear her say
There's no love left, now I'm all by myself
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)
There's no love left, now I'm all by myself
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)

[Bridge]
'Cause she don't love me no more
She don't need me no more
Oh, I'm all by myself now
(Bye-bye, baby; baby bye-bye)
She don't love me no more
(Bye-bye, baby; baby, bye-bye)

[Chorus]
I might as well kiss love goodbye, dry my eyes
'Cause she don't love me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)
She don't need me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)

[Outro]
There's no love left, now I'm all by myself
'Cause she don't need me no more
She don't love me no more
(Bye-bye, baby; baby, bye-bye)
She don't need me no more
(Bye-bye, baby; baby, bye-bye)
All by myself now
(Bye-bye, baby; baby, bye-bye)
Calling your name, Peaches
Calling your name, Peaches
In my lonely, lonely room, there's nothing left but the past
I think of how, my love, you speak
And why it didn't last, I think of how sweet all the love was
All the good times we had
I want you to come home, cause I feel so all alone
And I feel so sad
Calling out your name, Peaches
The whispers gettin' louder
Calling your name, Peaches
Don't you hear, Peaches
Don't you hear it, little baby?
Every time I think about you
I can hear you calling my name
And every time I'm all alone
The whispers be come back again
Don't you hear it, Peaches?
Don't you hear it, little baby?
The whispers gettin' louder
Whispers gettin' louder
Calling your name
Hear it baby
Calling to you Peaches
Fades... Louder, baby...

[Verse 1]
Ooh, once more, my love
You say you're sorry you caused me pain
But this time is the last time
You'll never break my heart again

[Chorus]
'Cause it's one too many times
This poor heart of mine has tried
One too many tears
These tired old eyes of mine has cried
One too many heartaches
For this heart of mine
Try your luck again
I'm sorry

[Verse 2]
Time and time again
I tried to believe it could be true
Heartache after heartache
I stood the pain just to be with you

[Chorus]
But it's one too many chances
You only used and pushed aside
One too many lonely, lonely night
I sacrificed my pride
One too many heartaches
For this heart of mine
Try your luck
I can't stand it
I can't take it, no
One, one, one, one, one
Too many heartaches
For this heart of mine
Try your luck again

[Intro]
It's out of the question
It's out of the question

[Verse 1]
Could not be another love as sweet as you
With lips that could kiss mine the way yours do
With a twinkle in her eyes for me alone
Now could I want another for my own?

[Chorus]
It's out of the question
It's out of the question
I couldn't stop loving you, can't be done
The chance of that happening is a million to one

[Verse 2]
Could not be a song with a melody
That's beautiful as your voice sounds to me
Your total quality it can't be beat
Now could a melody be that sweet?

[Chorus]
It's out of the question
It's out of the question
I couldn't stop loving you, can't be done
The chance of that happening is a million to one

[Bridge]
I couldn't do it and I ain't gonna try
That would be a hard task for any guy
(What could I do? All he could do)
Is try to be grateful and always be faithful
(I couldn't stop loving you, can't be done
The chance of that happening is a million to one)

[Verse 3]
Oh, now could there be a vague possibility
That there's greater joy than what you bring to me?
Perhaps there is, but I don't think so
Could I ever, ever let you go?

[Chorus]
It's out of the question
(You better believe it, baby)
It's out of the question
(Don't you know now)
I couldn't stop loving you, can't be done
The chance of that happening is a million to one
(Oh, don't you know now)
It's out of the question
(You better believe it, baby)
It's out of the question
It's out of the question
(No doubt about it)
It's out of the question
(Oh, don't you know now)
It's out of the question
Oh, I'm in bad shape since you've been gone
I lay in bed and cry the whole day long
I can find my mind beginning to crack
I gotta find a way to get you back
I don't want a loneliness to be my destiny
Baby, save me from this misery
Can't sleep, full of thoughts in my head
Feel like I got rocks in my bed

Oh, your lipstick stains on my shirt
Add more pain to my hurt
In a place where deeply, there's no doubt
'Cause it reminds me of a kiss I have to live without

Girl, you gotta have pity on me
Honey, save me from this misery
Oh, I need you so bad
Baby, my heart is 'bout to drive me mad
Oh girl, you gotta (Save me from this misery)
Oh, I need somebody right now (Save me from this misery)
Oh, I'm tired of cryin', tossin' and turnin'
These salty tears keep my eyes burning
Believe me woman, I'm in pitiful shape
Can't take no more hurt, or my heart will surely break
Your love, woman, is the only remedy
Baby, save me from this misery
Oh, I'm hurt so inside me
I need your love, I ain't got no pride

(I'm in misery) Gotta find a way to stop these tears
(Only you can save me girl) Feel like I've been crying for a thousand years
(I'm in misery) Girl I'm so lost without you
(Only you can save me girl) I need you, I need you, I need you, yes I do

[Verse 1]
Oh, seems this world's got you down
You're feeling bad vibrations frown, now
But open your eyes, girl, look at me
I'm gonna show you how it ought to be

[Chorus]
We're gonna have a good thing
Such a good thing, baby

[Verse 2]
And when your world don't just seem right, now
And your life's gettin' you uptight (You uptight)
You can change that wrong for right (wrong to right)
'Cause I was there myself last night (there last night)

[Chorus 2]
We're gonna have a good thing
Such a good thing, baby
I, I, I won't have nobody now
(No one around) To bring you down
Well, it's a groovy world, girl
Let me bring you to a good, good, good, good thing, girl

[Verse 3]
Gotta hear me, you can't beat 'em all, if you try (If you try)
They don't care if you live or die (Live or die)
'Cause they're losers, what a shame (What a shame)
I'm gonna show you to a brand new game (Brand new game)

[Chorus 1]
We're gonna have a good thing
Such a good thing, baby

[Bridge]
I won't tell you no, no lies
When I'm through, you will realize (Realise)
For the first time, it seems right (It seems right)
I'm gonna stay right here tonight (Here tonight)

[Chorus 2]
We're gonna have a good thing
Such a, oh, good thing, baby
No no, no, nobody, no one around, to bring you down
It's a groovy world, girl
Let me bring you to a good, good, good, good thing

[Outro]
(Good thing, baby) Good thing
(Good thing, baby) I don't know what to do here
(Good thing, baby) Hey, good thing
(Good thing, baby) You know I wanna love it
(Good thing, baby) Come on baby, sit down here with me
(Good thing, baby) Get all over me baby, oh baby I love you
(Good thing, baby) Sit down here with me

[Chorus]
I'm catching up on time I've lost
I'm making up all the time I've wasted
I'm catching up on time I've lost
Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted

[Verse 1]
I was dancin' free and having fun
And I really didn't give a care
And you must agree that you might see me
Most any and everywhere

[Refrain]
Once I saw you
(Saw you)
And I met you
(Met you)
Tried to call you
(Call you)
Had to get you
(Get you)

[Chorus]
I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Catching up, baby
(I'm making up all the time I've wasted)
I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Oh, baby
(Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted)

[Verse 2]
I was breaking hearts and taking names
And I wouldn't had stopped at that
But you made me see in spite of me
That that ain't where it's at

[Refrain]
Yes, you saw me
(Saw me)
And you caught me
(Caught me)
Then you fought me
(Fought me)
But you taught me
(Taught me)

[Chorus]
I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Catching up, baby
(I'm making up all the time I've wasted)
I'm catching on up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
(Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted)
Oh, I'm catching up, I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
(Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted)

[Verse 3]
I bet your wondering why I'm hard to find
But 

[?] still exists
To procrastinate is an awful fate
'Cause you never head the list

[Refrain]
What I'm sayin'
(Sayin')
So true
(So true)
I'm not playin'
(Playin')
Girl, I want you
(Want you)

[Chorus]
I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Catching up, baby
(I'm making up all the time I've wasted)
I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Yeah, baby
(Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted)
I'm catching on up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Catching on up, baby
(Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted)
I'm catchin up

[Music Visual Intro Annotation]

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Stripped down to my skin and my bones
I love huskies but I feel like a wolf (Howl!)
In a pack but I feel all alone
I'm scatterbrained man, better offer the Clon'
In Tejas apartments with racists doin' weird shit
Like, this'll make the biopic (Haha!)
Rile 'em up, hit Zaxby's, get the wing and tings (Yum!)
Real quick bills still stacking to the ceiling (Uh-oh...)
What you mean, it ain't working? (What?)
What you mean, you ain't finding yourself? (Oh, I am, I'm trying)
What you mean, you ain't got no cash? (I got a little bit...)
What you mean? What you mean?
Shouldn't your pockets be big just like a fat chick? (Uh-huh!)
Shouldn't your mama be done paying the house off? (I guess?)
Shouldn't you have a real big-ass ego? (No?)
Shouldn't these girls be flockin' just like seagulls? (Eh...)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
The original lick-splickety, higher than Yosemite
Breaking the mold mentally, master with no limiting
Making 'em say "ugh!", they worshipping our force viciously
Watching the floor tip in your temple of authenticity
Often they say I’m off it, I offer my crossed empathy
They forgot what we on, I’ll remind 'em with hostility
Hot-diggity damn, everyone running scams
Gotta cover your clams and take another glance
Running a clinic, no scans, ain't no one claimin' yo mans
It's all pertaining to plan, call me the architect
Lap you in a UFO, I haven't started yet
Still gotta figure out exactly where to park it at
Moses with the pen, each line an ocean I can part it at
But that's too deep

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Don't call me stupid
That ain't the way my name pronounced
Don't call me Cupid
I got too many hoes right now
Poolside in Houston
Tryna see if Beyoncé will take me for adoption
Broke-ass rich suburbs
A civilian shot in 3rd Ward, we just by the fountain
This is Merlyn Wood, man
Everywhere I go is The Woodlands
I need a honey-butter
Vodka in a Sprite can
When I'm in the Whataburger
All the kids know who I am
I need a honey-butter
Pouring lean in my Sprite can

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
I got a record but I'm clean as they come
I'm Godzilla, when they see me, they run
On 37th, used to run from the Bloods
The undercovers gotta duck when they come
I moved out and in a couple of months
I'ma be a pop star, they call me a thug
I used to write raps on the back of the bus
Now I'm in the front seat shifting the gears

[Verse 5: Joba]
It's funny how things can change
Three hundred dollars to my name led to Hollywood
I was living off ramen and change
Five hundred dollars on these dinners, never have to pay
Growing up my teachers told me
"You better get them grades up if you wanna finish high school
And after high school, you better get a degree
'Cause it's a dog-eat-dog world, you could live in the street"
Flashback, I had my Walkman in the minivan
Listening to *NSYNC, saw my name on the CD
Bleach blond tips, wanted to be JT
Wanted to do big things, had to fulfill a dream
One might say I was doomed from the get-go
But those same people assume, 'cause they'll never know
What it's like to be called to what's not set in stone
I am one with the ebb and flow, that's all I know

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
My decisions—I ain't sure if they the right ones
My daddy used to beat my mommy; I would fight him
But I been thinkin' that I'm kinda just like him
I take a sip, and then I go and grab a knife, and
I take a drive while I'm high—suspend my license
I'm hanging out the window speedin' on the I-10
I'm headed west out to Hollywood with my friends
I'm moving out, and I don't care if you like it
'Cause I've been sleeping on the roaches—I don't like this
I'm going platinum, then I'm gon' buy a island
I'm in that water to the creases in my eyelids
I'm out in Austin—I got work on consignment
I met some niggas that was runnin' in apartments
Take the money, take the weed into the darkness
I turned heartless, the barrel barkin'
I break commandments Moses put on stone carvings

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I did business with a homie—now he trippin' 'bout some money
Partially—mainly trippin' 'bout percentages he wanted
Made the trip to California, made the album of a lifetime
Fuck this boyband shit, I just want a lifeline
I just want my mom back, my sister in a Cadillac
The black—she had the rims to match
Twitter fuckin' pillow mat
I am not an activist just because I like dick
Nigga, my existence is enough to end all this shit
I be studyin'
Lot of music coming out that I ain't fuckin' with
Shit that we makin' sound like Southside Dungeon shit
We the new Motown
Thugs with no guns 'round, friendship is gangsta

[Outro: Matt Champion]
All my life, I been runnin' with the wrong ones
One slip-up and I end up in the coffin
No one love me, no one love me, I'm the off one
No one love me, no one love me, I'm the off one
All my life, I been runnin' with the wrong ones
One slip-up, and I end up in the coffin
No one love me, no one love me, I'm the off one
Holdin' on my motherfuckin' pride

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
My male role models drug dealers and thugs
My father learned how to solve problems with guns
And when I grew up, I learned what racism was
And what teaching it does, and like my teachers would say:
"Little Black boys have a place in the world
Like hanging from trees, or dead in the street"
Like I seen on TV
All them boys they killed, they looked just like me
Not like Brandon or Chandler, but Malik and Kareem
I was born with a target, and it stuck to my skin
And I learned in social studies, I was one of them men
Who were locked in the chains, but not locked in the pen
But I'm bigger than that, I'm the beginning and end

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I'm the sun and the moon
I'm the light and the dark, I am life in the tomb
I'm the pharaoh and slave, gentrifying my spirit
It's like a knife in the womb, refuse to act like a parrot
Or to dance like a monkey; see, your stance is apparent
That's why I'm here for the money, don't care to cater to merit
Y'all fetishizing my spirit, I see your culture’s dependent
On what you didn’t inherit, won't let my world be attempted
I'm staying distant

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Merlyn Wood]
Who gonna be the reason why I get high?
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over?
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust?
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped?
Who gonna be the reason why I get high?
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over?
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust?
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped?
Who gonna be the reason why I get high? (Bloodsucka!)
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over? (Bloodsucka!)
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust? (Bloodsucka!)
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped? (Bloodsucka!)
Who gonna be the reason why I get high? (Bloodsucka!)
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over? (Bloodsucka!)
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust? (Trustsucka!)
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped? (Bloodsucka!)

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Bum, bum, beat 'em, I would never wanna be 'em
If I catch 'em slipping, they gon' have to meet the eagle
Bum, bum, beat 'em, treat these niggas how I see 'em
I don't need you either, send you right back where I seen you
Bum, bum, beat 'em, I would never wanna be 'em
If I catch 'em slipping, they gon' have to meet the eagle
Bum, bum, beat 'em, treat these niggas how I see 'em
I don't need you either, send you right back where I seen you

[Outro: Ameer Vann & Merlyn Wood]
In the game, in the game, in the game, in the game (Bloodsucka!)
In the game, in the game, in the game, in the game (Bloodsucka!)
Running thangs, running, run, running, run, running thangs (Bloodsucka!)
Running thangs, running, run, running, run, running thangs
In the game, in the game, in the game, in the, in the
In the game, in the game, in the game, running thangs
Running thangs, running, run, running, run, running, run
Running thangs, running, run, running, run, running thangs

[Verse: Ameer Vann]
I done been in trouble 'bout as long as I remember
My momma tried to help me but I hardly ever listened
So she sent me to them white schools, I learned that I was different
They told me I'm a nigga, well, now I know I am
I got my finger on the trigger, I'm a project baby
A free-lunch felon, and I'm hungry every minute
Empty stomach, weed smoke can't fill it
If you don't listen to me, I set fire to the building
Need to listen to the children and the weapons they concealing
Hear the voices of a million when I sell my first million
I am bound to go diamond, ain't no luck or surprises
I am tanning on an island
I can feel the pressure, but I see my new horizons
Me and all my niggas getting stars down on Sunset Boulevard
But niggas from the Southside with Xan bars and gunplay
Niggas on that "Someday..."
If you shooting for the stars, you only headed one way
Like an alchemist or an engineer
I used to think of potions in my diaries
To improve the flow of my inner gear
Speeding up my nature inquiries

Moulded the vision I had of our sphere
Through meditation and observation
A social fabric tangible and clear
My disembodied thoughts in station

Knowing you
I had a feeling of indulging your tonic
Holding you
It made me drift from my prior logic

Knowing you
I had a feeling of indulging your tonic
Holding you
It made me drift from my prior logic

Extend the scope of my findings
Classifying them; a scattered thread
Scouted for more despite my failing tidings
A mere haul for the freight of my head
Reached the threshold of my wit
Where the whole seems badly heated
And judgements of value aren’t fit
I realized this spring was depleted

Knowing you
I had a feeling of indulging your tonic
Holding you
It made me drift from my prior logic

Knowing you
I had a feeling of indulging your tonic
Holding you
It made me drift from my prior logic
I have these thoughts going on in my head
My hopes are placed in some future ahead
My finite means tune the world to its will
My higher verb is forever fulfilled

If I live old
To see my grey days
My heart will stay true - and forever young
This minute of gold
I won't let it daze
Catching the fleeing moment bid it remain

If I live old
To see my grey days
My heart will stay true - and forever young
This minute of gold
I won't let it daze
Catching the fleeing moment bid it remain

I have these thoughts going on in my head
My hopes are placed in some future ahead
My finite means tune the world to its will
My higher verb is forever fulfilled
I contemplate this immortal outcome
A timeless trace of future times to come
I know I'm more than the span my life
I know I'm more than my own local strife

If I live old
To see my grey days
My heart will stay true - and forever young
This minute of gold
I won't let it daze
Catching the fleeing moment bid it remain

If I live old
To see my grey days
My heart will stay true - and forever young
This minute of gold
I won't let it daze
Catching the fleeing moment bid it remain
This night my sole appeal
I have a claim to your zeit
Foresaw this ideal
How would it feel right

Hold my verb for true
Trust we’re both kin
Saw myself through you
Past both flesh and skin

May this imprudent plea
Reach all created spheres
My finite self dares agree
With the cyclic gears

May this imprudent plea
Reach all created spheres
My finite self dares agree
With the cyclic gears

Formed to nature’s will
I ought to venture still
My core systoles
Cause boundless diastoles
My transmuted self
Orbits divine spheres
Shadows creating cells
Suits my nature here

May this imprudent plea
Reach all created spheres
My finite self dares agree
With the cyclic gears

May this imprudent plea
Reach all created spheres
My finite self dares agree
With the cyclic gears

[Verse 1]
Status, cold
Eager inclinations
Status, old
Cumulus frustration
Status, near
Witness your fate bud
Status: sphere
Looping my blue blood

[Verse 2]
Prospect, wait
Still thirsty for more
Prospect, faith
As my nature soars
Prospect, none
Hold to the few I own
Prospect, one
Forever unknown

[Bridge]
If you ever wonder
Men are still near their system
In a somnolent condition
Waiting for a turn
If you ever wonder
Men are still near their system
In a somnolent condition
Waiting for a turn

[Outro]
System, slash
Tissues crack
System, ash
Geist hold back
System, sealed
Widen soul
System, healed
Guide new whole
I have encountered in my course
Many open-minded folks
And often, they would friend
The journey, but not its end

Against the scholar disgrace
Too abstract for their taste
They’d rather think body and mind
A whole stoutly combined

A cerebral life
An endless strife
Sleepless pursuits
Nature’s prized truths

A cerebral life
An endless strife
Sleepless pursuits
Nature’s prized truths

I noticed their despair
None were truly aware
The sacrifice implied
Mistakenly applied
Reminding me asceticism
A self-refusing idealism
That someone should pursue
An endless strive for truth

A cerebral life
An endless strife
Sleepless pursuits
Nature’s prized truths

A cerebral life
An endless strife
Sleepless pursuits
Nature’s prized truths
My sight shall reach past the ruthless dunes
A solitary raven as my sole mate
Whose intentions towards me
I allow myself to doubt
(As everyone here is by their own)

Small unfortunate seeds champion
Against an unwilling stormy climate
Where venomous predators luxuriate
I therefore brace myself
While I have my last sip

I’ve been on many traveling caravans
With experienced and spirited folks
We kept our eyes vigilant
For danger preys each turn
(I can’t afford to let them down)

I am now one in this vast wasteland
My leather boots burn my weary feet
Meditating my next crucial move
Disdaining the liquid salt on my eyebrows
(My intentions will prevail)
What is it to be a man?
Is it to be romantic?
Fueling its own nostalgia
With dreams of death in battle
Submitting its body to hard privations
Gaining the curse of martyrdom
Leaving this world in a blind and passionate fashion
In the arms of a consuming mistress
Stupidly jumping off the schlafen berg
Dying on a piano, of an unexpected but inevitable sickness
With a still dripping quill in the left hand
Depicting unbalanced emotions in sheet music
A deforming lens
Aimed at a small fraction of the human catalogue
Or, in the case of our contemporaries
Depicting a long over exploited duality between good and evil
As if the choice was a puzzling dilemma
Attacking a God, killed over three centuries ago
Counter facing the camera you borrowed money to pay for
Implying references to esoteric Delphies
Creating a non existing mystery around oneself
What is it to be a woman?
Being sad on a beach,
A long monologue glorifying impossible loves
Smoking cigarettes with boredom
Enacting its own death in a car accident
Maybe quit it all at 27
Impressing some naive teenagers
Who can’t but think that suffering is deep
Clearly, there must be some other themes
Who please both to mind and body
While petitioning for genius and greatness
Maybe give a listen to Fauré and Bach
To the Greeks, Mill, and ironically, the great Goethe
They are all brilliant men who worked hard
… Still, they can’t be placed above manly affairs
Because, concerning those, no one ever saw nor heard
They remain interesting as photographs
Which depict some of many human features

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the only man that I want
And baby, you're the only man that I love
Baby, you're the only man that truly makes me happy
So happy
Baby, you're the only man that I want
And baby, you're the only man that I love
Baby, you're the only man that truly makes me happy
So happy
I'm so happy I met you

[Verse 1]
It's been a crazy afternoon
And I can't wait till I get home to you
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all day long
I hope you missed me boy, 'cause here I come
Boy, I love the way you move
And I love how bad I'm in love with you
Sometimes I wonder how it feels to be as beautiful as you
My search is over, baby
'Cause I'm so happy I met you

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the only man that I want
And baby, you're the only man that I love
Baby, you're the only man that truly makes me happy
So happy
Baby, you're the only man that I want
And baby, you're the only man that I love
Baby, you're the only man that truly makes me happy
So happy
I'm so happy I met you

[Verse 2]
Oh, I love the things you do
Baby, I've been wantin' you and get close to you
And I never thought to fall in love wit' you, you
How you got the qualities I've been lookin' for?
So glad God sent me to you
I'm so dangerously in love with you
I'd sell my soul when I'm wit' you, boo
You're so good to me
And that's why I'm happy I met you

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the only man that I want
And baby, you're the only man that I love
Baby, you're the only man that truly makes me happy
So happy
Baby, you're the only man that I want
And baby, you're the only man that I love
Baby, you're the only man that truly makes me happy
So happy
I'm so happy I met you

[Bridge]
You make me happy
You put a smile on my face
Just thinkin' about you, yeah
You make me happy
You put a smile on my face
Just thinkin' about you, yeah
You are my baby
You are the song throughout my day
And I do love you, yeah
You make me happy
You put a smile on my face
Thinkin' about you, yeah
I'm so happy I met you

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the only man that I want (yeah)
And baby, you're the only man that I love (yeah)
Baby, you're the only man that truly makes me happy
So happy
Baby, you're the only man that I want (yeah)
And baby, you're the only man that I love (yeah)
Baby, you're the only man that truly makes me happy (yeah)
So happy (I'm so happy I met you)

[Verse 1]
I'm staying in tonight
I won't stop you from leaving
I know that I'm not what you wanted, am I?
Wanted someone who I used to be like
Now you think I'm not trying
I don't argue, it's not worth the effort to lie
You don't want to bring it up
And I already know how it looks
You don't have to remind me so much
How I disappoint you
Suggest that I talk to somebody again
That knows how to help me get better
And 'til then I should just try not to miss any more
Appointments

[Verse 2]
I think if I ruin this
That I know I can live with it
Nothing turns out like I pictured it
Maybe the emptiness is just a lesson in canvases
I think if I fail again
That I know you're still listening
Maybe it's all gonna turn out all right
And I know that it's not, but I have to believe that it is

[Bridge]
I have to believe that it is
I have to believe that it is
(I have to believe it, I have to believe it)
I have to believe that it is
(Probably not, but I have to believe that it is)

[Chorus]
And when I tell you that it is
Oh, it's more for my benefit
Maybe it's all gonna turn out all right
Oh, I know that it's not, but I have to believe that it is

[Verse 1]
There's a hole in the drywall still not fixed
I just haven't gotten around to it
And besides I'm starting to get used to the gaps

Say you wish you could find some way to help
Not to be so hard on myself
So why is it easy for everyone else?
I'm not always like this
There's always tomorrow I guess

[Verse 2]
And I'd never do it but it's not a joke
I can't tell the difference when I'm all alone
Is it real or a dream, which is worse?
Can you help me?
I just wanted to go to sleep

[Bridge]
(When I turn out the lights)
When I turn out the lights
There's no one left
Between myself and me

[Chorus]
But when I turn out the lights
When I turn out the lights
When I turn out the lights, oh
There's no one left
Between myself and me

[Verse 1]
I know you do better when you're by yourself
Free from the weight of my dirt poor health
New drugs to fix all my missing cells
Didn't bring it up, cause I've done so well this week
And I thought that if I tried a little bit harder you'd change your mind
I've still got nowhere to be, and I don't do too well; nobody's worried
When nobody's worried about me

[Verse 2]
But I shouldn't have built a house in the middle of your chest
Plywood boards joined at your breast
Splinter in my arm where you rest your head
Checking my watch till you come to bed
Kiss me goodnight with your sour breath
Breaks on my face like a wave of emptiness
And when I talk just taste regret
You're everything I want and I'm all you dread

[Bridge]
Watch the poison leak from your pores
Think all the liquor's gonna keep you warm
Burn everything down to prove you could
Leave me inside in a body made of wood
In a body made of wood

[Chorus]
Oh, the harder I swim, the faster I sink
The harder I swim, the faster I sink
The harder I swim, the faster I sink
The harder I swim, the faster I sink
The harder I swim, the faster I sink
The harder I swim, the faster I sink
The harder I swim, the faster I sink
The harder I swim, the faster I sink

[Verse 1]
My heart is gonna eat itself
I don't need anybody's help
It's just me, the vacant, and nobody else
At least that's what I tell myself

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm an amputee with a phantom touch
Leaning on an invisible crutch
Pinned to the mattress like an insect to styrofoam
Calling out from my bedroom alone

[Verse 2]
And I know what's in my cannibal chest
That's been dug out like a strip mine till there's nothing left
Hold the chorus in between my ears until I go deaf
That remind me exactly what I am every chance they get

[Chorus 2]
Am I a masochist screaming televangelist?
Clutching my crucifix of white noise and static
All my prayers are just apologies
Hold out a flare until you come for me
Do I turn into light if I burn alive?
If I could do what I want
I would become an electrician
I'd climb inside my ears
And I would rearrange the wires in my brain
A different me would be inhabiting this body
I'd have two cars, a garage, a job
And I would go to church on Sunday

A diagram of faulty circuitry
Explains how I was made
And now the engineer is listening
As I voice all my complaints
From an orchestra of shaking metal keeping me awake
I was just wondering if there's any way that you made a mistake

Because I miss you the way that I miss nicotine
If it makes me feel better, how bad could it be?
Well I heard there's a fix for everything
Then why, then why, then why
Then why not me?
The 1st of April saw the sickening repair
Wore my best shirt to the clinic decorated with a laminate name
No one is laughing from an audience of folding plastic chairs
And I'm not fooled when you tell me that you're glad I came
Am I honest to admit or just a hypocrite?
I know I should be being optimistic but I'm doubtful I can change
Grit my teeth and try to act deserving
When I know there is nowhere I can hide
From your humiliating grace

Because if you swear that it's true
Then I have to believe
What I hear evangelicals say on TV
And if there's enough left after everyone else
Then why, then why, then why
Then why not me?

[Verse 1]
I used to never wear a seatbelt
'Cause I said I didn't care
What happened
And I didn't see the point
In trying to save myself
From an accident
'Cause if somebody's gonna help me
What's this fabric gonna help?
And when I'm pitched through the windshield
I hope the last thing that I felt before the pavement
Was my body float
I hope my soul goes too

[Verse 2]
I shouldn't have let you leave
I should have called you twice
But I didn't
'Cause it's always something else
And I know it's a bad time
But there's no one left for me to call
And I was wondering if you would be my ride
And damn it, we are gonna figure something out
If it takes me all night to make it hurt less

[Chorus]
Leave the car running
I'm not ready to go
It doesn't matter where
I just don't want to be alone
And as long as you're not tired yet
Of talking, it helps to make it hurt less

[Chorus]
Oh, leave the car running
I'm not ready to go
And it doesn't matter where
I just don't want to be alone
And as long as you're not tired yet
Of talking, it helps to make it hurt less

[Outro]
This year I've started wearing safety belts
When I'm driving
Because when I'm with you
I don't have to think about myself
And it hurts less

[Verse 1]
When is it too many times
To tell you that I think of you every night
I don't want to make it hard on you
So I could be cruel
Yeah I could make you hate me
Would that make it easy
Did you think I forgot
The fireworks, the black eye
Trading blows on the fourth of July
But you were right, I was asking for it
I always am
It's no good if the pain doesn't make you feel like you earned it
And I probably deserved it

[Chorus]
'Cause all you ever say is
"What's the point
Is anybody there to help me now"
It's not that I think I'm good
I know that I'm evil
I guess I was trying to even it out

[Verse 2]
Isn't that what you want
For me to be miserable like you
Well brother, you're about to get your wish
Putting my fist through the plaster in the bathroom of a Motel 6
I must have pictured it all a thousand times
I swear to God I think I'm gonna die
I know you were right
I can't be fixed, so help me

[Chorus]
'Cause all you ever say is
"What's the point
Is anybody there to help me now"
It's not that I think I'm good
I know that I'm evil
I guess I was trying to even it out
Collecting the circles that tell us
How old we are beneath our eyelids
Wearing a purple badge to prove what I did
Pump the vitals out of my wrist
'Cause I'm conducting an experiment on how it feels to die
Or stay alive

So try to stay calm, 'cause nobody knows
The violent partner you carry around
With claws in your back, ripping your clothes
And listing your failures out loud
It's more than the skeleton next to my coat
The black that I held in the back of my throat
Follows you straight into the dark;
The easy way out and the hardest part
When it won't leave me alone
I'm better off learning
How to be
Living with demons I've
Mistaken for saints
If you keep it between us
I think they're the same
I think I can love
The sickness you made
'Cause I take it all back, I changed my mind
I wanted to stay
I wanted to stay

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine

[Post-Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
I'm just a boy yeah, I'm just a boy yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy yeah
I'm just a boy yeah, I'm just a boy yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy yeah

[Verse 1: Joba]
It doesn't rain in L.A
And I'm afraid to see your face
Flashback to the flash floods
And the slow-paced Texas days
We never change, no no
Forever was just a phase
I didn't mean to leave you lonely
I just had to do what's best for me, selfishly
I'll admit that
I'm in a fetal hold, I'm a weak man
I'm a weak man
I hit the ground running
Trippin' on my feet
As the distance between us
Became more than I can see
I hope you're okay
Yeah, I hope you're okay
I went to the beach yesterday
And cried 'cause I missed you
The waves don't crash the same
And the sun still burns me

[Bridge 1: Joba]
I'll miss you for all my life
I'll love you for all my life
I'll miss you for all my life
I'll love you for all my life
(Another day away, another state away)
I'll miss you for all my life
(Another day away, another state away)
I'll love you for all my life
(Another day away)
I'll miss you for all my life
I'll love you for all my life

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I can't stand it here no more
I've been banging at your door
I'm so lost in Hollywood
All that shit I put you through
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, yeah
I'm so sorry
But you won't wait for someday
We had dreams, married Sunday
But I left Texas, now you hate me
In this town where I can't breathe
Yes, I love you, but I can't stay
And you ask why, but I can't say

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Still ain't find all the answers
I don't want to be standard
Surgeries, I've been tampered
Watched her fight and beat cancer
Wasn't ready to let me go
I wasn't ready for life without
Fear one day that I'll make that call
I have to face all my darkest doubts
I can scream when I think of what happens for a reason
Find my ways to fly with everyone, I lost when I'm dreaming
I don't wanna wake up when I get a chance to catch that feeling
Letting go, every second that I live until I stop breathing

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine

[Post-Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
I'm just a boy, yeah, I'm just a boy, yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy, yeah
I'm just a boy, yeah, I'm just a boy, yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy, yeah
I'm just a boy, yeah, I'm just a boy, yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy, yeah
I'm just a boy, yeah, I'm just a boy, yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy, yeah

[Bridge 2: Kevin Abstract]
Texas sky, if I die, I hope that I'm no random guy
It's so mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Texas sky, if I die, I hope that I'm no random guy

[Verse 4: Kevin Abstract]
You made me do things I don't ever wanna do
You made me say things I don't ever wanna say
You ain't act ways that are natural
I'd rather end up in disaster
Imagine me and you outside
When the wind can't hurt my pride
Imagine me and you in a car crash
Imagine me and you shared a last laugh
Imagine me and you hold hands
Fake ass romantics
Like all the niggas we stanned
Think that's a classic, damn
You let me share your couch with you
I thank you for that
You let me share your house with you
I thank you for that
You let me wipe my mouth with you
I thank you for that
You let me write my songs about you
And I hate you for that
And I can't get it

[Intro: Gucci Mane & Quavo]

[Chorus: Quavo & Gucci Mane]
You get the bag and fumble it
I get the bag and flip it and tumble it (Yeah)
Straight out the lot, three hundred cash (Cash)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I know that these niggas gettin' sick of me (Eww-ah)
These chains on my neck cost a mil' a piece (Um)
I don't even like to freestyle for free
I put in the key and I ride the beat
I won't even come out the house for free
I pay a nigga to drive for me (Huh?)
JAY-Z couldn't even co-sign for me

[Chorus: Quavo]
You get the bag and fumble it
I get the bag and flip it and tumble it (Yeah)
Straight out the lot, 300 cash (Cash)
And the car came with a blunt in it (Yeah)
Lil' mama a thot, and she got ass (Thot)

Be real with me
Keep it 100, just be real with me (Ayy)
Eat it up like it's a feast (Woah, eat it up)
They say the dope on fleek (Yep)
Born cutting teeth on the curb
Summoning ghosts up from the concrete
Keeping me company while I learned
Shadowboxing with giants
That grew from our feet

I know that you don't understand
'Cause you don't believe what you don't see
When you watch me throwing punches at the devil
Ooh, it just looks like I'm fighting with me

But there's a comfort in failure
Singing too loud in church
Screaming my fears into speakers
'Til I collapse or I burst
Whichever comes first

I know you were trying to help
But you're only making it worse
Tell me that I shouldn't blame myself
But you can't even imagine how badly it hurts
Just to think sometimes
How I think almost all the time
So break me down
Folded over your arms
Like an unloaded shotgun
Dismantled and harmless
Even you couldn't manage to pull
The fuse from the back of my head

When you tell me you love me
Tell me you loved me
I wanted so bad to believe it
So tell me you love me
Tell me you loved me
I wanted so bad
I wanted so bad to believe you

[Verse 1]
What is it like to be empty?
Full of only echoes
And my body caving in
A cathedral of arching ribs
Heaving out their broken hymns

[Verse 2]
Thought I made out your reply
In the seconds between sound and light
And I could have sworn the sirens
Were the holy ghost just speaking in morse code

[Chorus]
'Cause Lord, Lord, Lord, is there some way to make it stop
'Cause nothing that I do has ever helped to turn it off
And everything supposed to help me sleep at night
Don't help me sleep at night, anymore

[Verse 3]
From a distance, light from stars
Entry wounds or puncture marks
Leaking from your arms
Through the perforated dark

[Chorus]
'Cause Lord, Lord, Lord, is there some way to make it stop
'Cause nothing that I do has ever helped to turn it off
And everything supposed to help me sleep at night
Don't help me sleep at night, anymore

[Outro]
So could you hear from heaven on earth
If I scream a little louder
I know you would have heard
Say there's no way I could be further
If I scream a little louder I know you would have heard it

[Dress You Up]

[Verse 1]
You've got style, that's what all the girls say
Satin sheets and luxuries so fine
All your suits are custom made in Barcelona
But I've got something that you'll really like
(Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body

[Verse 2]
Feel the silky touch of my caresses
They will keep you looking so brand new
Let me cover you with velvet kisses
I'll create a look that's made for you
(Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body

Gonna dress you up in my love, in my love
All over your body, all over your body
In my love
All over, all over
From your head down to your toes

[Into the Groove]

[Chorus]
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?

[Verse 1]
Music can be such a revelation
Dancing around, you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythms right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight, I want to dance with someone else

[Instrumental Break]
(Are you ready to party?)

[Dress You Up]

[Chorus]
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body

Gonna dress you up in my love, in my love
All over your body, all over your body
In my love
All over, all over
From your head down to your toes

[Outro]
Gracias, señores y señoritas!
If there are rebel hearts in the audiente tonight, why don't you put your hands together?

[Spoken Intro: Madonna]
Medieval warrior bitch goddess
That's what I'm going for
Blood, sweat and tears
(Blood, sweat, tears)
(My hands are raw right now)
When you are prepared for anything
You are prepared for war

This is the beginning of a crazy ride
The great thing about the war that we fight every night
Is that we bring no harm to people
We just bring love, inspiration
And people need it
(Blood, sweat and tears)
This is it, people
It's showtime

[Spoken: Madonna]
(I'm a woman, I'm a woman)
I’m a woman, I’m a blonde
I have tits and an ass
And an insatiable desire to be noticed
"Come on, baby, show us your ass"
(Iconic)
"Shake it for us, baby
Do that dance you do so well for us, baby"
Ok, but I still want to start a revolution
Somebody’s got to

[Refrain: Madonna]
(Iconic)
(Iconic)
Born to be a superstar
That's exactly what you are
Born to be a superstar
That's exactly what you are

[Spoken: Madonna]
There’s too much beauty in the world going to waste
Too much talent going unnoticed
Too much creativity being crushed beneath the wheel of corporate branding and what’s trending
But it’s time to wake up
(Born to be a superstar)
And I looked into the eyes of people and I saw helplessness
(That's exactly what you are)
I saw hopelessness
I saw humans searching for a way out

[Spoken: Mike Tyson]
Watch me, people
I am great and I am somebody
I've been up and down so many times
No one forever stops me cause I am somebody
I am beautiful!

[Spoken: Madonna]
Because when those Fascist dictators posing as righteous men come for you
With their big leather boots to shut you up
To put a gag in your mouth
You better be prepared to fight for what you believe in
You better be prepared to die for what you believe in
I want to start a revolution

[Intro: Mike Tyson, Madonna]
Are you with me?
I'm the best the world has ever seen
(I'm the best ever!)
I'm somebody you'll never forget cause I work hard and sweat in my tears (Can't be stopped!)
I'm never falling again and if I did, I'd come back
(Yeah, Iconic, Iconic, Yeah)

[Verse 1: Madonna]
If you tried and failed, get up again
Destiny will choose you in the end
If you don't make the choice, and you don't use your voice
Someone else will speak for you instea
What you want is just within your reach
But you gotta practice what you preach
You pay with sweat and tears to overcome your fears
Never let the fire inside you leave

[Chorus: Madonna]
"I-can't", "icon" - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are who you are
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be

[Drop: Madonna]
Iconic
Iconic
Ironic
Iconic

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Tell me I'm no good and I'll be great
Say I have to fight and I can't wait (yeah)
Standing in the wings, a butterfly that stings
I will rise above cause it's my fate (yeah)

[Chorus: Madonna]
"I-can't", "icon" - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are who you are
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be

[Drop: Madonna]
Iconic
Iconic
Ironic
Iconic

[Bridge: Madonna]
Born to be a superstar
That's exactly what you are
Born to be a superstar
That's exactly what you are

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
Alright
Firefly change when they catch ya
Wanna put ya in their net for their light glow
Yellow brick highway
Paparazzi piled up on the high road
They just turned the sun into an idol
They just wanna see how high the sky go
Just to find how it feel to fall back
Madonna said I remind her of Michael
Steady blowing up my head, blowing up my head
Put it on your wall
Put me in the school book, put me in the laws
Put me in the desk and in the Synagogue
Firefly glow when they catch ya
Wanna catch ya when ya lights go dim
Wanna turn you to a letter in their logo
Wanna stick you in a jar with a pen
You an icon

[Chorus: Madonna]
"I-can't", "icon" - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are who you are
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be

[Drop: Madonna]
Iconic
Iconic
Ironic
Iconic
Iconic
Iconic
Ironic

Poured up with my nose up and that rose up in that thinga

[Intro]
Arigato gozaimasu, Bambi-chan, Aya-chan
Alright, are you ready to heat things up?
It's getting a little bit hot in here!
I said "why don't you help me turn up the heat!?"
Are you listening motherfuckers?

[Verse 1]
Don't put me off 'cause I'm on fire
And I can't quench my desire
Don't you know that I'm burning up for your love?
You're not convinced that that is enough
I put myself in this position
And I deserve the imposition
But you don't even know I'm alive
And this pounding in my heart just won't die
I'm burning up

[Chorus]
I'm burning up, burning up for your love (I can't hear you)
I'm burning up, burning up for your love (Let me hear you sing)
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
For your love

[Verse 2]
You're always closing your door
And that only makes me want you more
And day and night I cry for your love
You're not convinced that that is enough to justify my wanting you
Now tell me what you want me to do
I'm not blind and I know
That you want to want me but you can't let go
C'mon, let go

[Chorus]
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
For your love, oh

[Verse 3]
Do you wanna see me down on my knees?
Bending over backwards, now, would you be pleased?
Unlike the others, I'd do anything
I'm not the same, I have no shame
I'm on fire

[Guitar Solo]

Do you wanna see me down on my knees?
Or bending over backwards, now, would you be pleased?
Unlike the others, I'd do anything
I'm not the same, I have no shame
I'm on fire

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah, I'm burning up
Ooh, yeah, I'm burning up
Come on, oh come on, I'm burning up
Uh, uh, uh
You know you got me burning up, baby
You know you got me burning up, baby
Burning up for your love
Burning up for your love (That's right, motherfuckers)
Burning up for your love
Burning up for your love

[Verse 1]
I can give you everything that you want
(Bitch, get off my pole)
(Bitch, get off my pole)
You can't buy this at no luxury store
(Bitch, get off my pole)
(Bitch, get off my pole)

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a place you gotta go
Before I let you take it all
It's like a drug, it should be illegal
Baby, you should get down low
And drink my precious alcohol
You look so thirsty, I think you need it

[Chorus]
Kiss it better, kiss it better
Don't it taste like holy water?
Make it wetter, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, kiss it better

[Verse 2]
I can teach you all the things you don't know
(Bitch, get off my pole)
(Bitch, get off my pole)
It's rare like mink, it's something you wanna own
(Bitch, get off my pole)
(Bitch, get off my pole)

[Pre-Chorus]
There's something you gotta hit
It's sacred and immaculate
I can let you in heaven's door
I promise you it's not a sin
Find salvation deep within
We can do it here on the floor

[Chorus]
Kiss it better, kiss it better
Don't it taste like holy water?
Make it wetter, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, kiss it better

[Bridge]
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?
Bless yourself and genuflect
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?
If you like it, please confess
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?
Bless yourself and genuflect
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?
Yeezus loves my pussy best

[Interlude]
Ladies with an attitude
Don't just stand there
Don't-don't, don't just stand there
Don't just stand there, let's get to it
Strike a pose, there's nothin' to it
(What are you looking at?)
Come on, vogue
Let your body move to the music (Move to the music)
Come on, vogue
Let your body go with the flow (Go with the flow)
You know you can do it
Come on, vogue
Let your body move to the music (Move to the music)
Come on, vogue
Let your body go with the flow (Go with the flow)
You know you can do it

Picture of a beauty queen
Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire
Ginger Rodgers, dance on air
They had style, they had grace
Rita Hayworth gave good face
Lauren, Katherine, Lana too
Bette Davis, we love you
Ladies with an attitude
Fellows that were in the mood
Don't just stand there, let's get to it
Strike a pose, there's nothing to it

[Bridge]
(Don't it taste like holy water?)
(Sacred and immaculate)
(Don't it taste like holy water?)
(Bless yourself and genuflect)

[Chorus]
Kiss it better, kiss it better
Make it wetter, make it wetter
Kiss it better, make it wetter
Kiss it better, kiss it better

Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Do-don't it taste like holy water?
Bless yourself and genuflect
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?

[Outro]
Bless yourself and genuflect
Yeezus loves my pussy best

[Verse 1]
Take my sins and wash them away
Teach me how to pray
I've been stranded here in the dark
Take these walls away
I've been swimming in the ocean 'til I almost drowned
Give me something I can believe in
Teach me how to pray

[Pre-Chorus]
And we can do drugs, and we can smoke weed, and we can drink whiskey
Yeah, we can get high, and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue, and we can do E, and we can drop acid
Forever be lost, with no way home

[Chorus]
Yeah, we can run and we can hide, but we won't find the answers
If you go down, then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul, then we should travel all together
And make the devil pray

[Drop]
(Oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-)
Devil's here to fool ya
(Oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-)
Devil's here to fool ya
Oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-
Devil's here to fool ya
Oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-
Devil's here to fool ya

[Verse 2]
Mother Mary, can't you help me?
'Cause I've gone astray
All the angels that were around me have all flown away
The ground beneath my feet's getting warmer
Lucifer is near
Holding on, but I'm getting weaker
Watch me disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
And we can do drugs, and we can smoke weed, and we can drink whiskey
Yeah, we can get high, and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue, and we can do E, and we can drop acid
Forever be lost, with no way home

[Chorus]
Yeah, we can run and we can hide, but we won't find the answers
If you go down, then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul, then we should travel all together
And make the devil pray

[Drop]
I said ooh, ooh, sing hallelujah
Ooh, save my soul
Ooh, ooh, the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told
I said (Ooh, ooh, sing hallelujah)
(Ooh, save my soul) Sing hallelujah
(Ooh, ooh, the devil's here to fool ya)
Until my story's told

[Verse 1]
With all these curves we might need to have the brakes looked at
So pop the hood and see what's good, I need a tune-up bad
My pressure's low, I'm on a roll but my transmission's blown
I heard a thump and then a knock

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop

[Chorus]
You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on my line

[Post-Chorus]
You can polish the headlights
You can smooth out the fender
You can start the ignition
We can go on a bender

[Verse 2]
Stuck to the seat, our body heat, what will you do with all this ass?
Let's shift a gears, get outta here, we're stepping on the gas
We gotta bounce, we're going fast, let's let the seat go back
You take the wheel, I'll sit on top

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop

[Chorus]
You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on my line

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on my line

[Post-Chorus]
Overheating the engine
Might be blowing a gasket
Tighten up the suspension
And you don't have to ask it

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I-I hear you work at a body shop (You're late)
(What you been doin', workin' out?)
I-I-I (Show me your sixpack)
Hear you work at a body shop

[Bridge]
I would drive to the ends of the earth for you
Jumpstart my heart, you know what you gotta do
I would ride through the dark of the night with you
Cross my heart and hope to die, it's true

[Chorus]
You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on my line (Hey baby)

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on my line

[Outro]
I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop
I-I-I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop
Thank you!
Let's get this party started

[Intro]
(Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper)
Are you bitches in my gang?
Stanley, are you in my gang?
(Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper)
(Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter)

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Verse 1]
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know
I let my father mold me

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Verse 2]
The deeper I go
All is fair in love she said
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Bridge]
Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude]
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Outro]
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
I can't keep from falling in love with you
You know there's nothing better that I'd like to do

[Intro]
(Come on!)
This will be a revolution requiring further
Of not worrying about winning other people's approval
Of not wishing you were someone else
But perfectly content to be who you are
(Come on, living for love)
Someone unique and rare
And fearless
I want to start a revolution of love

[Verse 1]
First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game, you fired a shot in my heart

[Chorus]
Living for love, living for love (I'm gonna carry on)
Living for love, living for love, I'm living for love
Living for love, living for love (Love's gonna lift me up)
Living for love, living for love, love's gonna lift me up

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna carry on
I could get caught up in bitterness
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best, and it's not you
You've broken my heart, but you can't break me down
I'd fallen apart, once was lost, now I've been found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

[Pre-Chorus]
Took me to heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

[Chorus]
Living for love, living for love (I'm gonna carry on)
Living for love, living for love, I'm living for love
Living for love, living for love (love's gonna lift me up)
Living for love, living for love, love's gonna lift me up

[Outro]
(Lord lift me up, up, up, up)
(Up, up, up, up, Lord lift me up, up, up, up)
Love's gonna lift me up
(Up, up, up, up, Lord lift me up up, up, up, up)
Love's gonna lift me up, I'm gonna carry on
(Said love's gonna lift me up)

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
Hey hey!

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, te amo
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

[Bridge]
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
Hey hey!

It's the MA-DO-NN-A, huh
You ready?
Let's go, alright

[Intro]
(When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied)
(When the gun was loaded, you were never on my side)
We only hurt the ones we love

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning feeling good that you were gone
Hurt for a while but I'm finally moving on
Said it, did it, hit it, quit it, then I let it go
See you trying to call me but I blocked you on my phone
It took a minute but right now I'm feeling strong
It almost killed me but I'm better off alone
Now you're saying that you're sorry, I don't wanna know
Better face the fact you had to go

[Chorus]
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

[Post-Chorus]
You know, you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me
Did you?
You know, you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you
(It might sound like I'm an)
(It might sound like I'm an)

[Verse 2]
I know you'd like it if I sat at home and cried
But that ain't gonna happen, here's the reason why
When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied
When the gun was loaded, you were never on my side
I'm popping bottles that you can't even afford
I'm throwing parties and you won't get in the door
Said it, get it, love it, hate it, I don't care no more
Tell me how it feels to be ignored

[Chorus]
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

[Post-Chorus]
You know, you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me
Did you?
You know, you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you
(It might sound like I'm an)

[Interlude]
I need a new bitch in my life!
Please, someone!
(It might sound like I'm an)
Anyone?

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
(It might sound like I'm an)

You've been a bad bad bad bad bad girl
(It might sound like I'm an)
Hard ass
Bad bad bad, bad bad bad

[Chorus]
Come on, baby
(It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch)
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

[Post-Chorus]
You know, you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me
Did you?
You know, you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you

[Chorus]

[?]
(It might sound like I'm an) Unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like (Fuck you!) I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
(It might sound like I'm an) Come on, baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it like it's hot, oh yeah
(It might sound like I'm an) Oh I'm not there at all, yeah
Shake it, shake it
Yes! Oh yeah, oh yeah! (It might sound like I'm an)

[Outro: Madonna, guests]
Yes! Yes bitch!
Do it like you mean it
Rita Ora: "Make some noise for the queen of the world!"
Ladies and gentlemen, a big round of applause for tonight's unapologetic bitch!
Give me a hug
Oh yeah

You have a lot of clothes on
You have anything to apologize for?
Gwendoline Christie: "Fuck no!"
That's right!

Katy Perry: "I love you mom! I'm such a big fan!"

[Chorus: Big Sean]
(Yeah) I swear that I changed
I don't even rock the same chains
Me and them not in the same lane, nope
Swear that I've changed (yeah)
I even ran into my old hoe
And I told her I changed, yeah
And the number just changed
Man, I swear that I changed
I know you prolly wish that I had stayed the same (I know, I know)
I know you prolly wish that I had stayed the same

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
As the winter turn to spring and the leaves start changing
Her dress get shorter and her weave start changing
Rocking short sleeves, my timepiece keep dangling and blinking
Ten diamond chains and they turnin' and tanglin'
Old Gucci Mane was addicted to dranking
New Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to Franklins
No, we not the same, I'm evolving
I'ma elevate long as the world keeps revolving
And I got problems, but they rich nigga problems
Used to see niggas like me and want to rob them
I know my granny prolly looking down at me now
They used to look down at me, but now look around
My house so big, my pool so muthafuckin deep
So plushed out, I don't really like to leave
My bitch so bad that I don't even go to sleep
Pussy so good, it make you wanna buy a ring

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I swear that I changed
I don't even rock the same chains
Me and them not in the same lanes, nope
Swear that I've changed (yeah)
I even ran into my old hoe
And I told her I changed, yeah
And the number just changed
Man, I swear that I changed
I know you prolly wish that I had stayed the same (I know, I know)
I know you prolly wish that I had stayed the same

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Only thing that ever stayed the same was the name
You prolly wish I go back through the pain
Back when I was in school, contemplating if I ever even
Do music again, bitch, I'll do that shit again
Cause I never got lost when I follow my heart
I know I'm a walking target just dodging the darts
Used to focus on getting rich now I'm focused on getting smart (smart)
Cause that's the only thing that they can't take or tear apart (straight up)
Beast beast beast, bitch, watch out for my teeth (beast)
And I never miss a mil', both cash and feast (feast)
And my future set in stone like Medusa was me (whoah)
More focused in on this shit and tryna' get off that lease (don)
Cause if you wanna lease, they got yo' ass on a leash (damn)
And now I'm not a pet, I'm a vet, bitch please (bitch please)
The old me used to be a pushover, shit (yeah)
Then I pushed myself and a nigga took over (I took over)
One of the greats you bitches tend to look over (I am)
But bet I kill this shit every time that the hook over
It's over, yeah
Yeah bitch, it's over

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I swear that I changed
I don't even rock the same chains
Me and them not in the same lane, nope
Swear that I've changed (yeah)
I even ran into my old hoe
And I told her I changed, yeah
And the number just changed
Man, I swear that I changed
I know you prolly wish that I had stayed the same (I know, I know)
I know you prolly wish that I had stayed the same

[Verse 1]
You are everything to me
And I, I would die for you
There've been times where I'm up all night
Crying in the dark, so I sleep with the light on
I've heard I've got words like a knife
That I don't know how to choose just so wisely
But I see trees and their colored leaves
When I think about all that we could be

[Chorus]
When you're gone, time moves so slow
Like the grass, I've watched us grow
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow
How could I never let you know?

[Verse 2]
That you are everything to me
You're sweeter than candy and better than any childhood dreams
I am yours and you are mine
I have your heart, I don't even need a ring
I'd give up all I have in exchange for who I love more than anything

[Chorus]
When you're gone, time moves so slow
Like the grass, I've watched us grow
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow
How could I ever let you know?

[Bridge]
'Cause you, you're everything to me
And I, I would die for you
Yeah, I would die for you

[Chorus]
When you're gone time, moves so slow (I would die)
Like the grass, I've watched us grow (I would die)
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow (I would die)
How could I never let you know?
I would die for you

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I don't know where you always go
Why you tryin' to keep it on the low?
I'm always like, "Where the hell you been?"
You tell me that you've been hanging with your friends
Somethin' seems just a little sus
We ain't got nothin' if there ain't no trust
I'm not sure, but I got a hunch
And now you've got me thinkin' way too much

[Chorus]
I've been thinkin' way too much, much, much, much
You ain't been callin' me enough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough
Now I'm longin' for your touch, touch, touch, touch
I've been thinkin' way too much, I've been thinkin' way too much
You won't pick up the phone, phone, phone, phone
Now I'm sitting here alone, lone, lone, lone
Do you do this just for fun, fun, fun, fun?
I've been thinkin' way too much, I've been thinkin' way too much

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you

[Verse 2]
It's getting late, I'm starting to obsess
You got me crying and lookin' like a mess
My daddy said, "Stay away from such"
But now you got me thinkin' way too much

[Chorus]
I've been thinkin' way too much, much, much, much
You ain't been callin' me enough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough
Now I'm longin' for your touch, touch, touch, touch
I've been thinkin' way too much, I've been thinkin' way too much
You won't pick up the phone, phone, phone, phone
Now I'm sitting here alone, lone, lone, lone
Do you do this just for fun, fun, fun, fun?
I've been thinkin' way too much, I've been thinkin' way too much

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you

[Bridge]
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you

[Chorus]
I've been thinkin' way too much, much, much, much
You ain't been callin' me enough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough
Now I'm longin' for your touch, touch, touch, touch
I've been thinkin' way too much, I've been thinkin' way too much
You won't pick up the phone, phone, phone, phone
Now I'm sitting here alone, lone, lone, lone
Do you do this just for fun, fun, fun, fun?
I've been thinkin' way too much, I've been thinkin' way too much

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you

[Intro: Dolly Parton]
Hey, Miley
It's me, I’m in Nashville
I'm on my way to Dollywood, busy as you are
Can't get enough stuff to do, can’t
But anyway, I'm excited about singing with you
So I'm just gonna turn my CD player on with you singing
I'm gon' put this on a cassette
Sing along with it, and then I'll run you off a CD later
Oh, I'm so high tech
I got a flip phone too
But anyhow, see what you think
And mmm, here I go

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus & Dolly Parton]
Come on
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where everything goes as planned and I smile
’Cause I know if we tried, we could really make a difference in this world
I won’t give up or sleep a wink
It's the only thought I think
You know where I stand
I believe we can start livin’ in a rainbowland

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Dolly Parton]
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand
Oh, I'd be lyin' (I’d be lyin'), if I said this was fine
All the hurt and the hate going on here (hate going on here)
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through
Together we can start livin' in a rainbowland

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus & Dolly Parton]
Living in a rainbowland
Where skies are blue and things are grand
Oh, wouldn't it be nice (so nice) to live in paradise
Where we're free to be exactly who we are
Let's all dig down deep inside
Brush the judgment and fear aside
Make wrong things right (all things right), and end the fight
'Cause I promise ain't nobody gonna win
(C'mon)

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Dolly Parton]
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand
Oh, I'd be lyin' (I'd be lyin'), if I said this was fine
All the hurt and the hate going on here (hate going on here)
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through
Together we can start livin' in a rainbowland
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus 2: Miley Cyrus & Dolly Parton]
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand together (let's do it together)
Change things forever (forever)
I know there's got to be a greater plan
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through (shine my head)
Together we can start livin' in a rainbowland

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Outro: Dolly Parton]
Hey, Miley
Look, I know it sounds scrambled when I'm singing it with you
Wish I could do a little better
At least, I might not get it all the way through
'Cause I'm not sure of the structure without you
But I think this could work well, don't you?
If not, like I said
I'll write that love song for you
You probably wrote it about some boy you loved, didn't ya?
Well...

[Verse 1]
If I spent a week without you
Bet you'd wonder what I’d do
I think that I'd start goin' out
Get caught kissin’ other dudes
And it seems you just wanna bring me down, down
With your bad attitude (bad attitude)
When you know I'm not one to keep dealin' with the shit
That you put me through

[Chorus]
I know that I gave you my heart
But you stomped it to the ground
And that's what's got me wondering what it's like
To not have you around

[Verse 2]
If I spent a week without you, hmm
I'd probably have so much fun (have so much fun)
First things first I'd gather up all my girls, yeah
So we can lay out in the sun
Oh, it’d be so nice not to worry, yeah
How I’d love not to stress
I'd go and grab my old blue jeans
I’m sick of wearing this silly dress

[Chorus]
I know that I gave you my heart
But you stomped it to the ground
And that's what's got me wondering what it's like
To not have you around

[Bridge]
You know I’d miss you, babe
Feels like I've known you since I was just 7 years old
You used to make me smile, but now you don't do that anymore
It feels like I'm always just crying and sleeping alone
But when I think of you gone
I know

[Chorus]
I know that I gave you my heart
But you stomped it to the ground
I don't want to wonder what it's like
To not have you around
To not have you around, to not have you around
To not have you around, to not have you around

[Outro]
You know I'd miss you, babe
You know I'd miss you, babe
You know I'd miss you, babe
(Know I'd miss you)

[Intro]
Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Hah
It's Gucci
Hah

[Verse]
I was piss poor, sleeping on the dirt floor
And we couldn't pay the rent so it's a notice on the door
The neighbors been noticed so what I'ma front for?
Using pennies for the bus like what I'ma stunt for?
Mama workin' like a dog but we still broke
We lighting candles in the house 'cause the lights off
The best thing that ever happened, I got kicked out
Bought me a Chevy, got a grill, now I'm gold-mouthed
I lost my daddy last year, I couldn't even cry
'Cause it's so hard to shed a tear, he didn't even try
The only person in the world I could fully trust
Was my older brother Vic, that's just how it was
Top in the trunk, this for Bankroll and Slim Dunk
I miss that girl Beasley, she was a real one
I had an artist that I treated like my own son
Gave him the shirt off my back and my own gun
R.I.P. to Shawty Lo, Mister Don Don
It's been rainin' so long, when the sun comin'?
I'm drop top but put the top up when the storm comin'
Sometimes I think about my past, it make me start tripping
I was gifted with a talent that was God-given
But I was so hard-headed I would not listen
Sometimes I sit and I reflect about that cold prison
And doin' pull-ups with a nigga got a life sentence
They gave my nigga Grant life, he only gained on me
Five years later, how we in the same room?
You go to jail, that's when you see who really love you
I don't think nobody love me like my auntie Jean do
R.I.P my auntie Jean and uncle Goat too
How you gon' judge me? You don't know what I been through
I think these killers need a hug, I need a hug too
You send a slug, I'll send a slug, you know how thugs do
But I forgive, I been forgiven, I hold grudges too
I'm just a work in progress, I'm not even through
But I forgive, I been forgiven, I hold grudges too
I'm just a work in progress, I'm not even through

[Outro]
Wop
Hah
Woo

[Verse 1]
They say love can drive ya crazy, my dear
I wanna trap you in a locket, or in my pocket
So I can keep you near
You know I'd never hurt you
If you fall, I’d pick you up and I'd drink your tears
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

[Verse 2]
They say good things come to those who wait
It’s like countin' in light years
I'd physically live without you, but I don't want to
And death's never been my fear
You can take my blood, take my bones
My heart is yours, I volunteer
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

[Chorus]
When you look up at a rainbow
Do you ever wonder what's really waiting at the end?
I don't want no gold, nothing’s more than you
The amount is hard to even comprehend
Nothing I can do, I lost control
Something we hold on to so dear
But how can I miss you so much when you’re right here?

[Verse 3]
And how at this optimal time did you just appear?
Everyone under their guard, so full of shit
But you are just so sheer
You're my God, you’re my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

[Chorus]
When you look up at the cosmos
Do you ever wonder if there's really even an end?
It might go on forever, like my love for you
An amount that's hard to even comprehend
I won’t waste my time with wonder, in apprehension, or livin' life in fear
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

[Verse 4]
You're my God, you're my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
You can take my blood, take my bones
My heart is yours, I volunteer
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh (I wake up in a bad mood)
Oh-oh-oh (I wake up in a bad mood)

[Verse 1]
I always wake up in a bad mood
I can never fall asleep
I'm always thinkin’ 'bout you
What life would be if we didn't meet
I always wake up in a bad mood
Open my eyes, then I’m on my feet
And I wonder what you would do, yeah
If you couldn't rely on me

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh) I wake up in a bad mood
(Oh-oh-oh) I wake up in a bad mood
And you know that I got the proof
We're held together just by a string
And while you're hangin' round with your crew
I'm here balancin' too many things

[Verse 2]
I always wake up in a bad mood
I'm sick of rushin’ straight to the sink
You’re acting like you ain't got the news
I don’t even really care what you think
But what I do, you know I do with love
I believe in more than you can see
And you know I'm never givin' up
I ain't stoppin’ 'til I know I'm free

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh) Ooh (Ayy) I wake up in a bad mood
(Oh-oh-oh) I wake up in a bad mood
The glass ceiling's gotta break
All together, wanna hear ya say
"I don't know how much more it can take"

[Bridge]
You know it's gone on way too long (Don't ya?)
And you know it's wrong (Don't ya?)
But I know I'm strong (Yes, sir)
I don't give up (No, sir)
And when it gets rough (Rough)
I get tough (Tough)
I've had enough

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh) I wake up in a bad mood
(Oh-oh-oh) (Oh, yeah) I wake up in a bad mood (Bad mood)
And when the light starts getting dim
I'll open windows up and let it in
Sometimes it feels like it's 'bout to end
Before it's all about to begin

[Outro]
(Oh-oh-oh) I wake up in a bad mood
(Oh-oh-oh) I wake up in a bad mood

[Intro]
You gotta love someone

[Verse 1]
I don't know what you’ve been told
Or what they say about me
I never give up, but give it a rest
I ain't got time to worry 'bout a mess
And I’m kinda getting tired of dealin' with all your stress
I'm startin' to think you have no heart, yeah
You don't even have a soul
You always give in or ya try too late
All I do is give and all you do is take
I'm tired of protecting you from what you need to know (Come on)

[Chorus]
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you weren't the one
But nothing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all my shit and movin' on
Hey, yeah

[Verse 2]
I’m not sure I’d even go
'Cause I made your house my home
It’s come to an end, I hate how it's been
Lights are getting dim and the walls are caving in
And it's time for this queen to go and find another throne
When I give it up, I give it all
I went and made you my life
Don't you dare say I don’t care
When I need you most, you know you're never there
It'd be a cold day in hell before I'd ever be your wife, that's right

[Chorus]
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you weren't the one
But nothing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all my shit and moving on

[Bridge]
Kickin' off my shoes and runnin' towards the sun
I said "Nothing's really worth it unless you're having fun"
To make somebody stay
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

[Chorus]
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you weren't the one
But nothing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all my shit and moving on

[Outro]
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

[Verse 1]
I wanna start by saying thank you
I'm gonna miss ya, honey
You gave me things I can’t buy back with money
You changed my life
You've been my world
There's no other girl that looks like ya, darling
Those eyes, that tongue, those teeth, that face, that body
Even though we’ve gone to outer space
Still no way you can take his place

[Chorus]
You're not him (No)
Yeah, she's not him
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I just can't fall in love with you
'Cause you're not him (No)
Yeah, she's not him

[Verse 2]
And why, why can't I love you, baby?
Like I wanna love you, baby
I’m sorry
And maybe it’s beyond my control
Some sort of chemical reaction
Making it impossible to let him go

[Chorus]
You're not him
She’s not him
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I just can't fall in love with you
'Cause you're not him
Yeah, she’s not him

[Bridge]
And you don't deserve
All the bullshit I've put you through
And you, you deserve
A heart much bigger than one that's torn in two
Oh, oh

[Chorus 2]
You're not him (Whoa)
She's not him
Every time you walk through my door
I swear to God you're more beautiful than before
But you're not him
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I just can't fall in love with you
'Cause you're not him
Yeah, she's not him

Told the bitch to bring one friend
Hardheaded-ass bitch brought two
Looked one of 'em in the eye, said, "I already fucked you, why she brought you?" (Hah)
I'm a player, these bitches, they love me (They love me)
In the club passin' out bubbly (Here, take that)
Bitch, I'm the shit like Ruffin (David)
Can't a nigga tell me nothin' (It's Dolph)
I'm out in Hollywood druggin' (Druggin')
Young nigga paid and thuggin' (Yeah)
Dolce Gabbana tuxedo (Hah)
Trap nigga like Nino (Brown)
Just had a bad bitch trio
One Mexican and one Creole (Hah)

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Nigga, please
You ain't got as much guap as me (Uh)
You don't wanna go dollar for dollar (Ball)
You don't wanna go bottle for bottle (You don't wan' do it)
You don't wanna go bitch for bitch (Huh?)
'Cause all I ever fuck with is models (Yeah)
I'm a motherfuckin' player, my nigga (Player)
If she bad, I'ma slay her, my nigga, yeah (Push it, push it)
Stuntin' ain't nothin' to me (Ain't nothin')
Pimpin' ain't nothin' to me (Ain't nothin')
Ballin' ain't nothin' to me (Ain't nothin')
Poppin' bottles, that ain't nothing to me (That ain't nothin')
Flyin' foreign cars, that ain't nothin' to me
It ain't nothin' to me (I'm stuntin')
Stuntin' ain't nothin' to me (Ain't nothin')
Look at this shit, it ain't nothin' to me (Woo)

[Verse 1]
Gucci back home with the bling on
And if you think I ain't strapped then you think wrong
I ain't goin' back and forth, this ain't ping pong
Get your leg torn off, whole head blown
I was selling bales before I sold a ringtone
The whole hood know my number like Mike Jones
Yellowbone and she dancing in a pink thong
She ask me can we make love with my mink on
I call my migo plug, now, nigga, pack gone
Trapped a trailer full of strong, this my backbone
I used to sell half a ounces out a trailer home
I seen friends turn to foes 'cause the paper gone

[Chorus]
I had to cut lil mama off, now we back on
They think I'm still selling soft like it's back on
I was gone for a minute, now it's back on
I'm self made and independent, yup, black owned
I had to cut lil mama off, now we back on
They think I'm still selling soft like it's back on
I was gone for a minute, now it's back on
I'm self made and independent, yup, we black owned

Gucci Mane a menace (menace back on)
A hundred grand spent at the dentist (huh)
Hold up, I'm not even finished (wow)

Here's a message to my critics (fuck you)
Fuck your bitch, go get some business (go)
I just bought my bitch a Bentley (skrrt)
Hold up, I'm lyin' I bought my bitch a business (yea)

[Chorus]

They think I'm still selling soft like it's back on
I was gone for a minute, now it's back on

[Intro]
They love me for one thing
So I'ma keep some money
They love me for one thing
So I'ma keep some money

[Verse 1]
It's really gettin' outrageous, they stalkin' all my pages
They runnin' on the stages, and they say that I'm the greatest
They used to call me ugly, but now they say I'm handsome
I pull up in that Phantom, she took my dick for ransom
I said I was the greatest, some people call me crazy
A lot of people hate me, but still they imitate me
This watch here cost an eighty, Guwop's an eighty baby
Grew up in ATL but don't do no roller skatin'
Lil' mama wanna suck me and she ain't never met me
She said she had a dream that she fucked me in my Bentley
Baller of the century, and they could never clone me
He say he worth a mil, but I got a million on me

[Chorus]
Money make you handsome, even if you're ugly
Money make her fuck me, she wanna fuck my money
All my bitches love me, they love me for one thing
Money keep her coming, so I'ma keep some money
Money make you handsome, even if you're ugly
Money make her fuck me, she wanna fuck my money
All my bitches love me, they love me for one thing
Money keep her coming, so I'ma keep some money

[Verse 2]
I do it with no effort like I don't even want it
I just built me a mansion, so big I feel it's haunted
I got so many diamonds that I don't even flaunt them
She think her pussy diamond but I don't even want it
Call it perfect timing, I don't have no opponents
It ain't no competition, 'cause they don't really want it
A bitch'll slit her wrist just so she can be my sidepiece
She wanna stand beside me, I just threw up a nine piece
If she thick as a horse I might buy that bitch a Porsche
If she mean nothing to me, Wizop I'm worth a fortune
I do it with no effort like I don't really want it
He say he worth a mil but I got a million on me

[Chorus]
Money make you handsome, even if you're ugly
Money make her fuck me, she wanna fuck my money
All my bitches love me, they love me for one thing
Money keep her coming, so I'ma keep some money
Money make you handsome, even if you're ugly
Money make her fuck me, she wanna fuck my money
All my bitches love me, they love me for one thing
Money keep her coming, so I'ma keep some money

[Bridge]
So I'ma keep some money
So I'ma keep some money
They love me for one thing
So I'ma keep some money

[Chorus]
Money make you handsome, even if you're ugly
Money make her fuck me, she wanna fuck my money
All my bitches love me, they love me for one thing
Money keep her coming, so I'ma keep some money
Money make you handsome, even if you're ugly
Money make her fuck me, she wanna fuck my money
All my bitches love me, they love me for one thing
Money keep her coming, so I'ma keep some money

[Verse 1]
This is what eight figures look like
Kids wanna be like Gucci, give a fuck about Mike
Hmm, this is what your bitch look like
When you make two hundred thousand dollars cash one night
This is what your wrist look like
When you sold so many bricks that your fit turn white
That shit that you can step on twice
If you've never been a snitch this what your rep look like
And this is what your house look like
When you built it from the ground, paid that ten mil price, ayy
And this is what a king look like
Got a queen on your team, this what the ring look like (brrr, brrr)
This is what a dream look like
If you're hating tell me what your self esteem look like
Ex-dealer but I left that life
I can't even remember what a triple-beam look like

[Chorus]
Guwop how much you pay for that Patek Phillipe? (hundred thousand)
Pretty please get them broke niggas way from me (hundred thousand)
I don't want no bitch to fuck with me for free (what's a thousand?)
You know a rich nigga can't fuck no hoe for free (what's a thousand?)
I just made five hundred thousand in my sleep (five hundred thousand)
Money comin', I think it's in love with me (five hundred thousand)
I'm in the club throwin' money on the freaks (money piling)
It ain't 'bout money then no need for us to speak (money piling)

[Verse 2]
Long pipes, big rims, baby that's my life
When I pull up to the club better stash your wife
Hear a lot of haters talkin', they ain't 'bout that life
2017, nigga I done boost the price
Two shows one day, I done switched the ice
Gettin' head on a PJ, it's an all night flight
Call Forbes, tell them niggas what that list look like
'Cause if Guwop ain't on that bitch, then that list not right
I dropped the top so I could show her what the sky look like
Besides the nigga drivin' there's not a star in sight
I just might pull up, pop a wheelie on an all-chrome bike
Bought a diamond grill from my dog, told him to bark, don't bite

[Chorus]
Guwop how much you pay for that Patek Phillipe? (hundred thousand)
Pretty please get them broke niggas way from me (hundred thousand)
I don't want no bitch to fuck with me for free (what's a thousand?)
You know a rich nigga can't fuck no hoe for free (what's a thousand?)
I just made five hundred thousand in my sleep (five hundred thousand)
Money comin', I think it's in love with me (five hundred thousand)
I'm in the club throwin' money on the freaks (money piling)
It ain't 'bout money then no need for us to speak (money piling)

[Intro]
Huh, Ziggy (Ziggy)
Zay, Gucci
Zaytoven

[Verse 1]
I'm the definition of a rich trap nigga
Ex-Con, drug don, certified killa
Young nigga trapping for them new Lebrons nigga
I was trafficking and passing bricks like I'm Lebron nigga
Steph Curry pound of kush under my armor nigga
Arm and hammer Gucci cook it right in front of niggas
Everybody bosses really they just runners nigga
On YSL designer down I drip like gunna nigga
Have you been so broke you had to serve a pregnant lady
Feeding crack rock to a baby and you really just a baby
The shit I seen in Sun Valley drive a nigga crazy
I drunk so many pints I damn near drove my mama crazy

[Interlude]
This shit crazy
I'm crazy
Life crazy
They say my wife crazy
I'm marrying a killer
This ain't rock bottom
Can't go anywhere but up
It's Gucci, ha
I walk in the bank they say
"Hey, Mr. Davis, how may I assist you?" (Huh?)
It's Gucci, yeah
It's Wizop (Go)

[Verse 2]
I act like I forgot but I was once a mental patient
Sittin' still in a cell while my career deteriorated
Now everyday I wake up I feel invigorated
Got Rihanna on IG talking about Gucci's transformation
Minor setback for a major compilation
Meant to say comeback but I might drop a compilation
Sometimes I post a pic just so I can block all the haters
A lot of niggas sending threats I don't know what the wait is
They actin' like they tough but don't want no confrontation
These sucka's ain't even man enough to say congratulations
2018 20 year my high school graduation
I might go in my bag and send them on a paid vacation
You never sold a brick I understand the fascination
You think he a D boy but really he's a scammer baby
I'm from East Atlanta by way of Alabama baby
Took so many bricks to 'bama my pic should be laminated

[Outro]
I know my aunt looking down on me like
"I'm glad you made it"
I know my uncle looking down on me like
"I'm glad you made it"
I know Slim Dunk', Bankroll, Shawty Lo, Lonnie, East Atlanta Beasley, looking down on me like
"I'm glad you made it"

[Chorus: Monica & Gucci Mane]
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride
Even when it don't go right
Even when the shit go left
Even when my arms can't fight, we ride
(Get somebody that gon' ride for you) Even when I lose my breath
(Who gon' die for you) Even when I hurt myself
(Who gon' cry for you) Even if it means my life, we ride

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Look I don't trust nobody like I trust  you
I know you'll never hurt me 'cause it will hurt you
Everybody turn their back on me but you
And when I did time you was doing time too
Looking back at it, Hell what we went through
It's like I prayed for an angel and he sent you
They used to say you was a fool 'cause you loved me
Now look at them they like damn I wish it was me
But tell me can you hold me down in the bad weather?
Cause anyone can hold it down through the fair weather
That's why the rock so big 'cause when you wave at 'em
I want them hoes to run and hide like you sprayed at 'em

[Chorus: Monica & Gucci Mane]
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride
Even when it don't go right
Even when the shit go left
Even when my arms can't fight, we ride
(Get somebody that gon' ride for you) Even when I lose my breath
(Who gon' die for you) Even when I hurt myself
(Who gon' cry for you) Even if it means my life, we ride

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
It's me and my ride or die, that's my right hand
Got me thinking, "Damn who gon' be my best man?"
Built a house for 10 mil on your own land
And showed your best friend how to build her own brand
Have you ever seen a street nigga slow dance
In a white tux with a live band playing?
It's like the new Gucci talking to the old Gucci
Gotta have 20 M's to see what I'm saying
Who'd ever think I'd get this far, I was just trappin'
Who ever thought I'd get this rich when I started rapping?
This make a street nigga stand up and start clapping
I'd never thought I feel this way but then God happened

[Chorus: Monica & Gucci Mane]
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride
Even when it don't go right
Even when the shit go left
Even when my arms can't fight, we ride
(Get somebody that gon' ride for you) Even when I lose my breath
(Who gon' die for you) Even when I hurt myself
(Who gon' cry for you) Even if it means my life, we ride

[Intro: Rico Love & Gucci Mane]
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missin' my woe
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missin' my woe
It's Gucci

[Chorus: Rico Love & Gucci Mane]
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missin' my woe
Always stay on 10 like the 6 and the 4
I still can't believe you won't be hitting my phone
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
And I said one time, one time for the real ones (for the real ones)
Why they always die so soon? (so soon)
Why they gotta go so fast?
They don't make enough like you
So I took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
Missing my woe, huh, missing my woe, huh
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
Missing my woe, huh, missing my woe
Got money for bail, got money for bail
I won't stay in jail, I won't stay in jail
They want me to lose but they won't prevail
Damn I miss my dog man he should be here

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Fresh outta jail, made bail for the tenth time
Shoulda been said something cause it's been time
You see me smiling but I'm crying on the inside
Thinking bout my homies locked down on the inside
I've been spared so many times, could've been died
Coulda lost my sanity, my brain been fried
It's so hard to understand when it's God's plan
And it's not in my hands but in God's hands
Free my nigga Putang and free Papa Joe
And every soldier ten toes who ain't never told
And free my nigga Slick Ralph and my Uncle Grant
Lord knows I'm asking for a lot but bring my niggas back

[Chorus: Rico Love & Gucci Mane]
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missin' my woe
Always stay on 10 like the 6 and the 4
I still can't believe you won't be hitting my phone
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
And I said one time, one time for the real ones (for the real ones)
Why they always die so soon? (so soon)
Why they gotta go so fast?
They don't make enough like you
So I took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
Missing my woe, huh, missing my woe, huh
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
Missing my woe, huh, missing my woe
Got money for bail, got money for bail
I won't stay in jail, I won't stay in jail
They want me to lose but they won't prevail
Damn I miss my dawg, man he should be here

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Nobody ever kept it real with me like Shawty Lo
In ATL, your memory will never let it go
I'm holding on to them late nights in the studio
And every call, every show, and every video
R.I.P. to Slim Dunk, we miss you, Mario
We tryna move on but it still hurt though
We try to come together but it won't work though
'Cause you's the most important piece to the puzzle
I was in my cell, when I heard the news 'bout Bankroll
Now everybody tryna be like Bankroll
But they broke the mold, when they made my nigga Bankroll
I know I look like I'm all good but I ain't though

[Chorus: Rico Love & Gucci Mane]
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missin' my woe
Always stay on 10 like the 6 and the 4
I still can't believe you won't be hitting my phone
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
And I said one time, one time for the real ones (for the real ones)
Why they always die so soon? (so soon)
Why they gotta go so fast?
They don't make enough like you
So I took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
Missing my woe, huh, missing my woe, huh
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
Missing my woe, huh, missing my woe
Got money for bail, got money for bail
I won't stay in jail, I won't stay in jail
They want me to lose but they won't prevail
Damn I miss my dawg, man he should be here

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Ayy (It's goin' down)
It's goin' down every weekend, yeah
Malibu, top gone, everything for the weekend
Yeehaw, ayy
Summertime, bathin' suit, jump in the pool for the weekend
Ayy, yeehaw
I can make any bitch leave her man, just for the weekend
She don't really know it's goin' down tonight (Down tonight)
Up in the city goin' down tonight
All lights, our mission, they gone tonight
She like, "Shit, it's goin' down tonight"
I'm in my P1, doors up, I'm goin' places
She know that I'm goin' places (Goin' places)
Seein' different faces
Blue hundreds, big faces
Tonight (tonight), yeehaw

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Got it crackin' out in California
What I'm blowin' on strong, bottle of ammonia
"Keep your fuckin' phone on" what I tell my bitch
She don't answer, my mentality is hit a dancer
Fuck it, shit
I got no time for the fuck shit, I'm gettin' money or die
Get the fuck on with distractions, I'm way too dope not to have it
Rather say "bye" and stay fly than stay apart and me die
Some shit it just ain't no teachin', either you with it or not
If you gon' measure my bad more than you measure my good
Just think it could've been worse, I could be dead in the hood
Instead I'm out here with Swift, poppin' bottles and shit
Tell me how we gettin' it, it feels like the '90s again, damn

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Ayy (It's goin' down)
It's goin' down every weekend, yeah
Malibu, top gone, everything for the weekend
Yeehaw, ayy
Summertime, bathin' suit, jump in the pool for the weekend

I can make any bitch leave her man, just for the weekend
She don't really know it's goin' down tonight (Down tonight)
Up in the city goin' down tonight
All lights, our mission, they gone tonight
She like, "Shit, it's goin' down tonight"
Tonight, I'm in my P1, doors up, I'm goin' places
She know that I'm goin' places (Goin' places)
Seein' different faces
Blue hundreds, big faces
Tonight (Tonight), yeehaw

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
That Bentley truck'll get your dick sucked
I know you want that, but first you gotta run your chips up, ooh
I let lil' mama slurp on dick until her hiccup (Slurp)
Told her, "Keep that Rollie on" until her fuckin' wrist cut (Ay, keep that Rollie on)
Ayy, okie pokie, woah (Okie pokie)
I think my gators got a scoliosis, woah
Made it out the hood, ain't win no trophy, but I got gold
The obstacle is get this money up and, and go
Or you gon' end up stuck 'round here, drinkin' beer
Listen to my music, I can put somethin' in your ear
Pussy nigga play I bop-brrrat-bop-bop their beard
Your mama seen you get bop-brrrat-bop-bopped, then she teared
I pulled up to the party and walked in like, ayy
I don't want no problems, I just wanna say...

[Chorus: Young Thug]
It's goin' down every weekend, yeah
Malibu, top gone, everything for the weekend
Yeehaw, ayy
Summertime, bathin' suit, jump in the pool for the weekend

[Verse 3: T.I.]
When you see a Friday (Yeah, yeah)
You paid for that ride out the driveway (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When you see a Saturday  (Yeah, yeah)
Lookin' like we never seen a bad day (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When you see a Sunday
Dressed like we fresh off the front page (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Catch us every weekend (Weekend)
And we gon' do more ballin' than sleepin'
We gon' be stayin' up, drinking all night
Gotcha pourin' shots out the bottle, getting high with a model
Ain't no body die, we'll be alright
Nigga, fuck the drugs and the liquor, we get high on the lifestyle
I said fuck the drugs and the liquor, we get high on the lifestyle

[Outro: T.I.]
The Dime Trap
Plainly put, it's like a TED talk for hustlers
The evolution of Trap Muzik
Now, Trap Muzik is just, you know, a dope boy's philosophy
A former trap nigga's experiences and adventures
Set to music, but not just, when he cracking a key
Or when he cooking the work or when he sell it and get busted
We know all that, what happen when he go on vacation
You know, how is that, what happen when he fall in love?
Or have his first child
All we want to cover all those bases
'Cause dope boys go through many, many things
Just because it's trap music, don't mean it got to be one-dimensional
Diversified vibes

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Yeah, I got the fire on me
I keep the chopper close by, that's just my philosophy
Misery loves company and I don't need the misery
House full of baby bottles like I run a nursery (Wop!)
Drop top, red 'vert, I'm slidin' down universities
A lot of niggas feelings hurt cause they can't get a verse from me (damn)
Nope, nope, hell nope, boy you sound like a joke to me
And you look really broke to me, how I'ma take you seriously?
Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, cooking up the groceries
Same color T-shirt, just got a half a bird for free
I'm sending mine all low-key behind 10 at the Busy Bee
'Cause I don't need no one to do for me what I won't do for me (pow pow)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Here's a lil' story 'bout a gangster like me
A eight figure nigga, fresh out the penitentiary
A nigga like me, would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker from around the way
Here's a lil' story 'bout a gangster like me
A eight figure nigga, fresh out the penitentiary
A nigga like me, would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker from around the way

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, aiming out me Cartier
Pussy boy, you sweet, don't play with me, you know you gummy bear
Bitch, I paint the street, I guarantee bloah bolah bloah, pourin' this
Bitch, I drive Mercedes, huh, hop out like the Navy, huh
Pussy, I can sell you work, hold crack like the eighties, huh
I just fuck her makeup up, you just give her baby bump
Hit that lick, got double stripes, judge had tried to give me life
Came home, I got extra bright, platinum records, now we on
Remember couldn't afford a blunt, now a million ain't enough
Ball on them niggas, huh, crawl in them bitches, huh
Icing, that's a carrot cake, side to side, my Chevrolet
Keep a strap on side of me, sold it all through A to Z

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Here's a lil' story 'bout a gangster like me
A eight figure nigga, fresh out the penitentiary
A nigga like me, would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker from around the way
Here's a lil' story 'bout a gangster like me
A eight figure nigga, fresh out the penitentiary
A nigga like me, would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker from around the way, huh

[Intro: Gucci Mane & Future]
Huh, Gucci
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Her hair down to her asshole, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
Her ass all on her back, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
Her shoe game is fantastic, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
She don't fuck with broke niggas, and I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
We just rolled in the lot, hoe, hoe what you got?
Make a nigga spend his last like a hole in his pocket
Ice on swole, swole overload, Jenny from the block
Bitch, I wanna enter every hole that you got
Sugar daddy Gucci Mane, I'm holding a knot
You can't even fathom all the hundreds I got
I'ma give you money if you want it or not
A red droptop Phantom just swerved in the lot
Guwop got a sack, have you heard it or not?
And they gon' fuck with Wop whether they nervous or not
Baby, is you gon' give me the service or not?
'Cause that's a big factor if we splurging or not
Why your friend tryna' block for? She know you a thot, hoe
It ain't nuthin' wrong with fucking Gucci on the top floor
Diamonds draped all over me, so drink me on the rocks
This bitch so fucking nasty, I might buy this bitch a watch

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Her hair down to her asshole, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
Her ass all on her back, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
Her shoe game is fantastic, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
She don't fuck with broke niggas, and I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Uhh, where she go? There she go
Perico straight from Mexico
Ten kilos, called up Federico
Ready, go, gave Wop some top like there he go
Word to grandaddy Q, came through, couple old hoes acting new
The clothes on bare back and new, the clothes he got on coming soon
I be living life cautious, keep it moving like motions
Keep it smooth, I'm like lotion, we've been swimmin like n'oceans
Why these niggas like vultures? Dang, these bitches got motives
So much Gucci on the loafers, I'ma turn into the spokesman
Oh, it go Wop linked up with the Mob
I say Guwop, let's hit the block, linked up in Dubai

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Her hair down to her asshole, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
Her ass all on her back, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
Her shoe game is fantastic, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
She don't fuck with broke niggas, and I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch

[Intro]
Why you comin’ down, like whoa?

[Verse 1]
Beemers blazin', I'm gone
Drinkin' liquor, fucked up
Tried to call you, dial tone

When you feel me, ice cold
Why you actin' loco?
I'm addicted to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Drivin' through a lonely, lonely night
Thinkin' 'bout you
I wish that you were here to hold me tight
Wanna get out, eh-eh

Don't wanna be alone, alone tonight
Don't wanna be alone, alone tonight

Don't you know that love kills?
(Why you comin' down, like whoa?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Drivin' through a lonely, lonely night
Thinkin' 'bout you

Don't wanna be alone, alone tonight

[Verse]
Still ain't have my float trip down your spine in so long, uh
Learning on the bitch, woo, get it
Search of the clique, woo, get it
Standing in the rave, woo, get it
Raise the flag and wave, woo

[Bridge]
Read something deep kill the pressure with the light
What I'm made of

[Verse 1]
Standing in the open light
Within the swelter of the night
I found myself staring at you
And every time our fingers touched
I felt like it would be too much
And too little to hang onto

[Pre-Chorus]
I cannot fall in love with you
I cannot feel this way so soon, so soon
I cannot be this way with you
I cannot fall in love with you

[Chorus]
I knew it when you looked my way
That I'd be begging you to stay
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it to myself
I felt it burning in the way
I held on when you pulled away
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it
I couldn't just say it

[Verse 2]
And every evening, every time
I keep replaying in my mind
And wondering if you do the same
And if it makes you lose your breath
And if it makes you just forget
That all of it's a bit insane

[Pre-Chorus]
I cannot fall in love with you
I cannot feel this way so soon
I cannot be this way with you
I cannot fall in love with you

[Chorus]
I knew it when you looked my way
That I'd be begging you to stay
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it to myself
I felt it burning in the way
I held on when you pulled away
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it to myself
I knew it when you looked my way
That I'd be begging you to stay
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it to myself
I felt it burning in the way
I held on when you pulled away
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it
I couldn't just say it

[Outro]
But I cannot fall in love with you
I cannot feel this way so soon, so soon
I cannot be this way with you
I cannot fall in love with you

[Verse 1]
I can see it now, tripping on split stones
Trying to make hits so we could play them loud
Picking at our souls like we didn’t know
Just like we were only playing with the sound

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Trying to control what was so low
But I never knew how then to just go and let it out
Get it out

[Chorus]
But if you could fight
If you could choose
If you could say all the things you wanted to
If you couldn’t lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
If you could cry
If you couldn’t sleep it off
If you could feel everything you’ve ever caused
If you couldn’t lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose

[Verse 2]
And I’m not saying I would always speak up
That it didn’t creep up on me all the time
I’m just saying there was a window
Where you could’ve let go in that place and time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Laughing all it off like it was innocent
Oh, but all I ever wanted was to get rid of it
And let it out (let it out)
Get it out

[Chorus]
But if you could fight, if you could choose
If you could say all the things you wanted to
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
If you could cry, if you couldn't sleep it off
If you could feel everything you've ever caused
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose

[Bridge]
And I can see us there
You staring at me
And me just praying for air
I can see us there
Standing cheek to cheek
And counting week by week
Wishing everything would be clear
I can see us there
I can see us there

[Chorus]
But if you could fight, if you could choose
If you could say all the things you wanted to
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
If you could cry, if you couldn't sleep it off
If you could feel everything you've ever caused
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose

[Verse 1]
I’m happy as I am
Cause I’m leaving
Days will be the same
In a different way

[Pre-Chorus]
Going to a place
Where I used to stay
Writing something new
In this home I know

[Chorus]
We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog
Won’t die in the city
We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog won’t die in the city
We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog
Won’t die in the city
We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog won’t die in the city

Right eyelids closed
Both feet behind
I aim for tomorrow
Work on my mind

Going to a place
Where I used to stay
Writing something new
In this home I know

We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog
Won’t die in the city
We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog won’t die in the city
We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog
Won’t die in the city
We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog won’t die in the city
There's a monster in my closet and I don't know what to do!
Have you ever seen him?
Has he ever pounced on you?
I wonder what he looks like!
Is he purple with red eyes?
I wonder what he likes to eat.
What about his size!!
Tonight I'm gonna catch him!
I'll set a real big trap!
Then I'll train him really well.
He'll answer when I clap!

When I looked up in that closet, there was nothing there but stuff.
I know that monster's in there!
I heard him huff and puff!
Could it be he wants to eat me?
Maybe I'm his favorite tray.
And if he comes to get me,
I'll scream loudly, "Go away!!"
If he's nice, I'll name him "Happy."
If he's bad I'll name him "Grouch."
I suspect that he is leaving, but if not. . .I'll kick him out!

[Verse 1]
Means I'm ready for

I'll be drinking Krug Rosé and sometimes Lemon Drops
I'll be wearing diamond grills and Louboutins a lot
Sometimes I can be extreme, I'm never gonna stop
Keep this party goin', we'll be dancing 'till we drop

[Verse 3]
You're my metaphor

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna & Adam Levine]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

[Chorus: Adam Levine, Rihanna, Both]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Verse 2: Rihanna & Adam Levine]
Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes you burn to learn I'm with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & Rihanna]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Rihanna]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
Get tonight

[Bridge: Adam Levine & Rihanna]
Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
(Promise not to leave me behind)
Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think, but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time

[Chorus: Rihanna with Adam Levine]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
(Talk to me, yeah, talk to me)

[Chorus: Adam Levine, (Rihanna), Adam Levine & Rihanna]
Keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before (Did before)
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Verse 1]
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Verse 2]
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

[Refrain]
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Verse 2]
Fingers trace your every outline (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And you may not know
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Oh, come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow...
Driving slow.. (All I need)
Yeah, yeah...

[Outro]
It's a flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair

[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
You push me
I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
To take me down, take me down
You hurt me
But do I deserve this?
You make me so nervous
Calm me down, calm me down

[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

[Verse 2]
So come here
And never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down, slows me down
So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out, why don't you help me out?

[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh
So you say, "Go, it isn't working"
And I say, "No, it isn't perfect"
So I'll stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed

[Bridge]
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back
And fake it, fake it all
Take what I can get
Knockin' so loud, can you hear me yet?
Try to stay awake, but you can't forget

[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh
So you say, "Go, it isn't working"
And I say, "No, it isn't perfect"
So I'll stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have

[Verse 1]
The moment I saw ya
I knew I had to get with ya
You had this thing that really caught my eye (caught my eye)
When you walked up to me
I knew you were something special
Cause you didn't kick the same old lines
What's your name, what's your sign, girl

[Chorus]
Is it all in my mind
Think about you all the time
Can't get you out my head
I don't know what to do
Can't seem to shake you
I can't get you out my head
Look at what you do to me
With you is where I want to be
I just want to be with you
Be with you

[Verse 2]
I got me thinking about ya
I want to hook up with you later
Cause see a girl like me
Can never get a guy like you
Because I heard it all before
And I don't want to hear no more
But you said all the right things
And let me know you did it right

[Chorus]
Is it all in my mind
Think about you all the time
Can't get you out my head
I don't know what to do
Can't seem to shake you
I can't get you out my head
Look at what you do to me
With you is where I want to be
I just want to be with you
Be with you
Is it all in my mind
Think about you all the time
Can't get you out my head
I don't know what to do
Can't seem to shake you
I can't get you out my head
Look at what you do to me
With you is where I want to be
I just want to be with you
Be with you

[Bridge]
Boy I'm so crazy about ya
Can't wait til I get with ya
(oh oohhh)
I never felt this way that I'm feeling
No one's ever done this to me
Left this impression on me
(oh oohhh)
And I can't believe I want you here with me

[Chorus]
Is it all in my mind
Think about you all the time
Can't get you out my head
I don't know what to do
Can't seem to shake you
I can't get you out my head
Look at what you do to me
With you is where I want to be
I just want to be with you
Be with you

[Hook]
La la la la la la
I just wanna be with you, be with you
La la la la la la
I just wanna be with you, be with you
La la la la la la
I just wanna be with you, be with you
La la la la la la
I just wanna be with you, be with you

[Chorus]
Is it all in my mind
Think about you all the time
Can't get you out my head
I don't know what to do
Can't seem to shake you
I can't get you out my head
Look at what you do to me
With you is where I want to be
I just want to be with you
Be with you

[Verse 1]
You know everyday I ask myself the same question
Mary why you going through this
Why you takin yourself through this
But when you love somebody and
Maybe they might not love you but
It's hard, it's just so hard but
I just gotta think about myself
Right now and but I gotta remember this
I don't know why
Why you came in my life just to see me cry
Or maybe to see me die
But look at me now
You disguise yourself so well
That I didn't know that I was walkin into hell
But my soul I would never sale
That's why I have this story to tell
And I wanna know

[Chorus]
Where is my happy ending
I always knew you were pretending
Now it's clear to see
That there was no real love
From the beginning
See I need to know
Where is my happy ending
You hurt me so bad
There is no mending
Now it's clear to see
That there was no real love
From the beginning

[Verse 2]
How could you be so cruel
To turn yourself into a fool
Not knowing love was real
Even though you still wasted all my time boy
Now let's go back to day one
When all we knew was having fun
But you stumbled across someone who's better than me
Now I know I ought to be free

[Chorus]
Where is my happy ending
I always knew you were pretending
Now it's clear to see
That there was no real love
From the beginning
Where is my happy ending
You hurt me so bad
There is no mending
Now it's clear to see
That there was no real love
From the beginning

[Bridge]
You didn't love me, you were fakin
The whole thing was a hoax and I was blind
You really hurt me
What goes around comes around
And the pain you caused will come back to you

[Chorus]
Where is my happy ending
I always knew you were pretending
Now it's clear to see
That there was no real love
From the beginning
I need to know
Where is my happy ending
You hurt me so bad
There is no mending
Now it's clear to see
That there was no real love
From the beginning
I've done met so many
I've done lost so many
Been hurt by somebody
I have hurt somebody
I've been in the cold
Boy but now i know you're the one i want

Wanna tell the whole world about you baby, baby, baby
I’ll let you real near to my heart
So close that you can feel beats
As they move apart
I’ll let you real near to my mind
So close that all our empty thoughts
Are intertwined

Sitting by the edge of the world I know it’s true
That we wrote a language just for me and you
Stayed in that place and spent all of our day
The flashes of colour that lit right through the grey

Stay here and we’ll align
Your shadow passes into mine
Stay here and we’ll align
Your shadow passes into mine

I’ll let you real near to my heat
So close that all the broken things
Feel so concrete
I’ll let you real near to my soul
So close that you have a love
You can’t control
Sitting by the edge of the world I know it’s true
That we wrote a language just for me and you
Stayed in that place and spent all of our day
The flashes of colour that lit right through the grey

Stay here and we’ll align
Your shadow passes into mine
Stay here and we’ll align
Your shadow passes into mine

Stay here and we’ll align
Your shadow passes into mine
Stay here and we’ll align
Your shadow passes into mine
Oh..Ohh..Ohh

[Verse 1 - Jazmine:]
A memory its you its me
No makeup no clothes we bear our souls
I'll make it with you no lies the truth
We're all the same
The joy, the pain

[Chorus 1 - Jazmine:]
We 'gon make it
We 'gon make it
It gets hard but I know we can take it
I'ma make it
I'ma make it
Its the truth and there's no reason to fake it

[Chorus 2 - Mary:]
We 'gon make it
We 'gon make it
It gets hard but I know we can take it
I'ma make it
Yes I'll make it
Its the truth and you can leave it or take it

[Verse 2 - Mary:]
Livin' here today in this stress filled life
Gets so hard for me but I win the fight
So I act just like an eagle and take flight
I am not 'gon stop
Lately it seems that I can't breathe
I live to love
I give so much
I've nothing to prove I'm down with you
This job gets tough but I found out

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3:]
I know (you might)
No movies (no lines)
No camera (no flash)
No music (no fame)
I hurt (I feel)
I love (I'm real)
We're unified just you and I

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Mary (Spoken):]
For all my people in the struggle
We all havin' hard times right no
Whether it be mentally, spiritually, or finacially
We 'gon make it
So hang in there
Please
Crank my car with the tip of my fingernail
Wanna shop with me then by you a bigger scale
Wanna cop choppers plenty yoppers then call me
Got more god damn guns than an army
So Icy Entertainment soliders cock it and aim it
And we don't want a sign just make you famous
So many rings on I need another pinky
I hit more broads than Wilt the Chamberlain
I'm all black, rich, and I'm extra dangerous
I'm handsome (?) almost famous
I'm workin' with the fork and the sides I'm scrapin'
I burn it, turn it the crack is Cajun
Your Auntie hit it said it's amazing
Your uncle pawned your Playstation
The dope man got on new Ballys
I slam dunk bricks my plug throwed an alley
I'm shark meat, caviar, kush, and salad
The coke from Venezuela but the kush from Cali
A million dollars worth of carats gotcha jealous
But ain't nothing a hater can tell us

[Chorus]
We cocky, yeah bitch we cocky
Watch, ring, chain you know that we're poppin'
They're jockin' but I swear so cocky
Pockets so fat it makes us more cocky
We cocky, yeah bitch we cocky
Watch, ring, chain you know that we're poppin'
They're jockin' but I swear so cocky
Pockets so fat it makes us more cocky

They can't catch me whatcha gon' tax me?
Ask me I sell chicken like Zaxby's
Stacks and racks and Franklins and Jacksons
Packs and bales we sell them white dragons
I'm a talking brick they need to unwrap me
God take my breath if Gucci's not trappin
65 pounds of mid in my magnum
'caine same color as baby girl's dandruff
Kush same color as baby boy's stacks
Purp same color as Adrian Pete's fans is
Dog is a falcon black, red, white diamonds
Same height and same weight as a lineman
Pulled up in a donk and gave your girl the Heisman
Touchdown in the 6 I'm dancin' like Rodman
Skrt Skrt dancin' my egg beater harmonizin'
That's my machine advertisement
That's my AK homiciding
That's Gucci's favorite line man

[Chorus]
We cocky, yeah bitch we cocky
Watch, ring, chain you know that we're poppin'
They're jockin' but I swear so cocky
Pockets so fat it makes us more cocky
We cocky, yeah bitch we cocky
Watch, ring, chain you know that we're poppin'
They're jockin' but I swear so cocky
Pockets so fat it makes us more cocky

My scale see mo' blow than 4 drug stores
I'm drinking ice tea my girlfriend a coke ho
I strap a brick to her tell the bitch to go go
Nowhere she go nobody ___ this ho
I'm workin' with this fizo
Egg beater good but I'm workin' the fizork
'caine so pretty bitches love to snizort
I'm tryna sell everything they could import
Or export, my young nigga from Shreveport
But I don't show love I give him what he paid for

[Chorus]
We cocky, yeah bitch we cocky
Watch, ring, chain you know that we're poppin'
They're jockin' but I swear so cocky
Pockets so fat it makes us more cocky
We cocky, yeah bitch we cocky
Watch, ring, chain you know that we're poppin'
They're jockin' but I swear so cocky
Pockets so fat it makes us more cocky

Hello Ladies and Gentlemen
It’s Friday morning, May 25th, 2007
You know I never say the dates but since this is a mixtape

It look like like a sandwich

Uh, baby girl let me touch that sexy body
You over here up and down that pole for my freaking Rarri hey
What do you like
What do you need
You need a mic
On this balcony
Hey
I don't know what I'm talking bout
I've been srubbing walls for a couple change in the South
Hey
Oh what do you mean?
Yamine been down the row between 2 to 4 teams
They strippin
They know I'm tippin'
4 rounds and they trickin'
Thotting the thots smoking the pot
For Pippen
I don't know what I'm whipping in this kitchen
40 hoes for this dick I'm gon' swimming
I don't ever stop it
Cuz me and Usher made this song
For this girl can be on my Rocket
The one I stick in the socket
Naw nigga she gone for the week
While me and Usher go on team fleet
Hey
She fresh and so clean
(Hook: Usher)
We do it in the shower
On the counter
On the floor
Then well make it to the bed
I just want to test it me
Then we'll do it so the world can see
On the balcony, balcony (repeat)

(Verse 2: Yamine)
Hey girl what you like?
I need a couple rounds for this sprite
I had 4 hoes last night
I'm so sorry baby I was getting it right
(yeah bro)
Last mixtape was fire
And I never retire
Me and Usher in the aisle
And they know I'm an owl
I've been looking all day with a flashlight
Young ass girl that loves to bite
She knows that she loves me
I've been loving this girl all day
And she know that I love her
And she loves me so cove her

(Hook: Usher)
We do it in the shower
On the counter
On the floor
Then well make it to the bed
I just want to test it me
Then we'll do it so the world can see
On the balcony, balcony (repeat)

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Skinny boy, skinny boy, where your muscles at?
Used to walk to work, eight hours, take the bus back
Ain't no time to stop, ain't no time for vacation
Y'all all want my spot 'cause you know that I am A1
All these pretty girls, they come running to our faces
I could do without, I could move without, I could do myself
I get in a rut, I feel depressed, I bang on my chest
I say fuck 'em all 'til I'm dead

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
First off, fuck Dolce & Gabbana (Fuck em, fuck 'em)
Racist mothersuckers tryna be my pana (Pana, pana)
Put that on me auntie and me mama (Mommy, mommy)
Grab the Ghost then I go right back to Ghana (Skrrt)
I came back again (Ayy, ayy), with the platinum (Ayy, ayy)
To the continent (Ayy, ayy), I came back again (Ayy, ayy)
I came back again (Ayy, ayy), with the platinum (Ayy, ayy)
To the continent (Ayy, ayy), I came back again (Ayy, ayy)

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion & Kevin Abstract]
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Got a lot of things to say that I could never finish
Told my mama, "I'll be back, just gotta kill another mission"
Gimme thirty seconds and I'll make off with a billion
Every verse a heist for all your underlying feelings
Got canaries on the window, smell like roses on the ceiling
Oh what a–, oh what a–, oh, how appealing
Candy paint revealing all that bullshit you concealing
Fuck what you been hearing, I'm everything they fearing
I'm black and smart and sexy, universally appealing
Genius what I'm dealing, something they ain't stealing
They prohibited the potents, might give you cirrhosis
Spaceship doing donuts, it's written, I'm the POTUS
I'm focused

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion & Kevin Abstract]
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
Barre Baby, spilled syrup on my big wheel
You could call me lil nigga with the big crib
My lifestyle still the same, just a face lift
Silly niggas got me running out of patience
My whole life slowly turned into a daydream
I hit the bank with a smile on my face, man
Pretty women always pullin' at my waistband
Used to get arrested, all I get is checks now

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side

[Verse 1: Joba]
Too many things I'd rather do different
Woke up in a cold sweat (Ugh!)
My emotions creepin'
Three o'clock on the weekend, might as well sleep in
Stay down for the count when
She hit me with the "what-ifs?" and the "what-whens?" and the "what-thens?"
Wonder where my life went, living in the moment
I been thinking 'bout my time spent
Are the bills paid? Is it make-or-break? Will I find a way?
Have my feelings changed? Will I be okay? I don’t know
But what I do know is, life don't make sense
If you can't pay rent, so I place my bet

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away (Yah)
You left a spell on my Saturday

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I got cracks in my phone screen
The past fuck with my psyche
Smoke weed and get high, please
Went to school in The Woodlands
And that made niggas wanna fight me
So I don't take threats lightly
Tell them niggas, "Come and find me"
Gotta say it in my eye-view
New house off iTunes
New money, my perfume
Big smile, in a good mood
I been running out of issues
I ain't trippin' when the rent due
I ain't runnin' with a pistol
I ain't locked in the system
Taking care of my kinfolk

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Taking a book out the page of the greats
I'm only human and I make mistakes
Chisel my flows so they can't liberate
Talking the time as the pendulum sways
I gotta face what I didn't create
Just 'cause I can't relate, I don't debate
I educate, illuminate
Or we can't duplicate, no more moving the plates
Second chances feeling overrated
Unappreciated, so I bossed up
Missed the time when we could share space
But it'll all be straight the day we cross up
Nothing better than some time with you
Because it's time I never wanna toss up
Lose myself inside of you, you find yourself in me
I don't wanna be cautious

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away (Yah)
You left a spell on my Saturday

[Outro: Joba]
What got you shook?
What got you shook?
What got you shook?
What got you shook?

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Hi, I live a wonderful life
Should've died twice, wonder who on my side
Life always better keepin' two on the side
Need no music when my niggas arrive
We be in Van Nuys, black van with some white guys
Keep your hand out, waiting for the appropriate time
To ask a question like
"Could you perform at my best friend's birthday party?
With your friends and go crazy, just bring the shotty
Bring the loud one with the blonde hair."
Making out with Zayn in a lawn chair
They kicked me out but I belong here
Hear these songs nigga, see this long hair, see these videos
Direct these hoes with no budgets though
How the fuck did I land a fucking TV show?
Met all my friends through Kanye West and I ain't met him yet

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Just shaved down to the baby face
Clothes on me, guess it's Holiday
Fried, no sides at the restaurant
My sleep schedule like the power here, it's never on
Feeling like the past year a whole escapade (uh-oh)
Four cars, need a motherfucking Escalade
Pack it up like a clown car (honk, honk)
Bet you know my name from here to Hong Kong, bet I get along
Make some commas, karma, watch 'em sing along
Ayy, err, err, butter knife like dancing on a knuckle
In the thunder car, rocked up in the Lumma
Incidental, I be better by the summer
I be better by the winter, I be hoppin' in the rental
Maybe Tesla for all my missus sitting in the Volvo
Damn, shoot 'em down like, hmmm, sorry, do it all here

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I'm moonwalking on the sun hot
I used to live where the guns popped
Made some records then we moved out
Turned rap into the new pop
Bandana, I'm the new Pac
I been blowing up, I can't stop
They need my niggas in the White House
I do business with the white folks
Bring that money back to black folks
Flip it, stimulate the cash flow
Economic, but I speak ebonics
L.A. turned me to an asshole
I been shopping down on Melrose
Still a nigga but I'm livin' different
I been looking at the bigger picture
So I don't hear 'em when they talking to me

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
I just want a friend to fall in love with
Maybe someone I can binge drugs with
Living like a prince but I'm dove-less
Playin' my emotions, you a dumb bitch
Everybody talking on some gun shit
They don't even know where to bust it
Cry nigga, gotta fuckin' kick back
Gotta leave those soft niggas at the kickback
Splittin' all my problems like a Kit-Kat
I finessed the night that we slipped up
I could let you know where I'm next at
Tell my baby girl where the brakes at
You know I got number one pick stats
Catch me on the field, it's a mismatch
More like an eclipse, she couldn't miss that
Putting my ideas where my chips at

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down

[Outro: Joba]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da (La-di-da, la-di-da)
Do-walla, do-walla-walla, do-walla
La-di-da-di-da-di-da (La-di-da, la-di-da)
Do-walla, do-walla-walla, do-walla
La-di-da-di-da-di-da (La-di-da, la-di-da)
Do-walla, do-walla-walla, do-walla

[Verse 1: bearface]
In the heat of the summer, oh
Yeah, yeah, mhm
You know that you should be my boy
Oh yes, you know
In the heat of the summer
You're so different from the rest
You know, you know, you know, oh-oh
You know that you should be my boy
Oh yes, you do
In the heat of the summer
You're so different from the rest
You know, you know, you know

[Verse 2: bearface]
You know that you should be my boy
Oooh, yeah, yeah
In the heat of the summer
You're so different from the rest

[Intro: Matt Champion]
Why you look like that? (He looks crazy as fuck)
He look crazy as hell
But he dress well (oh my God)
Why his face look puff?
Why he look like that? (You look like a)
Why your hair like that? (Like a chipmunk or something)
Why your teeth like that? (Or like a prairie dog)
Why your cheeks like that?

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
I got this shitty moustache, and a new haircut
Short but tall enough to ride every ride so it's fair enough
Teeth crooked but my breath fresh just like the evergreens
My attitude is bit like, a psys- fuck!
You mean psychopath
I bet the marble feel good on your bare foot
I'm in the backyard hiding out like I'm Bigfoot
And I won't cater to you
Yeah I am not Carrabba's, and I ain't taking orders
Here for the loot, and to inspire some of you
To do what you do despite all the "fuck you's"
'Cause they shit on your shit, stab you right in the back
'Til you're shittin' on the toilet with Grammys in your lap

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
Niggas talk a lot of shit, in a safe place
Aiming with they keyboard, they shootin' uppercase
I'm booking tour dates, money in the suitcase
Commander and the chief like, Barack Hussein
Same nigga, two names, I am onto new things
Flying out of Houston, lemme say a few things
I don't give a fuck about you or your screen name
I'ma be a star even if I say the same things
'Cause them same things keep me on the wavelengths
I dropped another verse, so you gon' have to pay me
Glock with no safety, seen niggas on the pavement
Over gang affiliations, guns with extensions
Seeing niggas get anxious, all these internet gangstas
I'm running outta patience, nigga, stick to your day shift
And watch what you're saying, and please keep praying
'Cause niggas talk big 'til that price on their head

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I feel the voices always drown out all the noise in the room
They don't employ you for your purpose, they just need a platoon
Another number in a line ready to march into tombs
I ain't the one to assume, I put the coon in tycoon
We colonizing the moon, I see you look to the sky
And start to wish it was you, sometimes I wish I was me
Sometimes I'm watching my life
I'm dissociated from what eats my heart up at night
Sleep on a cloud of my strife
I ain't afraid of the heights, they all afraid to appall
I'm just afraid of excitement being a trip to the mall
I need a summer to fall, I need a winter to spring
Got all these seasons within me, building a story to sing
Don't need a dollar to dream, I need a billion in facts
I need a trillion in wealth, y'all niggas need to relax
I wanna build up the culture, they wanna dream in the trap
I took the zoom off my lens and I saw the world in my lap

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
All I do is work and pray (Ay-yah-woo-woo!)
Tryna' find a place to stay (Ay-yah-woo-woo!)
Tryna' find some food today (Ay-yah-woo-woo!)
This shit is real hard okay? (Okay)
Take that, homie got the Lysol spray, ain’t it? (Ain't it?)
You don't wanna see all my bad days, ain't it? (Ain't it?)
You don't wanna see what I got to say, ain't it?
You don't wanna see my boys, man, they ain't friendly

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
It ain't my birthday yet and I'm acting like a bitch
Screaming "motherfuck your set" like I'm 2Pac
Ain't got no ice on me yet, still feeling how I dress
So it's Dickies and I got these hoes from Walmart
It ain't my birthday yet and I'm acting like a bitch
Screaming "motherfuck your set" like I'm 2Pac
Ain't got no ice on me yet, still feeling how I dress
So much Dickies and I got these hoes from Walmart

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann & Kevin Abstract]
I just saw my P.O. (What up, nigga?)
He like me, though (He like me, though)
Clean money, tryna stay up out the streets, though
7 days a week though, (All day!) it's that heat, though
My daddy called me, said he seen my last video
Looking at a younger me, coulda had a heatstroke
In the middle of the summer with my negros
Cool cuts and snow cones, smoking to the ozone
Smokin' 'til it's all gone, smoking 'til my folks come home

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down

Runnin' outta time again
Runnin' outta time again
Runnin' outta time again, mmm
Ay-yeahh, ay-yeahh
Ooh, ooh, oo-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I don't know why I wanna fuck with you
But all I know is that I really fuck with you
Really wish you didn't like to fuck with me
Wish you took that energy and trusted me
I get so exhausted when you fuss with me
'Cause all that time could be spent in love with me
I know I need it and you deserve it
You like to size me up to see if it's all worth it
I don't know where it is now, but I'm searchin'
I think you want what I don't ever want: be perfect
'Cause I ain't perfect, I just wanna be good to you
I would take my heart right out the hood for you
Wanna do the things I know I should for you
Standing by myself until I stood for you
If I knew this love, I woulda looked for you
But I'm glad you found me, I'm glad you found me

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip, fall

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Split the diamond with us, fuck taking the bus
I want a whip to call my own and a home to call my own
All 14-15 of my niggas
To figure, ooh, that's a step-back
Ooh, my nigga, that's a step-back
If I had to choose, I would not choose you
If I had to stop, I would turn around and choose glue
If I had to hit the brakes, I'ma stop right here
If I had to choose, I'ma not choose you
If I had to turn around, I'ma turn into some glue
If I had to hit the brakes, I'ma stop right here, yeah

Just tell– just tell everyone how high you are
No, I can't talk, I'm not telling anyone
I'm not telling anyone
Can you please–
Are you recording me?
No I'm not, can you just–

[Intro]
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah (Wolfpack)

[Verse 1]
Puerto Rican Air Force One's at the wedding (Uh)
I'm only speaking truth
Uh, I might open up for Bruce (I might)
My own horn I don't really mean to toot
Sign big deals with yarmulkes on and suede gloves
It's safe to say your boy done came up
Too much lobster on the plane, the plane won't stay up (Uh)
Bitch, I'm butt naked, laid up
Yo, what the fuck?
(Wolfpack)

[Verse 2]
This dick'll make an R&B chick write a song
About the rain when it falls and the pain that it causes (Uh, uh)
And how she always wakin' up alone?
And now Bronson gotta call Tyrone (Gotta call Tyrone)
Fuck that, I'm tryna blow smoke towards the moon
Till my mind start racing like zoom
I'm hotter than when Bow Wow dropped in the summer
Girls scream and I hop into the Hummer like
Uh, I'm a teenage heartthrob
You smoke little blunts like Kevin Hart's arms (Uh)
My bloodline predate Aardvark and large shark (Uh)
And cookin' flesh off of charred bark (Aaah!)
(Wolfpack, wolfpack)

[Verse 3]
I shot dope before I wrote this
Sniffed coke and did aerobics by the ocean
This is Blue Chips 7 not Usher (Uh)
Big muskets get squeezed like mustard
And motherfuckers flee off in the Nissan (Uhh)
They say that life is like a see-saw
I roll solo, why I got these extra seats for?
Hit eject, watch him free fall (Aaaaaah!)
Better use both fucking feet, dog!

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Bam Bam, Blue Chips 7
My Blue Heaven

It's from the phone
Could rhyme on this. Oh, hell yeah, hahah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Came out the pussy wearing Timbs
Oh, my lord, it's him
Time to put the toys back in the bin
'Cause I'm sick of this shit
Motherfucker sweeter than a licorice stick
And it's rubbing me the wrong way to say the least
I'ma say my peace
And I'ma breeze in the caprice with the gold seats
Bumpin' Boosie on a slow creep
On Collins Ave looking stoned, man, you know me
Asian shooter with the blonde hair, Street Fighter character
Fuck around and suplex 'em through the salad bar
My life is greenlit, no script
And we all know that money be the motive for this whole shit
Bitch, I'm focused like none other, the number one Don Dada
Drop-top, jokes on the youngster, now look at him
Looking slim in the red '89 Testarossa with the wing
Mind blown

[Interlude]
A customer representative will be with you shortly. Did you know we can get to you in just seven minutes? Seven minutes. Call 1-800-80…

[Verse 2]
Your shit lack quality
I'm sittin' right behind my chick makin' pottery
My first joint was like an odyssey
The second joint straight raw like the shaman's feet
Climbed the stairs to the sun
Sacrificed myself for protection of my only son
Keep the bloodline strong while I watch close
To another thousand years, here's a toast (clink)
Champagne drippin' down the beard hair
Supermodel sucking while I steer the long pink Fleetwood
Roll a big fat blunt so you know I'm gonna sleep good
Now

[Outro]
(Uh)
(Rock-a-bye baby, yeah)
(Rock-a-bye baby, uh-huh)

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yeah, it's me
Yo, these queers tryna rock me to sleep (Never)
But the show got a line
Around five blocks, read it and weep (Bitch)
Shit, I'm unexplained like a lot of things (What?)
If I see it and I want it, I'ma get it baby, ba-da-bing (Bing)
No doors on my jeep (Nope)
That's the case, I had to jump out
And Stacey Dash on police (Yo, I'm out! Yo, I'm out!)
I shoulda tried out for the Chiefs, damn (Uh)
A Hall of Famer at the least, damn (Uh)
This train won't stop, so my chick won't top (Nope)
I'm bouncing down the block in that '62 drop ('62 drop)
I'm so sincere, man, I shit you not (I shit you not)
I'm qualified to speak for my attorneys
Address the jury in a Shaq jersey (The black one)
This is one night only, Dragon vs. Phoenix (Yeah)
I think I'll fuck around and throw Aladdin on the remix (Yeah)
You can never score a point against my defense (No)
For many years, my mind been going off the deep end
Uh, like Tom Hanks with the soccer ball
You get turned into a taco (Mmm)
Uh, they thought Body was Bruce Willis in Morocco
(Hey, Bruce Willis? Bruce Willis?)
Like I said, they'll never find you in a pot roast (Never)
Uh, they'll never find you in a pot roast

[Chorus: Jah Tiger]
When the sun don't shine no more
And the rain keep bubbling down
And it can't exsolve the pain
Baby, you can call my name
When the sun don't shine no more
And the rain keep bubbling down
And it can't exsolve the pain
Baby, you can call my name

[Verse 2: Mayhem Lauren]
Yo, yeah, yo
Suicidal doors, bipolar necklaces
Army suit matchin' this coupe 'cause we perfectionists
Three's basic, forty-five colors on the Coogi
You see me but you never knew me, somethin' like a failed father
Up in Saks bustin' down racks
We out in Bal Harbour, certified
Looking like I'm powerin' appliance
Beefin' over money that can sour an alliance
Infused EVOO, sitting in the cabinet
Used to hold the work under the whip using a magnet
Outfits, controversial like I'm Russell Westbrook
Code name Lorraine, 'bout to hit you with a left hook
And fuck these old niggas actin' like they made us
We superceded everything they did so now they hate us
Take a look at my life, 'cause I'm historical
You the type to compliment a Rolly at the urinal
I'm the type to look up continents and then explore a few
Splash Disaronno in the coffee
This watch is costly, I tell the time with your salary
Every Gucci hoodie that's out, you couldn't style with me
Creamed spinach, vintage, tinted but still shine through
Easy 'fore we up in the spot, I might blind you
Shit

[Chorus: Jah Tiger]
When the sun don't shine no more
And the rain keep bubbling down
And it can't exsolve the pain
Baby, you can call my name
When the sun don't shine no more
And the rain keep bubbling down
And it can't exsolve the pain
Baby, you can call my name
Baby, you can call my name

[Outro: Action Bronson and Jah Tiger]
That's how you perform under pressure
Just cameras and stuff like that, and this man just went in there and knocked it out!
Rastafari, mon, Haile Selassie, mon

My life, my life
Yeah

[Verse]
It's been a minute but your boy back with it
Time to enjoy my chicken (Uh)
Motherfucker, this is big business
My product bangin' like a baked biscuit (Yeah)
Daddy back with his long white Cadillac
Now it's time to take a nappy-nap (Yup)
I'm so chill, it's like I'm in a circle playing hacky-sack
Embroidered dragon on the satin jacket, bastard
I'm always eatin' dinner
Still got the body of a swimmer and I don't like winter no more
You can catch me where the grass is greener
Blastin' Aaliyah (Uh)
Sleep with amethysts around the bed
Quartz go around my head like a force field
Open portals to the stars and it's all real (Yeah, and it's all real, yeah)
Open portals to the stars and it's all real
Now I'm layin' in the bed naked
My chick said I look like Kevin Bacon (For real)
I'm not sure if that's a compliment or not but I'll take it
Three dice in my hand, I might as well shake it (Head crack)
Mommy needs a kitchen set
She off the boat, she don't even know The Simpsons yet (That's crazy)
Told her, "Baby, you ain't livin' yet" (That's crazy!)
Nah, you ain't livin' yet
I might hang off the side of the mountain to trim a bonsai (Uh)
Perfect 10 on the swan dive, uh (Uh)
I could never do no wrong in my mom's eyes
Damn, time flies, and it don't wait for no one (Nobody)
Crash the Benz, buy a new one
And get my baby one too 'cause she a true one
I'll get the red, you get the blue one (Yeah)
I rolled up and then I blew one and she did too, uh

[Outro: ?]
Seen Tom Hardy on the street a few weeks ago
Tom Hardy knew what a real cowboy was
Jimmy Page and Led Zeppelin
Were the last ones with this much sauce

[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, now I'm ready, uh

[Verse 1]
Your pockets' slim pickings
Lay 'em out like grilled chicken
It's been an hour but that blunt still hittin' like a champion
Eatin' scampi with Batali, 50 feet from the Pantheon
And that's my life, 60k for the glass pipe
I'll break it on your head if you don't act right
There'll be bagpipes playin' like a cop died
While I wiggle 850s wearing foxhide
I pray to Jobu that we all get money and live life sunny with a gold pool
But the fact is, I stand alone like cactus
Hide money under tempurpedic mattresses, shit
You don't know the half of this (you bitch), nah (you bitch)
I serve the Jersey Shore Line with furs on (Uh)
It's my world, get my swerve on (Oh)
Install the turbo on the Cherokee for certain
It's like my life directed by Tim Burton
And daddy twisted off the henara
And I'm always on the center stage
Reminisce on better days in a hammock, reading Hemingway
Trying to get a better brain, then it rained
Let it rain (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I must've been a junkie in my past life, man
I must've been a junkie in my past life

[Verse 2]
Standin' in front of McDonald's, throwin' bottles
Ninety degrees, Timbs on
Ma, your kid's gone
A lot of graves to be pissed on
Land of the free I think wrong (I think wrong)
You know I got the drug so potent
Johnny took a hit
He died, came back, said, "That's that shit" (Goddamn!)
Two-twenty in Toyota Supras (Uh)
The shit sound like I'm shootin' off bazookas (Uh)
Flushing, Queens, no scare business here
Assemble weapons with no hand twitches here (Uh-uh)
Plus the strength of twelve oxen
Hold it down, though, there's no option
Let it rain (Uh)
I must've been a junkie in my past life, you know
I must've been a fiend in my past life, fuck
I must've been a junkie in my past life

[Outro]
Uh, these dudes trash like Michael Jordan jeans
Hahaha, that's it. I'm done

[Intro]
Yeah, uh, yeah

[Chorus]
I'd give my right lung if I could dunk a basketball one time
I'd give my right lung if I could dunk a basketball one time, uh

[Verse 1]
Seasons change weekly
Life in the big leagues
I can tell it's summer by the fig trees
Wiggle German Jeeps with kiss on 'em
Drop her top, she got a nice set of tits on her
Hardcore, got me feelin' like a fish outta water
Cruising U.S.A., I use six quarters
I got next

[Interlude]
Uh, ah man, ah man, uh

[Chorus]
I'd give my right lung if I could dunk a fucking ball just one time
I'd give my right lung if I could dunk a basketball one time
I'd give my right lung if I could dunk a ba–
Yo, fuck that shit, man

[Verse 2]
Fuck a critic
I'll have my little Spanish homie hit you with the Civic
Send the motherfucker spinnin'
I ain't like my chain so I threw it on a midget
I don't like the terms of the deal, do better on the digits
My Colombian princess'll come and hit you with the scissors
In the neck 'til it look like Twizzlers

[Outro]
Night night
Take me home

[Intro: Action Bronson]
Body needs a bat and a black leather to record
Here, take it, get ready

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is it, ah
The eighteen-wheeler papi, we'll drive it through your living room
While you watchin' Maury, true story
Uh, jump in the pool with the tool on me, shredded 240
Who gon' stop me? You and whose army?
Bronson come with the ninja grip
Wheelin' red ninjas down the strip
Phillies to my lip
High as Dark Knight, fuck it, let the card swipe
I'll take that yellow Lamborghini on the far right
As if I fit it
100k for me to spit it
I'm bout' to take a shitted on your fitted with no good luck
Just tragedy and hardship
Another loser on the corner doing card tricks (Ah)
I'm on the plane to Russia with a hard dick and a tank top from Target
Why this blunt taste like Starburst?
And why your girl cheating on you with a player from the San Diego Chargers?
Motherfucker, somehow we got Jeeps in jail
Tell the judge, "It's all good, go 'head and keep that bail"
It's me, you can't touch me
Like Hammer, shit gets crunchy
I do it for the glamour
I do it for my mama
I do it for my people
I do it for myself because there should've been a sequel
But there was complications during, birth givin', damn, man
Another night the Moon's shinin', the Earth twistin'
Boo, listen, Daddy swerved the coupe with conviction
Guns under the pillow like my tooth missin'
Everybody know it's me 'cause the roof missin'
You can see my smile from a mile
Yeah

[Verse 2: Big Body Bes]
Oooh, I'm up at bat!
Albanian baseball, I'm swingin' a hammer!
Fuck that!
We've been in the game our whole fuckin' lives!
Only God can bench us!
You was in the dayroom doin' splits!
I told you stop blockin' the TV!
I'm tryna watch Maury!
Ay hang that fuckin' phone up!
We've been ballin' our whole fuckin' lives!
You talkin' to the P-A-L champion!
I does this! Uh!
Fuck her 'til she hates me!
You gotta stab me if you love me
I'm down to die
You're scared to live

[Intro]
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Get 'em!

[Chorus]
I'm the man right now
I got the plan right now
Fuck that, I got the world in my hand right now

Uh, but I'ma show you how to move

Got the pistol in my pants
I got the pistol in my pants
I'ma show you how to dance, uh

[Verse 1]
The full moon make me loco
Like I sniffed a whole baseline of coco
Man, I took the speedboat for a joy ride
At one point I was flyin' baby, no lie
What'd I do to have a life like this?
Ass so fat on my wife like, shit!
And your boy got a stomach like Buddha
Chandelier hanging from the ceilin' of the Cougar, ah
50K in a swimtrunk in a brown paper bag like a kid's lunch
Thug passion in a sippy cup
A 100 dollars worth of haze in a blunt, bitch

[Chorus]
I'm the man right now
I got the plan right now
Fuck that, I got the world in my hand right now
I should be somewhere sunny, gettin' tanned right now
Uh, but I'ma show you how to move
I'ma show you how to dance
Got the pistol in my pants
I got the pistol in my pants
I'ma show you how to dance, uh

[Bridge]
One time for the big girls
Two time for the big girls
Ooh, you know that I need that
Uh, you can find me where the weed at
One time for the big girls

Ooh, you know that I need that
Uh, you can find me where the weed at

[Interlude]
Somebody sleepin' in my bed

[Verse 2]
All I do is bump Dru Hill
Damn, I should have took the blue pill, it's too real
I signed for two for 22 mil'
Option for the third
You ain't poppin' on the curb
We never see you in the street
And me, I'm always on the town
You hear me?

[Chorus]
I'm the man right now
I got the plan right now
Fuck that, I got the world in my hand right now
I should be somewhere sunny, gettin' tanned right now
Uh, but I'ma show you how to move
I'ma show you how to dance
Got the pistol in my pants
I got the pistol in my pants
I'ma show you how to dance, uh

[Verse 1]
Kelly Slater couldn't ride this wave
Or those dudes from The Endless Summer
We gettin' bent up 'til the sun up
You gettin' wet up if you run up
(Hold on, yeah, uh-huh)
Man, the blunt burn for longer
Than the whole Badu concert
And while I was walking back to the whip
And still had a fat clip
I threw it on the floor and said, "Shit"
The whole ride back I ain't say shit
'Cause sometimes I be devastated
I need the feeling like I'm levitating
In the lotus flower pose
With patience's with power shows
They say that I been sculpted with a Pharaoh's nose
I like to think that I got Darryl's nose
It's like it's 1986 again, in Flushing, Queens for real
Fuck the way you feel
I love the way I feel
It's 1986 again, in Flushing, Queens for real
Fuck the way you feel
Fuck the way you feel, pussy

[Chorous]

[Outro]
Lo duca e io per quel cammino ascoso
Intrammo a ritornar nel chiaro mondo;
E sanza cura aver d'alcun riposo
Salimmo sù, el primo e io secondo
Tanto ch'i' vidi de le cose belle
Che porta ‘l ciel, per un pertugio tondo
E quindi uscimmo a riveder le stelle

[Verse 1]
I'm jealous, I'm overzealous
When I'm down I get real down
When I'm high I don't come down
But I get angry, baby, believe me
I could love you just like that
And I can leave you just as fast

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too

[Chorus]
'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory, of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need you

[Verse 2]
You do shit on purpose
You get mad and you break things
Feel bad, try to fix things
But you're perfect, poorly wired circuit
And got hands like an ocean
Push you out, pull you back in

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause you see it from the same point of view

[Chorus]
'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory, of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need you

[Bridge]
I got issues, you got 'em too
And one of them is how bad I need you
I got issues, you got 'em too

[Chorus]
'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory, of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues (I got)
And one of them is how bad I need you (You got 'em too)
Yeah, I got issues (I got issues)
And one of them is how bad I need you (You got 'em too)
Yeah, I got issues (I got)
And one of them is how bad I need you

[Verse 1]
What you gonna do
What you gonna do when it don't work out
What you tryna prove
What you tryna prove when you act so proud
Hanging from a chain
Hanging from a chain and you lost your ground again
When your heart breaks down imma be around

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're broken you know I can be your shelter
When you come boy I promise I won't let go
Wrapped in roses our future could last forever
So pull me real close, oh

Hold on tight to my love
Hold on tight to my love (hey)
Don't you dare give it up

Lock you in my heart
Lock you in my heart, swallow down the key, oh yeah
Now i'm all you need we were meant to be

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're broken you know I can be your shelter
When you come boy I promise I won't let go

[Verse 1]
(Hey!)
I spend a whole night sippin' on a good time
Can't see the stop sign
What you gonna say?
(Hey!)
Wandering blindly
Please don't remind me
You're all that I see, what you gonna say?
(Hey!)

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need is someone livin' for the night ride (night ride)
I can feel it
You've been beaming like a spotlight (spotlight)
(Hey, hey!)

[Chorus]
I saw you stop and sta-a-a-are
Why don't you come 'round he-e-e-re?
You glow, oh-oh-oh

Why don't you make a mo-o-o-ove?
I see you shining throu-ou-ough
You glow, oh-oh-oh
Glow, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
You spend a whole night dancing with the wrong type
Why don't you make right?

We could be lightnin'
I know it's frightenin'
Why are you hidin'?
What you wanna say?

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need is someone livin' for the night ride (night ride)

[Verse 1]
I look at you, you look at me
You know what is on my mind
Sugary sweet, bon appétit
I can't wait to make you mine
Je t'aime, Je t'aime
You're heaven sent
Feels like red roses and wine
Whoever said romance is dead?

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I've been all 'round the world
Baby, nothing can compare to when you touch me
You know you take me there
This ain't no vacay, it's forever and a day
Baby, you take me there

[Chorus]
When we go to Paris
You make me go ooh-la-la
I know you like a challenge
So baby boy, here's my heart
I wanna go and go for hours
So take me up the Eiffel tower
When we go to Paris
You make me go ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la, ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la, ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
Taking our time seeing the sights
Got me screaming out your name
Feeling alive, a magical ride
Champagne bubbles in my brain
J'adore, J'adore, oui, mon amour
I know that you feel the same
Feeling couture, baby, I'm yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I've been all 'round the world
Baby, nothing can compare to when you touch me
You know you take me there
This ain't no vacay, it's forever and a day
Baby, you take me there

[Chorus]
When we go to Paris
You make me go ooh-la-la
I know you like a challenge
So baby boy, here's my heart
I wanna go and go for hours
So take me up the Eiffel tower
When we go to Paris
You make me go ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la, ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la, ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la

[Outro]
Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la-la-la
Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la-la-la

[Intro: Sample]
"Step aside, boy, I'mma check in that cash register."

[Verse: MF DOOM + Samples]
In lak'ech, planetary kin ("Step aside, boy...")
Red overtone dragon make your barathary spin (V-Villain!)
In the flesh with a band of merry men
Innocent civilians hari kari over yen ("Uh!")
Is it the end or for pretend?
I can neither condemn, nor defend
Cats that's more pussy than a sanitary napkin bin
Villain ran a scam on his imaginary rappin' friend ("Uh!")
Again; shame on us
We in the same game, put the blame on Gus
Study till your brain vomit
Just don't be out getting money when it rain comets
Armpits of funk, a bomb in the hunk-a-junk trunk
Metal palm on your ma's ba-dunk-a-dunk
In a park in a rave under three days of darkness
Tell a hater, "Behave and spark this"
With the fresh banana berry blend ("Step aside, boy...")
Countin' mad tens than when January begin
The other hand clutched to a pen
24/7—much to his chagrin
Used to drink gin, now, he only drink oxygen water
Mixed with shark fins that cleanse the toxins, sorta
And if they ever come get me
We were sippin' rum on a number one jitney (Ya wit' me?)
I can neither confirm nor deny
On account of the sherm—all high
Villain make 'em squirm till her perm all dry
Sperm to her eye, to a worm to a fly
It's germs and mad babies to kiss
Won't stop rockin', 'cept to maybe take a piss
Or soak his feet in a mineral oil vat ("Step aside...")
Holdin' a Rodin coil in his tin foil hat
Step aside, give him some room, player ("Step aside, boy...")
Till the end of days he'll be the ill doomsayer

[Outro: Samples]
"Step aside, boy, I'mma check in that cash register."
"Uh!"
*Grunting*

[Chorus: Eric Nally]
I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit (No!)
History is ours tonight
The people are chantin', can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Open up the doors on 'em, we playin' tonight
Bring on the marchin' band and turn on the stadium lights
They gon' learn from me, this is our church of The
Life of a champion, ugh, so Freddie Mercury
Sneakin' into Hov concerts in nosebleeds
The Hov bein' like "whoa"
Yeah, independent, keep killin' these people and don't sleep
Even the pigeon-toed still standin' on both feet, you know
It's obvious whose night this is
Grandparents immigrants, couple Irish kids
Victory in my grasp, gotta fight for this
The streets are ours this evening, goin' undefeated
I roll the dice against the staircase, uh huh
Steak season gotta marinate, uh huh
If I happen to die tonight, put my spirit in the stars
Bury me in the grave and carve "The history was ours"
Said I—

[Chorus: Eric Nally]
I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit (No!)
History is ours tonight
The people are chantin', can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Wake up, bitch, I ain't dead yet
And if I was in heaven, I'd be the best dressed
My closet lookin' like a swap meet in Texas
And maybe it's excess, but
We ain't cut from the same cloth, player
Talkin' to a boss player
Checks like a ball player
Easy money, all layups
I be pissin' off neighbors
Get up off my dick and get the finger like a cross-fader
I be in my lawn chair, star gazin' like, woo!
All praise to the most high
Your boy in his own J's, I made it to courtside
Remember the old days and playin' for co-signs
When labels offer me pay, I said that I won't sign
I took my weakness and turned that into a weapon
And when everybody doubted me, I turned that to my leverage
So I stand up on the stage, it wasn't planned, see it was destined
Look at fifty-thousand people with their hands into the heavens
Said I—

[Chorus: Eric Nally]
I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit (No!)
History is ours tonight
The people are chantin', can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

[Bridge: Eric Nally]
Didn't come this far to lose
Won't let death make a move
Might not mean much to you, but I'd die for this W
Let my life be something to prove
Every scrape, every fight, every cut, every bruise
I'll lay it all on the line, I'll re-write these rules
Victory in my sight, I will not lose

[Chorus: Eric Nally]
I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit (No!)
History is ours tonight
The people are chantin', can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
R.I.P. Willy Wonka, watch the roof come off (Willy)

'Cause I'm just 'bout that action boss, 'b-b-bout that action boss
I'm a motherfuckin' icon (icon)
Boots made of python (python)

[Chorus: Offset]

Bitch, I'm Willy Wonka

Bitch, I'm Willy Wonka
Bitch, I'm Willy Wonka

[Verse 2: Offset]
I got more flavor than Willy Wonka (flavor)
I took three bitches to Benihana's (woo)
I took a jet out to Punta Cana (pew, pew)
She got her lips 'round my my anaconda (oh!)
Hands on my hip when I grip the burner (brrrt)
Roll up some cookie, you smell the burner (cookie)
Willy Wonka probably pour deuce
Blowin' up this money like a flute
I pipe the shit up but can't pipe that bitch up (pipe)
No, Super Bowl ring, but not one Super Bowl (hey)
Ooh, what would you do for some dough? (huh?)
Flash, I took a picture for Vogue (flash)
I never play with my nose (no)
My wrist is a 'fridgerator 'cause it's cold (cold)
Pull up in the frog, I suppose (skihi)

[Outro]
Gemini

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I wanna be sober, but I love gettin' high
Wanna give it a hundred percent, but I'm too afraid to try
I wanna be faithful, but love hookin' up with randos
I wanna live by the law, but still think like a vandal
I wanna get exercise, but I'm too lazy to workout
I want all the finer things, but don't wanna go to work now
I wanna go outside, take my family to the beach
I wake up in the morning, first thing I do is look at a screen, at a screen

[Pre-Chorus: Macklemore]
Wanna live freely, why isn't it so easy?
I should read a book, but I keep watchin' this TV
And I know this lifestyle doesn't really feed me
I just tune out to the voice inside that's speaking

[Chorus: Dan Caplen]
All my little problems keep on buildin' up, and buildin' up
All my good intentions just ain't good enough, can't find the love
So I smoke until my lungs are full
And drink until I lose my cool
Apology's my middle name, and one day I will change, but
I'm okay with who I am today
I'm okay with who I, who I am today

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I want world peace, but I wanna watch Worldstar
I know that I should stay home, and still wanna kick it where the girls are
I wanna be a feminist, but I'm still watchin' porno
I wanna eat healthy, but I'ma eat this DiGiornos
We live on social media, read other people's thoughts
Tweet about justice, but don't show up to the march
I think about the earth, and I think about the eco
What am I willin' to sacrifice at the expense of my ego?

[Pre-Chorus: Macklemore]
Wanna live freely, why isn't it so easy?
I should read a book, but I keep watchin' this TV
And I know this lifestyle doesn't really feed me
I just tune out to the voice inside that's speaking

[Chorus: Dan Caplen]
All my little problems keep on buildin' up, and buildin' up
All my good intentions just ain't good enough, can't find the love
So I smoke until my lungs are full
And drink until I lose my cool
Apology's my middle name, and one day I will change, but
I'm okay with who I am today
I'm okay with who I, who I am today
I'm okay with who I am today
I'm okay with who I, who I am today

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin' merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

[Verse 3: Macklemore & Kesha]
Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days

[Bridge: Kesha]
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I said "woo", don't make me
Break out the velour suit and the Stacey's
Give me a baseline and a break beat
Fuck around on the dance floor, make a baby, watch me
Got a cane with a gold tip
Gucci ice cream tat type flow, bitch
I could make it rain, but I won't, shit
'Cause I'm cheap, motherfucker and I don't tip (I don't)
Watch out, I'm about to pull this new watch out, ta dow
Puttin' in work, we don't clock out
How 'bout, we go and cut the rug at the pow-wow
Get to movin' and breakin' and poppin' like wild style
Electric boogaloo
She movin' that body like a booty in a hula hoop
Gave her that look like, "You don't know what I'd do to you"
And she was like "Oh my God, I just Googled you"
Jheri curl, mullet on some Mario Lopez
Last call, then we go and hit the coat check
Lyft outside, buenos noches
Now tell that motherfucker, take us back to the homestead, gone

[Chorus: Otieno Terry]
Now take your shoes off in here
We don't need to talk (we don't need to talk)
I said "I'm shooting for the moon, baby"
Now watch me walk (watch me walk)
I don't believe in gravity, honey
I'm an astronaut (I'm an astronaut)
Just wanna see you levitate, and I'ma watch (I'ma watch)

[Post-Chorus: Otieno Terry]
Whoa whoa whoa (Whoa whoa whoa)
Yeah yeah yeah (Yeah yeah yeah)
Hey now (Hey now)
Alright now (Alright now)
Gon' levitate (Gon' levitate)
Gon' levitate (Gon' levitate)

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Oh shit, she just gave me her number (number)
You now dealing with the Irish hustler (hustler)
Like a 2002 Usher (Usher)
Let that burn, nah, I'm wearing a rubber
Plaid on me, dancin' like a one man army
Turn a funeral into a dance party
Meet the Holy Ghost, I'ma catch me a body
You don't wanna see me when I start doin' the zombie, Thriller
Master P, barbecue chip, Percy Miller
That's a rap snack, I'm a fat dad, got some fat abs
Sweatin' like I'm eatin' jalapeños out in Baghdad
You ain't on the level, got a medal for the flash dance
You ain't fucking gigging, what the hell you getting mad at?
I pulled up in that purple thang
I didn't dress like Prince in Purple Rain (oh my God)
Lions, cheetahs like the circus came
And I should charge everybody to observe the game
Pour shots, big up and fuck cops
Invite the whole neighborhood to a party on my block
Up rock a booty, juicier than a cumquat
Boyfriend mean muggin', little buddy fuck off

[Chorus: Otieno Terry]
Now take your shoes off in here
We don't need to talk (we don't need to talk)
I said "I'm shooting for the moon, baby"
Now watch me walk (watch me walk)
I don't believe in gravity, honey
I'm an astronaut (I'm an astronaut)
Just wanna see you levitate, and I'ma watch (I'ma watch)

[Post-Chorus: Otieno Terry]
Whoa whoa whoa (Whoa whoa whoa)
Yeah yeah yeah (Yeah yeah yeah)
Hey now (Hey now)
Alright now (Alright now)
Gon' levitate (Gon' levitate)
Gon' levitate (Gon' levitate)

[Outro: Otieno Terry]
Gon' get down, we gon' get down
Get down so you gotta get up
Don't sit down, don't sit down
Two steppin' 'til the sun come up, come on
We gon' get down, get down
Get down so you gotta get up
Don't sit down, don't sit down
Two steppin' til the sun come up, come on
Gon' get down, we gon' get down
Get down so you gotta get up
Don't sit down, don't sit down
Two steppin' til the sun come up, come on
We gon' get down, get down
Get down so you gotta get up
Don't sit down, don't sit down
Two steppin' til the sun come up, come on

[Intro: Macklemore]
Got a Guns N' Roses T-shirt, and never listened to the band
Just being honest, I just thought that shit looked cool
Hold up, do you know who I am?

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Turn the block to Woodstock
Retire? Don't think that I could stop
Jet-ski the way I ride the beat
And fuck your wave, I'ma die knowing that I did me
I got some words and I cannot let them die in me
This is arena status
Our bones end up in the ground, does it even matter?
Make some good music, get what you put in
Get out and go and leave the planet
Now what the hell did you think this is?
We're born, we're dying, in-between we live
Love, prosper, hands to the sky, catch a gospel
Roll the dice, nah, I ain't betting on tomorrow
Chain looking like Orion's Belt
Jacket looking something like a lion pelt
Had to take a break and find myself
They put me in a box by myself
The same writers criticizing my rhymes
Are the same writers that gentrifyin' Bed-Stuy
I can't even see the hate, I should probably check my eyes
I got 50,000 phones pointed at me in the sky

[Pre-Chorus: Reignwolf]
Between a rock and a hard place
Cold blunted with a stone face
Firebreather, firebreather
Born under a blood moon
But the sun is coming up soon
Firebreather, firebreather

[Chorus: Reignwolf]
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Firebreather, firebreather
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Firebreather, yeah, firebreather

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
What the fuck you think I'm doing it for?
Hungry like it's my rookie year, and I'm new to the sport
The game is tied up, they looking at you in the fourth
Do you take the shot or pass it, this is ten-thousand hours
And I'm working on my Master's, liabilities, and assets
And I'm showing up to practice, shooting early, getting baskets
There's no father to my style, I'm just a freckle-faced bastard
An animal in the jungle, running, hunting with a habit (woo)
Abracadabra that motherfucker is magic
It's '81 and Madonna is on me dancing
I'm sorry momma, I got it, I know I should mind my manners
I'd probably go double-platinum if I could think of an ad-lib
I'm jazz Prince, I rap a lot
I grew up on Scarface, now Brad's my dawg (woo)
Irish goodbye, sayonara and we mobbin'
Put the nail in the coffin, motherfucker, I'm on one

[Pre-Chorus: Reignwolf]
Between a rock and a hard place
Cold blunted with a stone face
Firebreather, firebreather
Born under a blood moon
But the sun is coming up soon
Firebreather, firebreather

[Chorus: Reignwolf]
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Firebreather, firebreather
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Firebreather, yeah, firebreather

[Intro: King Draino]
Don't nobody give a damn what all that shit talking 'bout, man, we tryna hear some of that, that "Girl, shake your ass, shake your ass, shake your ass," you know what I'm sayin'? I'm tryna get that in my life
Gemini

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, that's my shit (that's my shit)
Oh, juice (wet), three-piece, crisp (damn)
Saucey, dripping (dripping), CEO of this (CEO)
Curry, wavy, my undertow's a bitch
Shoutout to my city, know I really does this
Third time's a charm, I'm feeling triumphant (I want it)
I put a little gold up on my bicuspids
They can only see my eyes inside of the Cutlass (Who's he?)
She may be vanilla cream, baby her butt big
They treat me like McGregor when I'm out in Dublin (They do? Yes they do)
My momma don't like it when I be cussin' (She don't)
But fuck these motherfuckers, momma, I don't trust them (fuck 'em)
It's plush up in the bucket, look, don't touch it, thought you knew
In the pocket, like I'm Russel, man I hustle, watch me move
In the summer watch me fuck around, I'm 'bout to drop the roof
She hopped up in the whip and then I taught her how to play the flute, play the flute

[Chorus: King Draino]
Goddamn, they hatin' on a player (Why that?)
Don't understand, they need to get they weight up (Okay)
Shazam, I'ma have to David Blaine 'em (What you doin'?)
Emoji hands, I'm praying for them haters (Amen)

[Post-Chorus: Macklemore]
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Ay little mama, aqui
Skin tone macchiato, we eating mahi-mahi
On Miami Beach, we have a party la-dee-da-dee
On my B-I-E 'til I D-I-E, I think I'm king (I think I'm king)
You didn't think that I would get the peacoat (No!)
Unbutton that motherfucker, nothing but a speedo (Look!)
Who's that peeking in my window?, Cee-Lo
I was on that Khujo, that Big Gipp and that T-Mo (What?)
Dolce and Gabbana, cappuccino, gelato
In a grotto out in Cabo, amateurs so apollo
Whip this bulky like Costco, I'm out here and dodging 5-0
I hit the block with that top low, a dookie rolled with a poncho
But it ain't about to rain on me
Tryna sing up in this bitch, but I ain't on key
Now I stay genuine, I'm the same old G
Feeling like John Havlicek, check, with these eight gold rings
Play the flute

[Chorus: King Draino]
Goddamn, they hatin' on a player (Why that?)
Don't understand, they need to get they weight up (Okay)
Shazam, I'ma have to David Blaine 'em (What you doin'?)
Emoji hands, I'm praying for them haters (Amen)

[Post-Chorus: Macklemore]
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay

[Verse 1]
I paid my dues, now I'm really on
Prince to the SEA, put my city on
Left the condo for a bigger home
Everything clean like my chicken bones
I work hard, I work hard for it
Had to go back to the chalkboard
We was tourin' countries all foreign
Now I don't gotta open car doors
So say what's up to my haters at the club tonight
I'll be busy singing my daughter lullabies
When she sleep, I hit the booth and get super lit
Living my dreams I can sleep in another life
Living my dreams I can sleep in another life, yeah
The tensions so thick, you can cut with a butter knife, yeah
If that's your example of artists, then what am I?
You lied, they consume it, you say that you boomin'
That's probably why Metro don't trust you, gosh

[Chorus]
I am not surprised, I am not surprised, yeah
Had to optimize, then monopolize, yeah
We turn out the lights, then we come alive, yeah
All these dollar signs, ain't no 9 to 5, yeah
I am not surprised, I am not surprised, yeah
Had to optimize, then monopolize, yeah
We turn out the lights, then we come alive, yeah
All these dollar signs, ain't no 9 to 5, yeah

[Verse 2]
Ten million sold, go and look at that
Ain't no middleman gonna get any of that
I suck at math, but I know how to add (1 + 1)
That's a whole lotta money
Bought my baby's momma momma a pad
Wow, do a spin move on stage looking like the white James Brown
There's a whole lotta people in this arena, you know it sold out (sold out, sold out)
Took my daughter on the road and she pointing at me from the crowd (from the crowd, from the crowd)
Saying, "That's my daddy, top 5 on stage," no doubt
In God we trust, God we trust
They ain't came in the same way
They are not with us, not with us
Came back and it's game time
This the follow-up, and now I'm up
I decided that was not enough
Dopps and Budo with that final touch
Competition, go and line 'em up
I run this shit, I run this shit, put that on my momma
I done this shit, I done this shit, since I was pushin' a Honda
No one hit shit, no one hit shit, platinum plaques in mi casa
And my accountant's dead (rest in peace)
Couldn't count the commas

[Chorus]
I am not surprised, I am not surprised, yeah
Had to optimize, then monopolize, yeah
We turn out the lights, then we come alive, yeah
All these dollar signs, ain't no 9 to 5, yeah
I am not surprised, I am not surprised, yeah
Had to optimize, then monopolize, yeah
We turn out the lights, then we come alive, yeah
All these dollar signs, ain't no 9 to 5, yeah

[Outro]
Gemini

[Chorus: Donna Missal]
We got that bad love, but it taste like medicine
I never had love, so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought I'd have to choose
Between paradise and you

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I still creep on your 'Gram, oh
See you with you and your man, oh
And I scroll, and see the pictures you deleted
Like the history ain't happened, long as we cannot see it
Getting back is insanity, and we repeat it
Momma said we need counseling
But I can't reason with a terrorist
Oh, this is embarrassing
You ain't Cinderella, ain't no pumpkin, turn them into fuckin' carriages
You create a narrative, people ask me "Where's she been?"
Send her packing, now she's living back out at her parents' crib
Fight, break up, we fuck, we fight, break up, you know the deal
Vent to friends and tell them, "This the last time, I'm for real"
You text me, then the next thing you know, I'm behind the wheel
Pull up, fuck you in the backseat thinking this will help us heal
There is no use for you texting my phone
Got FOMO the minute I walked out the door
Can't get in the gate because I changed the code
Now you can toast to the love we don't make anymore

[Chorus: Donna Missal]
We got that bad love, but it taste like medicine
I never had love, so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought I'd have to choose
Between paradise and you
And now I'm free (Oh oh)
I'm free, yeah (Oh oh)
I'm free, yeah (Oh oh)
Now I'm free, yeah (Oh, oh)
(And now I'm free)

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Back on the "Why didn't you text me?"
Back on the "Shit, I was busy"
Back to us raising our voices
Back on that nobody's listening
Back to those horrible choices
Back on you moving back home
'Cause I would rather live in Hell than get comfortable sleeping alone
Back to that lying deception, back to the self-will
Back on that "Well, she don't do it, and I know that somebody else will"
You cheated, I cheated, you cheated, I cheated, I mean it, please Father, forgive us
The dirt that you've done and the secrets that we swept up under the rug that are gonna die with us
And I tried to cut the ties so many times
That I finally gave up on the scissors
We are both sinners, if we both lie to ourselves
That is just selfish, that isn't commitment
I try to hold it and I try to hold it and
Numb to it all and ignoring it
I'm just searching where the closure is
Going in circles, not noticing
But in my heart, I know I'm not over it

[Chorus: Donna Missal]
We got that bad love, but it taste like medicine
I never had love, so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought I'd have to choose
Between paradise and you
And now I'm free (Oh oh)
I'm free, yeah (Oh oh)
I'm free, yeah (Oh oh)
Now I'm free, yeah (Oh oh)
(And now I'm free)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I know you're troubled, girl
I seen you on Tumblr
February, dressing like a summer girl
Mini skirt on, no underwear (Whoo!)
I wanna take you shopping
Blow a bag of Prada
She say "Those clothes expensive"
So we end up at Zara
Late night, hit the city
And we go out to Target
Like why we go to Target?
This electric wheelchair's poppin'
You read bell hooks and Cornell West
You make me quesadillas when I'm stressed
And be like, "Boy, you better clean up the mess
And take out the trash before you come back"
Stay in, amen, don't fall asleep 'til the AM
Wake up in the morning and I'm prayin'
Sunlight made its way in, gave me angels
And I hold 'em, paint a mural so golden (alright)
And my girl, she sweet as hell
But we'll have a world star moment
Like "I'll fuck this bitch up" (whoa)
Yes you will, my darling (aha)
Type of girl fight for the family (she will)
And jump in if there's a problem (progress)
But not today, the ocean waves
I can't complain, I hold her waist
My only ace until we're old and gray
See, that's my baby

[Chorus: Abir]
Wave after wave, yeah, we're catching the vibe, yeah
Feeling alive, yeah
Ten out of ten, I know you down to ride, yeah
Always by my side, yeah
My baby, know I know
Had to hold you down for sure
You the only one, you the only one, yeah
You the only one, you the only one in my life
You the only one, you the only one, yeah
You the only one, you the only one in my life

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
And if you feel some type of way, then just say that (say that)
I'm on my way to make it back, talking ASAP (ASAP)
And we can do all types of things in this Maybach (Maybach)
Kick off your shoes, relax your feet, while I play that (play what?)
That 90's R&B (alright)
Yeah, House Party 3 (ok)
Come spend the night with me (let's get it)
And bring your toiletries
You got your girls with you
I brought my boys with me
Playing that Shai Adina Howard, and that Jodeci (Jodeci)
Do you want a back rub, do you want a massage?
On my birthday, it's my birthday
Do you think we can menage? Sike
El Dorado inside, all suede
Let's go half on some offspring
Girl you flyer than an osprey
We ain't doing a damn thing all day

[Chorus: Abir]
Wave after wave, yeah, we're catching the vibe, yeah
Feeling alive, yeah
Ten out of ten, I know you down to ride, yeah
Always by my side, yeah
My baby, know I know
Had to hold you down for sure
You the only one, you the only one, yeah
You the only one, you the only one in my life
You the only one, you the only one, yeah
You the only one, you the only one in my life

[Chorus: Dave B]
Corner store, 2 A.M
Got some mango Hi-Chews, a bag of chips
Rollin' through the city and we hide behind the tints
In the Benzo, gut the Swisher out the window, then we dip
Posted at the corner store, posted at the corner store
Posted at the corner store, posted at the corner store

[Verse 1: Travis Thompson]
Okay, 2 A.M., I'm posted (I'm posted)
Dope all in my Jansport
Movin', the youth I run with
Might treat your block like a dance floor
Finesse the rent out the landlord
Mama said "Pull your pants up"
Bendin' corners and scraper, I'm loyal to 'til my bands up
I'm pushin', movin' work, improvin'
There's commas on the way
Put the pussy on pedestal
Blow the medical to the face
It's evident on my face
Rollin' heaven in my new Wraith
Declinin' the call from labels
Still grubbin' on struggle plates
They all wanna know whats next, shit, I don't even know myself
Nah, I don't wanna hear your best shit, I don't really need your help
I'm posted and smokin' just like my uncles before me
I politic with the stagnant, forget my day by the mornin', it go

I grew up on Old English, that's that malt liquor (Aha)
Never smoked a Backwood, it was all Swishers (Uh-uh)
Before I pulled a fake ID out on a bartender
I was on a bag of cubensis, walkin' off kilter (Shrooms, shrooms, shrooms)
We ain't have no common sense
Do that dirt and hop that fence
Roastin', talkin' shit, we mobbin', I just got my momma's whip (Hell yeah)
We blow dank out that window, right with your tape up, it's garbage
I used to roll up a spliff, and I mixed the weed with the Parliament, ayy (Oh shit)
Couldn't tell you 'bout our future (Nah)
We was on the corner, posted (Yeah)
Wasn't thinking 'bout tomorrow (Uh)
On the rooftop smokin' (Smokin')
Swisher guts in the Funyun bag (Yes)
I was just doing my thing (My thing)
Hit the hot food aisle (Uh-uh)
Got the gizzards instead of the wings (Gizzards)
But it's all love, run my route, play the course
Sweatpants, shorts, wife beater, posted on the porch
Reminiscin', 2:11, and we smokin' on some 'Ports
And gettin' hella faded
Gotta re-up so you know we 'bout to hit the—

Takin' my time, workin' it out
Countin' the coin, breakin' my back
All in my loins, all on my nerves
Can't get a break, but that's my snack
Call me Almond Joy, mama's boy
Can't afford none of what you order
Shit, I'm hardly on, not quite broke
Off the wall, but on the border
Pushin' pen to the paper for peso
They wanna Lego
Close construction, no room for the huevos
You gotta love it
That's Benny, he like Montego, he save you like the gecko
He not gon' pay to date you, you guessed it, OG Maco
Boy so wonderful
Them cheap thrills, they come and they go, yeah
Talkin' 'bout we saved you a seat, boy, boy
They don't want no one to know, long as you comfortable, yeah

That's all (Gemini)
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference

[Chorus: Dan Caplen]
My troubles test me on the daily
They say that only God can save me
I think I'm slowly goin' under
But I won't ever tell my brother
And now I wonder where's the good gone?
'Cause I can't find no miracles 'til I go home
Oh, I wonder where's the good gone?
Need to find me some hope
Where's my miracle? Where's my miracle?
Where's my miracle?

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
It's been a long night
I just might wake up on the wrong side
I tell myself it'll be alright
Sunlight peakin' through the dark sky
Bottle it up, fall in the cut, all out of luck
Drownin' in this quicksand and I'm swallowin' mud
I taste temptation and I fall in and out of love
Grab her hand, taxi cab, in God we trust

[Pre-Chorus: Macklemore]
You can wish on all the stars, way up in the galaxy
They want you to fall apart, so they can have a piece
I threw a hundred in a wishing well
Ad then I came back for a refund
Said "all this pressure just might tip the scale"
Seen it before, it's just a re-run
So keep runnin', ay, I keep runnin'

[Chorus: Dan Caplen]
My troubles test me on the daily
They say that only God can save me
I think I'm slowly goin' under
But I won't ever tell my brother
And now I wonder where's the good gone?
'Cause I can't find no miracles 'til I go home
Oh, I wonder where's the good gone?
Need to find me some hope
Where's my miracle? Where's my miracle?
Where's my miracle?

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I got some secrets, I got some secrets
My palms together, prayin', but I keep on thinkin' 'bout evil
Snake-bit in blood, and the poison, it ain't leaving
Wanna sabotage everything, one and only enemy
If these walls could talk, they'd have a lot of blackmail
Is karma real or not? I can't tell
The Devil complimented me and said "You dance well"
The praise won't save me, and neither will the fan mail
I'd be a sinner, but thank God I'm not religious
And I'm addicted, drugs and women, there's no difference
I know the right, but the wrong is just so tempting
I've got a phobia, fear of what I'm missing, amen

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Moms and pops, they used to take us to church
Saying "If you don't believe, then the prayin' don't work"
With the beatbox I got free on the pavement, I'm first
Music brought me to my knees, I found faith in a verse
So dear Spirit, I know I gotta take a chance
And my mistakes and shortcomings finally made a man
I got some issues, I got problems, gotta make amends
I watch my daughter giggin' in the kitchen to the safety dance
This shit right here, we call love
You can't put that into words, but feel that in your gut
The goosebumps on my arms, I watch the fallin' sun
Kiss my daughter and say "Thank God" as I wake up
Oh I know, yeah, I know now
And I'm up, but I'm aware that it goes down
Travelled 'round the globe, I needed to slow down
And no better feeling riding 'round in my hometown

[Chorus: Xperience]
Hope I'm feeling this good when it's Monday mornin'
Been doing my own thing, can't say that I'm sorry
And I can only pray someday that we'll all be
More than just okay, we can be so free
And I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah
I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Oh my God, oh my God
No other person on this earth could ever take my job
This my life, it was planned, I can't take it off
Bruised elbows, knees scraped, I learned to take a fall
My mistake, my mistake
Karma waits, karma waits
But I'll be brave, I'll be brave
The pain seems more than I could take, I could take
I learn more from loss than the gain, than the gain
New state of mind, I feel like taking my time
And that laidback reclines, still pushing that '85 Lac
Windows down, city passing by, like a timelapse
The weatherman be trippin', so that ceiling got that white rag, ay
We came so far, just some kids in the city tryna make some art
Leave some change in the fountain, hope to make my mark
You see I was given a role, never played my part

[Chorus: Xperience]
Hope I'm feeling this good when it's Monday mornin'
Been doing my own thing, can't say that I'm sorry
And I can only pray someday that we'll all be
More than just okay, we can be so free
And I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah
I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah

[Outro]
I can have a life to– I have life today. I rely on that constant communication with my higher power, more so than anybody these days. And I realized, that's kinda all I need. And then, of course, y'all appear, right, y'all appear, things appear, and situations appear. And I realize, that's God working through me, if I allow myself to be that vessel.

[Chorus: Saint Claire]
Fill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away
Crack my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
If I could read the world my notebook and these thoughts in it
Would they judge me or love me for what I've written?
Tryna get closer to spirit that enters the body
It's the vessel like I'm not in it
In fifty-something years, I won't be here
There'll be a kid with some headphones coverin' his ears
Walkin' 'round a hallway, dreamin' of ideas
Find himself in the sound 'cause music is a mirror
What you looking for? What you headed towards?
What's your name worth when they mention yours?
When you leave here, are you stepping forward?
Can you remember your intention when they question yours?
They're gonna question yours, they're gonna question yours
I've been to rock bottom and I'm headed North
If you don't love yourself, what's the respect for?
If you don't love life, the check won't correct yours
Excavate

[Chorus: Saint Claire]
Fill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away
Crack my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain
And I found peace
And I found peace
And I found peace

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I had this vision of my death
Surrounded by people I love and respect
In the baby blue Cadillac hearse
Pullin' me 'round the block that I rep
The greatest fear that I've ever kept
Is dying with regrets
Like was I just alive for success?
Or did I leave a better life for the rest?
My greatest achievement isn't the dollars
My greatest achievement isn't the followers
My greatest achievement isn't the accolades
My greatest achievement is my daughter
Wakin' up in the morning, bein' a father
Watchin' the light kiss her eyelids
Hearin' her sing along to Chance
And bein' like, "Yeah, that's my kid"
The light started to glow
And the saxophone from Coltrane started to blow
Tender, laying in the snow, turn on my headphones
Couple miles to go before I run out of road
Excavate

[Chorus: Saint Claire]
Fill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away
Crack my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain
And I found peace
And I found peace
And I found peace

[Outro: Macklemore]
Hold me up into the light and study every part of me
I'm an open book, no, I don't mind, but sometimes I'm hard to read
Just flesh and bone, I'm headed home, but this life is so hard to leave
But who am I when they cut the lights and nobody's watching me?
Hold me up into the light and study every part of me
I'm an open book, no, I don't mind, but sometimes I'm hard to read
Just flesh and bone, I'm headed home, but this life is so hard to leave
But who am I when they cut the lights and nobody's watching me?
Gemini

[Verse 1]
It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, until the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

[Chorus]
It was just an old plywood boat
75 Johnson and an electric choke
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
I would make it whine
He'd say, "You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides"
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

[Verse 2]
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip, we'd haul trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

[Chorus]
It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower, girl
You're doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

[Bridge]
Soon I'll be grown up
With daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say

[Chorus]
It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say
Steer it left, and turn it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
Oh, he let me drive
Oh, he let me drive

[Outro]
It's just an old plywood boat
With a 75 johnson
And electric choke

[Verse 1]

I felt her stare
A timeless glance surpassing infinity with beauty that I could not bare
This woman was rare
Ruminated infatuation with the essence of life encased in the shape of the ever match of the metronome of eternal bliss
These eyes are putting my hands around her hips
Dancing to the sound of two hearts synchronized by a kiss
I could not resist
But to look back and imagine us intertwined soul and mind holy divine love is by but I
Turned away
Becoming entrap I fear with the thought that my heart would be empty until the day that love would serenade
A song that was requested but was never played
A hopeless romantic with dreams of a soulmate that just been slain
So I said
Wanting to turn back had to turn back but the treasure that I Searched for my whole life
Would turn from gold to black
In an instant
My intuition forced me to go the distance
A-hundred-n'-eighty degree turn and hope with me and beauty With love hung from a rope as fate sculpt
Inside my ear
She waves the finger from her lap and silently mouthed the words "come here"
Sweat poured on my face terrified from the daughter fear
And as i walked toward my companion I felt that my destiny was near

[Verse 2]
I approached my stranger
A modern-day Mary and the manger
A woman who by existing did mankind a favor
She sweet taste of life that death wishes it could savor
If beauty could be bought in the bible
She would be the thing for God's savior
Stood right in front of my face
I stuck my hand out to shake hers
She pushed it away and grabbed my waist in an embrace
It seemed like for hours we were in that pose
My hands explored the flesh of her back exposed by the revealing Dress that she had chose
To wear
We were rhythm I was the kick she was the snare
The feeling of knowing that this is it is so rare
She stroked her fingers through my hair
I felt the moment for what it was worth if I should spend the eternal harmony with my soul in the earth
She had given birth to creation filling my vows with the emotion of love combined with the constellations above I knew that I had found
My lifelong companion and after all those years I was alone
She grabbed my hand and whispered in my ear "let's go home"

[Verse 3]
We made love
Possessed by the spirits enchant approaching human being Separate entities rejoicing as one
Being
Flesh red
I touched her breasts
As a mother firsts touches her infant
Her body was my canvas and I painted an in-depth picture to distinguish
The feeling of being in-sync with
A companion that would never leave you
She spoke only to say "I need you"
Every push was a pulsation of love's rejuvenation
She was freedom and I was a slave who had touched my whole life with liberation
Souls united under the force-field of trust
The orgasm was everlasting exceeding the depths of passion past the earth's crust
I had licked the juice from the sweetest nectar she returned the favor swallowing my soul the feeling that would last forever I remember
We held each other
Our bodies fit together like a missing piece of a puzzle
Our minds were one organism
Congruent
She got up to leave
"Hey yo wait I never asked you your name"
She turned around looked into my soul
And silently whispered "Music"
Her name was Music !

[Interlude]
Good evening fellow earth people
Tonight I would like to take you on a trip
A trip with our minds
We're going to do something a little unique this evening
Start by just relaxing in your chairs and feel your consciousness
Feel where you are
I think most will find your self awareness
Somewhere up here in the cranium
That's where I dwell, that's where your center of awareness is
Self awareness, mind
Self awareness, mind

[Instrumental]

Cranium
We're going to do something a little unique this evening

[Instrumental]

Self awareness, mind
Cranium

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
That's where I dwell
That's where your center of awareness is
Mind

[Interlude 2]
People tend to believe
On the basis of outside authority
Now in no way
In the science of mind do we ask you to assume any bidding
On the basis of outside authority
We ask you to think for yourself, to turn within
To experiment with the principles
And see
That they are demonstrable
They work, these writings, the scriptures, the sacred literature
A great (?)
Which is a source of an interior power by which to live
This is where it ties in with the faith
Because without the mystical element in any religion
The religion is sterile
It has no dy-dynamism
It isn't going anywhere, it isn't going to do anything for you
Because it's all, you're on a head trip
(You're on a head trip)
(You're on a head trip)
(You're on a head trip)
There are definite (?) we need to teach you
That make you live more comfortably in yourself
And with other people
Both in regard to the physical laws of nature
And to the psychological aspects of man
None of this scientific evidence means anything
And the breakthroughs and knowledge
Will still lead the West spiritually bankrupt
If we continue on our negativistic course
Today's answer, of course, rests in learning to effectively meditate
Coming to know the real purpose of life
To return to man's victorious spirit
Kingdom of heaven that is within (within, within, within, within)

[Intro: Martin Luther King Jr.]
I am happy to join with you today
In what will go down in history
As the greatest demonstration of freedom
In the history of our nation
I have a dream
That my four little children
Will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged
By the color of their skins
But by the content of the character
I have a dream today

[Chorus: Macklemore]
This the moment
January 13th has giving birth to the resurrection of the dream
Putting liberation first, 1929 until the present
The movement has begun
The infinite anthem of freedom will forever be sung
This the moment
January 13th has giving birth to the resurrection of the dream, yo
Putting liberation first, 1929 until the present
The movement as begun
The infinite anthem of freedom will forever be sung

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I have a dream, a dream deeply rooted inside of my soul
The time is now in the present for us to take control

[Intro: Kelly Montague]
There's a light inside for you to hold onto

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
My artwork is a collection of my life through the perception of the First person
Dimension the pen is an extension of my life
A reciprocal relationship one that never stops giving
But I am giving my soul and dedicating my spirit to the realm of (?) With all the (?) philosophies
And positivity will keep ca-tastrophes
And (?) or in actuality my strategy
Is for all to hear and see but in reality the earth
Shakes and quakes and Ima say it (?)
My words the world rotates and we as humans physically
Migrate or die
And I must (?) that can occur I have a message
And thought of my words and my things becoming (?)
With the potential of the power that I posses
The words of meaning bare witness to an inspiration of progress And if any audience or individual is affected by my music
Then my service is of purpose and I will continue with my Movement
Experience of poetry has it's (?)
Rhythmic revolution is fueled by injustice globally
So I act locally and to my surrounding and history
Preaching peace to each who seek to (?)
Inner outer aura internally externally creates energy
Seeking to find oneself as a conversation with self you must Discuss
For the potentially possessed is within us all
The question is do you make your energy a minus or a plus

[Chorus: Kelly Montague]
It's only, only, only lifetimes
It's only, only, only lifetimes
It's only, only, only lifetimes
Only

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
When I speak of us it is all who (?) time into distraction
(?) and we as us must discuss taking action
Making Babylon into fact forming one community
Of revolution of thinkers putting meaning into the word unity
Over kicks and snares the beat meets and greets the discussion
The time (?) were doing nothing
And everything is something but society lowered the expectations Put restrictions on dreams and installed false limitations

[Verse 1]
Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don't care, but can you listen?
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain around my neck
And now it's missing

[Chorus]
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're looking at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?

[Verse 2]
You said, "Don't treat me badly"
But you said it so sadly, so I did the best I could
Not thinking you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry, why should you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love when your love is never for me?

[Chorus]
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're looking at me like I'm see-through

[Verse 1]
I'm not crying on the phone when you call
What's the use in begging you to stay?
I'm not trying to save us anymore
Cut me loose, 'cause you're too far away

[Chorus]
To make me feel better, make it alright
To give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo, push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo
Seven days

[Verse 2]
I'll give all my weapons to you
We've said it all, no more bones to break
I'm done thinking that we might just spark enough
We're broken glass waiting to be washed away

[Chorus]
Can't make me feel better, make it alright
Give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo, push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo
Seven days

[Bridge]
If you love me, let me go
If you love me, leave limbo

[Chorus]
Can't make me feel better, make it alright
Can't give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo, just push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo
Seven days

[Intro]
The train’s motion
Untidy echo
And she pants

[Verse]
She asked me why I’m here
But I come here every night
Do you need to tell her something?
No, I need a place to write
And as the sea of darkness forms
And casts us into night
You ask me what her name was called
But I found it hard to write
One time I was impaled forlorn
And thrown into a pile
I said you know where I’m coming from
And she looked me in the eye
Loverboy, you drown too quick
You're fading out of sight
Is it the numb density?
Can’t even look her in the eye
Where tiny men have been absorbed
For questioning the sky
To when and where the stars were formed
That glance upon this night
Light-years to sit upon
And paint us as we lie
And to think it's us she's wasted on,
Can't even look her in the eye
See I’ve found a new place to mourn
She asked me who died
Well if there’s a dark uniform
I need a place to hide
As simple as his faith had gone
The burning of the spire
And yet he still searched for warmth
But it was cold by the fire

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
She grips me tight, she grips me tight
But I still rip at the seams
I can’t sleep at night, never slept at night
But she still sits in my dreams
I’m out of sight, so out of sight
But she sees what I see
She's watching me
She's still watching me
She still sees what I see
The train’s motion
Untidy echo

[Video Intro: Romil Hemnani, Nick Lenzini, Zack Beitel & Robert Ontenient]
...and now you in Hollywood, baby
I know, isn't that crazy?
I saw Will Ferrell last night
Where? (where?)
And Woody Harrelson (where?)
Just in a restaurant, (what?)
I was walking down the street on La Brea
Will Ferrell and Woody Harrelson are—
They looked old. He had a shaved head
Well, yeah, he looks old. What movie was he in?
I forget
Me Ilamo Roberto, y este es el primer single de SATURACIÓN tres

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Nineteen, I got my first boyfriend
Nineteen, I almost signed to Def Jam
I remember being younger watching Space Jam
Told my mama that I wanna be the bald man
Got older, goals changed, needed God's plan
Got older, got a chain, nigga, god-damn
Shit is gold and it hurt me when I walk man
And I ain't got it but I just got my advance
So I might cop it, yeah, nigga that's my energy
I might tell these niggas that they ain't no friends to me
'Cause I'm tired of these niggas sucking clout up
Like a motherfuckin' 'squito in the trough, bruh

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I got dirty money, minutes on my tracfone
I just bought a scale, now e'rywhere a traphouse
I got on TV, then I turned into an asshole
'Cause I ain't selling dope or running with them bad folk
I'm eating shrimp and lobster, sitting next to white folk
Now I'm in Trader Joes with Birkenstock and iPhone
My agent called said they want me in the movies now
They used to call me ugly, turned 'em into groupies now
Now I'm on Melrose, I'm ready for my closeup
They call me pretty, need to put me on the poster
I write my name, then I buy a Testarossa
I kill my haters then I leave 'em for the vultures

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
God-damn, man, I think I need a therapist
Feel like a goldfish in the bowl with
Twenty other goldfish with the bowl switched
Bowl-cut or the mullet 'til I shaved it
Barely made it but I'm still here on my kickstand
Did the same shit that duffed Whitney Houston
They was boostin' while I'm slurping from my sippy cup (sippy cup)
Need blue jeans, pulling out the pocket fluff (the pocket fluff)
Talking to myself like I am my best friend (hello, hello, hello)
When I walk, see the arrogance flushing (hello, hello, hello)
Make the front page like Paris in the sex tape (oh)
Barely late to my first date with my therapist

[Verse 4 (box set only): Joba]
Brrr! Call me, I'll be running in my, Asics
Gold plated belt buckle 'round my, sweat'ns
Tube socks, white tee, Polo underpants
I will never grow old, call me Peter Pan
Dial *67, when they need to listen
I move just like a phantom, I should have been a teacher
Handing out these lessons, my pupils ask no questions
They like to think they're special, I feed them graham crackers
Got my Timex in the mail, keep it in the case
They tapping lines every day, I cannot be traced
I don't believe in credit, my people call me different
I evade, then get paid, brr! Just a second

[Verse 4 (video only): Merlyn Wood]
Trusty press, wear the colors of the ocean
Skeetin' sad in my Supreme clothing
Hit my line if you ever need an OZ
Don't hit my line if you think you know the old me
Have gassed-ass plans in the e-class
And I'm still getting head on public transit
And I'm still really sad about my last chick
And I'm still 'bout to cry outta both heads

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Now I've never been one to dance
But we've got something going on in my pants (Haha)
It's like I'm stuck in a trance and I'd better take advantage
Who knows when I'll get another chance
I feel like breaking too
Electric Boogaloo
You play Kelly, I'll be O-Zone
Travie Laz and Taio Cruz

It's taking me higher, higher (Yeah)
Higher off the ground (Let's go)
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Verse 4: Travie McCoy]
I got my feet in the air and my head on the ground
And the rest of my body is somewhere in the clouds
I'm coming down no time soon
Like I'm tied to a couple hundred helium balloons
Looks like I'ma be up for a minute (Uh-huh)
Such a beautiful feeling, 'idn't it?
Yup, when your body is so plateau
On a level that just feels so infinite

[Bridge: Taio Cruz]
The music's got me going higher
I feel like I can touch the sky

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

Yeah, I’m gonna stand, I’m gonna stand my ground
Hey, I’m gonna open up my heart to give
Yeah, because it’s the only way to live
I’m gon
