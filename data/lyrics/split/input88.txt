And nobody's life is fair

'Cause everybody's got a story that'll break your heart
Yeah, everybody's got a story that'll break your heart

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Gang!
Gang!
Gang!
They talkin' down on my name
Don't let 'em run off with the name
Man I just run with the gang
A$AP boys came with the flame
Gang! Gang!
They talkin' down on the gang
They wanna rep with the name
But this ain't no regular name
Gang! Gang! They tryna run with the name
I might pull up with 3K
But I do not fuck with no Klans

[Chorus]
Gang! Gang!
Them boys not flexin' the same
I'm done with adjustin' to fame
Pull up on your set, leave a stain

[Intro]
Mmm
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Lay on me the weight of the world
Smiling like you're given a gift
Don't you wanna dance with your little girl?
In the shadows, I can see those things you hid
From me

[Chorus]
You burn all your dirty laundry
You curse at your phone
You set the house on fire and tell me to come home
Tell me you're stoned
Mmm
Mmm

[Verse 2]
Twist my words and then wring 'em out
Drag me down into your jealousy
Rising to inside your open mouth
Taking out your whole life on me
On me

[Chorus]
You burn all your dirty laundry
You curse at your phone
You set the house on fire and tell me to come home
Tell me you're stoned

[Bridge]
Don't tell me to come home, you must be stoned
Won't be wrapped up in your wings that spread with disaster
No, I'm not all those things you might be after
Maybe you're just too stoned to see you're the reason I don't come home
Too faded to see that my heart's growin' blacker

[Chorus]
You burn all your dirty laundry
You curse at your phone
You set the house on fire and tell me to come home
Tell me you're stoned

[Verse 1]
Darling, I wonder if you could even tell
That there are flowers growing
In places I once fell
I opened up my heart to you
I opened it so wide
And you couldn’t find the strength
To confront all your weakness
So you tried to steal mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don’t know
How you live with yourself
But all I really need to know
Is that’s for someone else to figure out

[Chorus]
I place my feet on the corner of the mat
I’m building muscles I didn’t know I had
I place my feet on the corner of the mat
You have lost control of mе
I’m gonna backflip outta this
And you can watch the replay in slow-motion
I’m the onе with the pretty little arc in my back
I’m the one with the pretty little arc in my back

[Verse 2]
There was so much love I had for you
A gift you left unwrapped
Oh I’ll leave it in the past
Cuz I won’t go back
Back to a place
Where you’ll manipulate
All my vulnerabilities
What’s beautiful in me
My sensitivity

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don’t know
How you live with yourself
But all I really need to know
Is that’s for someone else to figure out

[Chorus]
I place my feet on the corner of the mat
I’m building muscles I didn’t know I had
I place my feet on the corner of the mat
You have lost control of me
I’m gonna backflip outta this
And you can watch the replay in slow-motion
I’m the one with the pretty little arc in my back
I’m the one with the pretty little arc in my back

[Chorus]
I place my feet on the corner of the mat
(I place my feet)
I’m building muscles I didn’t know I had
(I'm building muscle)
I place my feet on the corner of the mat
You have lost control of me
I’m gonna backflip outta this
And you can watch the replay in slow-motion
I’m the one with the pretty little arc in my back
(I’m the one with the pretty little arc in my back)
I’m the one with the pretty little arc in my back

[Intro]
Nadia
Nadia
Nadia

[Verse 1]
Darling, I wonder if you could even tell

I’m the one with the pretty little arc in my back

(I place my feet)
I’m building muscles I didn’t know I had

I place my feet on the corner of the mat

(backflip outta this)
And you can watch the replay in slow-motion
(you can watch the replay in slow-motion)
I’m the one with the pretty little arc in my back
(I’m the one with the pretty little arc in my back)
I’m the one with the pretty little arc in my back

[Breakdown x2]
Chalk on my hands
And I smell metal
I’m gonna collect my “10”
Chalk on my hands
And I smell metal
I’m gonna collect my “10”
Chalk on my hands
And I smell metal
I’m gonna collect my “10”

[Outro]
But I know
Today I feel strength
But tomorrow
I will feel like total garbage
I will feel like
Nothing
Nothing

[Verse 1]
(Michael:)
This time around I never get bit
Though you really want to fix me
This time around you're making me sick
Though you really want to get me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to get me
You really want to fix me, hit me
But this time around I'm taking no
Though you really want to get me, you really want to get me

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of mе
He really thought, they thought thеy really had control of me

[Verse 2]
This time around I'm not going to get bit
Though you really want to get me
But this time around I'm taking no
Though you really want to fix me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to use me
You really want to use me and falsely accuse me
This time around don't treat me like spit
Though you really can't control me, you really can't control me

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

[Verse 3]
(The Notorious B.I.G:)
Listen, I got problems of my own
Flashing cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home, I ain’t safe as I should be
Things always missing, maybe it could be my friends

But they ain’t friends if they robbing me
Stopping me, from making a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'

If I was dead broke and smoking
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm a killer I ain’t joking
Indo smoke got me choking, I'm hoping
A fool come slipping, so I can blow him open
This time around I changed up my flow
Got rid of the rots, got Pits by the door
I reeled a set of people to watch my back
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my Mike like that (Michael: This time around, yeah!)
Baby

[Chorus]
(Michael:)
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

[Ad-libs:]
Get me, infect me
You really try to get me
Use me
Accuse me
Nobody should abuse me
(Control this!)

He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they really had control of me
(Control this, here ya!)
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they really...
This time around, yeah!
(He really thought)

[Verse 1]
(Michael:)
This time around I never get bit
Though you really want to fix me
This time around you're making me sick
Though you really want to get me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to get me
You really want to fix me, hit me
But this time around I'm taking no (*Song jumps*)
Though you really want to get me, you really want to get me

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of mе
He really thought, they thought thеy really had control of me

[Verse 2]
This time around I'm not going to get bit
Though you really want to get me
But this time around I'm taking no (*Song jumps*)
Though you really want to fix me

This time around don't treat me like spit
Though you really can't control me, you really can't control me

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

Things always missing, maybe it could be my friends

But they ain’t friends if they robbing me
Stopping me, from making a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'

If I was dead broke and smoking
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm a killer n**** I ain’t joking
Indo smoke got me choking, I'm hoping
A fool come slipping, so I can blow him open
This time around I changed up my flow
Got rid of the rots, got Pits by the door
I reeled a set of people to watch my back
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my n**** Mike like that (Michael: This time around, yeah!)
Baby

[Chorus]
(Michael:)
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

[Ad-Libs]
Get me, infect me
You really try to get me
Use me, accuse me
Nobody can abuse me
Take me an' change me
Nobody's gonna break me
Kill me, deal with me
I hate the way you control this, here ya!

He really thought he really had a hold of me

[Ad-Libs]
Use me, accuse me
Nobody can abuse me
Fix me, mix me
Nobody's gonna ditch me

Hoo!

This time around, yeah!
(He really thought)

[Verse 1]
(Michael:)
This time around I never get bit
Though you really want to fix me
This time around you're making me sick
Though you really want to get me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to get me
You really want to fix me, hit me
But this time around I'm taking no
Though you really want to get me, you really want to get me

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of mе
He really thought, they thought thеy really had control of me

[Verse 2]
This time around I'm not going to get bit
Though you really want to get me
But this time around I'm taking no
Though you really want to fix me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to use me
You really want to use me and falsely accuse me
This time around don't treat me like spit
Though you really can't control me, you really can't control me

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

[Verse 3]
(The Notorious B.I.G:)
Listen, I got problems of my own
Flashing cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home, I ain’t safe as I should be
Things always missing, maybe it could be my friends

But they ain’t friends if they robbing me
Stopping me, from making a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'

If I was dead broke and smoking
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm a killer n**** I ain’t joking
Indo smoke got me choking, I'm hoping
A fool come slipping, so I can blow him open
This time around I changed up my flow
Got rid of the rots, got Pits by the door
I reeled a set of people to watch my back
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my n**** Mike like that (Michael: This time around, yeah!)
Baby

[Chorus]
(Michael:)
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

[Ad-Libs]
Get me, infect me
You really try to get me
Use me, accuse me
Nobody can abuse me
(Control this!) An' change me
Nobody's gonna break me
Kill me, deal with me
I hate the way you control this, here ya!

He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they really... This time around, yeah!
He really thought he really had a hold of me

[Ad-Libs]
And use me, accuse me
Nobody can abuse me
Fix me, mix me
Nobody's gonna ditch me

He really thought, they really had control of me
He really thought he really... (*Song fades out*)

[Verse 1]
Jane, lack of blood running down
My dream
One too many of the same
You came through
She belongs with her
And I belong there too

[Chorus]
I'll take her arm today and rescue
The draw that's all the time
The draw that's all the time
Pull through, pull through
The draw that's all the time
The draw that's all the time

[Verse 2]
Jo, pull back a little more
Let's roll
Just another bend to go
We'll make do
Cause I belong with me
And you belong here too

[Chorus]
I'll take your arm today
Unfold to
Thе draw that's all the time
The draw that's all thе time
Pull through, pull through
The draw that's all the time
The draw that's all the time

The draw that's all the time
The draw that's all the time
The draw that's all the time
The draw that's all the time

[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Flipmode, nigga
Pharrell remix, huh

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
I ain't meanin' to brag, girl
You know that I'm the shit
But see, I'm lovin' your swag, girl
Nowadays, they print a nigga name on a flag, girl
You rubbin' on me, see the way my denim'll sag, girl
Flipmode, see, they give me my respect
Miss neck, if you want it, we could flip it on some sex shit
My ex-chick kinda mad at the world
But it's nothin', because you know I love you, girl
Ayy Rob', go 'head and talk to 'em

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
She's the kind of girl you wanna marry
The kind of girl you'd walk the whole Earth for
Put her on your back and just carry
Her attitude is hotter than the Earth's core
When she's around, nothing else matters
Untouchable, she's got her own forcefield
Sooner or later, someone will get at her
If I don't, someone else will

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you

[Post-Chorus: Robin Thicke & Busta Rhymes]
Oh (Here we go), oh (Bounce back)
Oh (Flipmode, baby), oh (Star Trak)
Oh (Holla at me, baby), oh (Just for a little while)
Oh (You checkin' for the god), oh (I know you love my style)
Oh (I know you proper), oh (And I love the way you clean wit' it)
Oh (You know I'm dapper), oh (And a muh'fucka mean wit' it)
Oh (Extreme wit' it), oh (Triple beam wit' it)
Oh (You know I love your style), oh (And how you're like a queen wit' it)
(Labba, talk to 'em)

[Verse 3: Labba]
What am I to do?
I gave her diamond fondles and introduce her
To cars that got glass roofs
We well protected, ma, you feel elected
Flipmode is where we at
You come to my section, that's where the stars is at
Our money long, we cop artifacts
And I hope you fall in love with that, ha
Clap your skateboard, ma

[Verse 4: Robin Thicke]
She's the kind of girl you wanna marry
Scientists say that she's the second sunshine
And now my life is sweeter than berries (Than berries)
I guess if we have sex, our love will turn to wine
When she's around, nothing else matters
Even if the sky was at a standstill
If I turn my back then someone will get at her
If I don't, someone else will

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you

[Post-Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Spliff Star]
Spliff, you know you need to kill it
Yes, I do

[Verse 5: Spliff Star & Robin Thicke]
(Oh, oh) I gave her the finest things in life
(Oh, oh) Diamonds, cars, and furs is the things she likes
(Oh, oh) Dipped in Dior, Ferragamo
(Oh, oh) Had her pushin' whips like Murciélago
(Oh, oh) 'rosa, bought her a gun and a holster
(Oh, oh) Knowin' little mami, she'll be movin' like a soldier
(Oh, oh) Known by many and respected like Oprah
(Oh, oh) Keep her on my side like Bonnie did Clyde
Spliff, baby

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I'm so glad)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I found you)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (Oh girl)
Wanna love you girl, ooh
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I'm so glad)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I found you)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (Oh girl)
Wanna love you girl, ooh

[Verse 6: Pharrell Williams]
Uh, picture this all
Picture my life and my intention to ball
Picture this ice and how it glitter for y'all
Now don't you feel claustrophobic when that chick is involved?
She changed your life, and your frame of mind
Sorry, I hope what I'm saying is fine
We fuss but we take it one day at a time
If there's a fire, you know that she'll lay in the line
I just, close my eyes and curve my mouth
Open my mind and words come out
You're eclectic, you're creative
You the picture girl I just painted
I got it, you name it, it's all paid for
Big castle on the seashore
With the Willy Wonka decor
How this sound? Mr. and Mrs. Skateboard P

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I'm so glad)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I found you)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (Oh girl)
Wanna love you girl, ooh
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I'm so glad)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I found you)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (Oh girl)
Wanna love you girl, ooh
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I'm so glad)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I found you)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (Oh girl)
Wanna love you girl, ooh
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I'm so glad)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I found you)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (Oh girl)
Wanna love you girl, ooh

[Verse]
A falling star fell from your heart and landed in my eyes
I screamed aloud, as it tore through them, and now it's left me blind
The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart
And in the dark, I can hear your heartbeat
I tried to find the sound
But then it stopped, and I was in the darkness
So darkness I became
The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart

[Intro]
Brrt, mm, brrt

[Verse]
Crystal on my wrist, you don't look like this
Diamonds in that water look like washin’ dishes (Washin')
Bought a flight for two tryna fuck some sisters

Came up scammin’ and swipin', you know we gon' hit the road (Shoo)
Bitch, better act like you know or we gon' do the most (Shoo)
Yeah, might cop a crib in the Cove, I'm tired of bein' seen
My bitch

I crashed the Rari' on the side of the highway, I thought I was Lightning McQueen (Skrt)
Yeah, off of that boot nothing I can't do
I feel like I got me some wings (Brrt)
Yeah, aye, brrt
Maybach SUV, I’m on the waiting list (Vroom)
Yeah, he had too much drank he on that satan shit (Slatt)
Lord forgive me (Woo)
Tell me who else you know keep that shit on standby
My bitch with all shit she act just like 

[?]
Ain’t ever do no Grits, i'ma just take from the rich
Take big bro out the bricks, got him a house with a stick (Brrt)
I was not always here (Oh, no)
Used to be broke with my moms it was just us and my sister (Slatt)
Used to be gettin’ no pussy, even the one with the whiskers (God)
Now, I'm that nigga they know
Now, I'm that nigga they call on
Deep down I don't respect niggas (No)
This world kinda weird I don’t see how they expect niggas (No)
I don't really wanna go in depth ‘bout it (Yeah)
But if a nigga really wanna some smoke we gon' step about it (Step about it)
Mm, mm, brrt
If a nigga want some we gon' step about it

[Intro: JID]
We doin' good
We doin' good
That's your problem

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Pulling me down like an anchor
Sayin' it's my fault, you're angered
Telling me no one will love me (Watch your mouth)
Telling me I'm gon' be lonely
(Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me now)
You and me on for a good run
Thinking that you were a good one
Under your palm, yeah, you like that (What the fuck?)
Now it's my turn to bite back (I've had enough)

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa & JID]
Ooh, did it to yourself (Yourself)
Playing with my mind (My mind)
Putting me through hell (Hell)
Ooh, I'd be broken too (Too)
If you left me like (Me like) like I left you
That's your problem

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & JID]
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
Doin' it all for reaction
Doing the most in your caption
Making me seem like the bad guy (Watch your mouth)
Try to bring me down, but nice try
(Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me now)

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa & JID]
I used to like you
How did I like you? (What the fuck?)
I used to like you
And now I don't (We doin' good)
Ooh, I'd be broken too (Too)
If you left me like (Me like) like I left you
That's your problem

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & JID]
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)

[Verse 3: JID]
I thought I liked you, I thought you was cool
But I'm a thot when I be drinking, don't be thinking shit through
Nevertheless, you got the clue, and now you blue
'Cause I ain't speaking to you
Aww booboo, you'll be cool
Don't boo-hoo, boo, what's the issue?
GGG's listening, this BD, she trippin'
I'm dippin', I'm dippin', I'm done with it
I'm stupid, I'm dumb, come with it
I heard 'em all, I'ma call you one name
(That's your problem)

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & JID]
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)

[Verse 1]
It's amazing how time just stops
Every time we get to this part
Wearing nothing but our hearts and souls
Look at me girl that was crazy
Catch a breath now here we go, baby
You got me buzzing from my head to my toes
Life's jaded, complicated, everything with a shine gets faded
Not us naw, not tonight, lets put our love in the spotlight

[Chorus]
Living in the afterglow, baby I don’t wanna go
Lets put tonight on hold, turn that air down low
Cause it's going to heat up again
This is where I wanna be
You laying one leg over me
Yeah Im in too deep, i don't wanna go to sleep
And I hope this feeling never еnds
Baby I don't wanna go, lets live herе in the afterglow

[Verse 2]
The world keeps on turning outside
I found a little piece of heaven in your eyes
It's nothing like like when you hold me tight
And you whisper in my ear
Life's jaded, complicated, everything with a shine gets faded
Not us girl, not tonight, lets put our love in the spotlight

[Chorus]
Living in the afterglow, baby I don’t wanna go
Lets put the night on hold, turn that air down low
Cause it's going to heat up again
This is where I wanna be
You laying one leg over me
Yeah Im in too deep, I don't wanna go to sleep
And I hope this feeling never ends
Baby I don't wanna go, lets live here in the afterglow

[Chorus]
Living in the afterglow, baby I don’t wanna go
Lets put the night on hold, turn that air down low
Cause it's going to heat up again
This is where I wanna be
You laying one leg over me
Yeah Im in too deep, I don't wanna go to sleep
And I hope this feeling never ends
Baby I don't wanna go, Well baby I don’t wanna go
Lets live here in the afterglow

[Outro]
Living in the afterglow

[Verse 1]
Advertise in imaginative ways, start your free trial today
Come on in, the water's lovely
Look, you could meet someone you like
During the meteor strike, it is that easy
Lunar surface on a Saturday night, dressed up in silver and white
With coloured Old Grey Whistle Test lights

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the roof, it was well reviewed
Four stars out of five
And that's unheard of

[Verse 2]
Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the Starlight Express
The head of special effects in my mind's eye
Hokey Cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget, doesn't time fly?
I'm in no position to give advice, I don't want to be nice
And you know that

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio is the place to go
And you will not recognise the old headquarters

[Bridge]
All the nights that never happened and the days that don't exist
At the Information-Action Ratio
The only time that we stop laughing is to breathe or steal a kiss
I can get you on the list for all the clubs
I can lift you up another semitone

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, now, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio (The Information-Action Ratio)
Is the place to go, four stars out of five
I put a taqueria on the moon (The Information-Action Ratio)
Rave reviews, four stars out of five

[Outro]
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while
Four stars out of five

[Verse 1]
Brian, top marks for not trying
So kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted
And I wonder, are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't get our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator

[Spoken Interlude]
We are the Arctic Monkeys from High Green, baby!

[Verse 2]
Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
'Cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet, but she's yours
Shе'll be saying, "Use me, show mе the jacuzzi"
I imagine that it's there on a plate, your whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened to make 'em wait for a while
I doubt it's your style not to get what you set out to acquire
The eyes are on fire, you are the unforecasted storm

[Verse 3]
(Brian) Calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not trying) You leave the other story standing
With your renditions and jokes, bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their thunder
Are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't get our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator

[Spoken Outro]
Thank you very much

[Verse 1]
Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said, "You're mistaken if you're thinking
That I haven't been called cold before"
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

[Chorus]
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravatе the ice-cream man
On rainy aftеrnoons

[Verse 2]
The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

[Chorus]
And your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting, but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
Crying Lightning

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying Lightning, Crying Lightning, woah-oh
Crying Lightning, Crying Lightning
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying

[Verse 1]
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you’d stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you’d stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
(You've had a few) Oh, callin' when you've had a few?
('Cause I always do) Because I always do
(Maybe I'm too) Maybe I'm too busy
(Busy bein' yours) Bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

[Outro]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day, yeah
(Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' yours to fall
(Sad to see you go) Ever thought of callin', darlin'?
(Do I wanna know?) Do you want me crawlin' back to you?

[Verse 1]
The mirror's image tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your boots
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
"Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

[Verse 2]
Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, well, are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to gеt you to listen
More I get through thе gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions
And having bad ideas

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply (Message, you reply)
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
"Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

[Bridge]
An' I can't see you here, wonder where I might?
It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time
I haven't found what I was hopin' to find
You said you got to be up in the mornin'
Gonna have an early night
An' you're startin' to bore me, baby
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"

[Outro]
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"High?"

[Spoken Outro]
Thank you very much, London
How are you this evening?

[Verse 1]
This time around I'll never get bit
Though you really wanna fix me
This time around you're making me sick
Though you really wanna get me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to get me
They really wanna fix me, hit me
But this time around I'm taking no shit
Though you really wanna get me, you really wanna get me

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold on me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold on mе
He really thought, they thought thеy really had control of me

[Verse 2]
This time around, not gonna get bit
Though you really wanna get me
But this time around I'm taking no shit
Though you really wanna fix me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to use me
They really want to use me, then falsely accuse me
This time around don't treat me like spit
Though you really can't control me, you know you can't control me

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold on me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold on me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold on me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold on me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

[Bridge]
This time around, yeah

Get me, and fix me, they really tried to get me
And use me, accuse me, nobody will abuse me (Control this)
Diss me, and shake me, nobody's gonna fake me
Guilt me, and deal with me, I like the way you thrill me
Hoo, ah, this time around, yeah
And use me, accuse me, nobody will abuse me
And fix me, and wish me, nobody's gonna diss me, hoo

This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
Hate me, and take me, nobody's gonna fake me
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
Watch me, I love the way you rock me, hoo, ho
He really, control of me
He really, they thought they really tried to get me
Ah, this time around, yeah, hoo
He really
He really thought, he really
And use me, and sue me, and then falsely accuse me

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold on me
(Fix me, and hit me)
He really thought he really had control of me
(And lied then tried to diss me)

[Outro]
He really thought he really had
He really thought he really had
He really thought he really had
He really thought he really had
Use me, accuse me, and lied to say you lose me
Take me, forsake me, then lie and say ya hate me
Hoo, lockalockalocka
He really, he really
Go on, boy, hoo, woo, hoo
This time around
Accuse me, and use me, and lie then say what you do to me
Take me, and fake me, and forsake me
Go on, hoo
Alright

[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

[Verse 1]
Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

[Verse 2]
Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, seemed like a perfect place to start

[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you'rе waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs
Alright

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
But I crumble complеtely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with "Goodbye"
I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
Take your hands off of your eyes too soon

[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs and a smile

[Verse 1]
Dancing in my underpants
I'm gonna run for government
I'm gonna form a covers band anorl
Back there by the baby grand
Did Mr. Winter Wonderland
Say, "Come 'ere, kid, we really need to talk"?
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

[Verse 2]
I fantasise, I call it quits
I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits
The chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They all come out of the cracks, thirsty for blood

[Bridge]
Oh, just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritised
And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever criеd
Multiplied by five
I suppose a singеr must die

[Verse 3]
"Singsong 'Round the Money Tree"
This stunning documentary
That no one else unfortunately saw
Such beautiful photography
It's worth it for the opening scene
I've been driving 'round listening to the score
Or maybe I just imagined it all
I've played to quiet rooms like this before
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

[Verse 1]
Well, the mourning was complete
When there were tears on the steering wheel drippin' on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

[Verse 2]
It's the beginning of the end
The car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
Ask anyone, they'll tell you that it's these times that it tends
To start to break in half, to start to fall apart
Hold on to your hеart

[Chorus]
And do me a favour and break my nose
Or do mе a favour and tell me to go away
Or do me a favour and stop asking questions

[Bridge]
'Cause she walked away while her shoes were untied
And her eyes were all red, you could see that she'd cried
And I watched and I waited 'til she went inside
Forcin' a smile and waving goodbye
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

[Chorus]
And do me a favour and ask if you need some help
She said, "Do me a favour and stop flattering yourself"
And to tear apart the ties that bind
Perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind
Perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind

[Spoken Outro]
Oh, the Monkeys in the Royal Albert Hall

[Spoken Intro]
A song about a search for the Albert Hall

[Verse 1]
I thought I saw you in the Battleship
But it was only a look-a-like
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name

[Verse 2]
I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook
Huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look
And smooched whoever was sitting there
She was close, and she squeezed me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely
"Pleasе, can I call you her name?"

[Chorus]
And I elongatеd my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself, woah

[Verse 3]
I thought I'd caught you in the Parrot's Beak
Fiddlin' with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm
It was close, it was so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
"No, you can't call me her name"

[Bridge]
So tell me, where's your hiding place?
You see, I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

[Chorus]
I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

[Spoken Interlude]
Mr Jamie Cook on the electric guitar!

[Verse 4]
Well, I saw your sister in the Cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
Well, that's when I knew that she'd understand
She was close, well, you couldn't get much closer
She said, "I'm really not supposed to, but yes
You can call me anything you want"

[Spoken Outro]
Oh, thank you
You're very kind

[Spoken Intro]
It's gotta be now, innit?
Now, now

[Verse 1]
You got the lights on in the afternoon
An' the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissin' to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sittin' in the corner with the coats, all piled high
When I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

[Chorus]
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

[Verse 2]
Well, you cured my January blues
Yeah, you made it all alright
I've got a feelin' I might have lit the very fuse
That we were tryin' not to light
And you're the stranger in my phonebook I was actin' like I knew
‘Cause I had nothin' to lose
When the winter’s in full swing
And your dreams just aren’t comin' true
Ain't it funny what you’ll do?

[Chorus]
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

[Post-Chorus]
The late afternoon, the ghost in your room
That you always thought didn’t approve of you knockin' boots
Never stopped you lettin' me get hold of the sweet spot
By the scruff of your (Knee socks)

[Bridge]
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby

[Interlude]
All the zeros lined up
But the number’s blocked
When you’ve come undone

[Bridge]
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby

[Chorus]
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
You walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Arabella's got some interstellar gator-skin boots
And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger
And I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality
She takes a dip in my daydreams

[Chorus]
My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries, but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella, oh
Arabella

[Post-Chorus]
Just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

[Verse 2]
Arabella's got a '70s head
But she's a modern lover, it's an exploration
She's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the colour of a constellation
Fallin' into place

[Chorus]
My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries, but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella, oh
As Arabella

[Post-Chorus]
I just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

[Bridge]
That's magic in a cheetah print coat
Just a slip underneath it, I hope
Asking if I can have one of those
Organic cigarettes that she smokes
Wraps her lips 'round a Mexican Coke
Makes you wish that you were the bottle
Takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like
Woo!

[Instrumental Break]

[Post-Chorus]
I just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

[Spoken Outro]
I'd like to play for you now, ladies and gentlemen
The, uh, title track from our new LP
Entitled, "Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino"
Get down

[Verse 1]
Jesus in the day spa, filling out the information form
Mama got her hair done, just popping out to sing a protest song
I've been on a bender back to that prophetic esplanade
Where I ponder all the questions but just manage to miss the mark

[Chorus]
Hoo
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

[Verse 2]
This magical thinking feels as if it really might catch on
Mama wants some answers
Do you remember where it all went wrong?
Technological advances really bloody get me in thе mood
Pull me in close on a crisp evе, baby
Kiss me underneath the moon's side boob
Ahhh

[Chorus]
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

[Bridge]
And do you celebrate your dark side
Then wish you'd never left the house?
Have you ever spent a generation trying to figure that one out?

[Chorus]
Hoo
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

[Spoken Outro]
Oh
Let's give a big Royal Albert Hall round of applause for our opening act this evening
Mr Cameron Avery, ladies and gentlemen
He's gonna help us out on this next number, folks
It's called "She Looks Like Fun"

[Chorus]
(She looks like fun)
(She looks like fun)
(She looks like fun)
(She looks like)

[Verse 1]
Smile like you've got a straw in something tropical
I've got the party plugged right into my skull
Wayne Manor, what a memorable NYE

[Chorus]
(She looks like fun) Good morning
(She looks like fun) Cheeseburger
(She looks like fun) Snowboarding
(She looks like)

[Verse 2]
Finally, there's a place with you through cloudy skies
Every whimsical thought that enters my mind
Look, there ain't no limit to the length of the dickheads we can bе

[Chorus]
(She looks like fun) Bukowski
(She looks likе fun) Dogsitting
(She looks like fun) Screwballing
(She looks like)

[Verse 3]
Finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue
Baby, but why can't we all just get along?
Dance as if somebody's watching, 'cause they are

[Bridge]
No one's on the streets
They've moved it all online as of March
I'm so full of shite
I need to spend less time stood around in bars
Waffling on to strangers all about martial arts
And how much I respect them

[Chorus]
(She looks like fun) Key changes
(She looks like fun) Re-thinking
(She looks like fun) New order
(She looks like fun)

[Verse 1]
Last night these two bouncers
And one of them's alright, the other one's a scary'un
His way or no way, totalitarian
He's got no time for you looking or breathing
How he don't want you to, so step out the queue
He makes examples of you, and there's nowt you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realise then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain, you'vе got something to prove
To all the smirking facеs and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant? Why can't they have a laugh?
He's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
But secretly I think they want it all to kick off
They want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
It's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away, let's put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things that I could never say this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

[Verse 2]
And this town's a different town today
This town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
And that girl's a different girl today
That girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
Oh, no

[Chorus]
Well, I'm so glad they turned 'em all away, let's put it down to fate
I thought a thousand million things that I could never think this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

[Verse 3]
Last night, what we talked about, it made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended, it don't make no sense anymore
Last night, what we talked about, it made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended, it don't make no sense anymore
Oh

[Verse 1]
Trudging through the morning
The tramp with the trampoline under his arm
Shifts past your whiskers, so stark is the charm
But the barking alarm waits coiled 'til the corner is turned
And the bicycle wheels all struggle to move ’round
In your muddy mind, blatantly caked and
Unwilling to wind uncooperative time
So he sits on the springs 'til the muck goes dry
Ooh

[Chorus]
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the

[Verse 2]
What came first, the chicken or the dickhead?
Split sleep reaps rewards from ill-fitting thoughts
And twilight forced you to go on a walk
Your legs start running and your leg gets caught
Canopy 19 is perfectly placed
For the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste
You'll have to slip away, I’m unhappy to say
Behold as the crook in the hammock plays

[Chorus]
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on your wall

[Post-Chorus]
Let's play darts

[Bridge]
Behold as a crook in the hammock plays
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
Gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fucking fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
She was gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp

[Chorus]
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

[Verse 1]
Break a mirror, roll the dice
Run with scissors through a chip pan fire fight
Go into business with a grizzly bear
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

[Verse 2]
Find a well-known hard man and start a fight
Wear your shell suit on bonfire night
Fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

[Chorus]
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Bite the lightning and tell me how it tastes
Kung fu fighting on your roller skates
Do the Macarena in the devil's lair
But just don't you sit down 'cause I've moved your chair
Yeah

[Chorus]
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh

[Spoken Outro]
Thank you very much for havin' us, Royal Albert Hall
If I can call you that

[Spoken Intro]
We're Arctic Monkeys
This is "I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor"
Don’t believe the hype

[Verse 1]
Stop making the eyes at me
I'll stop making the eyes at you
What it is that surprises me
Is that I don't really want you to

[Pre-Chorus]
And your shoulders are frozen (Cold as the night)
Oh, but you’re an explosion (You're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't like the sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

[Chorus]
I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
Don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on thе dancefloor
Dancing to electro-pop likе a robot from 1984
From 1984

[Verse 2]
I wish you’d stop ignoring me
Because it’s sending me to despair
Without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
And I don’t think it's very fair

[Pre-Chorus]
That your shoulders are frozen (Cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (You're dynamite)
Your name isn’t Rio, but I don't like the sand
And lighting a fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

[Chorus]
I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
Don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984

[Bridge]
And no, there in't no love
No Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes and DJ sets and
The dirty dancefloor and dreams of naughtiness
Oh, come on

[Chorus]
On the dancefloor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or what
I don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984

Woo
He really, ah

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G. & Michael Jackson]
Listen, I got problems of my own
Flashing cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home, I ain’t safe as I should be
Things always missing, maybe it could be
My friends, but they ain’t friends if they robbing me
Stopping me, from making a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'
If I was dead broke and smoking
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'ma kill a nigga, I ain't joking
Indo smoke got me choking, I'm hoping
A fool come slipping, so I can blow him open
This time around I changed up my flow
Got rid of the Rotts, got Pits by thе door
A real set of peoplеs to watch my back
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that
(This time around, yeah) Baby

He really thought he really had a hold on me

Stopping me, from making a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'
If I was dead broke and smoking
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'ma kill a nigga, I ain't joking
Indo smoke got me choking, I'm hoping

Buenas noches, nosotros estamos, Rabia contra la maquina de Los Angeles, California

[Verse 1]
The movie ran through me
The glamour subdue me
The tabloid untied me
I'm empty. please fill me
Mister Anchor, assure me
That Baghdad is burning
Your voice, it is so soothing
That cunning mantra of killing
I need you, my witness
To dress this up so bloodless
To numb me and purge me now
Of thoughts of blaming you
Yes, the car is our wheelchair
My witness, your coughing
Oily silence mocks the legless
Who travel now in coffins

[Pre-Chorus]
The jury's sleepless
We found your weaknеss
And it's right outside your door

[Chorus]
Now testify
Testify
It's right outsidе your door, testify
Testify

[Verse 2]
With precision you feed me
My witness, I'm hungry
Your temple, it calms me, so I can carry on
My slaving, sweating the skin right off my bones
On a bed of fire, I'm choking on the smoke that fills my home
The wrecking ball is rushing
Witness your blushing
Pipelines is gushing
While here we lie in tombs

[Pre-Chorus]
While on the corner
The jury's sleepless
We found your weakness
And it's right outside your door

[Chorus]
Now testify
Testify
It's right outside your door
Testify
Now testify

[Post-Chorus]
Mass graves for the pump when the price is set

[Verse 1]
Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured, silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle, monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle, monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
Fistagons, thе bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks and staff the party ranks
Morе for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord!

[Chorus]
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Come on
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio

[Verse 2]
Contact, I hijacked the frequencies
Blockin' the beltway, move on DC
Way past the days of bombin' MCs
Sound off, Mumia, go on, be free
Who got 'em? Check the federal file
All you pen devils know the trial was vile
Army of pigs try to silence my style
Off 'em all out the box, it's my radio dial

[Chorus]
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio

[Verse 1]
Since fifteen hundred and sixteen, Mayans attacked and overseen
Crawl amidst the ruins of this empty dream
With their borders and boots on top of us
Pullin' knobs on the floor of their toxic metropolis
How you gonna get what you need to get?
The gut eaters, blood drenched get offensive like Tet
The fifth sun sets get back reclaim
The spirit of Cuauhtémoc, alive and untamed
Face the funk now blastin' out your speaker
On the one, Maya, Mexica
That vulture came to try and steal your name but now you got a gun
Yeah, this is for the people of the sun

[Chorus]
It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around again
It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around again

[Verse 2]
Don't ever forget that the whip snapped ya back
Your spine cracked for tobacc-oh, I'm the Marlboro Man
Our past blastin' on through the verses
Brigades of taxi cabs rollin' Broadway like hearses
Troops strippin' zoots, shots of red mist
Sailors' blood on the deck, come sister, resist
The era of terror, check this photo lens
Now the City of Angels does the ethnic cleanse
Heads bobbin' to the funk out your speaker
On the one, Maya, Mexica
That vulture came to try and steal your name but now you found a gun
You're history
This is for the people of the sun

[Chorus]
It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around again, why, why
It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around again
It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around again, rise up, rise up
It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around, yeah

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
I be walkin' God like a dog, my narrative, fearless
Word war returns to burn like Baldwin home from Paris
Steel from a furnace, I was born landless
This is the native son, born of Zapata’s guns
Through the shanties and the cities' remains
Same bodies buried hungry but with different last names
These vultures rob everything, leave nothing but chains
Pick a point on the globe, the picture's the same
A bank and a church, a myth and a hearse
A mall and a loan, a child dead at birth
A widow pig parrot, rebel to tame
A white-hooded judge, a syringe and a vein
And the riot be the rhyme of the unheard

[Pre-Chorus]
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?

[Chorus]
I’m calm like a bomb
I'm calm like a bomb

[Verse 2]
This ain't subliminal, feel the critical mass approach horizon
The pulse of the condemned, sound off America's demise
The anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, yes, I spit fire
Hope lies in the smoldering rubble of empires
Back through the shanties and the cities' remains
Same bodies buried hungry, but with different last names
Vultures robbin' everyone, leave nothing but chains
Pick a point here at home, the picture's the same
Field full of slaves, some corn and some debt
A ditch full of bodies, check for the rent
There's the tap, the phone, the silence of stone
The numb black screen that be feelin’ like home
And the riot be the rhyme of the unheard

[Pre-Chorus]
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?

[Chorus]
I’m calm like a bomb
I'm calm like a bomb
I’m calm like a bomb
I'm calm like a bomb

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
I'm calm like a bomb

[Outro]
There's a mass without roofs, a prison to fill
A country’s soul that reads post no bills
A strike and a line of cops outside of the mill
A right to obey and a right to kill
A mass without roofs, a prison to fill
A country's soul that reads post no bills
A strike and a line of cops outside of the mill
A right to obey and a right to kill

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
The world is my expense
The cost of my desire
Jesus blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire
So raise your fists and march around
Just don't take what you need
I'll jail and bury those committed
And smother the rest in greed
Crawl with me into tomorrow
Or I'll drag you to your grave
I'm deep inside your children
They'll betray you in my name

[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire

[Verse 2]
The lie is my expense
It's the cost of my desire
The party blеssed me with its future
And I protеct it with fire

[Pre-Chorus]
I am the Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange, priests of Hiroshima
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire

[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire

[Bridge]
For it's the end of history
It's caged and frozen still
There is no other pill to take
So swallow the one that makes you ill

[Refrain]
The Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima
Sleep now in the fire

[Outro]
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire

[Verse 1]
My fears hunt me down
Capturing my memories
The frontier of loss
They try to escape across the street where
Jesus stripped bare
And raped the spirit He was supposed to nurture
In the name of my
In the name of my

[Chorus]
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man

[Verse 2]
Like autumn leaves his sense fell from him
A broken glass of himself shattered somewhere within
His thoughts like a hundred moths
Trapped in a lampshade
Somewhere within
Their wings banging and burning
On through endless nights
Forever awake he lies shaking and starving
Praying for someone to turn off the light

[Chorus]
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man

[Verse 3]
My fear is hunting me down
Capturing my memories
The frontier of loss
They try to escape across the street where
Jesus stripped bare
And raped the spirit He was supposed to nurture
In the name of my
In the name of my

[Chorus]
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Uh!

Uhh
Ayy, yo, it's just another bombtrack, uh
Ayy, yo, it's just another bombtrack, yeah
It goes a one, two, three
Yeah, and it's just another bombtrack

[Verse 1]
And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
But I'ma drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beatdowns
Could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall and the businessеs that burnt us all
See through the news and the viеws that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

[Pre-Chorus]
With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn (Yes, you're gonna)
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

[Verse 2]
It goes a one, two, three, another funky, radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere

[Pre-Chorus]
With the thoughts from a militant, militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

Think ya know it's all of that, huh
Ayo, so check this out, yeah

[Chorus]
Know your enemy
Come on

[Verse 1]
Born with insight and a raised fist
A witness to the slit wrist
As we move into '92
Still in a room without a view
Ya got to know, ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify, defy
I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in
Something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Fist in ya face in the place and I'll drop the style clearly

[Chorus]
Know your enemy
Know your enemy
Yeah
Ayo, get with this, ugh

[Verse 2]
Word is born
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Now I got no patience
So sick of complacence
With the D, the E, the F, the I, the A, the N, the C, the E
Mind of a revolutionary, so clear the lane
The finger to the land of the chains
What? The "land of the free"?
Whoever told you that is your enemy
Now something must be done
About vengeance, a badge, and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Now action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in

[Bridge]
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
Sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of you
Time has come to pay

[Chorus]
Know your enemy

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Come on
Yes, I know my enemies
They're the teachers who taught me to fight me
Compromise, conformity
Assimilation, submission
Ignorance, hypocrisy
Brutality, the elite
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams

[Intro]
Uh
Pump, pump, woo!
Come on
Uh

[Verse 1]
Solo, I'm a soloist on a solo list
All live, never on a floppy disk
Inka, inka, bottle of ink
Paintings of rebellion drawn up by the thoughts I think

[Interlude]
Yeah
Come on
The militant poet in once again, check it

[Verse 2]
It's set up like a deck of cards
They're sendin' us to early graves for all the diamonds
They'll use a pair of clubs to beat the spades
With poetry, I paint the pictures that hit
More like the murals that fit
Don't turn away, get in front of it
Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall playin Tic-Tac-Toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, three brothers gone, come on
Doesn't that make it three in a row?

[Refrain]
(Anger is a gift)
Come on
Uh

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Drop that
Uh
Come on
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 3]
Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall playin' Tic-Tac-Toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, three million gone, come on
'Cause you know they're counting backwards to zero
Environment, the environment exceeding
On the level of our unconsciousness
For example, what does the billboard say?
"Come and play, come and play
Forget about the movement"

[Refrain]
(Anger is a gift)

[Interlude]
Yeah
Uh
Aw, bring that shit in
Uh
Hey

[Outro]
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah right
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah, right
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah, right

[Verse 1]
The main attraction, distraction
Got ya number than number than numb
Empty ya pockets, son, they got you thinkin' that
What ya need is what they selling
Make you think that buying is rebelling
From the theaters to malls on every shore
The thin line between entertainment and war
The frontline is everywhere, there be no shelter here
Spielberg, the nightmare works so push it far
Amistad was a whip, the truth was featherеd and tarred
Memories еrased, burned and scarred
Trade in ya history for a VCR
Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture, Americana
Chained to the dream they got you searchin' for
The thin line between entertainment and war

[Chorus]
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)

[Verse 2]
Hospitals not profit full
The market bulls got pockets full
To advertise some hip disguise
View the world from American eyes
The poor adore, keep fiendin' for more
The thin line between entertainment and war
They fix the need, develop the taste
Buy their products or get laid to waste
Coca-Cola is back in the veins of Saigon
And Rambo too, he's got a dope pair of Nikes on
And Godzilla, pure mothafuckin' filler
To keep ya eyes off the real killer
Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture, Americana
Chained to the dream they got you searchin' for
Tha thin line between entertainment and war

[Bridge]
American eyes, American eyes
View the world from American eyes
Bury the past, rob us blind
And leave nothing behind
American eyes, American eyes
View the world from American eyes
Bury the past, rob us blind
And leave nothing behind

[Outro]
Just stare
Just stare
Just stare
Just stare
Relive the nightmare

[Verse 1]
Every official that comes in, cripples us, leaves us maimed
Silent and tamed
And with our flesh and bones, he builds his homes
Southern fist, rise through the jungle mist
Clenched to smash power so cancerous
A black flag and a red star
A rising sun loomin' over Los Angeles
Yes, for Raza livin' in La La
Like Gaza on to the dawn of Intifada
Reach for the lessons the masked pass on
And seize the metropolis, it's you it's built on

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a nеw year's day
Everything can change on a nеw year's day
And everything changed on a new year's day
Come on

[Chorus]
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land

[Verse 2]
Their existence is a crime
Their seat, their robe, their tie
Their land deeds, their hired guns
They're the crime
Shots heard underground 'round the rapture
The world's eye captured at last in a Mexican pasture
The masked screaming land or death
Within a breath, a war from the depth of time
Who shot four puppet governors in a line
Who shook all the world bankers who think they can rhyme
Shot the landlords who knew it was mine
Yes, it's a war from the depth of time

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Come on
Ugh, hear the masked scream

[Chorus]
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death

[Post-Chorus]
It's land or death
Yeah, uh
Come on
Come on
Yes, yes
Yes

[Chorus]
It's war within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death

[Intro]
Come with it now
Come with it now

[Verse 1]
This microphone explodes, shattering the mold
Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' the thirst
Of the power dons, that five-sided Fistagon
That rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
Trigger's cold, empty your purse

[Chorus]
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

[Verse 2]
Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war, cannibal animal
I walk the corner to the rubble, that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetery now
We don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
Arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally 'round the family, pocket full of shells

[Chorus]
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

[Bridge]
Uh, bulls on parade, woo
Transform
Uh-huh
Uh

[Outro]
Come with it now
Come with it now
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Gracias

Zapata's blood
Wasn't spilt in vain
So now the most poor, the most poor
The most poor wage war, wage war
To reclaim their name

Zapata's blood
Wasn't spilt in vain
So now the most poor, the most poor
The most poor wage war, wage war
To reclaim their terrain

Yeah
On January first, 1994
The indigenous farmers of Southern Mexico
Declared war on an unjust
And illegitimate government

Out of the depths of the most wild, the most poor
Came a just arm struggle
For democracy, justice, and liberty
And it won't stop
Until that 65 year old dictatorship
The Partido Revolucionario Institucional
Is buried in the ground
And thе people's voice is hеard once again
Yeah
So check it out
On January first of 94 they became known as a Zapatista movement
And they have a saying
And I want you all to sing along with me real quick
It goes something like this
It goes:

"Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves"

Sing that shit

"Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves"

Come on!
Yeah!

"Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves"

[Verse 1]
Rebel, rebel and yell
'Cause our people still dwell in hell
Locked in a cell, yes, the structure's a cell
Mad is the story I tell
How long can we wait?
Come on, seein' what's at stake
Action for reaction
If your mind's in a somewhat complacent state, get a check up
This is a stick up
Our freedom, or your life
Lord, I wish I could be peaceful
But there can be no sequel
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg, or South Central
On the mic 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion
Yeah, what about that, sucka?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, so you thought you could get with the hardlines
That fill your mind
Thoughts, battles fought, and lessons taught
Yes, I'll display the fitness, and flip like a gymnast
Raise my fist and resist!
Asleep though we stand in the midst of the war
Gotta get mine, gotta get more
Keepin' the mic warm against the norm
'Cause what does it offer me?
I think often it's nothin' but a coffin
Gotta get wreck 'til our necks never swing on a rope
From here to the cape of no hope
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg, or South Central
On the mic 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion

[Chorus]
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm

[Post-Chorus]
What's it gonna take?

[Bridge]
Shackle their minds when they're bent on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Shackle their minds when they're left on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Shackled our minds when we're bent on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Shackled our minds when we're left on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Lost
Lost
Shackle your minds and you're left on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Just shackle your minds when you're bent on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Lost

[Chorus]
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm

[Verse 1]
I just wanted to be one of The Strokes
Now look at the mess you made me make
Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates
But golden boy's in bad shape
I found out the hard way that
Here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a barge
Floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984, 2019

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
Karate bandana, warp speed chic
Hair down to therе, impressive moustache
Lovе came in a bottle with a twist-off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

[Chorus]
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Baby, that isn't how they look tonight
It took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes

[Verse 2]
I just wanted to be one of those ghosts
You thought that you could forget
And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright, 'cause you love me
And you recognise that it ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner, "Long Hot Summer"
They got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make-believe residency
From the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day, four nights a week
Easy money

[Chorus]
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Oh, baby, that is not how they look tonight
It took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes

[Outro]
And as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
It's the star treatment
Yeah, it's the star treatment
Yeah, ooh, it's the star treatment
Yeah
It's the star
Treatment

[Spoken Outro]
Thank you very much
I've been, uh, almost threatened with my life during the intermission with regards to playing this next number
So, uh

[Verse 1]
Anticipation has a habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment, but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah
Regardless of what's gone before
I want to see all of the things that we've already seen
I wanna see you face the jack—
And of course it's fancy dress
And they're all looking quite full on
In bunny ears and devil horns and oh

[Verse 2]
Anticipation has a habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment, but
Tonight therе'll be some love
Tonight thеre'll be a ruckus, yeah
Regardless of what's gone before
I want to see all of the things that we've already seen
I wanna see you face the jackpot out the fruit machine
And put it all back in
You've got to understand it
You can never beat the bandit, no

[Chorus]
And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that it says is that you've drank a lot
And you should bear that in mind tonight (Bear that in mind)
Yeah, you should bear that in mind tonight (Bear that in mind)

[Post-Chorus]
And you can pour your heart out but her reasoning will block
Owt you send her after nine o' clock, come on

[Verse 3]
Anticipation has a habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment, but
Tonight there'll be some love, ah
Tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah
Regardless of what's gone before

[Chorus]
And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that it says is that you've drank a lot
And you should bear that in mind tonight (Bear that in mind)
Yeah, you should bear that in mind tonight (Bear that in mind)

[Post-Chorus]
And you can pour your heart out around three o' clock
When the two-for-one's undone the writer's block, woah

[Spoken Outro]
Thanks very much for having us, everybody
And thank you for supporting War Child
I've got just one more question for you

[Verse 1]
I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling
Diamond cutter-shaped heartache
That come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Well, are you mine? Oh, ah

[Verse 2]
I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

[Chorus]
And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?) Oh, ah

[Bridge]
And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case, I'm mistaken, I
Just wanna hear you say, "You got me, baby
Are you mine?"
She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
Ah, that's a big shadow
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Oh, ah (Or just mine tonight?)

[Bridge]
She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Oh, ah (Or just mine tonight?)

Gotta go grind little homie
Everybody round me gotta get it

Everybody round me is a boss
Everybody round me drippin’ sauce
Everybody round me in the Porsche
Hundred thousand dollars what it cost
Packs came in overnight
Fifty thousand, made it off the right
Hundred thousand, made it off the swipe
Lord knows I gotta get it right
Rebound, but I did it right
Dunk a whole four up in my Sprite (Leanin’)

Thirty chickens in my brother kitchen
I just flipped a pigeon
Got the shipments and I got the vision
Bank statement, true to my religion
Fuck a bitch, need the championship
Drop six rings, cut like Rocky Road
Need a bitch, look like Kelly Rowland (Lil Boat)
Platinum teeth got my gum swollen (Okay)
Where these bitches at and where these hoes?
Fifty niggas deep at every show
From the concrete at 

[?]
From the city man, a star was chose
Niggas talkin’, bullet to his nose
I need a mansion with bout sixty hoes just for all my bros
White bitch with powder in her nose
Black bitch with red bottom toes

[Chorus: Larry]
I always been, I always been, I always been
I always been, I always been, I always been
I always been, I always been

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Above all you niggas and bitches
You play with my work, you might sleep with the fishes
Finessed up on all my three wishes
Now I rock Jacobs on bitches
Dior my goggles, now all I see riches
In the hotel with three triplets
12 thousand for my new wristlet
My new bitch gold like some biscuits, woah

[?] to my gang, I can’t go out with a bang
Shoot with no aim, slick like I’m James
I pull a 

[?] with no pain
I split the run up with my brothers
Hundred thousand for my mother
I do not care if you love her
That’s why she under my cover

[Chorus: Larry]
I always been, I always been, I always been
I always been, I always been, I always been
I always been, (Always been)

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
I need you, Christmas
Friends by the fire to hold
Times have been lonely
And lately, I just feel alone
I need you, Christmas
Family with nowhere to go
Angels on treetops and angels in the snow
Oh, the cold

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Seasons change, come and go
But there's one thing I know
You'll just stay the same
You don't ever change

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I miss the feeling
Waiting for Santa to show
Caroling late night
And all the children's eyes aglow
I need you, Christmas
Oh, how I miss you the most
Greetings from loved ones
And lovers under mistletoe
Oh, oh, oh
If you're young, if you're old
We all wait to be told
Just a simple phrase
"Have a Merry Christmas"
Ooh, ooh
Christmas, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Seasons change, come and go
But there's one thing I hope
You'll just stay the same
'Cause I need you, Christmas

[Intro: Michael Jackson & Busta Rhymes]
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Yeah, I know, it's been a minute
Got to know
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
When you need me (Woooh!)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy
How bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me
Big marbles, nigga
I lead this new generation, boy, don't argue with us
Marvelous beat selectors, authors and novel spitters
And it's all for the literature
And it's all for the hideous, the nastiest flows, the chlamydia, uh
I ain't afraid to say I need you, ah yeah (Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop)
I promise I'd never leave you, ah yeah
My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes I write
For sure my folks unite soon as the flow get nice, the poltergeist
That scare emcees, my prototype for every, my share of deeds
And R.I.Ps, you know my type of style is like my everything
Apparently my appetite they famished, bite no hand that feed
The culture vulture die and bleed
My focus hold these thoughts and dreams
Control this pen (Look over your shoulder)
Boldest lines of rhymes and things
Devote my time and mind it seems
Supposed to shine, remind I'm king
Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
The pros, the cons of diamond rings
I'm full of time but I'ma bring
The soul divine and cross between
What's yours and mines, the goal the green
The roads that show just what it mean
Then grab Shakur right by the wing
And fly before my vocals (Scream!)
For hip-hop, look at my Ziploc
Bag full of goodies, you Chris Rock, hit the Pookie and piss stops
Since tube socks, baby, you a hell of a drug
Just look over your shoulders when they fuck you over, it's love
I know ya

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
(Woo!) Don't you know, baby?
Don't you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Yeah yeah, you need me (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Shhh, look over your shoulder, get me?
'Cause I done bodied the game to the point niggas scared to rap with me
Kept burnin' 'til they anointed me one of the kings of black history
And yes, I see the game is a little different, niggas lack simply
Them bars and I spit 'em like darts 'til they puncture your kidney
You trash and it don't matter how much you gon' try to convince me
And you gon' make my gun cock and talk a whole 'nother way, yo
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh (Woo!)
I am the Buddha, the Ali Baba, the believer-er maker
So pristine, the dice roll from under my sleeve when I shake 'em
So rude, I'm so ice cold but I'm what you need to just wake 'em
All them crowns and medals on the wall waitin' for me to just take 'em
When I arrive, my theme music got a pound to it
And when I leave, even my shadow got a sound to it
'Cause I'm the god of the harder, the martyr, the father
I spit a saliva that's leaking a lava
Completin' the saga while meetin' and greetin'
And beating you niggas completely and conquer
Extremely bark on a nigga, you see me
And deeply carve up a nigga, believe me
Graffiti your armor, you heebie, you jeebie
Bikini your braud up (You guinea pig!)
See me now give me the startup and treat me, you greet me
And meet me with arms up
So sweet when I speak, have a seat, it was deep
I was sleep, now the god's up, hmm
Upholding the fundamentals, while most of you boast a rental
Focus on what's most essential, spit bars to provoke your mental
Do I have your attendamiento?
While I clap these raps like thunders
Look over your shoulder boy and wonder

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Nikki Grier]
(Wooh!)
Don't you know, baby? (Ooh, woah)
Don't you know, baby? (Mhm, mhn, yeah)
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me (When you need me)
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me (Whenever you need me)
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Yeah yeah, you need me (Woooh!)

[Verse 3: Nikki Grier]
With God watchin' over us and me over your shoulders (All you had to do is look forward)
But what you gonna do, you pull the devil even closer (Why'd you pull the devil even closer?)
Them clowns that you hang with more ridiculous than white Cleopatra
Or caucasians telling blacks to go back to Africa
But I digress, you're more, but you act less
Why do you act less even still, when the weight of life feels like a boulder (Just look over your shoulders)
I'm here whenever you need me
When you need me
Whenever you need me, when you need me

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
(Wooh!)
Don't you know, baby?
Don't you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me
Just look over shoulders, honey!
Yeah yeah, you need me (Wooh!)
(Wooh!)
Don't you know baby?
Don't you know baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Don't you know, baby?
Don't you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la

It's not the way you smile that touched my heart (sha la la la la)
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart

Uh-oh
Many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do?
I can't help myself, 'cause baby it's you
Baby, it's you

You should hear what they say about you: cheat, cheat
They say, they say you never never never ever been true (cheat, cheat)

Uh-oh
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do? And it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody, 'cause baby it's you
Baby it's you
Uh-oh
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, when it's true?
Don't want nobody, nobody, 'causе baby it's you
Baby it's you
Don't leave me all alonе
Come on home...
One day
You'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

Some day
You'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know

Oh one day
You'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

Yet tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know

Oh one day
You'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

[Intro: André 3000]
One, two
One, two, three, yeah!

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Inslumnational, underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground (Whoo!)
Like a million elephants or silverback orangutan
You can't stop the train
Who want some don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Bet I'll be a household name
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
1-9-9-9 Anno Domini, anything goеs
Be what you wanna be as long as you know
Consequеnces are given for livin'
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell (Hot!)
Get a life now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm & Hammer
Soul gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe
Believe there's always more (Ha!)

[Chorus: André 3000 + Morris Brown College Gospel Choir]
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Uno, dos, tres, it's on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
Like that there boy and will still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team, crack fiend dying to geek
OutKast bumpin' up and down the street
Slant back Cadillac, 'bout 5 niggas deep
75 MCs freestyling to the beat
'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club
Should've bought an ounce, but cha copped a dub
Should've held back, but cha throwed the punch
Supposed to meet your girl but cha packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl four year, Jordan
Never turned my back on my kids, for them
Should've hit it, quit it, rag top
Before you re-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coal
Record number four, but we on a roll
Hold up, slow up, stop, "Control"
Like Janet, Planet, Stankonia's on ya
Moving like Floyd, comin' straight to Florida
Lock all your windows, then block the corridors
Pullin' off my belt 'cause a whipping's in order
Like a three-piece fish before I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border
Pity pat rappers trying to get to five
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
When you come to ATL, boy, you better not hide
'Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride (Ha!)

[Chorus: André 3000 + Morris Brown College Gospel Choir]
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!

[Break: Morris Brown College Gospel Choir]
Bombs over Baghdad!
Bombs over Baghdad!
Bombs over Baghdad!
Bombs over Baghdad!

[Outro: André 3000 + Morris Brown College Gospel Choir]

[Intro: André 3000]
Yeah, this one right here goes out
To all the baby's mamas' mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this

[Chorus: André 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and takе her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnеct the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

[Chorus: André 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Bridge: André 3000]
Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on
You say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

[Chorus: André 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
"Look at the way he treats me"
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

[Chorus: André 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & André 3000]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Sir Lucious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlos
And El Dorados; so I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow, it's Showtimе at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a lеopard-print? Ah
Teddy Pendergrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sipping a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U
We blew hay too, athletes might cake you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make 'cause

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & André 3000]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Canary yellow seven-nine Seville is on display
My nigga Bongo hooked it up, Omar gon' dip my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the Honeycomb Hideout
I'ma show you how to wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snipples
YKK on your zipper, lick you like a lizard when I'm slizzard
Or sober, six million ways to fold ya
Like Noah's, I get two's of youse and you get pretty 'D'
But I'll call yo' ass 'round eight-ish, I know you'll be there for me, girl

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & André 3000]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Those huge baby eyes, get to runnin' off at they mouth
And tellin' me everything that's on your nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned, in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, I love who you ain't — you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for 'bout two weeks
Rick James'n, no chains and whips
I do suck lips 'til hips jerk in double time
The boy next door's a freak, ha-ha!

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & André 3000]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

[Bridge: André 3000]
And we are... The coolest motherfunkers on the planet
And my, my... The sky is fallin', ain't no need to panic
But ooh ooh... I got a stick and want yo' automatic
Ooh, ooh, ooh... Compatible, created in the attic
And we are... The coolest motherfunkers on the planet
And my my... The sky is fallin', ain't no need to panic
But ooh, ooh... I got a stick and want yo' automatic
Ooh, ooh, ooh... Compatible, created in the attic

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & André 3000]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean

Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Verse]
I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it
Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I

[Verse 1: Cee-Lo]
I don't recall, ever graduating at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asking "Gimme some," living life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Rollo, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb sh..., and I'm probably gon' do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though
(Why not?) Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you, I
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get yourself up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bull out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without?
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know something I don't, do you have any suggestions?
'Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue traveling his route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
You got to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[Verse 2: Big Gipp]
A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
It's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm digging through the ashtray, hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my grits, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Sedan DeVille, steady bouncing
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
'Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog
Dipping from the area, I'm scared
So one of these -itches might wind up dead, 'cause I have no time for jail
Buck Clampett cops, buck Elgin Bell
And crooked face Campbell, got the whole country
Thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo'
OutKast, a vision from the past
Hootie Hoo!
My White Owls are burning kind of slow

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
You got to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
You got to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Well, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you pinhead?
See, when I was a youngster, used to wear them country Pro Keds
My mama made me do it but the devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak suckers for they hooded Starters
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I worе with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my unclеs
They taught me (They taught me), I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense, I was Rosemary's baby
And then I learned the difference between a trick and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like those, see I pimped 'em
Witch never had my money so I never whipped 'em
See, all the playas came and all the playas went
A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his business
You need to git up, git out, git something
Smoke out cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade 'cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace 'cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool, yeah, it's real cool getting paid fat pockets
And all that other fat stuff like that, yeah

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
You got to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Y'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh, why?
Ain't nobody Black running but crac-kers
So, why I got to register?
I thinking of better stuff to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep-est rhymes
So let me take y'all way
Back to when Benjamin stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ayy
Y'all could not tell me nothing, thought I hit that bottom rock
At age thirteen, start working at the loading dock
They laying my mama off of work, General Motors trippin'
But I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping
Doing dumb thangs, not knowing what I know now
Yeah, that petty stuff will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point still actin' a fool
Wasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about mackin' girls and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some (In some)
Not thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's messed up, I should've listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you're gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yang yang so I paid her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feeling broke as chits
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-U-T-Kast
So get up off your ass

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
You got to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[Outro: Cee-Lo]
You need to...
You need to...
You need to...

[Verse 1]
Somewhere out on that horizon
Out beyond the neon lights
I know there must be something better
But there's nowhere else in sight
It's survival in the city, children
When you live from day to day
City streets don't have much pity, no
When you're down, that's where you'll stay

[Chorus]
In the city
In the city

[Verse 2]
I was born here in the city
With my back against the wall
Nothing grows and life ain't very pretty
No one's there to catch you when you fall
Somewhere out on that horizon
Far away from the neon sky
I know there must be something better, better
And I can't stay another night

[Chorus]
In the city
In the city
In the city
In the city

[Intro]
Hey, hey

[Verse 1]
After a few drinks, I start thinking about what we had
It gets complicated in my head
In my bed, in my 

[?]
And at the parties, nobody seems to care
It's like I'm not there

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I just want you to know
One, two

[Chorus]
That I still think about it, I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it, tried to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do

[Post-Chorus]
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you

[Verse 2]
When I left ya, I left hidden treasure
'Causе now no one can measure its prеssure
And I don't know what to do
Do I come back with the pride that I have left?
'Cause I know you were the best

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I just want you to know
One, two

[Chorus]
That I still think about it, I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it, tried to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do

[Post-Chorus]
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you

[Bridge]
Now I've come undone
And if I could turn back time, I'd choose you
I wish you were mine
I didn't know then, but now I do

[Chorus]
That I still think about it, I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it, tried to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do

[Post-Chorus]
To get over you, to get over you
To get over you, to get over you
To get over you, to get over you
To get over you, to get over you
To get over you

[Verse 1]
Before you came around, I was doing just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was looking in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly I can feel it inside

[Chorus]
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check? (I've got a fever)

[Verse 2]
Every time you're close, I get out of breath
Wondering, wondering, wondering what'll happen next
Oh, is it my imagination? It's got my heart beat racing
Fallin' in, fallin' in, fallin' in, feel it in my chеst

[Chorus]
I've got a fever, so can you chеck?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check? (I've got a fever)

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now, now, now, now
Tell me what you wanna do right now
'Cause I don't really wanna cool it down (I've got a)
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now, now, now, now
Tell me what you wanna do right now
'Cause I don't really wanna cool it down

[Chorus]
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me baby, I turn red (I turn red)
I've got a fever, so can you check? (I've got a fever)

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now (I've got a fever)
Tell me what you wanna do right now
'Cause I don't really wanna cool it down (I've got a fever)
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now (I've got a fever)
Tell me what you wanna do right now
'Cause I don't really wanna cool it down (I've got a fever)

[Intro: Murdoc, Noodle, Russel & 2D]
Valley of the Pagan, what's the meaning behind that, y'know?
It means that god is in everything and at the same time nowhere
Omnipresent, omnipresent
That's the best kind of present to have
Ah, oh- yeah (What you want for Christmas?)
Omnipresent (Well, there's no Christmas presents if you're a pagan)
Well, I suppose that's true normally (Dang, you're right. You're right, no)
Yeah, they don't go for that

[TAPE SCRATCHES]

[Outro: 2D, Russel & Murdoc]
I think I might be a bit pagan
I've always thought that (Yeah)
I reckon about, uh, two-thirds pagan
Yeah, and what's the other third
Uh, Croydon

[Intro: 2D & Noodles]
Do you like driving in L.A., Noodle?
Driving down Route 101 during rush hour is harder than some of the deadliest battles I've been in
Then you've been in loads of those
Deadly battles, not traffic jams

[TAPE SCRATCHES]

[Outro: 2D, Murdoc & Russel]
Did you ever trace your family tree?
Yeah, I did; I did a thorough one
Where did it go back to?
Oh, back to the Tudors
I was, um, related to a Tudor bishop, bishop Murdoc
So Tudor times, if you could imagine; take yourself back (Yeah)
(Yeah, I'm picturing it)
Down the alleyway, the alleyways of old London town
People emptying buckets out of windows
That- that sound like L.A.

[Verse 1]
The kiss of Venus has got me on the go
She scored a bullseye in the early morning glow
Early mornin' glow

[Verse 2]
Packed with illusions, our world is turned around
This golden circle has a most harmonic sound
Harmonic sound

[Chorus]
And in the sunshine, when we stand alone
We came together with our secrets blown
Our secrets blown

[Verse 3]
Now moving slowly, we circle through the square
Two passing planets in the sweet, sweet summer air
Sweet summer air

[Chorus]
And in the sunshine, when we stand alone
We came together with our secrets blown
Our secrets blown

[Bridge]
Reflected mountains in a lake
Is this too much to take?
Asleep or wide awake?
And if the world begins to shake
Will something have to break?
We have to stay awake

[Verse 2]
Packed with illusions, our world is turned around
This golden circle has a most harmonic sound
Harmonic sound

[Chorus]
And in the sunshine, when we stand alone
We came together with our secrets blown
Our secrets blown

[Harpsichord Solo]

[Verse 1]
The kiss of Venus has got me on the go
She scored a bullseye in the early morning glow

Come together

We go on a mission, we don't do no bitching
Now spend like a ticket, we goin' to court (Yeah)
Judge and the DA like “Fuck is you doin' this for?," you know I was goin' to war
She tried to lynch me and give me two and a four, I left it in a hole in the floor

Went to Miami for four hunnid thousand, to roll up some loud with a boat on the water (Woah)

[Interlude 1: Meek Mill]
Blood still treat me like fam, my youngboy go with his daughter (Facts)

Ha!

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Daddy died by a .44, I be livin' like a warlord
'Member I was shackled C.S.C. up, now I'm back to backin' in a four-door
Million dollars worth of jewelry on, no insurance on, like, "What's goin' on?"
In the trenches like it's regular, people think that I be showin' off
All these niggas talkin' they be goin' off, gotta blow it off
Left my youngin' with the presidential at the Waldorf to hit a star raw
Told me as soon as he got it, he dip it inside it and goin' in raw dog
I give a fuck she an actress, a singer, or model, I pray it don't fall off
Let's pray
All these hoes still fuckin'
Ran up a check and you know how we bummin'
Get to a milli' then run up them Bentleys
I'm fresh outta Philly, you know we ain't runnin'
I see these niggas talk shit on the internet
Catch 'em in traffic, I know it ain't nothin'
I told my youngin' to spin and to let out, as soon as he let out I throwed a little sum (Brr)

[Interlude 2: Meek Mill]
Boss in my hood, I'm like Richard Porter
I just fucked a dime for free and she ain't get a quarter
But I still wired the five racks because that shit was water
Gang!
Ha!

[Verse 3: Vory]
All the money that I sent you, that don't last too long
Pussy good, I might just have to put my crew on
Ten years runnin' shit, and she know that I'm two on
Baby, don't be surprised if I ain't shoot a drop before the team or somethin'
I know you started with nothin'
Always startin' something but wanna talk about nothin', oh yeah, yeah
And please don't be surprised if I shoot the fuckin' broads, girl, you know how it goes
Girl, you know how it goes, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Shawty for the downfall, she must been around y'all
So please don't be surprised if I shoot or fuck the team, or somethin'
'Cause you started with nothin'
Always turning nothings to somethings
Yeah
Oh baby
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
I ain't grow up tryna find...

[Verse 1]
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long bеfore
Your legend еver did

[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
And even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have loved you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 3]
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Outro]
I would've liked to have known you
Oh, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

See, a man is a man of his word and keeps his word Snatches life by the collar, gets what he wants
But all of this power means nothing if he ain't happy

This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing Nothing, without a woman or a girl

A man's got power
A man's got riches
A man's got respect, but hangs in the trenches
Work day to day just to pay the bills
But behind all the lights, y'all The struggle is real
Hustler, baller (he may be)
What is a he (without a she)

This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing, nah, without a woman or a girl

See, a man's got dreams
A man wants to fly
Do what he got to do just to get by
See, a man comes from nothing
And makes something of himself
But no matter how much money
See, a woman is his true wealth
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Not one little thing, without a woman or a girl
He would be lost in the wilderness
He would be lost in bitterness
He would be lost (without a woman)
Man, see he would be lost (without a woman)
His world is nothing, without (without a woman)
All of his fortune and fame means nothing (without a woman)

This is a man's world but (without a woman)
This is a man's world
But it don't mean nothing (without a woman)
Nothing Without a W-O-M-A-N

[Intro: 070 Shake]
Fallin', dreamin', talkin' in your sleep
I know you want to cry all night, all night
Plottin', schemin', findin'
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me you will see

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Verse: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Couldn't kill me if you tried, couldn't kill me if I die
I'm gon' always be alive, you were always in denial
Heard your song you stole my vibе
So I brought back my old vibe
Funny every timе you lie, how that turn into more lies
I'm too nice to all my dogs
Stand by me when I go wrong
Please don't (mumbling)
Like you not do nothing wrong
Why they (mumbling)
Man I'm so mad at my dad (uh)
I fucked that bitch on the bed, I fucked that bitch on the rag
Years ago
Might get physical
Might get somewhat digital
Lights still on like digital
All romance got digital
How low (mumble) like critical
And this condition critical
And that sound so pitiful
Why you standing lookin' so pitiful
Don't you know that you more beautiful?
Everything about you beautiful
Everything about you beautiful
Nothing do without you (mumbling)
We can do without you (mumble)
Maybe the-
Maybe the, world would, be with, out me
Maybe we, see with, see with, out me
Maybe like, (mumble), days was, cloudy
Maybe got, (mumbling)
Still a shame, all these things, all the same
All the pain, was all a lane, and all the lanes, deliver thing
Everything
Everything

I bet you're wondеrin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me bluе
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I loved you more

[Pre-Chorus]
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday

[Chorus]
Don't you know that I heard, heard it through the grapevine
No longer would you be mine
Honey, honey, hey
Heard it through the grapevine
I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, honey, hey

Darlin', I love you

[You're All I Need To Get By]

[Chorus]
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, no no
Nothing like the real thing, baby, oh Lord no
Nothing like the real thing

[Outro]
You know, Tammi Terrell and I recorded a lot of love songs
Tammi used to say, "Marvin, our message is to lovers, isn't it?"
I said, "And our message is of love, isn't it?"
And that's what we strove for, to sing of love, about love
We wanted to sing because we know, and we knew that love was happening
We want you to reminisce a little
See if you remember this

[Your Precious Love]

[Verse]
What you've given me, oh, I could never return
'Cause there's so much, girl, I have yet to learn

[Chorus]
Heaven must have sent you from above, baby
Heaven must have sent your precious love

[Pride and Joy]

[Intro]
Because you, honey, you are
You're my pride and joy
I love you, I love you, little darlin'
Like a baby boy loves his toy
Ooh, you've got kisses sweeter than honey, oh Lord
I work seven days a week, giving you all my money
And that's why, baby, you, you, you are my pride and joy

[Outro]
Don't you believe it?
Sugar, that's why, honey, that's why you're my pride and joy
I can say it one more time

[Stubborn Kind of Fellow]

[Chorus]
I'm a stubborn kind of fellow
Yes, I'm a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you

[Outro]
Thank you
Thank you very kindly, ladies and gentlemen

Every day, that's alright, yeah
Lordy Lord Lord, I know that's alright, baby
Yeah, that's alright, sugar, yes, it is
You believe, baby, that's alright, sugar, woo

[Verse 1]
Some of us were born
With money to spend
Some of us were born
For races to win
Some of us are aware
That it's good for us to care
Some of us feel the icy wind
Of poverty blowing in the air
For those of us who simply like to socialize
For those of us who tend the sick
Ah, and heed the people's cries
Let me say to you

[Chorus]
Right on
Right on, yeah, woo
Oh, oh, oh Lord, people
And I say, Right on
Yeah, and honey, right on, woo

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
For thosе of us who live
Where pеace is craved
For those of us who live, baby
Where hatred is enslaved
For those of us who live a life
Surrounded by good fortune and wealth
Those of us who live a life
Hey, hey, hey, enjoying ourselves
For those of us who got drowned
In the sea of happiness
For the soul that takes pride in his God
And himself and, ooh, everything else, woo

[Bridge]
Woo, love, love, love, love
That's all it is
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Hey baby, what you know good
I'm just gettin' back, but you knew I would
War is hell -- when will it end?
When will people start gettin' together again?
Are things really gettin' better, like the newspaper said?
What else is new, my friend, besides what I read?
Can't find no work, can't find no job, my friend
Money is tighter than it's ever been
Say, man, I just don't understand
What's going on across this land

[Chorus]
Ah, what's happening, brother?
Man, what's happening? What's happening, my man?

[Verse 2]
Are they still gettin' down where we used to go and dance?
Will our ball club win the pennant?
Do you think they have a chance?
And tell me, friend, how in the world have you been?
Tell me what's out and I want to know what's in

[Chorus]
What's the deal? Man, what's happening? Woo
Ah, what's happening, brother?

[Intro]

[Scatting and harmonizing]

[Chorus]
Flyin' high, woo
Flyin' high in the friendly sky
Flyin' high, without ever leavin' the ground, no

[Verse 1]
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
And have laid their bodies down, yeah
I go to the place where danger awaits me
And it's bound to forsake me
So stupid-minded
Oh, so stupid-minded
But I go crazy when I can't find it -- not too loud
In the morning, I'll be alright, my friend
Soon the night will bring the pain
Pain, awful pain

[Chorus]
Flyin' high in the friendly sky, ah
Without ever leaving the ground, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, I ain't seen nothing but trouble, baby, wee-hoo
Nobody really understands -- help me somebody
Well, I go to the place where this feelin' awaits me
Self destruction in my hand
Oh Lord, so stupid-minded
Oh, so stupid-minded
But I go crazy when I can't find it
Well, I know I'm hooked, my friend
To the boy who makes slaves out of men
Oh oh, woo hoo hoo, ooh

[Chorus]
Flyin' high in the friendly sky, hey
Ooh hoo hoo, hoo
Wee-hoo, woo-hoo
Flyin' high in the friendly sky, woo-hoo

[Intro]
I just want to ask a question:
Who really cares?
To save a world in despair
Who really cares?

[Verse]
There'll come a time, when the world won't be singin'
Flowers won't grow, no no
You know bells won't be ringin'
Who really cares?
Who is willing to try
To save a world that is destined to die?
When I look at the world, it fills me with sorrow
Children today are really suffer tomorrow
Oh, what a shame, such a bad way to live
Ah, who is to blame when we can't stop livin'? Oh oh
Live, live for the life
But let live evеrybody
Live life for the childrеn
Oh, for the children
Oh oh, oh, save the babies, save the babies
Save the babies
And if you wanna love, you got to save the babies
Oh Lord, make them feel it
Please save the babies
All of the children

[Outro]
But, who really cares?
Who's willing to try
To save a world
Save the world
Save our sweet world that is destined to die
Oh, oh, la, la la la, la la la
Oh, oh, dig it everybody, woo

[Verse]
Oh, don't go and talk about my Father
Because God is my friend (God is my friend)
He made this world for us to live in, and gave us everything
And all He asks of us, ah yeah, is we give each other love, ah yeah
Don't go and talk about my Father
'Cause God is my friend (God is my friend)
He loves us whether or not we know it
And He'll forgive all our sins, ah yeah, ah
And all He asks of us, oh yeah, is we give each other love, ah yeah

[Outro]
Love your mother
Love your father
Love your sister
Love your brother, your brother, woo
Don't go and talk about my Father
God is my friend (God is my friend)
And when we call in Him for mercy
He'll be merciful, my friend
Oh, yes He will
And all he asks of us, I know, is we give each other love

[Spoken Interlude]
Ah yeah now now
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Ladies and gentlemen
This has been my very first attempt
Coming back to show business on a live stage, four years
I'd like for you to give these fine musicians and singers
A fine round of applause for a job well done
Although it was a struggle
Although it was a struggle for us
I think we—I feel pretty good about it
Because I'm not satisfied in my heart
I'm gonna—I was supposеd to make my exit to this point but I can't go
No, herе's why
We had in mind to do a album for you
Try to do it just like the album we hope that you would enjoy
You can't hear me up in the balcony?
We hope that you would enjoy if we tried to do the album just like you've been listening to it at home
That was our favorite attempt, folks
But me not being satisfied in my heart, I want...
Anything that you heard, that you liked, that you'd like to hear it over...
Hahaha, I'd be very happy to give it my shot
You didn't say the whole thing, I know
No, keep the rhythm going, keep the rhythm going
Well...
I'll tell you, I'd like to just a little bit more of "Inner City Blues" for you before we leave
And after that, we're gonna do "What's Going On" and we're gonna call it a night
Thank you
Gentlemen, "Inner City Blues" please, "Inner City Blues"
Now, one of these days, ha
Thank you so much for bearing with us, ladies and gentlemen
We're gonna try a little "Inner City Blues" for you right here again

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

I'm gonna dedicate this to my mother and father
Mr. and Mrs. Gaye, who are in the audience
I'd like you to acknowledge them, ladies and gentlemen
I love them very much
Also my family, sisters and brothers, all of you

Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah

[Verse 1]
Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
'Fore we see it, you take it

[Chorus]
Ah, make you wanna holler
The way they do my life, yeah
Make me wanna holler
Thе way they do my life
This ain't livin', this ain't livin'
No, no baby, this ain't livin'
No, no, no

[Verse 2]
Inflation, no chance
To incrеase, finance
Bills pile up, sky high
Send that boy off, to die

[Chorus]
Ah, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Ah baby

[Scatting and harmonizing]

[Verse 3]
Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
Oh, honey, that I can't pay my taxes

[Chorus]
Oh, make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Yeah, it makes me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands, OW

[Verse 4]
Crime is increasing
Trigger-happy policing
Ooh, panic is spreading
God knows where, where we're heading

[Chorus]
Ah, ooh, ah, ah, don't understand
Make me wanna holler
They don't understand, ah OW

[Scatting and harmonizing]

[Outro]
God bless you
And Lord keep you
And may you live, live, live a good life
God bless you
God keep you
May you live, live, live a long, long, sweet life
Don't let the things get you down
Hold your head up, baby, walk around
Said God bless you, and I keep you
I'm praying a prayer for each and every one of you
Heaven bless you, Heaven keep you
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, ooh, hoo
Thank you
"What's Going On"
Thank you
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen

[Spoken Intro]
"What's Going On," gentlemen
One, one, one, one, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today
Father, father
We don't need to escalate
War is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

[Pre-Chorus]
Picket lines, picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see

[Chorus]
Oh, what's going on
Yeah, what's going on
Tell me what's going on
I'll tell you what's going on

[Post-Chorus]
Woo, hoo, hoo hoo hoo

Doo-pi-dup, we-bi-pi-dup
Diddly-diddly-di-di-di

[Verse 2]
Mother, mother, everybody thinks we're wrong, ah, yes they do
I wanna know, who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long
You know we've got to find a way
To bring more lovin' here today
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Picket lines, picket signs
Don't punish me, with brutality
But talk to me
You can see

[Chorus]
Oh, what's going on
Woo, hoo
Tell me what's going on
Ah, woo

[Post-Chorus]
Woo, hoo hoo

[Announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Marvin Gaye
Marvin Gaye, let's have a big round of applause for Mr. Marvin Gaye
Would you do that?
Marvin Gaye returns to Washington
Marvin Gaye, wow

[Intro]
Ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine

Said I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Honey, honey, yeah

[Verse 1]
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone еlse
Instead I heard it through thе grapevine

[Chorus]
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
Honey, honey, yeah

[Bridge]
Honey, honey, I know
That you're letting me go
Honey, honey, I know
That you're letting me go

[Chorus]
Baby, I heard it through the grapevine
Ooh, I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah

[Outro]
Honey, honey, I know
That you're letting me go
Said I heard it through the grapevine
Ooh ooh, heard it through the grapevine

[Verse 1]
Mmm, Sunny, yesterday my heart it was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
Oh, the...
Oh
Mmm, Sunny, yesterday my heart it was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
Oh, the dark days are done, and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere
Sunny one so true, I love you

[Verse 2]
Mmm, Sunny, yesterday my heart it was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really еased the pain
Oh, the...
Oh, thе...
Oh, the...
Mmm, Sunny, yesterday my heart was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
Oh, the dark days are done, and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere
Sunny one so true, I love you

[Verse 3]
Mmm, Sunny, yesterday my heart it was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
Oh, the dark days are done, and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere
Sunny one so true, I love you

[Verse 1]
Honey, you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers grow from rain
(I know flowers grow from rain)
But how can love grow through pain?
(But how can love grow through pain?)

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Peculiar as can be, oh
Ain't that peculiar

[Verse 2]
You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
But I'm so much in love with you, baby, 'til I don't wanna see
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makеs my love stronger than beforе
If the truth makes love last longer
(If the truth makes love last longer)
Why do lies make my love stronger?
(Why do lies make my love stronger?)

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Ain't that peculiar
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Ain't that peculiar

[Bridge]
Hey hey, ah ah ah
Hey hey, ah ah ah
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity

[Verse 1]
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

[Verse 2]
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

[Verse 3]
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

[Piccolo trumpet solo]

[Chorus 2]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

[Verse 4]
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

[Verse 5]
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

[Chorus 2]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane

[Outro]
(Instrumental)
A suitable ending, I think!
The lying farmer tries to sleep.
He's drifting off while counting sheep.
Tucked in wool, hand-knitted covers,
the farmer counts his former lovers.

[Intro]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Ehh, ehh, uh

[Verse]

[?] with the homies while we're waiting for a
Couple of women who be down to trip 

[?]

[?] While trippin' off their faces
This molly got us zombie, got me feeling all sedated
White girl loving
With a van full of hippies
Who love us, so lovely
They didn't even hesitate to touch us
They love us, so we lust them
No one will catch them
No one can help them
Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
Yeah, I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo (Echo, echo, echo)
Echo (Echo, echo, echo)
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah, I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables (Ooh, ooh, ehh)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables (Ehh, ehh)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables (Ayy, ehh)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Bring out the glass tables
The stars buzz around me
all lovely and green,
with a bright swirl of dusty stuff
dancing between.

As I lay down in bed,
I still can't conceive
that they'll carry on gamboling
after I leave.

[Intro]
Hey, is this thing on?
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 1]
Call me a savage
When I'm shoutin' down that phone
You say I'm tragic
'Cause I'm picking fights alone
Over-dramatic
I swear this used to turn you on
I scream and I shout and I let it all out
But I just want you to know

[Verse 2]
Call me romantic
Yeah, I do it all for love
You say it's plastic
'Cause you seen it all before
I know it's classic
But with the highs they come the lows
I scream and I shout and I let it all out
But I just want you to know that

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Know I'm a lot but you got me now
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Know that it's love when you stick around
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Tell me if you're with it, are you with it or not?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
I'm looking for tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ouble
Tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ah
I'm looking for tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ouble
Tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ah

[Verse 3]
How do you stand it
When I drive you up the wall?
I know it's manic
But you always break my fall
After the madness
We forget about it all
I scrеam and I shout and I let it all out
But I just want you to know that

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Know I'm a lot but you got me now
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Know that it's love whеn you stick around
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Tell me if you're with it, are you with it or not?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
I'm looking for tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ouble
Tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ah
I'm looking for tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ouble
Tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ah

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me when you, when you had enough
You ain't got time, time to listen up
I get you're mad, let me make it up
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Know I'm a lot but you got me now
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Know that it's love when you stick around
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Tell me if you're with it, are you with it or not?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
I'm looking for tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ouble
Tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ah
I'm looking for tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ouble
Tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ah

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me when you, when you had enough
You ain't got time, time to listen up
I get you're mad, let me make it up
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa & Miley Cyrus]
Strung out on a feeling, my hands are tied
Your face on my ceiling, I fantasize
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it (I can't control it)
I try to replace it with city lights
I'll never escape it, I need the high
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it (Oh)

You keep making it harder to stay
But I still can't run away
I gotta know why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

You keep making it harder to stay (Oh, ah)

I wanna know why can't you, why can't you
I wanna know why can't you, why can't you
I gotta know why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

[Intro]
It's all an illusion
There's too much confusion

[Verse 1]
Down, down, down in your heart
Find, find, find the secret
Turn, turn, turn your head around
Baby we can do it, we can do it all right

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you believe in love at first sight?
It's an illusion, I don't care
Do you believe I can make you feel better?
Too much confusion, come on over here

[Chorus]
Can we get together?
I really, I really wanna be with you
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too

[Verse 2]
I searched, I searched, I sеarched my whole life
To find, find, find thе secret
But all I did was open up my eyes
Baby we can do it, we can do it all right

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you believe that we can change the future?
Do you believe I can make you feel better?

[Chorus]
Can we get together?
I really, I really wanna be with you
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too

Can we get together?
I really, I really wanna be with you
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too

[Bridge]
It's all an illusion
There's too much confusion
I'll make you feel better
If it's bitter at the start
Then it's sweeter in the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you believe in love at first sight?
It's an illusion, I don't care
Do you believe I can make you feel better?
Too much confusion, come on over here

[Chorus]
Can we get together?
I really, I really wanna be with you
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too

Get together, get together, get together, get together, get together, get together, get together
Get together, get together, get together, get together, get together, get together, get together

[Outro]
It's all an illusion
There's too much confusion
I'll make you feel better
If it's bitter at the start
Then it's sweeter in the end

[Intro]
I want everybody's hands up in the air!
I want you to wake like you just don’t care!
Now I want to see everybody jumping, come on!
Lift your feet up from the ground, let's go!
I want to see this whole building jumping!
I want to see all of London jumping!
I want to see the whole world jumping!
Come on, motherfuckers!

[Verse 1]
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
(Come on, keep on jumping!)
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

[Chorus]
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Verse 2]
Faster than the speeding light she’s flying
Trying to remember where it all began
(I don't see you jumping!)
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

[Chorus]
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
(Come on, keep on jumping!)
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Post-Chorus]
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
(Here we go!)

[Verse 3]
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

[Middle 8]
And I feel
(Come on, London, let's see you jump!)
Quicker than a ray of light, then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years

[Outro]
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, she’s flying
Quicker than a ray of light, I’m flying

[Verse 1]
Something in the way you love me won't let me be
I don't want to be your prisoner, so baby, won't you set me free?
Stop playing with my heart
Finish what you start
When you make my love come down
If you want me, let me know
Baby, let it show
Honey, don't you fool around

[Pre-Chorus]
Just try to understand (Understand)
I've given all I can
'Cause you got the best of me

[Chorus]
Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love
Over the borderline
Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love
Over the borderline
(Borderline)

[Verse 2]
Something in your eyes is making such a fool of me
When you hold me in your arms, you love me 'til I just can't see
But then you let me down
When I look around
Baby, you just can't be found
Stop driving me away
I just wanna stay
There's something I just got to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Just try to understand (Understand)
I've given all I can
(Motherfucker!)
'Cause you got the best of me

[Chorus]
Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love
Over the borderline
Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love
Over the borderline
(Borderline)

[Outro]
Keep pushing me
Keep pushing me
Keep pushing my love
(Keep on pushing my love over the borderline, borderline)
C'mon, baby
C'mon, darling, yeah
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
(Keep on pushing my love over the borderline, borderline)

[Intro]
This one's for the ladies!
Ladies!
Have you ever had a best friend
That wanted to do everything you wanted to do?
Including fuck your boyfriend?
Yeah you know what I’m talking about

[Verse 1]
I shoulda seen the sign way back then
When she told me that you were her best friend
And now she's rolling, rolling, rolling
And you were stolen, stolen, stolen
She started dressing like me, and talking like me
It freaked me out
She started calling you up in the middle of the night
What's that about?

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be there when you discover
You’ll wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might cook you breakfast, and love you in the shower
The flavor of the moment, 'cause she don't have what's ours

[Chorus]
She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (It won’t be the same)

[Verse 2]
I shoulda seen the sign when you were here
Under a different light, it’s all so clear
And she was stealing, stealing, stealing
And now you're feeling, feeling, feeling
She started dyeing her hair and wearing the same perfume as me
She started reading my books, and stealing my looks and lingerie

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might make you breakfast, and love you in the shower
The thrill is momentary, ’cause she don't have what's ours

[Chorus]
She's not me
She doesn’t have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (It won't be the same)

[Bridge]
She is licking her lips and she's batting her eyes
She's not me
She's got legs up to there and such beautiful hair
She's not me
Oh, devoted for life, make a beautiful wife
She's not me
If you spend some more time, I guarantee you will find
She's not me
I know I can do it better
(Bitch!)
(Wannabe!)

[Verse 3]
There's someone else to pimp your style
And hang with you a little while
And make up for the things you lack
You're gonna have to watch

[Chorus]
She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (It won't be the same)

[Interlude]
Never let you forget
(Never let you forget, never let you forget)
(Never let you forget, never let you forget, never let you forget)
(Never let you forget, never let you forget, never let you forget)
(She's not me)
(She's not me)
(Never let you forget, never let you forget, never let you forget)
(She's not me, and she never will be, she never will be)
(Never let you forget, never let you forget, never let you forget)
(Never will be, never will be, never will be)
(Never let you forget, never let you forget, never let you forget)
(Never will be, never will be)

[Outro]
(Never will be, never will be, never will be)
(Never will be, never will be, never will be)
(She's not me, and she never will be)
(Never will be, never will be, never will be)
(She's not me, and she never will be)
(She's not me)
(Never will be, never will be, never will be)
(Never will be, never will be)
(She's not me, and she never will be)

[Intro]
Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life, yeah (Yeah)
And if it wasn't for the music, I don't know what I'd do
(Hey, listen up to your local deejay)
(You better hear what he's got to say)
Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life, yeah (Yeah)
And if it wasn't for the music, I don't know what I'd do

[Hook]
Do you like to?
Do you like to?
Do you like to?
Do you like my acid rock?

Put your hands up for Argentina!

[Verse 1]
Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts, I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy

[Chorus]
(Music, music, music, music, music, music, music, music, music)
Music, makes the people come together
Music, mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

[Verse 2]
Don't think of yesterday and I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie-woogie (Uh-uh!)
It's like ridin' on the wind and it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in, got to have it every day

[Chorus]
Music, makes the people come together, yeah
Music, mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

[Interlude]
Ah! Ah!
(Hey, Mr. DJ)
Get out of here!

[Hook]
Do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like my acid rock?

[Verse 3]
Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts, I never wanna stop
(Oh, oh, please don't stop)
It's gonna drive me crazy

[Chorus]
Music, makes the people come together, yeah
Music, mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

Music, makes the people come together, yeah
Music, mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

Boogie-woogie, do you like my acid rock?

[Chorus]
Music, makes the people come together, yeah
Music, mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

[Outro]
Put your hands up for Argentina!

[Verse 1]
As quiet as it is tonight, you'd almost think you were safe
Your eyes are full of surprises, they cannot predict my fate
Waiting underneath the stars there's something you should know
The angels, they surround my heart, telling me to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet he couldn't, I bet he couldn't recognize
But I played right into it, who am I to criticize?
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

[Chorus]
It's like over and ove, you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over, you can't lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do, I do, I do

[Verse 2]
You almost fooled yourself this time, let all of the saints be praised
You hide your sadness behind your smile and you keep your lost heart raised (Lost heart raised)
With steps that edge along the ledge is much higher than it seems
But I've been on that ledge before, you can't hide yourself from me

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet he couldn't, I bet he couldn't recognize
I still played right into it, who am I to criticize?
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

[Chorus]
It's like over and over, you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over, you can't lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do, I do, I do

[Instrumental Breakdown]

[Chorus]
It's like over and over, you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over, you can't lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you
Devil wouldn't recognize you
Devil wouldn't recognize you
The devil wouldn't recognize you, I do, I do, I do
You, you, you, you
Devil wouldn't recognize you
I do

[Outro]
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you
I do

[Intro]
Are you having a good time?
Alright, Buenos Aires
The city that I love the most
This song is for you!

[Verse 1]
I just woke up from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe the things that I have seen
I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away

[Pre-Chorus]
All my dreams, they fade away
I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way I see myself
I can't pretend to be someone else

[Chorus]
You always lovе me more, miles away
I hеar it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
(So far away) So far away
Let me hear you sing!
(So far away) So far away
Come on, Argentina!
(So far away) So far away
(So far away) So far away

[Verse 2]
When no one is around, then I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You always have the biggest heart
When we're six thousand miles apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Too much of no sound
Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
(So far away) So far away
(So far away) So far away
(So far away) So far away
(So far away) So far away

[Bridge]
I'm alright, don't be sorry, but it's true
When I'm gone, you'll realize
That I'm the best thing that happened to you

[Breakdown]
You always love me more, miles away
Come on, put your hands together!
(I hear it in your voice, we're) Miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
(So far away) So far away
(So far away) So far away
(So far away) So far away
(So far away) So far away
(So far away) So far away
(So far away) So far away
(So far away) So far away
(So far away) So far away

[Intro]
Alee-o, alee-o
(Alee-o, alee-o)
Alee-o, alee-o
(Alee-o, alee-o)

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze (Tropical the island breeze)
All of nature wild and free (All of nature wild and free)
This is where I long to be (This is where I long to be)
La isla bonita
(Ha-ha-ha-ha!)

Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, mirala pala late
Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, mirala pala late

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, te amo
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, mirala pala late
Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, mirala pala late
(He-he-hey!)

[Bridge]
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy...
Hey! Loves a girl

[Chorus]
Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, mirala pala late
Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, mirala pala late

Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, mirala pala late
Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, mirala pala late

Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, mirala pala late
Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, mirala pala late

[Outro]
Lela
Pala tute

[Verse 1]
Where do we go from here?
This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all, I believed in you
You believed in me
Certainties disappear
What do we do for our dream to survive?
How do we keep all our passions alive
As we used to do?

[Chorus]
Deep in my heart I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me
You must love me

[Verse 2]
Why are you at my side?
How can I be any usе to you now?
Give me a chance and I'll lеt you see how
Nothing has changed

[Chorus]
Deep in my heart I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me
You must love me
You must love me
Who is the master and who is the slave?

C'mon, boy
I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll
Well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll, mmm
I want somеbody to speed it up for me
Then take it down slow
Thеre's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?

Sometimes I think what I need is a "you" intervention, yeah
And you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good, by the way that you move, oh hey
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, yeah
But if I die tonight, at least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?

Oh, God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees

What are you waiting for?
Nobody's gonna show you how
Why wait for someone else to do what you can do right now?
Got no boundaries and no limits
If there's excitement, put me in it
If it's against the law, arrest me
If you can handle it, undress me

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on, and on, and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on, and on, and on

Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah!
No one's gonna stop me now

[Verse 2: Madonna]
They say that a good thing never lasts, and then it has to fall
Those are the people that did not amount to much at all
Gimme the baseline, and I'll shake it
Gimme a record, and I'll break it
There's no beginning and no ending
Give me a chance to go, and I'll take it

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on, and on, and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left

Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

[Chorus]
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
(Come on, I wanna see you jump!)
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Verse 2]
Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
(Come on, let me see you jump!)
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

[Chorus]
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Post-Chorus]
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
(Let me see you jump!)

[Verse 3]
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

[Middle 8]
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years

[Outro]
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, she's flying
Quicker than a ray of light, I'm flying
(One, two, three, four!)

[Verse 1]
When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
There's a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of the lark

[Pre-Chorus]
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown

[Chorus]
Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

[Verse 2]
When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
There's a golden sky

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown

[Chorus]
Walk on, walk on (Walk on, walk on)
With hope in your heart (Hope in your heart)
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

The only thing we have to do is put it in our mind
Surely things will work out, cause they do every time, hey

[Chorus]
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be, woah
The world won't get no better

Ooh

I wrote this song as a tribute to 

[Chrissy and my] relationship and the fact that love can get us through all kinds of tough times, and we know that the world is going through tough times right now.

We know that Joe Biden personally has experienced so much tragedy. And what I think he's taught us and what he brings to this job, this idea of being the leader of this nation, is the fact that he's resilient, that he has empathy, that he understands what it is like to feel serious pain, that he's able to lead this country out of a serious, dark time in our history. And that's why I'm here today.

This song is called "Never Break."
Pennsylvania! Some of you know I spent my formative years right here at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm a proud Penn alum, but don't hold me responsible for the behavior of all of our alumni. Some of them, you know, they slipped through the cracks.

Anyway, we've got to get down to business Philly. Tomorrow, Pennsylvania will determine not only who becomes the next President, but who we are as a county. This has been a difficult year. So many of us have experienced pain and struggle and loss. We've lost friends and family members, jobs and paychecks. Just last week we lost another black man, Walter Wallace Jr., right here in Philadelphia, to police violence. A man with mental health needs, who just like so many other Americans wasn't able to get the care he needed.

So yes, we've lost a lot, but Philadelphia, what we haven't lost is our ability to decide what happens next. In this election, you vote will decide whether we're a country that allows this pandemic to continue indefinitely or one with a plan to end it. A country where the president can go to court to kick 20 million people off of their healthcare or one where healthcare is a right for all Americans. A country where the president actively encourages police brutality and cannot bring himself to condemn white supremacists or neo-Nazis or one where we hold our police accountable and begin to root out the systemic racism in our society. A country that is small, mean, selfish, and divided or a country that is big, generous, kind, and decent. A country where we remember that while we may have different politics and different beliefs, we are all Americans. And that's why I already voted for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

Joe Biden will be a president who doesn't take pleasure in dividing us, but one who works hard to bring us together in common cause and common effort, a president guided not by wishful thinking, but by belief in science and a commitment to justice.

Now, some people see the meanness, the bullying, the selfishness of Donald Trump and they mistake it for strength, a kind of twisted masculinity. Some see his greed and they mistake it for being good at business. Some of your former favorite rappers have been taken in by these lies. I think they've even founded a new supergroup. It's called the Sunken Place.

But Trump's Platinum Plan for black folks is nothing but fool's gold because you can't bank on a word he says. Ask the students of Trump University. Ask all of the contractors he stiffed. Ask the people his charity was supposed to help before it was shut down for being a fraud. Ask all the black and brown Americans who are dying from this virus and losing their jobs under his watch. The president isn't strong. He's a coward and his career in business and in government has been failure after failure after failure.

We need a president we can trust. That's the kind of president Joe Biden will be. And he won't only reverse the damage of the last four years, hand in hand with Senator Kamala Harris, they will build back a  better economy and country than ever before. But Joe can not do this alone. He needs your help, and tomorrow he needs your vote.

Go to iwillvote.com right now to find your polling place and figure out where, when, and how you're casting your ballot if you haven't done it. And if you've already voted, make sure your friends and family members have a plan to do the same thing. Remember you have two options in Pennsylvania, you can vote in person tomorrow between 7 AM and 8PM or you can deliver your mail in ballot in person-in person, don't put it in the mail-in person- to one of the drop boxes or election offices located in your county by tomorrow at 8 PM. And make sure you read and follow the instructions. Put the ballot in a small envelope. Don't be caught out there naked. Then put the whole thing in the big envelope and sign it. That's the only way it will count.

Remember the other side would not be trying so hard to stop you from voting if they weren't so scared of what your vote could do. Don't let them take away your vote. Don't let them take away your voice. Philadelphia we have the power to put an end to this nightmare. If we win this state, then Donald Trump will be gone and Joe Biden will be the next president of the United States. This is more than an election. As Joe says, "it's a battle for the soul of our nation." And together, with our voices and with our votes, we will win.

And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Chorus]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground

We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha, sha-hallow

It’s been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I’m back in town
This time I’m not leaving without you
(Spoken)
I'm not leaving without your vote tonight, you know that right?
(Sung)
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I’m not leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"
(Spoken)
Come on put your hands up. Are you ready? A one, two, three

[Chorus]
Something, something about this place
(Spoken)
You love this place don't you? Come on cheer for it
(Sung)
Something, something, ‘bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Pennsylvania guy
Yeah, there's something about, Joe, you and I

[Verse 2]
It’s been two years since I let you go
I couldn’t listen to a joke or a Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me Neil Young "Heart of Gold"
With a guitar humming and a no clothes
This time I’m not leaving without you, oh, oh, oh, oh
(spoken)
And you know I put on some country clothes the other day and said I was voting for Joe 'cause I wear cabellas when I'm on a four-wheeler in Pennsylvania. And I will not be told what I can and cannot wear to endorse our future president. So this is what I have to say about that. I might not always look like you, but I am you. We are each other

[Pre-Chorus]
Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down where we belong, the whole damn country

[Chorus]
Something, something about this place
(Spoken)
The beautiful countryside
(Sung)
Something, ‘bout lonely nights
And my lipstick all over your face
Something, something about my cool Pensylvania guy
(Spoken)
I'm not kidding, we need every single vote and Imma keep saying it
(Sung)

[Chorus: Lukas Graham & Wiz Khalifa]
I'm not forgettin' where I'm comin' from
But I won't forget where I'm goin'
I've worked too hard for me to not go on
You don't know what it's like where I'm from
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
You know I didn't alone
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
Before you're right you gotta do it wrong
(Pssh, huh, oh man)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh man
Used to be the young one, now I turned to a grown man
Always gotta put on for my soldiers, fallen
Gotta run to it when I hear that money callin' (Brr)
Stand up
Can't be a lil' ass kid 'bout shit no more, gotta man up
It ain't about you at the end of the day, you got things you gotta handle
When they ask me why I go so hard, I blame that on where I came from
Pittsburgh, when it come to niggas I'm the realest version
Smoke good, man it's KK, you should see in person
Niggas hate when you come up, and this shit disturbin'
So much in my bank account, made a nigga nervous
Like, "What I'm gon' do with all that?"
Go hard and never fall back, tryna maintain
Focused on havin' good habits, if it work once, do the same thing
Pave the way for the people comin' up after me, to take the same lane
Been the same way since I came in the game, ain't a nigga ain't changed, mane

[Chorus: Lukas Graham & Wiz Khalifa]
I'm not forgettin' where I'm comin' from
But I won't forget where I'm goin'
I've worked too hard for me to not go on
You don't know what it's like where I'm from
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
You know I didn't alone
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
Before you're right you gotta do it wrong
(Pssh, huh)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Gotta build and destroy
Gotta know what to avoid
Gotta hustle 'til it's gone
Gotta go 'til your feet can't no more
Gotta always stay strong
Gotta last real long, don't gotta live up to the expectations
Just gotta prove 'em wrong
If anytime they don't understand, it's somethin' you done show
How the ground really gone? How the whole dawn it'll be right there for him
On a rooftop, smokin' KK out a bong
With my real niggas that I started with, know one day they'd be on
Run away, niggas was strugglin'
Every day hustlin', now we got bank accounts goin' through customs in
They just be showin' us love
I could afford a dub
But I've learn to roll with the punches, if you wanna throw 'em, I cover up
Know that I got it, I don't need no confirmation
I smoke, ain't no ventilation
My money keep calculatin'
It's out there, then I'ma chase it
No question if I can make it
I'm feelin' like I'm the greatest
When you are real, one can never break you, it ain't 'bout all the mills that you put in the safe

[Chorus: Lukas Graham]
I'm not forgettin' where I'm comin' from
But I won't forget where I'm goin'
I've worked too hard for me to not go on
You don't know what it's like where I'm from
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
You know I didn't alone
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
Before you're right you gotta do it wrong

[Bridge: Lukas Graham & Wiz Khalifa, Lukas Graham]
I did what I had, I've my mistakes
My foot's on the gas and I won't hit the breaks
Win some and then some, I do what it takes
But I won't forget where I'm from
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
You know I didn't alone
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
Before you're right you gotta do it wrong

[Chorus: Lukas Graham]
I'm not forgettin' where I'm comin' from (I'm not forgettin' where I'm comin' from)
But I won't forget where I'm goin' (But I won't forget where I'm goin')
I've worked too hard for me to not go on (I've worked too hard for me to not go on)
You don't know what it's like where I'm from (You don't know what it's like where I'm from)
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh (Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh)
You know I didn't alone (You know I didn't alone)
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh (Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh)
Before you're right you gotta do it wrong (Before you're right you gotta do it wrong)

[Outro: Lukas Graham]
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh (Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh)
You know I didn't alone (You know I didn't alone)
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh (Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh)
Before you're right you gotta do it wrong (Before you're right you gotta do it wrong)

(Living in a material world)
(Living in a material world)
(Living in a material world)

[Verse 1]
Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right

[Chorus]
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

[Verse 2]
Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interеst, then I have to let thеm be
Some boys try, and some boys lie
But I don't let them play, no way
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

[Chorus]
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Boys may come, and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich, and now they're after me

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

[Outro]
(Living in a material world)
(Living in a material world)
(Living in a material world) Materia-al
Yes, I am the luckiest girl in the world!

I mean, I failed at marriage twice already
Look, I mean, I'm almost sheeding a tear right now
Thinking about a third possible failure...
Just kidding

[Intro]
Why don’t you return my calls?
Why don’t you return my calls?
Why you trip 'bout where I be?
You don't ever come and see me
(Come and see me, come and see me, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh
(I want your love)

[Verse]
What you mean that you ain't fuckin' me no more?
Lil' bitch, is you dumb?
Slackin' on my pimpin' made you leave me for a new one
Girl, I'm way too wavy, let you play me like it's too fun
Malice in my palace, you the salad to my crouton
Keisha, Jenny, Gia, give a fuck about what they say
Talkin' like Madea with that rah-rah and that ray-tay
Me, I'm somewhere smoking on a B and got that A-grade
On the block, I'm spinnin' on that bitch just like a Beyblade
Don't fuck with my exes, but get texts on a late night
Airplane mode, I'm like the wheels, 'bout to take flight
And it's five-hundred on the dash
And to them tings I'm tryna bag, I'm on yo' ass, ah
Money is the motive, you got no emotion
Only two niggas she want is Benjamin and Borden
If money ain't in hand, then the plan get aborted
Slick with that finesse, I bet she'll make you feel important

[Chorus]
But ain't nothing important to her (No)
Ain't nothing important (No)
But Benjamins and Bordens (Benjamins and Bordens)
But ain't nothing important to her (No)
Ain't nothing important (No)
But Benjamins and Bordens (Benjamins and Bordens)
(I want your love)

[Outro]
What you mean you went and found another nigga? Bitch, is you dumb? (Is you dumb)

[Part 2: Are You Dumb]

[Intro]
Bitch, are you dumb?
Broke my heart, and found someone, are you dumb?
Are you stupid, psychotic or dumb, my girl, which one? (Which one)
'Cause it must be one

[Verse]
Is it crack, cocaine or meth you smoke?
What type of drugs you on?  (What type of drugs?)
'Cause, bitch, you ain't never left before
Is it make-believe? 'Cause we must be the joke of the summer
You can't leave me so open, had your pussy soakin', it's drippin' all over my covers (Oh)
You know we been fuckin', I had you chin tuckin'
Licking your tongue and then grabbin' your chin when you dick suckin'
Put my chicken in your dip like it's Kentucky
Now you fronted to that nigga like you didn't love it
I couldn't have figured
Heard this nigga get more paper than me
I can't even flex and say I'm richer
Guess I'm just the Rollie, he the Richard (Damn)
I feel embarrassed
I was thinking 'bout horse and a carriage
Thinking 'bout kids in our backyard
And you come divorcing a marriage

[Chorus]
Are you dumb? (Oh) Are you dumb?
Are you dumb? (Oh) Are you dumb? (You must be dumb)
Made me put in work when you was tryna find someone
(One question) Are you fuckin' dumb? Are you fuckin' dumb?

[Outro]
Are you?
Are you?
Are you?

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You got me in denial, in denial
When you say it's over
And all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you in denial, in denial
When they say it's over

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
See, it started at the park
Used to chill after dark
Oh, when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart
'Cause we both thought
That love lasts forever (Lasts forever)
They say we're too young
To get ourselves sprung
Oh, we didn't care
We made it very clear
And they also said
That we couldn't last together (Last together)

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
See, it's very defined
You're one of a kind
But you mash-up my mind
You often get declined
Oh, girl, my baby is drivin' me crazy

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You got me in denial, in denial
When you say it's over
And all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you in denial, in denial
When they say it's over

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
It was back in '99
Watchin' movies all the time
Oh, when I rushed back just to see you in time
And I never thought
That we was gonna see each other (See each other)
And then I came out
Mami moved me down south
Oh, I'm with my girl, who I thought was my world
It came out to be
That she wasn't the girl for me (Girl for me)

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
See, it's very defined
You're one of a kind
But you mash-up my mind
You often get declined
Oh, girl, my baby is drivin' me crazy

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You got me in denial, in denial
When you say it's over
And all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you in denial, in denial
When they say it's over

[Verse 3: Sean Kingston]
Now we're fussin'
And now we're fightin'
Please tell me why
I'm feelin' slight-ed
And I don't know
How to make it better (Make it better)
You're datin' other guys
You're tellin' me lies
Oh, I can't believe
What I'm seein' with my eyes
I'm losin' my mind
And I don't think it's clever (Think it's clever)

[Outro: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You got me in denial, in denial

I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I’ll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's making me say

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin’ to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave mе life
Baby, I can't explain

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold mе, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy (Yes, oh God)
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can’t wait another second
’Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don’t go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don’t go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & (Chance the Rapper)]
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
(Feels so) Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy (Feels so)

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Who finna point me in the right direction?
Every day I feel my mistakes are a sign from heaven
I wanna move back to the block and get right back to seven
Drug dealers, candy paint, and chop and screw the message
I stay truer than true
I’m feelin’ bluer than blue
I wonder what would I do if I ain’t have me a group
Baby boy, look at you, why you trippin’ off of school?
You should feel like a troop for the days you had to do

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You’re my everything, my everything, yah

I have no regrets
I don't have to justify anything
We all feel the same way
Why don't you just deal with it?
Just look in a mirror
Deal with it, deal with it
Deal with it, deal with it
I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
It's human nature
I have no regrets
I don't have to justify anything
Just look in a mirror
Deal with it
Deal with it
I'm not sorry
It's human nature
Lyrics from Snippet

[?] my city, it's apparent
Doing shit I couldn’t even imagine

[?] where I'm from, 

[?] I'm cashin’
Every different state, a different bad bitch
Everywhere I go, I keep it savage

[Verse 1]
Love is strown across the boulevard
Twist the knife as the night falls apart
I had a dream about you yesterday
I wish I dreamt about you every day

[Chorus 1]
You could break me if you tried
I promise it wouldn't be too hard
God, I wish that you would try someday
I 

[proudly need to mend the scars?]

[Verse 2]
Leaving only parts of me behind
The less you 

[notice me?] I'm on your mind
I keep drowning in my own obsessions
Void of will, slave to regression

[Chorus 2]
You could love me if you tried
Though it might seem awful hard
If you carried me on your mind
Surely, there are worse things to do
You could love me if you tried
You could love me if you tried
You could love me if you tried
You could love me if you tried

[Verse 1]
I remember some of the rain
I remember the sound of your name
Sitting in the back of my head like a song
I remember singing softly along

[Chorus]
You said you don't want to marry me, no-oh
You said you don't want to marry me, no
You say you're tired of hanging on so long
You said you don't want to marry me, no

[Verse 2]
I remember the feeling of your pain
I remember the looming senes of shame
Sitting in the back of my mind all along
I remember getting a call of your own

[Chorus]
You said you don't want to marry me, no-oh
You said you don't want to marry me, no
You say you're tired of hanging on so long
You said you don't want to marry me, no

[Verse]
Silence befalls the morning 

[that's lost a lover?]
Awakens the howls of 

[pain and relief familiar?]
Armed without any 

[solid?] stare
You check and I'm no longer there
You come searching for me in the night
In the night, in the night
But I'm no longer there

[Chorus]
We say our goodbyes on the phone
Retreat to the safety of home
Denying all company
Let's set aside all words of hope
Till we learn to get by on our own
We'rе in no need of saving
We'll just take it or leavе it

[Chorus]
We'll say our goodbyes on the phone
Retreat to the safety of home
Denying all company
Let's set aside all words of hope
Till we learn to get by on our own
We're in no need of saving
We'll just take it or leave it

[Outro]
Oh, 

[?]
Oh, we're standing 

[?]
Oh, Don't stand in my way
Strung out those manias
I have run out of names to call, alone
The world keeps humming over my head
Leaving me at the feet
Of defined signs, let me in

I need some help
Well, no can't you tell, tell
I know my head gets mixed up beneath the concoctions of
Love and 

[concern?]
But I come with my head in my hands
It's too much to feel on my own
Need a god
Need a light

Just sit back and take it as it comes
Day after day it overwrites
All that you have planned for your life
A passenger caught in a vice
Crying 

[halleluiah?]
Stranded in a hotеl room
No lifelines left to usе
No bottles left to confide in
No personas left to choose

[?] you 

[?]
I've played them all, all
From the rise to the fall, fall

I know my heart 

[gets backed up?]
In 

[need?] doses of will and desire
But I come with my head in my hands
It's too much to feel on my own
Need a god
Need a light
A vague, yet familiar scent
Slips quietly underneath my window pain
As I sleep
Dusting off the passions that just about remain
Remnants, glistening
Fall prey to the dripping light of a new morn
Cue the velvet moan of the night
What a harrowing sight to behold
As dear security of old
Dissolves under one’s hand
With no plan
In a desolate land
A man is left to stand
On his own

I know it well

Masquerade the pain
Behind kind and gentle eyes
Still, a dawning fog descends
Struggling to find the line between
Reality and the impending fear of
The make believe
I recall the distinct call
Of that demon I’ve met so many times before
A handshake so familiar and warm
He wanders in like a friend
When you’re in need
Turns into a silent killer in the dark
He doesn’t guess
He doesn’t ask
He has no time to explain
Why he brings with him this shame
In heavy burdens
I know it well

But I know of a sacred shrine
Where the golden sun will shine
And drape the light like a honey veil
Over all the evils that dim down and pale
An oasis in the hells of my days
Where I always want to stay
Where I’m warm
Where I’m safe
A man free to quarrel with his mind
So long have we known each other
(So long have we known each other)
So little do we know (Little do we know)
Sometimes I feel like strangers (Sometimes I feel like strangers)
The real us we seldom do show (Seldom do show)

Desire, it covers our faces
It happens in curious places
Your body, it covers my tower
Ecstasy is ours

I dream of a physical evening
(Dream of a physical evening, dream of a physical evening
Drеam of a physical evening)
I long 4 a night within U
U're saving your lovе 4 some soldier
(Some soldier, some soldier, some soldier)
Who'd much rather die than stay by your side
If U only knew

Desire, it covers our faces
It happens in curious places
Your body, it covers my tower
Ecstasy is ours
A ghost from your past
Prevents us from knowing the pleasures of love
What must I do 2 convince U
Isn't the expression on my complexion enough?
(Ecstasy)
Don't tell me we have conflicting emotions
It's written all over your face
Come my love, cover my tower
Ecstasy is ours

So long have we known each other
(So long have we known each other)
So little do we know
Let me show U

Desire, it covers our faces
It happens in curious places
Your body, it covers my tower
Ecstasy is ours

Desire, it covers our faces
It happens in curious places
Your body, it covers my tower
Ecstasy is ours

Desire, it covers our faces
It happens in curious places
Your body, it covers my tower
Ecstasy is ours
Woah, no, woah, yeah
Woah, no, woah no, yeah, yeah

There's a gentle autumn breeze that blows
Whenever we be lyin', lyin' in my bed
The moon appears and disappears, you look at me
My clothes I quickly, I quickly shed

The curtains dance a minuet, autumn plays the music
Baby, come on hold my hand, leaves are fallin'
Velvet splash, only you and I can under
Only you can understand

The sunlight draws a picture through the silky lace
That hangs above your, hangs above your door
A picture that is waving that is seems to be
With every thrust you makе me beg for more

A robin sings a mastеrpiece
That lives and dies unheard
For screams of passion
A sound produced by two in love
(Oh, two in love)
Curtains dance and autumn plays on
(And on and on)

The screams of passion, all I hear in my 

[unverified]
Echoing like a volcano, baby, the screams of passion
Back and forth the raging seas of lust, I want u madly
Can't you tell, can't you tell, can't you tell, can't you tell, oh

Take me in your arms, oh baby, the crime is done
I'd rather die here in your screams of passion
(Woah, hold me now, baby)
Tell me that you 

[unverified] me
(Tell me that you 

[unverified] me)
Is it Sunday or is it passion?

[Verse 1]
Wouldn't it be nice if we just laid in bed
All day in our desires?
The world can make its pretty noise
While you and me can play in here together

[Chorus]
Mmm, every day I wake up from a dream
Into another dream
That dream is you
Oh, you

[Verse 2]
Wouldn't it be nice to hold each other
When we're older and remember?
(These days)
To look into each other's eyes
And see our younger selves look back with laughter
(At these days)

[Chorus]
Mmm, every day I wake up from a dream
The sound of your breathing
The sound of my love
It's you

[Outro]
Your heart is my only home
I'll never be alone when it's near me
Be near me, come closer
Closer, just be with me

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, trappin' like the Carter
Yeah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Double MG, we gon' crush y'all
If it's fuck me, then it's fuck y'all
Niggas, they don't want war
Spent a hundred on my Patek, took them cuffs off
Totin' automatics, this the shit we get a rush for
All this rose gold look like duck sauce
In the Maybach with a young broad
Why the fuck would I give a fuck for
We don't lose sleep 'bout a fuck boy
Sendin' hits like a drug lord, Pablo
Dog food like Rylo
If they all move, then they die slow, pronto
Mixin' that Gucci, that Louis, that Yves Saint Laurent with that new Milano
Feelin' that shit that I ride for
Pop a wheelie when we see the 5-O
Who gon' motivate niggas if I go? Namе one
At the clear port, whеre you can't come
Eatin' finger lickin' on an G5, breath stank with the A1
When it come to rappers, I don't be with niggas
I'm still mobbin' on 'em with my day ones
Lil' shawty tried to play the kid but I'm Jay Sean
Handle that rod like it's M1, talkin' hot sauce
When it pop off with my Glock off
And the Wraith here from a pop-star
Man, I'm livin' a life niggas would die for
This that young nigga talk out the dealership
When you killin' shit, on some winnin' shit
At the VMAs with the .30 on me
In the front row and we with the shit
Heard these fuck-niggas had the free smoke
When we run into 'em, we gon' kill and shit
Talkin' really quick, keep the strap on me like a nigga's bitch

[Interlude: YFN Lucci]
(Yeah, yeah)
(Hard body, hard body, yeah, yeah, oh)
(Oh-oh, oh)
(Hard body, hard body, yeah)

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Okay, look, Young Fly Nigga 'bout cash, say fuck the other side
They don't want no drama with us, I hate my brother died
Now we want homicide, murder after murder, wan' make his momma cry
Kidnap his kids, leave 'em traumatized
We gon' hide niggas, they ain't gon' find niggas
Gotta keep that semi on my side like a side-kicker
Long live my nigga forever, we waited forever
Make my kid get a kid, they got a family forever, yeah
Get 'em sent far like the Godfather, that's on my daughter, yeah
Oh, I want his bitch and his sister and his friends, yeah, nigga, yeah
Uh, MAC-10, too many burners in the black van
Hit up permanent best friend, we got weapon
We won't condone it, won't address it
Hundred thousand on his head, make my dawg fetch it, yeah
Hundred thousand in my pocket, make 'em look pregnant, yeah, uh
AP on me lit, I don't want your bitch
Every single diamond VVS, I'ma hold it down by my respect
Ayy, fuck they found this nigga at? Yeah
Hit him nine times, if he survive, that cat was blessed, yeah, yeah
Murder for fun
Y'all niggas, you know we good with them hammers and guns
You know if you hit 'em in the head, we gon' double the fun
And if the nigga ain't dead, I'ma need a refund, yeah
Look, .44 F&N, two desert eagles, you know how we comin', nigga
More sticks than the army, nigga
More drugs than a pharmacist, nigga
I dare you try to harm a nigga, you harmless, nigga, yeah
100K on my neck and it's charmless, nigga
You know who the don is, yeah
Pop a seal and let my soul spill, yeah
I'm still the goat in the farm field
On my second mill', I told my partners chill
Put 60K on my wrist to make my aunt chill

[Outro: YFN Lucci]
Yeah, hard body, hard body, yeah
Where I'm from there ain't no love for 'em
Nobody, nobody, yeah, yeah, uh
Ain't no love, no, no
From the other side, yeah
Uh
When one meets another,
he or she must treat him or her kindly.
If a third were to enter,
he or she must be swiftly executed to avoid confusion.
The pussy has become overwhelming,
it's tumbling out of every suitcase,
whirring beneath every floorboard.

Who thought the pussy could become so cumbersome?
It stacks against my front door like fresh snow,
presses its lips against the glass of my kitchen window
like an inmate's wife would do with her regular face lips.

Where the whole world was once empty, it is now pussy-
as if I'm trying to measure the atmosphere's volume
by means of pussy displacement.
I don't want to die.

It keeps me up at night.

Because I know that when I die, whenever that will be, I'll probably wake up in some futuristic shopping mall, having just spent two space dollars and a mere fifteen space minutes living "my life" by means of one of the future's virtual reality massage chairs. Then I'll get up and watch the long line of people circle through, living "my life" then getting back in line.

And I'll remember who I am again.
I'm Xia Cobolt, a twelve-year-old Pan-Asian Euroamerican girl.

And I'm a fugitive.

Words are useless, especially sentences
They don't stand for anything
How could they explain how I feel

[Chorus]
Traveling, traveling

Leaving logic and reason
Traveling, traveling
I'm gonna relax
Traveling, traveling
In the arms of unconsciousness

Le-le-le, le-le-le-le
Let's get unconscious

And inside we're all still wet
Longing and yearning
How can I explain how I feel?

Let's get unconscious
Let's get unconscious

Let's get unconscious

[Interlude]
And I feel

And all that you've ever learned
Try to forget
I'll never explain again

[Intro]
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm
Get unconscious
Get unconscious
Get un-, get un-
Get-get-get unconscious

[Verse 1]
Today is the last day that I'm using words
They've gone out, lost their meaning
Don't function anymore

[Chorus]
Traveling
Leaving logic and reason
Traveling
To the arms of unconsciousness
Traveling
Leaving logic and reason
Traveling
To the arms of unconsciousness

[Refrain]
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious
Let's get unconscious, honey

[Outro]
And all that you've ever learned
Try to forget
I'll never explain again

[Verse 1]
Slipped away like grains of sand
Couldn't hold you long enough in my hands
Can't remember how it went from good to bad
Now I just reminisce, I just reminisce on everything we had

[Pre-Chorus]
The times you used to call me "Baby"
Driving in your old Mercedes
That feels like a distant memory now

[Chorus]
If I had one chance to tell you how I loved you
I'd be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what you meant to me

[Post-Chorus]
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen

[Verse 2]
I never meant for it to end this way (End this way)
I wish that I could say this face to face (Face to face)
Holding on for hope your mind would change (Mind would change)
'Cause I want you back (Want you back)
I need you back to take this pain away (Take this pain away)

[Pre-Chorus]
The times you used to call me "Baby"
Driving in your old Mercedes
That feels like a distant memory now

[Chorus]
If I had one chance to tell you how I loved you
I'd be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what you meant to me

[Post-Chorus]
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen

[Bridge]
My only request, I wish you the best
But I can't get no sleep, I can't get no rest
My head is a mess, between "No" and "Yes"
Right now you're heavy on my mind
I don't wanna guess what you're thinking tonight
I want the facts, I don't want no more lies
I just want a chance to make it right
I just want a chance to make it right

[Chorus]
If I had one chance to tell you how I loved you
I'd be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what you meant to me

[Post-Chorus]
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen

All I want is head, I ain't talking school
...
You plan on losing, not (Hall nah)

[Kodak Black]
I'm hustling like I ain't got nothin'

[Verse 1]
I wasn't gonna tell you this
Into that secret I cannot commit
But it's true, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you
Now I'm speaking from my heart
Yeah, I was enough of this camouflage
Now you feel, now you feel, now you feel how that

[Chorus]
The truth hurts, but lies hurt worse
Tonight I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Head first, nowhere left to turn
So I'm wearing my heart on my

So even if you walk away
And leave me with this guilt and shame
At least I was true, I was true, I was true to you
Yeah, I know my heart may ache
I've heard that happens all the time
I'd rathеr take the risk than play it safe tonight

[Chorus]
Thе truth hurts, but lies hurt worse
Tonight I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Head first, nowhere left to turn
So I'm wearing my heart on my

Why do I have to show it all?
Showing you the rise and fall
Is it how it's meant to be?
If you don't love me
I guess that's okay
I'll keep loving you just the same
I'm so glad I was true, I'm so glad I was true to you

[Chorus]
The truth hurts, but lies hurt worse
I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Head first, nowhere left to turn
So I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve

[Outro]
So I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
So I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Hey, look! It's the Youth.
The Youth is fighting the Man.
How cute. Get him, Youth! Get him!
Yikes, that was quick.
You'll get him next time!

[Intro]
Guilty, guilty, guilty

[Verse 1]
Took myself out for dancing, a little romancing
I’m learning to be alone
Left that sadness behind me, won’t let it define me
I’m on my own, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t have to tell you where I’m going
Who I’m going with or when I’ll be back home
Back home

[Chorus]
Feeling guilty ‘cause I feel so good
‘Cause I feel so good
Guilty ‘cause I feel so good
I know I shouldn’t feel so guilty
‘Cause I did no wrong, I’m just having fun
You’re the one that pulled the plug
Somehow I’m the guilty one
(Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty)

[Verse 2]
We could blame it on timing, if that justifies it
But we have to let go
This new rhythm I’m finding
Is helping me find me
I hope you do too

[Pre-Chorus]
You don’t have to tell me where you’re going
Who you’re going with or when you’ll be back home
Back home

[Chorus]
Oh, I’m feeling guilty ‘cause I feel so good
‘Cause I feel so good
Guilty ‘cause I feel so good
I know I shouldn’t feel so guilty
‘Cause I did no wrong, I’m just having fun
You’re the one that pulled the plug
Somehow I’m the guilty one
(Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty)

[Chorus]
Feeling guilty ‘cause I feel so good
‘Cause I feel so good
Guilty ‘cause I feel so good
I know I shouldn’t feel so guilty
‘Cause I did no wrong, I’m just having fun
You’re the one that pulled the plug
Somehow I’m the guilty one
Feeling guilty ‘cause I feel so good
‘Cause I feel so good
Guilty ‘cause I feel so good
I know I shouldn’t feel so guilty
‘Cause I did no wrong, I’m just having fun
You’re the one that pulled the plug
Somehow I’m the guilty one
(Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty)

'Cause I don't get on the internet no more

[Verse]
Wake up 

[?]
I don't got no time, I got a lotta shit on my mind

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
They gon' make a leak, they gon' make a leak
Man, they ball in the summer and they fall by the spring, aye
They gon' make a leak, they gon' make a leak
Man, they ball in the summer and they fall by the spring, aye

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out, know 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Break the bank and throw the money in the trash bag
If they kill me, please don't make my name a hashtag
They might steal your moment to set up a cash grab
But it's no way they maintain it if it ain't organic, gain it
No complaining in the business of obtaining what's our maintenance
Stain the glass and tint the windows so they can't see what you making off the top
Milk and honey on the rocks
Never lucky when it drops
Not your buddy or a prop
Y'all talk funny like the cops

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out, know 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out, know 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your house and dump like the trash man
All up in your grill, but I'm not a fan
Merlyn, I do no hat trick, just show me where the cash at
Then show me where the hash at, fuck that
Show me where the cash at
I would rather be on acid, rather make investments
They'll come out of that debt, we'll come out of those bedsheets
I'm like the IRS, pull up to your address
I was trying my best to seizure, but pull it like Keisha
Johnny Dang gon' ice my diamonds, up out that freezer
I used to be broke, I don't got amnesia
I used to deal with both, now it's black victims
She know not to call collect if she go to prison

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out, know 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out, know 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that

[Chorus]
I grow up on the 

[?] next to Paradise East (Huh?)
But ain't no paradise out here that I see (What?)
Two bedroom apartment and rent is not free (Huh?)
So I'm out here sellin' dope because my family gotta eat (Yup)

[Verse]
You're born with a silver spoon, but, nigga, not me (Hah)
We didn't even have shoes, we walked around bare-feet (Yup)
Have you ever been so hungry that it made you go to sleep? (Damn)
And have a dream 'bout a 'frigerator full of groceries (Grr)
Stealin' out the store, 7-year-old thief (Woo)
You ain't nevеr met a nigga been through it like me (No)
Had to do a burglary to gеt your first half a key (Skrrt, skrrt)
Mixin' pills with the lean like you're making daiquiris (Lean)
Trappin' out the park, got a chopper in the tree (Grrrr)
Junkies big and you for credit, Gucci, pretty, pretty please (Hee)
Get the fuck away from me before I shoot you in your knees (Pow, pow)
Sunnyvale apartments and we got them fours for threes (Ahh)
Had to sell your partner momma 'cause you really need the cheese (Momma)
'Cause your momma disowned ya and you're knee-deep in the skreet
Call me Guwop the GOAT 'cause I'm at these sucker's throat
Don't compare me to no rapper if he never sold dope ('Wop)

[Intro: Gucci Mane]

East Atlanta slum, man, that's where I come from
Pass that bubble thrax and put this bean on your tongue
Now everything was gravy 'til your bitch came in (Came in)
'Bout the same time that that thang kicked in (It kicked in)
Now she ain't really pretty, but she got a nice body
I'm geekеd up thinkin' this Buffie the Body
Ain't your name lil' Trina? 'Causе you look like Janet Jackson
I'm off three double stacks and I'm lookin' for that action
Gucci Mane, you stupid, man, I love the way you flowin'
Ridin' in my drop, but I don't know where I'm goin'
On 285, I keep ridin' in a circle
The inside of my ride smellin' like a pound of purple
"Gucci, show time," give me five more minutes
And a cold orange juice, 'cause I'm really, really trippin'
Went to the strip club and requested "I'm The Man"
The next thing you know I was throwin' rubber bands

[Chorus: Shawnna & Gucci Mane]

I got a Big Mac, let's make french fries
I'm high as a plane, pop a pill, disappear like David Blaine
Come back on the track with Gucci Mane
I got ten pills, ten hoes, I'ma run a choo-choo train
All through Atlanta, my new nickname is Coochie Game
I don't let 'em swallow, I show 'em how to use it, man
Wah-da-tay, my damie, make 'em sell they pootie tang
You got some bad bitches, I suggest you do the same
Treat my hoes like my cars, drop 'em, then blow they brains
Wash 'em up, then blow they brains
If she swallow the whole bat and the ball, she can roll with Game
I been the soldier boy, niggas know the name

Gucci Mane La Flare, nigga, get your mind right
Order Cris' by the twelve like a case of Bud Light
Sell kush by the bale, so you know my shit tight
7:30 in the morning on an all-night flight
I'm high like Fabo, hood like Shawty
So tell me when to go like my name E-40
Like a rich rock star, nigga, I'm gon' party
Got a party pack of pills that's at least 'bout forty
I'll pour 'em in your hand like a bag of jelly beans
Take two of these pills, call me in the morning
Fifty thousand pills, man, I'm so real
Three dollars for a pill, that's a damn good deal

[Chorus]
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

[Verse 1]
Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name out of your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal

[Pre-Chorus]
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

[Chorus]
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

[Verse 2]
I don't want press to put your name next to mine
We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'Cause I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable (Got a lotta)
Interviews, interviews, interviews
When they say your name, I just act confused

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you have fun?
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

[Chorus]
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

[Bridge]
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name

[Chorus]
I'm not your friend (I'm not your friend)
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man (Damn, you think that you're what I am)
I think, therefore, I am (I am)
I'm not your friend (Friend)
Or anything, damn (Anything, damn)
You think that you're the man (You're the man)
I think, therefore, I am (Therefore, I am)

[Verse 1]
Emotional affair
Overly sincere
Smoking in the car, windows up
Crocodile tears, run the tap 'til it's clear
Drift off on the floor
I drag you to the shore
Sweating through the sheets
You're gonna drown in your sleep for sure
Wake up and start a big fire
In our one room apartment
'Cause I'm too tired
To have a pissing contest
All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours, I'll show you mine

[Verse 2]
Call me when you land
We'll drive around again
One hand on the wheel, one in your mouth
Turn me on, turn me down
Baby, you're a vampire
You want blood and I promised
I'm a bad liar
With a savior complex
All the skеletons you hide
Show me yours, and I'll show you minе

[Outro]
All the bad dreams that you hide
Mm, show me yours
Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Rich young nigga fucking bitches now
Might go cop a 

[?]...no switches now
Free the gang, 

[?]...militia now
No Jonny Dang, this water need some 

[?] now
Hell yeah, I gave my momma hell
That's why her house like heaven

[Verse: Chance the Rapper]
Fuck 12, every year I turn 11
I don't need no birthday, I'll just celebrate in heaven
And I love to watch her trynna squeeze into them leggings
Say she on the pills but I can tell that booty pregnant
You can spin the block, swear that shit a dead end
Thought it was a Glock, but it was a FN
Ride round like the President, you is just a residеnt
I play golf with drugs, but they don't ever see no еvidence
And I'm on a-

[Verse 1]
Day off in Kyoto
Got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-Eleven
The band took the speed train
Went to the arcade
I wanted to go, but I didn't
You called me from a payphone
They still got payphones
It cost a dollar a minute
To tell me you're getting sober
And you wrote me a letter
But I don't have to read it

[Chorus]
I'm gonna kill you
If you don't beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
Then I flew over the ocean
And I changеd my mind

[Verse 2]
Sunset's been a freak show
On the weekеnd, so
I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill
And stare at the chem trails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by like ten days
But you get a few points for tryin'
Remember getting the truck fixed
When you let us drive it
Twenty-five felt like flying

[Chorus]
I don't forgive you
But please don't hold me to it
Born under Scorpio skies
I wanted to see the world
Through your eyes and then it happened
Then I changed my mind

[Outro]
I guess I lied
I'm a liar
Who lies
'Cause I'm a liar

[Verse 1]
I've been running around in circles
Pretending to be myself
Why would somebody do this on purpose
When they could do something else?
Drownin' out the morning birds
With the same three songs over and over
I wish I wrote it, but I didn't so I learn the words
Hum along 'til the feeling's gone forever

[Chorus]
Took a tour to see the stars
But they weren't out tonight
So I wished hard on a Chinese satellite
I want to believe
But then I look at the sky and I feel nothing
You know I hate to be alone
I want to be wrong

[Verse 2]
You were screamin' at the Evangelicals
They were screamin' right back from what I remember
When you said I will never be your vegetable
Because I think when you're gone, it's forever
But you know I'd stand on the corner
Embarrassed with a picket sign
If it meant I would see you when I die

[Chorus]
Sometimes, when I can't sleep
It's just a matter of time before I'm hearing things
Swore I could feel you through the walls
But that's impossible
I want to believe
That if I go outside I'll see a tractor beam
Coming to take me to where I'm from
I want to go home

[Verse 1]
When the speed kicks in
I go to the store for nothing
And walk right by
The house where you lived with Snow White
I wonder if she ever thought
The storybook tiles on the roof were too much
But from the window, it's not a bad show
If your favorite things are Dianetics and stucco

[Pre-Chorus]
The drugstores are open all night
The only real reason I moved to the East Side
Love a good place to hide in plain sight

[Chorus]
What if I told you
I feel like I know you?
But we never met

[Verse 2]
And herе, everyone knows you'rе the way to my heart
Hear so many stories of you at the bar
Most times, alone, and some, looking your worst
But never not sweet to the trust funds and punishers

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, I wish that I could say the same
I swear I'm not angry, that's just my face
A copycat killer with a chemical cut
Either I'm careless or I wanna get caught
Who I'm not

[Chorus]
What if I told you
I feel like I know you?
But we never met
It's for the best

[Outro]
I can't open my mouth and forget how to talk
'Cause even if I could
Wouldn't know where to start
Wouldn't know when to stop

[Intro: Laura Les]
Hey, you little piss baby
You think you're so fucking cool? Huh?
You think you're so fucking tough?
You talk a lotta big game for someone with such a small truck
Aw, look at those arms
Your arms look so fucking cute, they look like lil' cigarettes
I bet I could smoke you, I could roast you
And then you'd love it and you'd text me "I love you"
And then I'd fucking ghost you

[Chorus: Laura Les]
It's so funny how you're all alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
It's so funny how you're all alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
Tell me what's the deal, I've been tryin' to go to bed
I've been up for days, I've been tryna get ahead
Said it all before, and I'll say it once again
I'm better off alone
Tell me what's the deal, I've been tryin' to go to bed
I've been up for days, I've been tryna get ahead
Said it all before, and I'll say it once again
I'm better off alone

[Chorus: Laura Les]
It's so funny how you're all alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
It's so funny how you're all alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone

[Chorus: Joba]
I wish you knew it’s not your fault
I feel like you should smile some more
You cried a single tear, that's all
What’s meant to be prevails
I wish you knew it’s not your fault
I feel like you should smile some more
You cried a single tear, that's all
What’s meant to be prevails

[Chorus: Phony Ppl]
I play the outfield, that's usually
Humbly watchin', nope, not today
Put a disclaimer out 'cause I'm on my shit tonight
They never saw this side of the moon
Askin' me questions like, "Where'd you go?"
Put a disclaimer out 'cause I'm on my shit tonight

[Verse 1: Phony Ppl]
Your friend, she lookin' nice
I know that's your friend but she lookin' right
So, what's good with your friend? You and her tonight
I'm on my shit tonight
I'm feelin', fill a glass
Mi nuh let no spliff pass
I'm 'bout to holla at her, quick, fast
Time flies, did that, these facts
A couple minutes of the chit-chat
You tryna parlay, yo, get back, uh
I told her straight, "I'm tryna hit that"
'Cause she was on my dick that night
I might just play some cash, go fuck up the game
Before the pillow touch my head and maybe throw some change
Enough to fill a duffel bag
'Cause I don't give no shits, alright

[Chorus: Phony Ppl, Joey Bada$$, Both]
I play the outfield, that's usually
Humbly watchin', nope, not today
Put a disclaimer out 'cause I'm on my shit tonight
They never saw this side of the moon
Askin' me questions like, "Where'd you go?"
Put a disclaimer out 'cause I'm on my shit tonight (Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Uh
Lately I've been livin' life (Life)
2020 with the vision like
Same shit, just a different night
We don't take the same trips
Homie, we on different flights
It's levels to this shit and we at different heights (Facts)
Plain Jane on the bezel and I got different types (I got different, woah)
VS1 on the chain, know I got different ice
Know that money my lingo, talk to me nice
She see me doin' my thing, I made her pay the price
She walkin' to me like, uh
She want that sugar and a lil' spice
Tell her I'm the nigga who could change her life (Facts)
If she do me right (Yeah)
I was busier today, but what you doin' tonight? (Yeah, brr)
She hit me back like, "It's whatever you would like" (Right)
I reply like, "This is why you're my type" (Haha, yeah, uh)
Just send the addy, Bada$$ gon' slide
I scoop you up in that badass ride
Bring that ass outside (Hahaha)

[Chorus: Phony Ppl]
I play the outfield, that's usually
Humbly watchin', nope, not today
Put a disclaimer out 'cause I'm on my shit tonight
They never saw this side of the moon
Askin' me questions like, "Where'd you go?"
Put a disclaimer out 'cause I'm on my shit tonight

[Verse 1]
Dream me to life
Write our names in the pillow skies
We can meet in our minds
If our days count us out of time

[Pre-Chorus]
And we'll stay alive
In seas of city lights
Where you and I collide

[Chorus]
So let's go
Swimming in the stars tonight
Oh, and we'll glow
And shimmer in the diamond lights
We'll dive in
Head first, all the way down
In gravity's arms we'll drown
The world is ours
When we're swimming in the stars
When we're swimming in the stars

[Verse 2]
Keep me in reach
Hold your breath 'til we're in too deep
Where the sun's out of hеat
We're awake in thе deepest sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
And we'll stay alive
In shades of neon highs
Where you and I collide

[Chorus]
So let's go
Swimming in the stars tonight
Oh, and we'll glow
And shimmer in the diamond lights
We'll dive in
Head first, all the way down
In gravity's arms we'll drown
The world is ours
When we're swimming in the stars
When we're swimming in the stars

[Bridge]
What if we could float here forever?
In these Gemini dreams together
Let me take your breath right now
Promise that I'll never breathe out

[Chorus]
So let's go (Let's go)
Swimming in the stars tonight (In the stars tonight)
Oh, and we'll glow (We'll glow)
And shimmer in the diamond lights (Oh)
We'll dive in
Head first, all the way down
In gravity's arms we'll drown
The world is ours
When we're swimming in the stars (When we're swimming in the stars)
When we're swimming in the stars

[Outro]
Swimming in the stars tonight
Oh, and we'll glow
Swimming in the stars tonight
When we're swimming in the stars
The Squares lived happily
in their square houses,
in their square yards,
in their square town.

One day, a family of Circles
moved in from the west.

"Get out of here, roundies!" shouted one of the Squares.
"Why?" asked one of the Circles.
"Because this is a metaphor for racism!"

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since you (Fell in love)
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning
I'd let you had I known it (Why don't you say so?)
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused (You want it? Say so)

[Verse 2]
Yеah
Let me check my chеst, my breath right quick
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like...
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
(Why you actin' like you shy?)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
(Never knock it 'til you try) Yah, yah
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my... sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

[Bridge]
Why don't you say so?
You want it? Say so

[Chorus]
(Day to night to morning)
Why don't you say?
(Keep with me in the moment)
Why don't you say?
(I'd let you had I known it)
Why don't you say?
(Why don't you say so?)
Why don't you say?
(Didn't even notice)
Why don't you say?
(No punches left to roll with)
Why don't you say?
(You got to keep me focused)
Yeah!
(You want it? Say so)

[Bridge]
Why don't you say so?
You want it? Say so
Why don't you say so?
You want it? Say so
Day to night to morning
Keep with me the moment
Didn't even notice

[Outro]
Day to night to morning, keep with me the moment
Didn't even notice, got to keep me focused
I would do anything for you,
if convenient.

I would move a mountain for you
if that mountain could be moved
with a button or with a lever that
wasn't too cold to the touch.

I would give you the moon if I could.
You would love the moon. You would
show it off to everyone and not give a fuck
that you’ve now severely damaged our ecosystem by disrupting the tides.

Maybe a nice look in the mirror is in order, Missy.
Read this to yourself. Read it silently.
Don't move your lips. Don't make a sound.
Listen to yourself. Listen without hearing anything.
What a wonderfully weird thing, huh?

NOW MAKE THIS PART LOUD!
SCREAM IT IN YOUR MIND!
DROWN EVERYTHING OUT.
Now, hear a whisper. A tiny whisper.

Now read this next line with your best crotchety-old-man voice:
"Hello there, sonny. Does your town have a post office?"
Awesome! Who was that? Whose voice was that?
It sure wasn't yours!

How do you do that?
How?!
Must be magic.
Martha was ugly like a shaven baboon,
so she wrapped herself up in a curtain cocoon.
After a week, she finally emerged
and she smelled like shit.
What a psycho!
I'm not looking in every nook and cranny for it.

I'll do the nooks.

No way I left my keys in some fucking cranny.

[Verse 1]
Build yourself a boat, babe
Make yourself a sail
Float into the ocean
To nowhere
Yeah, I see you're lookin'
Looking for a sign
Praying for a beacon
So here's the light

[Pre-Chorus]
My arms will be wide open
For the moment you arrive, arrive

[Chorus]
When you set sail on your journey
And happiness is far away
Love will guide you 'til the mornin'
Lead your heart down to the bay
Don't resist the rain and storm
I'll never leave you lost at sea
I will be your lighthouse keeper
Bring you safely homе to me
I will be your lighthouse keepеr
Bring you safely home

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I see you're lonely
Going in alone
Fire up the engine
Stoke the coal
Floatin' on a feeling
Fighting with the tide
Hope you'll be home for Christmas time

[Pre-Chorus]
My arms will be wide open
For the moment you arrive, arrive

[Chorus]
When you set sail on your journey
And happiness is far away
Love will guide you 'til the morning
Lead your heart down to the bay
Don't resist the rain and storm
I'll never leave you lost at sea
I will be your lighthouse keeper
Bring you safely home to me
I will be your lighthouse keeper
Bring you safely home to me
Mid-October,
with leaves spilled
like colored pencil shavings--

the streets dicing our town--
into neat, unfair portions
and me, eatin' that pussy.
I've got a rabbit's foot and I feel lucky that I have it,
but I still know that it must've come from one
unlucky rabbit

[Intro: Thundercat & Ty Dolla $ign]
You'd do it for me, you'd do it for me
(It is what it is)

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
'Til it ain't
Things will never be the same
Never be the same again
Everything so strange (Strange)
It ain't a game no more (A game no more, woah)
We were just gettin' lifted
Yesterday, yesterday
Now we just reminiscin'
On yesterday, yesterday
Keep my head above water (Head above water)
My eyes gettin' bigger (Eyes gettin' bigger), the world gettin' smaller
I been gettin' richer, only made me crazy (Crazy)
Mama said I'm different (Oh yeah), since I was a baby (Baby)

[Verse: Lil B & Ty Dolla $ign]
My emo-o-otions
Gimme a sip of that potion
No, my heart is not broken
But I feel like it's open
Please, somebody, do surgery
Tell the doctor come work with me
I keep lookin' at my soul
Prayin', but only God knows
And I've been workin' nine to nine
Yeah
But they talk about it
But you know it's all fine
(It is what it is)

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
'Til it ain't
Things will never be the same
Never be the same again
Everything so strange (Strange)
It ain't a game no more (A game no more, woah)
We were just gettin' lifted
Yesterday, yesterday
Now we just reminiscin'
On yesterday, yesterday
Keep my head above water (Head above water)
My eyes gettin' bigger (Eyes gettin' bigger), the world gettin' smaller
I been gettin' richer, only made me crazy (Crazy)
Mama said I'm different (Oh yeah), since I was a baby
If I had a million dollars, I would pay your mother
to have sex with me.
Afterwards, I would probably invest in the remaining
nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine
hundred ninety dollars.
Burrrrrrn.
I'll give you till the count of six.

One.
Now run!
Two.
Go screw!
Three.
Let me be!
Four.
There's the door!
Five.
While I'm still alive!
Six.
Please stay, I love you.
Before I was a nudist, I was a man of many cloths,
but all that changed the day I met a swarm of starving moths.
The Boston people pass their time
by making all their stories rhyme.
Like, "Yesterday, me and my ma
watched the Sox game at the bar."
You're afraid of sharks?
Really?
They don't even have bones!
They have cartilage.
Are you afraid of ears too?

[Verse 1]
Under the moon, I cry
Waiting in the whisper of your name
My lullaby
And I'm caught here in your eye
I cannot be afraid to let you love me when we're far away

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We'll figure it out
We'll figure it out
I'll pretend that you are sleeping next to me

[Chorus]
Are you lookin' out your window?
Are you lookin' out your window?

[Bridge 1]
I wanna see your smile
And I'd do anything just to see it now
Pull the light in through your window
Know that I am doing the same
Close your eyes and sink through your pillow
We'll see each other in our dreams

[Verse 2]
Into the night, I say your name
Wish upon the headlights of the cars that are flickering
And I'll wait here 'til the light
Sing the lullaby I've been singing to myself at night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, calm down
We'll figure it out
Just pretend that I'm sleeping next to you

[Chorus]
Are you lookin' out your window?
Are you lookin' out your window?

[Post-Chorus]
It's me there
Oh, it's me
In the fear that we share

[Bridge 2]
Your heart is my home
Our love will keep us warm
Your heart's made of gold
Mine is silver like the moon
Pull the light into your shadow
Know that I am doing the same
Close your eyes and sink through your pillow
Know that I am singing your name

[Outro]
Can you see?
Can you see?
See the moon tonight
We're looking at the same sky
Yeah, we're looking at the same sky
Can you see?
Can you see?
Can you see the moon tonight?
Yeah, we're looking at the same sky
Oh, we're looking at the same sky
I want to be a plate spinner,
I practice all day long.
But I just can't seem to get it right.
What am I doing wrong?
It's a week before the wedding
and the bride is with her friends
(grown women with bright plastic dick jewelry)
and the groom is with his friends
("grown men" or "bright plastic dick jewelry").

[Verse 1]
She asked me where I was from
I said "Somewhere you never been to"
Little town outside of Knoxville
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water
She left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach

[Chorus]
Yeah but, now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed mе tells me she'd lovе Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

[Verse 2]
I said "Let's go shoot tequila"
So we walked back to that beach bar
She said "Don't cowboys drink whiskey?" (huh)
So we drank bottom shelf
She said "Damn, that sky looks perfect"
I said "Girl, you've never seen stars like the ones back home"
And she said "Maybe I should, see 'em for myself"

[Chorus]
Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

[Bridge]
I said meet me in the mornin'
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up

[Chorus]
Oh, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

[Verse 1]
I bought a Harvard sweatshirt off the Goodwill rack
Makes some people wonder if I'm smart like that
And that guitar layin' on the chair is worn out like my boots
Makes it look like I can play it better than I do

[Chorus]
But nobody buys it when we walk in
They say there ain't no way that she's with him
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me

[Verse 2]
It's funny how some strangers like to size me up
This attitude it makes me street and this accent makes me dumb
I can tell 'em I've got pirate blood or ancient royalty
Thеre's no end to the liеs that I could get 'em to believe

[Chorus]
But nobody buys it when we walk in
They say there ain't no way that she's with him
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Must've done somethin' right
Somethin' right
In another life

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody buys it when we walk in
They say there ain't no way that she could be with him
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me
Oh, ain't no one more surprised than me

[Verse 1]
Jack D, there's a seven on the label
One glass on the living room table
Phone face down, Church up loud
Was tryna drown you out tonight
But first sip, I could feel you on my shoulder
The Tennessee heat had me feelin' colder
Thought a drink would get you off my mind

[Chorus]
But this bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
Yeah, one last time, don't think twice
Girl, just pick it up and come over
Give the bedroom door a little closure
I know I told you I wouldn't call and I tried
But this bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)
This bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)

[Verse 2]
You might think I don't really want you with me
You might tell me to empty out my whiskey
Or try changin' what I'm holdin' in my hand
Try another liquor, try another brand
But it don't matter if I got my lips on a different drink on a different night
Yeah, the second that I take a sip all I'm gonna think

[Chorus]
Is this bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
Yeah, one last time, don't think twice
Girl, just pick it up and come over
Give the bedroom door a little closure
I know I told you I wouldn't call and I tried
But this bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)
This bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)

[Bridge]
Thought a drink would get you off my mind
I ain't sayin' I love you, but I might

[Chorus]
'Cause this bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
Yeah, one last time, don't think twice
Girl, just pick it up and come over
Give the bedroom door a little closure
I know I told you I wouldn't call and I tried
But this bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)
This bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)
This bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)
This bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)

[Verse 1]
They started out blue like an East Tennessee June sky
Full of small-town innocence
Guarded by a picket fence
Perfect 'til I drove by
You were lookin' for a way out and I was on my way
Girl, once you love a cowboy, you'll never be the same
I know right now you think this is it
But I'm gonna leave you with

[Chorus]
Neon eyes
Dollar-in-a-jukebox heartache
Drinkin' off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave you with neon eyes
Dancin' with a ghost on thе dance floor
Never rеally gettin' what you came for
Lonely lips sippin' on a margarita
Girl, I'd hate to see you with neon eyes

[Verse 2]
Right now, they're glowin' like the cigarette we just sparked
Aw, but I've seen this scene before
Like the lights on a liquor store
Pretty soon, they'll go dark
I know you're tired of all the same shit
That's why you think you want this
I can show you first-hand, girl, what you wish you'da missed
But if you won't take it from me
I guess you're gonna have to see through

[Chorus]
Neon eyes
Dollar-in-a-jukebox heartache
Drinkin' off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave you with neon eyes
Dancin' with a ghost on the dance floor
Never really gettin' what you came for
Lonely lips sippin' on a margarita
Girl, I'd hate to see you with neon eyes
Neon eyes

[Bridge]
I don't wanna be the one to say I told you so
Just let me push you away before you get too close
I can't go and make up your mind
And I don't wanna be the reason behind those

[Chorus]
Neon eyes
Dollar-in-a-jukebox heartache
Drinkin' off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave you with neon eyes
Dancin' with a ghost on the dance floor
Never really gettin' what you came for
Lonely lips sippin' on a margarita
Girl, I'd hate to see you with neon eyes
Neon eyes
Neon eyes

[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
Used to be you'd see my face on wanted posters all over this town, mmm
For leading lovers on until the dawn, just ridin' in and rollin' out, mmm

[Pre-Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
I never thought I'd get caught
Yeah, at least that's what I thought

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
'Til you rolled in like Annie Oakley with them guns blazin'
Bang-bang, baby, them blue eyes got me like
Take me in, lock me up, tell all them boys not to save me
Bang-bang, baby, that sweet smile hit me like
Lightnin', ain't tryna fight it
Stole this heart, ain't that the truth?
Guess that makes you an outlaw too

[Verse 2: Ben Burgess]
I can't believe you came after me with the crazy reputation that I have, mmm
It takes a hell of an angel to see the good inside a man so bad
But you did

[Pre-Chorus: Ben Burgess]
I never thought I'd get caught
Yeah, at least that's what I thought

[Chorus: Ben Burgess]
'Til you rolled in like Annie Oakley with them guns blazin'
Bang-bang, baby, them blue eyes got me like
Take me in, lock me up, tell all them boys not to save me
Bang-bang, baby, that sweet smile hit me like
Lightnin', ain't tryna fight it
Stole this heart, ain't that the truth?
Guess that makes you an outlaw too
Mmm, yes it does baby

[Bridge: Ben Burgess & Morgan Wallen]
I was wild as a West Texas wind
Wild as a cowboy's ever been

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
'Til you rolled in like Annie Oakley with them guns blazin'
Bang-bang, baby, them blue eyes got me like
Take me in, lock me up, tell all them boys not to save me
Bang-bang, baby, that sweet smile hit me like
Lightnin', ain't tryna fight it
Stole this heart, ain't that the truth?
Guess that makes you an outlaw too

[Verse 1]
You thought I'd die when you said goodbye
For a minute I thought that I would
And there for awhile couldn't even fake a smile
Even if the bad joke sounded good
I went off the rails
Thought hell, might as well
Rock bottom was callin' my name
But lookin' back now I oughta be
In the movin' on hall-of-fame

[Chorus]
It wasn't my buddies
It wasn't my mama
It wasn't no self-help how-to
It wasn't old records
It wasn't old flings
Or dancin' with somebody new
Tequila made me crazy
Cold beer wouldn't do
So I whiskey'd my way over you

[Verse 2]
You saw me out on a Friday downtown
With a smile that came stumblin' back in
Guess that killed your mood 'cause you did what you do
Turned around and walked out again
So pour a little more bourbon
Oh, it's the only thing been workin'

[Chorus]
It wasn't my buddies
It wasn't my mama
It wasn't no self-help how-to
It wasn't old records
It wasn't old flings
Or dancin' with somebody new
Tequila made me crazy
Cold beer wouldn't do
So I whiskey'd my way over you
Whiskey'd my way
Whiskey'd my way

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, keep the bar keep workin'
Oh, oh, pour it on this hurtin'

[Chorus]
It wasn't my buddies
It wasn't my momma
It wasn't no self-help how-to
It wasn't old records
And it wasn't old flings
Or dancin' with somebody new
Tequila made me crazy
Cold beer wouldn't do
So I whiskey'd my way over you

[Outro]
Tequila didn't cut it
Cold beer was no use
So I whiskey'd my way over you

[Verse 1]
I don't know where the hell it comes from
Got no idea where it goes when it leaves
When it's here, it's here, when it's gone, it's gone
Kinda like them smoky mountain fall time trees
I guess I'll leave it to something bigger to figure it all out
But I sure could use a little breeze right now

[Chorus]
Yeah, if anybody out there somewhere
Got a secret they wanna sharе
On why it does to her what it does to dust
It rеally just ain't fair
And why it always takes her with it
And only brings her back now and then?
I guess I've always been
Wonderin' 'bout the wind

[Verse 2]
She sits there like a feather just waitin' on a gale
By the time I pushed off she already caught sail
I'm always waitin' to put my anchor down
But I sure could use a little breeze right now

[Chorus]
Yeah, if anybody out there somewhere
Got a secret they wanna share
On why it does to her what it does to dust
It really just ain't fair
And why it always takes her with it
And only brings her back now and then?
I guess I've always been
Wonderin' 'bout the wind

[Bridge]
Hey, I can taste the rain, I can see the sun
And that makes sense to me
But this feels like one I that I can't outrun
Guess I'm runnin' just to see

[Chorus]
If anybody out there somewhere
Got a secret they wanna share
On why it does to her what it does to dust
It really just ain't fair
And why it always takes her with it
And only brings her back now and then?
I guess I've always been
Wonderin' 'bout the wind

[Outro]
And why it always takes her with it
And leaves me hangin' on a limb
Just wonderin' 'bout the wind
Aw, wonderin' 'bout the wind

[Verse 1]
If I was your car
I'd turn you 'round
If I was your radio
I'd play our song right now
If I was your memory of me
I'd keep runnin', runnin'
'Til your fingers started thumbin'
Through your phone
And tell me that you're comin' home

[Chorus]
If I was your bartender
I'd mix 'em up strong in a tall blender
'Til the last one's gone
Yeah, I'd play every heartbreak song
On the jukebox 'til your tear drops
They fell on that bar top
Keep you drinkin', get you thinkin'
I'm right where you need to be
If I was your bartender
I'd talk you out of leavin' me

[Verse 2]
If I was your Bible
I'd turn the page to forgiveness
If I was your bed
I'd be icе cold without me in it
If I was your dream
I'd keep runnin', runnin'
Through your mind
'Til therе was nothing you could do
But call me up out of the blue
Yeah

[Chorus]
If I was your bartender
I'd mix 'em up strong in a tall blender
'Til the last one's gone
Yeah, I'd play every heartbreak song
On the jukebox 'til your tear drops
They fell on that bar top
Keep you drinkin', get you thinkin'
I'm right where you need to be
If I was your bartender
I'd talk you out of leavin' me

[Bridge]
Woah, ooh-woah, woah, ooh-woah, oh, oh
Woah, ooh-woah, woah, ooh-woah, oh, oh
Woah, ooh-woah, woah, ooh-woah, oh, oh
Yeah, I wish I was
'Cause

[Chorus]
If I was your bartender
I'd mix 'em up strong in a tall blender
'Til the last one's gone
Yeah, I'd play every heartbreak song
On the jukebox 'til your tear drops
They fell on that bar top
Keep you drinkin', get you thinkin'
I'm right where you need to be
If I was your bartender
I'd talk you out of leavin' me

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah-yeah
If I was your bartender
I'd talk you out of leavin'
I'd talk you out of leavin'
I'd talk you out of leavin' me

[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
She told me where I could go
Just stopped in here before I went
And I'll be here until you close
Or all my money's spent
So if you don't mind my friend

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Chris Stapleton]
Bartender, pour me one more
Make it quick and make it strong
'Cause buddy, my last drink, yeah
Ain't the only thing that's gone

[Verse 2: Chris Stapleton, Morgan Wallen, Chris Stapleton & Morgan Wallen]
Here's a hundred and some change
I'll take whatever that'll buy
Leave a twenty for the band
If they'll lay off lonesomе songs tonight
And whenever you gеt time

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Chris Stapleton]
Bartender, pour me one more
Make it quick and make it strong
'Cause buddy, my last drink, yeah
Ain't the only thing that's gone
Oh no

[Instrumental Break / Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Chris Stapleton]
Bartender, pour me one more
Make it quick and make it strong
'Cause buddy, my last drink, yeah
Ain't the only thing that's gone

[Outro: Morgan Wallen & Chris Stapleton]
And I ain't got nowhere to be
And I'd rather not go home
'Cause buddy, my last drink, yeah
Ain't the only thing that's gone

[Verse 1]
I rolled in bumpin' 10's into Broadway
Dirty boots, been a workin' like a dog day
Boot scootin' to the juke for some Conway
Or anything to get my Honky Tonk on
You walked in, cutoffs lookin' real skimpy
The hottest thing my side of the Mississippi
And I could spin you 'round and 'round 'til I get you dizzy
But you look like you got hillbilly in your bones

[Chorus]
So let's ditch this hole-in-the-wall
Mix some sticks with a fifth of homemade alcohol
Disappear somewhere with a lower population
I ain't sayin' that you wanna but if it's any consolation
I got a redneck, yes I do
I got a redneck, how 'bout you?
I got a four by four with a toolbox
Just to keep them ole mountains blue
You got a drank you're barely sippin'
I got a tank full of paycheck money
I'm good friends with Mason Dixon
Girl, whatcha say we do somethin' country?

[Verse 2]
I'll close thе tab quick
We can go get half-lit
Hit the rivеr skinny dip or catch a catfish
Yeah, I'll take you to the holler
I ain't talking 'bout a hollow
Put some red on the tread
Hell, I'll wash it off tomorrow

[Chorus]
So let's ditch this hole-in-the-wall
Mix some sticks with a fifth of homemade alcohol
Disappear somewhere with a lower population
I ain't sayin' that you wanna but if it's any consolation
I got a redneck, yes I do
I got a redneck, how 'bout you?
I got a four by four with a toolbox
Just to keep them ole mountains blue
You got a drank you're barely sippin'
I got a tank full of paycheck money
I'm good friends with Mason Dixon
Girl, whatcha say we do somethin' country?

[Bridge]
Whatcha say? Whatcha say?
We can take a little stroll, maybe roll in some hay
What's it gon' be? What's it gon' be?
Shorty, if you wanna get your back forty on with me

[Chorus]
Then let's ditch this hole-in-the-wall
Mix some sticks with a fifth of homemade alcohol
Disappear somewhere with a lower population
I ain't sayin' that you wanna but if it's any consolation
I got a redneck, yes I do
I got a redneck, how 'bout you?
I got a four by four with a toolbox
Just to keep them ole mountains blue
You got a drank you're barely sippin'
I got a tank full of paycheck money
I'm good friends with Mason Dixon
Girl, whatcha say we do somethin' country?

[Verse 1]
I need to lean on a truck with five old friends
Tell old lies and then tell 'em again
Ride 33 'til it hits the river
Throw cans in the bed 'til the moon's just a sliver
Wanna see my name on a dive bar wall
Where the ceilings ain't, but the beers are tall
There's something 'bout a city like this
Makes me miss what I grew up with

[Chorus]
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
One light, one bar, one church
Where the Lord gеts thanked and the shine gеts drank
While an out back brush pile burns
Yeah, I've been away way too long
But tonight I'm headed back home
'Cause when I need to find me
There's only three things that'll work
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt

[Verse 2]
I need to hear mama pray 'til the rolls get cold
For them hometown folks that she says I know
My soul's a little dirty 'cause my boots are too clean
It's been too long since I've seen

[Chorus]
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
One light, one bar, one church
Where the Lord gets thanked and the shine gets drank
While an out back brush pile burns
Yeah, I've been away way too long
But tonight I'm headed back home
'Cause when I need to find me
There's only three things that'll work
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
Oh

[Bridge]
Yeah, I bet by now they're missin' me
So I ain't stoppin' 'til I see

[Chorus]
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
One light, one bar, one church
Where the Lord gets thanked and the shine gets drank
While an out back brush pile burns
Yeah, I've been away way too long
But tonight I'm headed back home
'Cause when I need to find me
There's only three things that'll work
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt
Rednecks, red letters, red dirt

[Verse 1]
Map dot, southern rock, buckshot, stop sign
Grizz pack, mantle rack, channel cat, trot line
Pipes ain't Bristol, but they're pretty loud though
'Round here, the sun goes down slow
But beer don't

[Verse 2]
Home base, that's the party spot at the Walmart
Second base in the parkin' lot at the ballpark
Sweet cherry pie slice in the boondocks
Skillets and the engines and the women stay hot

[Chorus]
But beer don't start nothin' but the party
Beer don't taste half as good in the city
Beer don't buzz with that hip-hop, cuz
But it damn sure does with a little nitty gritty
Beer don't bust its ass Monday to Friday
Beer don't wanna sit in a glass, so slide it my way
We might drink way too many of 'em at the bar
People got their own opinion about how redneck we are
But beer don't

[Verse 3]
Big boss on your back, 'bout to get a cuss-out
Scopes off, low shot, didn't lay the buck down
Baby says "bye," and it down right breaks you
Hey, just remember when you think the world hates you

[Chorus]
Beer don't start nothin' but the party
Beer don't taste half as good in the city
Beer don't buzz with that hip-hop, cuz
But it damn sure does with a little nitty gritty
Beer don't bust its ass Monday to Friday
Beer don't wanna sit in a glass, so slide it my way
We might drink way too many of 'em at the bar
People got their own opinion about how redneck we are
But beer don't
No, beer don't

[Bridge]
One beer, two beer, three beer, four
There's twenty more of 'em behind the fridge door
Five beer, six beer, seven beer, eight
You can keep count, but I'll tell you who ain't

[Chorus]
Beer don't start nothin' but the party
Beer don't taste half as good in the city
Beer don't buzz with that hip-hop, cuz
But it damn sure does with a little nitty gritty
Beer don't bust its ass Monday to Friday
Beer don't wanna sit in a glass, so slide it my way
We might drink way too many of 'em at the bar
People got their own opinion about how redneck we are
But beer don't
No, beer don't
Yeah, beer don't
But beer don't

[Verse 1]
If you get a little dirt on your new boots
If you roll in late to work from hittin' snooze
If them school boys ain't got no luck 'cause you start turnin' your nose up
At them downtown lights 'cause they ain't your kind of view
I hope the next boy that falls for you don't blame you

[Chorus]
If you roll your eyes when them other guys try to take you out on the city
If you quit sippin' wine and you start likin' shootin' whiskey
If you start talkin' with a drawl and feelin' all kinds of pretty
If you're up to see the sun before you fall asleep
Oh baby, blame it on me
Oh baby, blame it on me

[Verse 2]
If your friends start asking you what's going on
'Cause all you wanna hear is them country songs
If you start takin' gravel roads and stoppin' off at Texacos
And you wanna watch the full moon all night long, it's my fault, ha

[Chorus]
If you roll your eyеs when them other guys try to takе you out on the city
If you quit sippin' wine and you start likin' shootin' whiskey
If you start talkin' with a drawl and feelin' all kinds of pretty
If you're up to see the sun before you fall asleep
Oh baby, blame it on me
Oh baby, blame it on me

[Bridge]
Forgive me if I set the bar too high
With a six-pack and a bass boat fishtail slide
If them weekend boys get boring, I don't mean to wreck it for you
Yeah, it's my bad girl if you had the time of your life
It's all right

[Chorus]
If you roll your eyes when them other guys try to take you out on the city
If you quit sippin' wine and you start likin' shootin' whiskey
If you start talkin' with a drawl and feelin' all kinds of pretty
If you're up to see the sun before you fall asleep
Oh baby, blame it on me
Oh baby, blame it on me

[Outro]
Baby, blame it on me
Oh, blame it on, oh, blame it on
Baby, blame it on me

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna go to work
I don’t wanna see my ex-girl
I don't wanna worry 'bout findin’ me my next girlfriend
At the bar where they charge your right arm
For a cold can of PBR
Yeah, I don't wanna watch the news
I don't wanna pick the phone up
Don't wanna sit in traffic with an empty can of long cut
I've been doin' what I should be doin'
And I'm losin’ my Dodge Ram mind

[Chorus]
’Cause I just wanna do country-ass shit
With my country-ass friends
But my country-ass been
Havin' to make them dollar bills, y’all
Ask me how my country ass feels, y'all
Between workin' it off and gettin' it chewed
There ain’t much country ass left in these old blue jeans
But wait a minute, the whole world can kiss it
'Cause me and my country ass gone fishin' (GAHT)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I just wanna drink a beer
I just wanna get a line wet
Let the sun put some more red on my neck
Wave at the girls on they rental pontoons
While my bass boat speakers go boom, boom

[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna do country-ass shit
With my country-ass friends
But my country-ass been
Havin' to make them dollar bills, y'all
Ask me how my country ass feels, y'all
Between workin' it off and gettin' it chewed
There ain't much country ass left in these old blue jeans
But wait a minute, the whole world can kiss it
'Cause me and my country ass gone fishin' (GAHT)

[Bridge]
Don't wanna shake no hands or tuck my shirt in
Pardon my french, Mama, if you're listenin'

[Chorus]
But I just wanna do country-ass shit
With my country-ass friends
But my country-ass been
Havin' to make them dollar bills, y'all
Ask me how my country ass feels, y'all
Between workin' it off and gettin' it chewed
There ain't much country ass left in these old blue jeans
But wait a minute, the whole world can kiss it
'Cause me and my country ass gone fishin' (GAHT)

[Outro]
Yeah
(There ain't much country ass left in these old blue jeans)
(But wait a minute, the whole world can kiss it)
'Cause me and my country ass gone fishin'

[Verse 1]
When I met you I was chillin' to some old Willie
Bet you were thinkin', "How'd I get up with this hillbilly?"
Saw yourself sittin' pretty in the big city
And now you're big-time diggin' on some little bitty
Backroads, real slow
Got your hand out the window

[Chorus]
Now you took a little ride around the farm
Got to do a little fishin' in the dark
Wrapped up in some country boy arms
Now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Halfway down your first country mile
You called your mama said, "It's gonna be a while," ha
I didn't think way out was your style
But now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Yeah, whatcha think of country now?

[Verse 2]
Aw, baby now you've seen the way my sun sets
From a blanket on a bank of a creek bed
And I can tell you were hooked soon as you said
"Don't take me home, boy I ain't had enough yet"

[Chorus]
Now you took a little ride around the farm
Got to do a little fishin' in the dark
Wrapped up in some country boy arms
Now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Halfway down your first country mile
You called your mama said, "It's gonna be a while," ha
I didn't think way out was your style
But now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Yeah, whatcha think of country now?

[Bridge]
Yeah, whatcha think about the pine trees?
Hey, whatcha think about the cool breeze?
And whatcha think about the midnight moon?
Aw damn, this country looks good on you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Now you took a little ride around the farm
Got to do a little fishin' in the dark
Wrapped up in some country boy arms
Now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Halfway down your first country mile
You called your mama said, "It's gonna be a while," ha
I didn't think way out was your style
But now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Yeah, whatcha think of country now?
Aw baby whatcha think of country now?
Mmm, now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?

[Verse 1]
I know we made a downtown reservation
Let's get there early, get drunk, and break it
There's cabs outside we could wave and take one
To that little dive bar you like
I know you got your red dress on, but
It was always gonna come back off
So go on and call me crazy
We both know it's just a matter of time, baby

[Chorus]
With me on whiskey, and you on wine
Gettin' Tennessee tipsy in the neon light
Yeah, it's what we do, girl, it's kind of our thing
A little jukebox dance and then a smoky dream
We're as easy as you got your drink I got mine
But we got the same thing on our mind
I guarantee best times tend to be
With you on wine, and me on whiskey
With you on wine, and me on whiskey, yeah

[Verse 2]
Let's get started on an all-night nightcap
That won't wind down until the break of dawn
And we can keep it rollin' like that
'Cause right about now, it don't sound wrong
Girl, I know you got all dressed up
Yeah, and now we're gettin' all messed up
We don't just do it 'cause we're good at it
Yeah, we do it 'cause we find some good things happen

[Chorus]
With me on whiskey, and you on wine
Gettin' Tennessee tipsy in the neon light
Yeah, it's what we do, girl, it's kind of our thing
A little jukebox dance and then a smoky dream
We're as easy as you got your drink I got mine
But we got the same thing on our mind
I guarantee best times tend to be
With you on wine, and me on whiskey
With you on wine, and me on whiskey, yeah

[Bridge]
Girl, I know you got your red dress on
Sittin' pretty on that old barstool and
And we don't ever get enough of this
It's pretty simple, baby, all it is

[Chorus]
It's me on whiskey, and you on wine
Gettin' Tennessee tipsy in the neon light
Yeah, it's what we do, girl, it's kind of our thing
A little jukebox dance and then a smoky dream
We're as easy as you got your drink I got mine
But we got the same thing on our mind
I guarantee best times tend to be
With you on wine, and me on whiskey
Yeah, yeah
With you on wine, and me on whiskey, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
This whiskey sure tastes fine right now
But it ain't doin' the trick, no
Yeah, it ain't gettin' me gone enough
To make my mind forget
That one shot, two shot, three shot more
Don't change the fact she ain't in the picture anymore
This bar stool ain't workin'
But if anything can
It'll be me on a dock pushin' off of dry land

[Chorus]
I need a lake, a little bit of bait
I'd even take a creek
I'm tired of all these concrete streets
We were running down
Yeah, what I need right now
Is some roddin' and some reelin', first catch feelin'
Praying to the man for some muddy water healin'
Don't need no sad song on my radio
Burnin' up some black smoke, down a backroad
I need a boat
I need a boat

[Verse 2]
Don't care if it's a pontoon
Brand new, been used
As long as it'll fish
Just wanna cast it out yonder
Let my mind wander off to anything but this
I'm tired of runnin' into all my friends
Askin' if I'm over her lovin'
Yeah, but out there where the river lets in
Them fish don't ask me nothin'

[Chorus]
I need a lake, a little bit of bait
I'd even take a creek
I'm tired of all these concrete streets
We were running down
Yeah, what I need right now
Is some roddin' and some reelin', first catch feelin'
Praying to the man for some muddy water healin'
Don't need no sad song on my radio
Burnin' up some black smoke, down a backroad
I need a boat
I need a boat

[Bridge]
I need some peace and quiet
I don't know who the hell's gonna buy it
Yeah, but I need a boat
Uh-huh

[Chorus]
I need a lake, a little bit of bait
I'd even take a creek
I'm tired of all these concrete streets
We were running down
Yeah, what I need right now
Is some roddin' and some reelin', first catch feelin'
Praying to the man for some muddy water healin'
Don't need no sad song on my radio
Burnin' up some black smoke, down a backroad
I need a boat
I need a boat

[Outro]
I need a boat
I need a boat
Reel, reel bad

[Verse 1]
Never thought I'd be callin' you up today
Takin' out an ad for this Chevrolet
But there's a ring in the window just down the street
I wanna marry her, she wants to marry me
Money's kinda tight but love don't care
Me and this truck been everywhere
Just need a little spot on the back page
Here's what I want it to say

[Chorus]
This truck will get the prettiest girl in town
Sittin' right beside you when you're ridin' around
It's got a pretty good radio
If you wanna get her dancin' down an old dirt road
Spent a lot of Friday nights up under the stars
Get you where you need to go and it'll go too far
God knows all thе stories it can tell
I got a Silverado for salе

[Verse 2]
Now don't you think there's a wild eyed teenage kid
Workin' hard all summer just like I did?
Saved up a couple thousand bucks
Got a girl that he's dyin' to go pick up
She'll steal his heart on that old bench seat
He'll wanna lay the world right there at her feet
I can see him smiling ear to ear, ha
When he reads these words right here

[Chorus]
This truck will get the prettiest girl in town
Sittin' right beside you when you're ridin' around
It's got a pretty good radio
If you wanna get her dancin' down an old dirt road
Spent a lot of Friday nights up under the stars
Get you where you need to go and it'll go too far
God knows all the stories it can tell
I got a Silverado for sale

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Hello? Yeah, I'm the guy
I've got 'er all cleaned up
Just come on by

[Chorus]
This truck will get the prettiest girl in town
Sittin' right beside you when you're ridin' around
It's got a pretty good radio
If you wanna get her dancin' down an old dirt road
Spent a lot of Friday nights up under the stars
Get you where you need to go and it'll go too far
God knows all the stories it can tell
I got a Silverado for sale
I got a Silverado for sale
I got a Silverado for sale

[Intro]
So heartless
So heartless

[Verse 1]
Say you're goin' out late
I count down 'til you call me
It's just one of those things
That you do when you're lonely
And you're all about the chase
But you won't ever let me catch you
And I wish I was the same
But I know I'm gonna let you
Win again and when I do
It's gonna hurt like hell
And you don't mean to
That's what I tell myself

[Chorus]
But why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl, the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches
Leavе me in the darkness
Nеver finish what we started
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless?
Yeah, why you gotta be so heartless?

[Verse 2]
Well, Monday night was definitely not our night
Tuesday night was just another fight
Wednesday, I thought everything would change
Thursday came and it was still the same
Friday night, we went out on the town
Saturday, we should have burned it down
Sunday morning came and now you're gone
I should probably know this shit by now
Ah, oh
Yeah, I should probably know this shit by now
But no, no

[Chorus]
Why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl, the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finish what we started
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless?
Yeah, why you gotta be so heartless?

[Bridge]
Why you gotta be so in between
Loving me and leaving, leaving?
Ah, oh
Yeah, I should probably know this shit by now
But no, no

[Chorus]
Why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl, the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finish what we started
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless?
Why you gotta be so heartless?
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless?
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless?
Oh

[Verse 1]
Mama don't pray for my success anymore, yeah
But mama still prays for me
Seein' the world ain't really seein' the world
Through a window from A to B
Between alcohol and women and Adderall and adrenaline
I don't ever get no rest
Signed my life away to be the life of the party
Yeah, to everybody else

[Chorus]
I look like a rockstar, in and out of cop cars
Livin' out a suitcase, trashin' hotel bars
If I see the sunrise, it's 'cause I stayed up all night
Drinkin' 'cause I need to, damn it, what a good life
Judgin' by my long hair, you might think I don't care
Sittin' here, sippin' and bitchin' about a spot where
Peoplе would kill to be, kill to be, kill to be
But y'all, it ain't as good as it seems, this livin' thе dream is
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me

[Verse 2]
Another day, another venue
There's trouble to get into
And love ain't on the menu again
Lonely as an eagle
I meet a thousand people
Who think I got a thousand friends

[Refrain]
Ooh
There's a stranger in the mirror
Ooh
But accordin' to the pictures

[Chorus]
I'm a rockstar, in and out of cop cars
Livin' out a suitcase, trashin' hotel bars
If I see the sunrise, it's 'cause I stayed up all night
Drinkin' 'cause I need to, damn it, what a good life
Judgin' by my long hair, you might think I don't care
Sittin' here, sippin' and bitchin' about a spot where
People would kill to be, kill to be, kill to be
But y'all, it ain't as good as it seems, this livin' the dream is
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me

[Refrain]
Ooh
There's a stranger in the mirror
Ooh
But accordin' to the pictures

[Chorus]
I'm a rockstar, in and out of cop cars
Livin' out a suitcase, trashin' hotel bars
If I see the sunrise, it's 'cause I stayed up all night
Drinkin' 'cause I need to, damn it, what a good life
Judgin' by my long hair, you might think I don't care
Sittin' here, sippin' and bitchin' about a spot where
People would kill to be, kill to be, kill to be
But y'all, it ain't as good as it seems, this livin' the dream is
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me

[Verse 1]
Puttin' in that overtime and comin' up with nothin'
Sure as hell ain't for lack of tryin'
There’s no use wastin' time in fightin' for somethin'
When you see that white flag a flyin'
Can you hear that whistle blow?

[Chorus]
There's all-day thinkin' time
And all night drinkin' time
And time to sing or time to find if
Rhyme has a reason
Time to pack it in and stay down
Pack it up and walk away now
And give it one more day or call it a season
I can tell by the tears not in your eyes
It’s quittin' time

[Verse 2]
There's somethin' to be said for sayin' what needs sayin'
A suitcase says it all to me
Before the credits roll just know I always lovеd you
So we wrote that famous final scenе
Where you turn and walk out on me

[Chorus]
There's all-day thinkin' time
And all night drinkin' time
And time to sing or time to find if
Rhyme has a reason
Time to pack it in and stay down
Pack it up and walk away now
And give it one more day or call it a season
I can tell by the tears not in your eyes
It’s quittin' time
It's quittin' time

[Bridge]
Every start has an end
Every first has a last
Every now has a then
Every future has a past
And sometimes you want it back

[Chorus]
There's all-day thinkin' time
And all night drinkin' time
And time to sing or time to find if
Rhyme has a reason
Time to pack it in and stay down
Pack it up and walk away now
And give it one more day or call it a season
I can tell by the tears not in your eyes
It’s quittin' time
It's quittin' time
Thye let gays marry
and I took offense to that;
then my brother got gay-married
and I took a fence to that.
From my window seat, the world looks so tiny,
the cities so adorably ordered.

Makes me realize just how insignificant people are
and just how godlike I am.
Two young boys in corduroys
were playing with a ball.
Two young boys heard one strange noise,
coming from the hall.

The boys stood still, well, still until
the door swung open wide.
And a ghostly chill and a real ghost, Bill,
were heaved the heck inside.

The brave boy stood, as the brave boy would,
and said, "Hey, listen Bill!
We're here to hear you, not to fear you.
Tell us what you will."

The other boy wheezed and sneezed then seized
and vomited on the floor.
He shook his brain. He felt insane.
Nothing was real anymore.

"Ghosts are real?! They're fucking real?!?!?!"
he cried and shook and feared.
For nature's laws were gone because
a ghost had just appeared.
And on that night of fear and fright,
the brave boy had his thrills.
And the other one was fucking done
and swallowed fifty pills.
No matter our race or color or creed
or way of life or species or breed.
No matter our height or girth or scent,
we all hate Donald because Donald is a fucking dick.
I love you just the way you are,
but you don't see you like I do.
You shouldn't try so hard to be perfect.
Trust me, perfect should try to be you.

[Verse 1]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop

[Verse 2]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some carolling

[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancin' merrily
In the new old fashioned way

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voicеs singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck thе halls with boughs of holly!"

[Verse 2]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some carolling

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancin' merrily
In the new old fashioned way, way
If you were perfect,
I'd tatto this on my chest.

If you were beautiful,
I'd carve this into a tree trunk.

If you were nice,
I'd write this in a letter.

But you're none of those--
Someone carved a face in that pumpkin,
and now it's perched on a stoop, grinning
with the same sinister grin the carver must have had
when he carved it.

And everything I recognize as expressive
(the triangular eyes, that big toothy smile)
is marked by a lack of pumpkin.
A red face of dead space.

And now I'm seeing just the opposite.
I see two spots where the eyes should be,
an open wound where thе mouth once sat,
and a fire within, baking the insidеs.
On a Wednesday morning, clear and calm,
I went to Astor Place
and had a gypsy read my palm
or maybe just my face.

She said my heart was heavy
and my head was stuffed with lies.
But things like that weren't on my hand,
they hid behind my eyes.

The room is dull and dank and cold but at
least I have a hand to hold.
I feel strange.
Half light-hearted, half heavy-handed.
You know when you get a song stuck in your head
and you can't get it out?
I hate that.
That's sort of what this feels like.

I feel better.
Less panicked, more confused.
But a good confused.
You know that feeling of warm water
running down your back
when washing your hair?
I love that.
That's sort of what this feels like.

I feel great.
And nothing.
This is just what I needed.
A warm bath and a quick nap.
She waits. How beautifully she waits.
How impossibly lovely she is
with a thing so passive.

With what weight she waits,
making her bus or boyfriend
(or whatever she waits for)
seem like a first brunch with Christ.

She waits regally, in perfect contrast
to the drooling buffoon describing her.
"Well...,"
she said, unwell.

"Well... surely...,"
he continued, unwell, unsure.

"Listen," he said.
But nothing.
Just some rain tapping a window out of boredom.
I bought a bunch of wooden soldiers.
I bought them from the store.
And now a hundred tiny soldiers
guard my bedroom door.

So if you're a scary monster-thing
who wants to go to war,
my bedroom door is open.
I'm not frightened anymore.
Sully suffers from a stutter,
simple syllables will clutter,
stalling speeches up on beaches,
like a sunken sailboat rudder.

Sully strains to say his phrases,
sickened by the sounds he raises,
strings of thoughts come out in knots,
he solves his sentences like mazes.

At night, he writes his thoughts instead
and sighs as they steadily rush from his head.
Our love was a roller coaster.
It had ups and downs and I sat real close to her.
It had a real slow climb and a real quick drop.
I screamed "faster" and she begged it to stop.
I put up my hands and she held on tight.
Not a second of boredom on our rickety flight.
And when it came to a stop at that first safer place,
I said, "Let's do it again," and she puked in my face.
You think I'm crazy?
HA! That's real funny.

If I were crazy, would I have written a twelve-hundred-
page novel without using a single vowel?
No. 'Cause I did. And I'm not crazy.

If I were crazy, would I be able to predict the future by
dropping empty tuna cans into an open drain in my backyard?
No. 'Cause I can. And I'm not crazy.

If I were crazy, would I love to slit your fucking throat
just to watch the color drain from your face and onto
that cleanly pressed collared shirt of yours?
Yes. I would love that if I were crazy.

But I'm not crazy.
I wrote you a letter,
and then another letter,
and another, and another,
until I wrote you a word.

So I wrote you a word,
and then another word,
and another, and another,
until I wrote you a sentence.

So I wrote you a sentence,
and then another sentence,
and another, and another,
until I wrote you a letter.

I hope it finds you as I found you.

Yours truly,
Yours, truly.
Her eyes were like fire.
They weren't red or anything.
Not particularly warm, either.
They didn't glow or "appear to glow,"
whatever that means.

But they had that same strange blend of
familiar and miraculous---
and they were always nice to look at
after a long day of doing things.
Life is an open book.
Time is an oscillating fan.

I've had to learn to skim-read because
before I can read more than a few paragraphs,
that fucking airhead comes circling back,
blowing pages like a medieval prostitute.

The cool air feels nice, though.
Sometimes, when my head aches,
I let my eyes relax
and I enjoy the breeze as the words blur.
I'll have a cheeseburger.
Hold the cheese.

Hold it in your hand until it melts---
until it bears the shape of that voluptuous palm of yours.

Then put it on my burger.
When I was little,
I killed ants with a magnifying glass.

And now I'm big.
And I worry I'm doing the same thing with you.
hey

Hell waits in a doctor's office,
tapping his shoe against a loose strip of carpet,
holding a magazine in front of his face,
trying to look professional,
whilst eyeing the children's toys.
Grooming my cuticles
in an un-roomy cubicle.
The phone rings, duty calls.
Better sell those pharmaceuticals.
Ed had a date with a girl that he liked
but she called and canceled the lunch.
At the biweekly orgy later that night,
Ed pleasured himself by the punch.
Homonyms aren't fare.
It's awful. It's tragic.
I say I'm pulling out my hare
And they think I'm talking magic.
Those little drink umbrellas that spring up in the tropics
Were invented by a lonely group of crying alcoholics.
He was fucking a pussy and sucking a dick,
his happiness fully depleted,
when he noticed the people attached to those organs,
and instantly knew what he needed.
I'll love you until I'm dead on the outside.
I'll give you every one of my mortal seconds.
I'll never leave your side.
I'll die holding your hand.
But after that, I want some "me time."
Why do poets always talk about the ocean's waves,
about their single file march to shore,
and yet never talk about my grandmother's farts,
which arrive in time, one after the other, with equal
regularity?

Are these poets too holy to comment on anything
less than nature's flashiest gestures?
Are we going to spend another millennia searching
for meaning in sunsets and waterfalls?

Or will we finally turn our ear to Grammy's rump
and away from all that pretty stuff,
and hеar that foul, muted trumpet sing,
marking the еnd of an era?
You're like milk,
tasty and versatile.
You're like a dog,
loyal and often mistaken.
You're like New York,
large and in America.
You're like my girlfriend,
female and actually my girlfriend.
"Well, man, you know what they say."
No, I don't. I don't know what they say.
I don't even know who they are.
Who is this they?
They seem pretty smug.
They seem to think they know shit.
Fuck them.
Can I have a word, please?
It can be any word.
Just give me a word.

We can all share the rest.
Just let me have one.
It can be anything.
I'd take canteen or avid.
I'd even settle for timely.

But you can't use my word,
whatever it is,
without asking.
Because it's my word.

And I'll almost always let you use it when you ask.
Unless, for example, my word is wonderful
and you want to use it to describe a movie I haven't seen yet
or a movie I saw already and didn't care for.

I rеally want everything.
That's my first choice.
Flabbеrgasted is a close second.
Senator, what bright eyes you have!
The better to light paths with.
Senator, what a sharp tongue you have!
The better to cut the fat with.
Senator, what broad shoulders you have!
The better to carry you with.
Wait, why is your chest beeping?
God bless America!
My daughter,
on her teeter-totter,
slaughtered the fresh water otter I bought her.
Just like I taught her.
I said no to drugs once.
I looked a bag of weed right in the face
and like a loving but firm father,
I said, "No."
I was really high.
I'm old and cold and out of time,
thirteen years far past my prime.
Weary legs from life's steep climb,
I can barely walk let alone think of a fourth line.
I'm a gargoyle.
Stuck.
Outdated.
And pretty fucking weird looking.

You're an angel.
Free.
Immortal.
And pretty fucking weird looking, too.
He poked his penis all over her skin,
pensively feeling for an easy way in.
This man, with his fractal and fragmented soul,
finally felt hole and finally felt whole.
The first was acro-claustro-homo-arachnophobic,
terrified of being trapped in a very small,
very high-up place with a bunch of gay spiders.

The second was avio-coulro-glosso-metrophobic,
terrified of being forced to read poetry
to the clown public on an airplane.

The third was octo-oneirogmo-kathiso-lutraphobic,
terrified of having eight consecutive wet dreams
whilst sitting on a pile of otters.

The fourth was afraid of snakes.
What a pussy!
I don't expect
to change your mind
with one conversation,

only to chip away at it,
like a woodpecker on a redwood tree.
I've
hit rock
bottom.

What’s
a guy
to do?

I
certainly
can't
head
upward,
so
I'll
try
digging
through!
When I
walk into a
room,
you'd think
I was one
of those
long,
straight
Tetris
pieces
because
everyone's
just like
"Oh great,
you're
here!
We've
been
waiting for
you to
show up."
I will have sex with you if you ask politely.
Or ask.
Or if you politely consent to it.
Or consent to it.
I would like to have sex with you.
Call me back.
Buried beneath a pile of cats,
in a purring igloo,
is a crazy fucking cat lady.

Who'd have guessed?
I've seen a vampire transform into a single bat.
I've seen a vampire transform into a number of bats.
I've seen a vampire without any bat-transformation abilities.

WHICH IS IT!?
It feels good to love an angel.
It feels better to fuck an angel
with her wings pinned back
like a recently archived butterfly.
Why do these gay guys always parade around,
being all gay?

Like, two months ago,
I was at this gay pride parade
and this one guy on a big gay float
kept parading around, real gay-like.

Same thing happened fourteen months ago.
Same spot.
Same guy.
Parading around.
Hey, fireflies! Fly higher, guys!
Fly high above this place.
Till a sky rise is a wire’s size.
Then fly off into space.

I catch stupid bugs in jars
but you’re not bugs you’re baby stars!
On the third of June, at a minute past two,
where once was a person, a flower now grew.

Five daisies arranged on a large outdoor stage
in front of a ten-acre pasture of sage.

In a changing room, a lily poses.
At the DMV, rows of roses.

The world was much crueler an hour ago.
I’m glad someone decided to give flowers a go.
They say adults have no imagination. Not true.
Just instead of dinosaurs and spaceships, they imagine
silence and the new babysitter bent over the coffee table.
I said, “You can’t judge me.
Only Jesus can!”

He said, “Well I can ’cause
I’m a judge and
’cause you just killed a man.
Be patient, be patient.
Rome wasn't built in a day
It wasn’t built at all, in fact.
Rome self-assembled in reaction
to the people's unwavering patience.
So be patient, be patient.
Let your hands relax by your sides.
Let your chin rest gently on your chest.
Let each new breath fill you with calm.
Let your mind wander away to a faraway place.
Let me piss on your expensive shoes.
Let me empty your pockets of any valuables.
Let me escape this parking garage as you drift past some meadows or some shit.
When I die, I hope I don't see a bright light.

Those give me headaches.

After a long life, I don't want to stare into the sun.

I want a calm blackness-
the same shade that coats the back of my eyelids.
Right when you left, you left me

cold
and broken
and numb-

partly because

your love warmed me
and made me feel whole
and made me feel things I hadn't before-

and partly because

you left me chopped up in a freezer.
That small turn she
did, that one swift
pivot, the one she
did by the water with
flats scratching the
sidewalk, her hair
catching up seconds
afterward, fucked me.
You said your secret ingredient
was a pinch of love.
And that may be true.
But I taste cinnamon.

And I hate cinnamon more than I hate love.
You're a bunny, Alfred.
Quit all this "elephant" bullshit.
Look at your little bunny ears.
Look at your adorable whiskers.
Do elephants have little bunny ears?
Do they have adorable whiskers?
No, they don't.

You can't just wake up one day
and decide to be an elephant, Alfred.
The world doesn't work like that.
There are rules, Alfred.
And you want to stomp all over them.
Get over yourself.
Unstick me, woman. Dial it down.
Your grip is an aging chicken's and yet,
here I am--stuck, sticked.

Don't make me whip out a cheap lamp
and melt this cell into a motel room.
This is a fine form to make a prepositional proposition in.
The proposition is this: prepositions are fine to end a sentence with.
The nudist, sweating, with smudged ink filling in the cracks of his palm, approached the microphone, took a deep breath, and imagined the audience clothed.
The biker gang rode for years and years
through blood and sweat and mud and tears,
through snow and sand and dust and leaves,
and the poor old guys were just looking for sleeves.
Are you terrified, as I am,
of nothing?
Nothing scares me more
than nothing.

"What's going on?" I ask, trembling.
Don't you say it.
Don't you dare.
How fitting, she thought to herself
(or just thought, as she was the only person
to whom she had ever thought).

How fitting, the thought, that her words,
after tumbling in her head all day,
came out shrunken
like they were meant for a child.
Flower sex! Flower sex!
Flex those sexy flower pecs.
Good old April shower sex
that lasts for half an hour sex.

Yeah! Flower power her!
Devour her! Don't cower, sir!
Put that petal to the medal
and powerfully flower her!
Lou followed his dreams. Lou followed those things
into studios and boxing rings,
into clown schools and swimming pools,
into plucking little fiddle strings.

Lou followed his dreams. Now he's dirt-poor.
He doesn't have a pillow or bed anymore.
So three cheers for Lou, the follower who
followed his dreams all the way to the floor!

[Verse 1]
I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Verse 2]
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Bridge]
Dear Lord, when I get to heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothin' but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Outro]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?
I worry that
I'm using you,

my love,
my light,
my back-scratcher,
my cooking dickglove,
my sapient baby-maker,
my emotional treadmill,
my long-legged suggestion box,
my immaculate tissue dispenser.

I worry that
I'm using you.

Classic me.
The Sasquatch squats, flowers in hand,
on an old stump by the riverbed.

She’s not coming. He knows that by now
but he stays put—tracing circles in the dirt
with his big toe.

Overhead, the birds sing their condolences.
A fox passes and offers a bite of dead squirrel.
The monster politely declines.

As the sun tucks itself behind the horizon,
his eyes close, his chin meets his chest,
and the flowers slip from his grasp.
Although there's many different brains,
with different stories, different names,
different isn't safe like same,
so same makes most take safer aim.

Who needs those same old, same old fakes?
Today, the same old, lame mold breaks.
I'm me! I'm me! Meet me and see
what a difference difference makes!
The big bigs buzz and putter about the playground.

They're trying to have fun--to enjoy themselves--
but it's impossible.

Because the playground is made for tiny people,
not big bugs.
Three bee guys were scared for their lives.
They broke out of their hives,
they broke out in hives.

They screamed, "We miss our honeycomb home!"
and three wives from the hive scramed "Honey, come home!"
"Touch me back,"
you said, like a pirate talking to a masseuse.
"Right away, Captian,"

I replied, forgetting that you couldn't hear
that connection that I made in my head.
I went out to play on Christmas Day
and thought, "Hey, wait a minute!"
My tree has a house in it!
And my house has a tree in it!"

[Verse 1]
I walk with a real big stick
You hear a whisper, I don't give no lip
Yeah, the bark comes before the bite
Changes nothing, I'm the only dog in the fight
And the rules, they don't always apply
'Cause people love when you're a hell of a guy
Yeah, I walk with a real big stick
Here's the situation, I'm coming tonight, oh

[Chorus]
Kiss me a little
Kiss me before you roar
I'm yours, forever yours
And you are mine to take tonight

[Verse 2]
Well, there's a growl there deep inside
It's purely animal and socially compatible
A rough exterior shine
Pushing on my principle, she's always unpredictable
Her hand held will do you right
Melting all the ice from your heart tonight
Yeah, I walk with a real big stick
No one's gonna hurt you, I'll never desert you

[Chorus]
Kiss me a little
Kiss me before you roar
I'm yours, forever yours
And you are mine to take tonight
Hey

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Yeah
Yeah, you know it's true
That it's true, that it's true
Yeah

[Outro]
That I walk with a real big stick
I back up on my promises, I promise I'm protagonist
A little bite'll do you good
I'll sink my teeth in like you knew I would
And together, we'll spark a fire
Starting wars over borders, giving birth to desire
And you walk with a sway in your hips
Be my queen, I'll show you a palace

[Verse 1]
I just wanna take you for a ride up in my Cadillac
Let your hair go wild and put the seats back
I just wanna take you to a place where you've never been
Are you buckled in? 'Cause I don't hold back

[Chorus]
You've been lifted up, you've been lifted up
You've been lifted up on solid ground
Where we can be or not be found
And I've been lifted up to hold your crown

[Verse 2]
I just wanna take you for a ride through my dreams at night
Well, come and catch the fly and we can play with fire

[Bridge]
Wanna lift you higher
Come with me, my queen
I wanna go everywherе to lift your crown higher
Come with me, my queen
I wanna go with you еverywhere to lift your crown higher
You'll always be my queen
I wanna go with you everywhere and lift your crown

[Chorus]
You've been lifted up, you've been lifted up
You've been lifted up on solid ground
Where we can be or not be found
And I've been lifted up to hold your crown

[Outro]
I just wanna take you for a ride up in my Cadillac
Well, is that too much to ask?
We could make it last, oh
"You're a cunt,"
I said to the cunt.

"Well, you’re a cunt too!"
replied the cunt to the other cunt,
apparently.

And far away, fresh moss continued to fill in our initials.
Lyrics from Snippets

[Intro: Kanye West]
While you're fast asleep

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Do you experience nervousness or shakiness inside, faintness and dizziness? The idea that someone else can control your thoughts. Feeling others are to blame for most of your thoughts. Trouble remembering things, feeling easily annoyed and irritated. Feeling afraid in open spaces or in public. Thoughts of ending your life. Feeling that most people could not be trusted. Poor appetite, heart or chest pains?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I feel like that, I feel like that all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that, I feel like that all the time

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Do you feel tempered outbursts, that you cannot control? Feeling lonely, even when you are with people, feeling blocked. Feeling blue, sad, feeling disinterested in things, feeling fearful. Are your feelings easily hurt? Feeling that people are unfriendly, or do you feel like people dislike you?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I feel like that all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that

[Refrain: The World Famous Tony Williams with Ty Dolla $ign]
Our remains are not in there, no lines
This train won't stop 'cause there’re no signs
Feel, feel (Yeah, yeah)
It feels like I'm drowning here tonight (I feel like that)
Oh. Oh. Oh
Feel, feel (Oh, yeah)
Our remains are not in there, no lines
This train won't stop 'cause there're no signs
Feel

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I feel like that
I feel like that, I feel like that all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that, I feel like that all the time

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Do you have trouble falling asleep? Nausea, upset stomach, hot or cold spells? Numbness, tingling in parts of your body, trouble catchin' your breath?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time
I feel like that

[Refrain: The World Famous Tony Williams with Ty Dolla $ign]
Our remains are not in there, no lines
This train won't stop 'cause there're no signs

Deep in the bowels of Athens,
Socrates is having the squirts—
his body, like the aqueducts,
giving way to a long, watery movement —
hunched head to hands and elbows to knees.
Thinking pretty hard now ain’t ya, buddy?
Yeah, I bet you are.
Father Time is fucking Mother Nature.
He's fucking her good. And he's lasting a long time.
She's loving the shit out of it.
He's doing that thing that makes girls' heads spin.

She's been spinning for years!
I heard that one day, in the future,
he's gonna fuck her right into the sun.
He's done it to chicks before.
He's talking in the third person again.

Look at him,
talking to himself,
about himself
as if he's talking to someone else
about someone else.

He's about to speak.

"Hey! You!"
Wait, he can't do that.
He can't address "him" as "you."
He is "him."

"HEY! YOU!"

Wait a second...
yes?
Thank you Richard, Ben, Pippa, and everyone at Grand Central Publishing. I am so grateful.
Thank you to the teachers who inspired me- Mrs. Burridge, Mr. Furlong, and many others.
And to George Carlin and Shel Silverstein.

Big love to you all.

Old men love to sit on benches. They do! All day.
If you see an empty bench, look around.
I guarantee that you will not see any old men.

Old men always sit on benches.
And they always have.

Back in the day,
baby old men,
with their baby walking sticks
and baby dentures,
would sit on tiny baby benches.

And as they grew,
from baby old men
puttering around dragging baby oxygen tanks
into grown-up old men puttering around
dragging oxygen tanks,
the benches grew too.

Sometimes,
two old men will sit on a bench together.
And that’s fine.
Because it’s not a throne.
It’s a bench.
And it’s for old men.
Anteater, blender, butthole:
these words know what they’re doing.

What does a blender do?
Blend.
What does an anteater do?
Eat ants.
What’s a butthole?
A hole in your butt.

Carpet, manslaughter, folklore.
These words suck.

What is a carpet?
No idea.
What is manslaughter?
It’s actually slaughtering men or women. Misleading.
What is folklore?
A bunch of folks doing lore? What the fuck is lore?

Absolute nonsense.
We need more words like toothbrush.
I eat words! Delicious words!
I gobble the words that you make.
Words like rod taste like turds,
but billow tastes like cake.

I stuff my space with afterwards
and wash it down with hush.
Dessert must wait till after words
like hunch or flack or crush.

And my dessert won't be dessert.
That word is tough to chew.
I'll have a word that's sweet an curt,
like pony, nip, or blue.
Ye old sea captain.

You know, briny breath,
one squinting eye,
chewing a waterlogged pipe,
squatting on dock post.
A bearded cauldron blabbering bullshit,
crashing through anecdotes
like a radio dial through waves of white noise.

Living legend, he is.
A great American archetype.
So grab your digital cameras
you yuppie fucks.
I could make an easy joke to get you laughing.
Something about a cat and them
the word pussy being used ambiguously.

I could tell a sad story to get you crying.
Like how I had a single mother
who started selling handmade yo-yos
to support her only child.

I could tell you an interesting fact to get you nodding,
Like how carpets were first made in the hopes that all of the world’s grass
would one day be replaced by carpets, or, as they called
them, "comfy grass."

I could tell you a scary story to get your teeth chattering,
Something about a really old man, sitting in a squeaky
rocking chair, pointing at you.

What are you in the mood for?
You had many layers like an onion.
Wait, no, like an artichoke—with your
layers arranged like snake scales, not
stacked like coats of paint.

Be sure to call in a year or so and
tell me whether I was lifting heavy
stones off your bunker door or
plucking petals off your face.
I’m a gangly kid,
one of those drunk marionettes,
one of those baby giraffes with inner ear syndrome.
A flailing stork in high winds. A stilted freak.

I am an easel—not symbolically— structurally.
I attempt to dance and become a tornado of elbow.
The snow lay gently upon the ground.
The poo lay gently upon the snow.
The boy lay gently upon the poo.

And the boy made a snow angel.

An angel
with a white body made from heaven’s ashes
and a brown heart made from a dog’s
gastrointestinal tract.
Eight baby turtles scurry to shore.
Wait, seven—now six—now five—now four!
Two more gone, two left in the race,
both of them sprinting and hoping to place.
The first gets second, the second gets third,
and first place goes to the now well-fed bird.
There’s nothing like a cup of joe,
when the morning’s grey and grim and slow,
when the streets collide with the world outside,
when litter lies where lilies grow.

Just drink that smoking cup of black
and feel your feelings surging back.
Plus, spill a drop and a coffee shop
will sprout up from a sidewalk crack!
Aw, it’s plump, old dandy Sandy Claws.
It’s fuckin’ Daddy Christmas.
How’s it hanging, Sandy Claws
I’m sure Miss Kringle missed us.
I love you, you big dumb sack of shit.
Come over whenever, I got the fireplace lit.
I’m fuckin’ with you!
Look at her, balanced on that rotten turtle shell,
conducting the wind with those two moldy corn dogs.
An old demigod, rightfully covered in bird shit
in the middle of the park.

She hasn't lost it. She's found it--
and it's a disgusting and goofy thing.

If you don't believe me, have a picnic in the park
and enjoy gagging on your homemade cooking.
Severed heads get all the attention.

“Poor ol’ disembodied heads,”
cry the townspeople.

But what about the severed bodies?
What about that poor ol’ disembodied head’s
poor ol’ disemheaded body?

The heads roll around moping all day.
The bodies work in the mines.
Without a union!

It’s a no-brainer for the no brainers.
Give ’em some respect.
They harvest our coal, for Christ’s sake!

Another day on the Ant Farm
and still no crops in sight.
The soil's something terrible
the days are far too bright.
We work the fields, we tend the land,
we check the ground for weeds,
but how are we to farm when
we weren't even given seeds!

There's little hope in sight
and as I sit here all alone,
I wonder if an Ant Farm's
just a place where ants are grown.
My barber is bald, my trainer is fat,
my sponsor is drunken and lazy.
My optometrist is as blind as a bat
and my shrink is batshit crazy.

When you look at who is helping me,
you’ll know the reason why
I’ve remained a bald, fat, drunken, lazy, blind,
and crazy guy.
One of them Martians came round the house last night.

Talking in code or some shit.
Weird fucking things they are.

He rambled for a good ten minutes.

Didn’t listen. Kept staring at his brain
through that tacky glass head of his.
I could see his thoughts form. I could see
them scramble around like ants on hot pavement.
Dumb and flightless, that’s what they are.

He eventually left. Haven’t thought of him since.

[Verse 1]
I was losing you in grays and blues
A winter sky I never wanted over us
Inconsequential hues I never knew could play that part
When I was walking through the park

[Pre-Chorus]
And I would paint the clouds away
If I could

[Chorus]
I would take it slow walking home
Remind you all that we could be together
Holding hands while marching bands sing
Loud choruses of the future
Together

[Verse 2]
And all that's good and fine
But, darling, I'm still terrified
That you'll choose Los Angeles over me
And staring at my toes, if only I could make them go
Where I'd be happy

[Pre-Chorus]
And you said that you'd nеver stay
Away

[Chorus]
We could take it slowwalking homе
Remind you all that we could be together
Holding hands while marching bands sing
Loud choruses of the future
Together
Together
Together

[Verse 1]
Steady now
Keep your coat near
We don't belong here anymore
Board it up
Window's too cold
Shivering hole in our wall

[Chorus]
And I was shaken for so long
I was shaken, but I'm steady now
Steady now

[Verse 2]
Take it off
Paper thin tears
Break it off
We don't belong here anymore
Anymore
Anymore

[Chorus]
And I was shaken for so long
I was shaken, but I'm steady now
Oh, I was shaken for so long
And I was shaken, but I'm steady now
Steady now
Steady now
Steady now
Steady now
Steady now
Now

[Verse 1]
I never told you 'bout the green in your eyes
Watching you sleep through 2008 skies
But it's alright
Maybe some other time
We always said we'd meet up in the city
Tell of our lives since that virgin kiss
Oh, such a long while ago in my mind

[Chorus]
First love, gone too soon
I wish that I could sit with you
For one more afternoon
First love, gone too fast
I'll think of you like we were last
Alive and young, in love and in the sun

[Post-Chorus]
One more afternoon
One more afternoon
One more, one more, one more

[Verse 2]
Maybe in ten years, I'll think about now
When I learned that you're always with me somehow
Always in my mind

[Chorus]
First love, gone too soon
I wish that I could sit with you
For one more afternoon
First love, gone too fast
I'll think of you like we were last
Alive and young, in love
Alive and young, in love and in the sun
I love being silly, don't you?
Boing, boing, boing. Poo!
Be silly when you're giddy!
Be silly when you're tired!
If your job is superserious,
Be silly till you're fired!
The way her hair barely touched her shoulders,
like it knew to stop growing there.
The way her lips teased each other when she spoke,
parting and embracing with every syllable.
The way her tight virgin nostrils twitched and spasmed in the moonlight,
quivering like two horny monks.
The way her curly, almost pubic eyebrows framed her fishy, moistened eyes.

I'm a face guy.
A priest, a rabbi, and a horse walk into bar.
The bar bursts into flames. The horse escapes,
only to drown in a lake later that night.
As for the priest and the rabbi? Turns out
they were just two other horses. My mistake.
I'm stuck in this thing and I'm wanting to leave.
There are holes in the thing that hiss when I breathe.
And the more that I sit here, the more I believe
that I'm stuck in this thing and won't ever leave.

Back at the kennel, the whole cage was ours
but maybe these walls are better than bars,
or maybe I'm hurtling skyward to Mars
and maybe those holes are actually stars!

[Verse 1]
Motherfuckers try to grab me by the pussy
Turn around and tell 'em you can kiss my tush-ey
Turn around and tell 'em you can keep on wishin'
Turn around and tell me what's good, Miley
What's good, what's good?
Motherfuckers catching feelings, wow
So I smash and gotta leave it
All the papers tryna pay me like a villain
But I still beat 'em tell me what's good, Miley
What's good, what's good?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Yeah, Miley is good, yeah, Miley's good
M-M-Miley is running to Hollywood
Miley got a molly and California weed, hey
And for a guy, she's never gets on her knees

[Chorus]
'Cause she's the boss, she's the bitch, shе's the leader (Milеy!)
She's the shit, she's the queen, she's the winner (Miley!)
Miley don't fuck with that loser
That think he can coming grab me by the pussy

[Verse 2]
Motherfuckers try to grab me by the pussy
Turn around and tell 'em you can't kiss my tush-ey
Turn around and tell 'em you can keep on wishin'
Turn around and tell me what's good, Miley
What's good, what's good?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Miley can speak dollar Clinton
Been doin' it while the girls be strippin'
A hundred thousand tippin'
Like Cardi B on drippin'
I let my tits slip while I'm off to zippin', oh God

[Chorus]
'Cause she's the boss, she's the bitch, she's the leader (Miley!)
She's the shit, she's the queen, she's the winner (Miley!)
Miley don't fuck with that loser
That think he can coming grab me by the pussy

[Bridge]
I'm twerking for it, I be working for it
And I just can't ignore it
You think your hands on my money and my money and my ass
I'm can't ignore it, I be working for it
And I ain't looking for ya
So take your hands off my money and my money and my ass
My money and my ass, yeah, my money and my ass
Take your hands off my money and my ass

[Verse 1]
Motherfuckers try to grab me by the pussy
Turn around and tell 'em you can kiss my tush-ey
Turn around and tell 'em you can keep on wishin'
Turn around and tell me what's good, Miley
What's good, what's good?

[Outro]
Obama
Obama
Obama
Obama
Turn down reality, t-turn up the fantasy
Why, why don't you come with me?
You, you know it's gonna be on, hey
You know it's gonna be on, hey
Turn down the prophecy, d-don't ever fuck with me
You, you wanna come with me
You, you know it's gonna be on
You know we goin' be on, hey
The American dream is boring
The American dream is boring
Sex, drugs, and rock and roll
Caught on name and we goin' be on
The American dream is boring
Forgive me, but the rain is pouring
Sex, drugs, and rock and roll
Caught on name ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
You love my pussy
Hey, I love my pussy too
You love my pussy, huh?
Good, huh, I love my pussy too
You love my pussy, huh?
Good, I love my pussy too
Hey, you love my pussy, huh?
Good, I love my pussy too
I love my pussy too
I love my pussy too
You love my pussy, huh?
Good, I love my pussy too
Babies are the puppies of people.
You feel me?
I hope you can feel me.
'Cause I feel like I should be felt right now.

Check this out--
your first floor's ceiling is your second floor's floor,
Whoa, right?

Bet you didn't know that the plural of house is hice
or that all dogs are male and all cats are chicks.

WHO IS THIS GUY?! HOW DOES HE KNOW SO MUCH?!?!

(I'm afraid I might die alone).
Could I crush you, young lady,
and put you in my pocket?
You would fold beautifully, like
fifty-dollar-bill beautifully, not
origami-swan beautifully.

We could unwind by the
glass lakes of romance or tangle by the
dank wetlands of perversion—
as long as we’re together.
I feel poetic when I say that the group of young
teenage girls at the mall

rattled my psyche
like wailing sirens

and that their freshly developed breasts
could make for quite tempting cider

should Satan decide
to pick and press them.

I feel honest when I say that the group of young
teenage girls at the mall

rattled my psyche
like the other group of teenage girls I once
saw scissoring in a porno,

and that their freshly developed breasts
made mе wrestle my inner lunatic to
thе ground,
bind his hands behind his back
and draw him a crude sketch of the young
girls scissoring to keep him from screaming.
In his long career as a heart surgeon,
in his life full of valves and ventricles,
full of tumors and heartache,
rumors and arteries.
In all those years of blood and tears,
he’d never seen anything like this before.

[Intro]
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo

[Verse 1]
I longed for you since I was born
A woman sensitive and warm
And that you were
With pride and strength no one could test
Yet still have a feminine finesse
And so much more

[Chorus]
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world

[Verse 2]
A female Shakespeare of your time
With looks to blow Picasso's mind
You werе the best
Your body moved with gracе and song
Like symphonies by Bach or Brahms
Nevertheless, oh oh

[Chorus]
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world

[Refrain]
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo

[Verse 3]
The passion burning in your heart
Would make hell's fire seem like a spark
Where did it go?
Just why that you would overnight
Turn love to stone as cold as ice
I'll never, never, never, never, never know

[Chorus]
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world
(Cold, too cold)
(You took me riding)
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven (Dropped me back)
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world
(Oh, oh, oh, you took me riding)
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven (But at a half a mile)
(You dropped my Black ass)
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world
(I would not do that to a dog, baby)
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world (Oh, oh)
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
(Know you hurt me so, but you hurt me)
But at a half a mile from heaven (Woah, woah, woah)
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Baby, your rocket love
The flies do their daily exercise routine,
buzzing and twisting around the mounds of shit
in my front lawn.

How happy they must be darting through the stench,
taking deep breaths of airborne fecal particles
rather than that stale chemical fertilizer.

The shit's where it's at. The flies know that.
When the dancing is over, they collapse onto the poo
and stuff their faces with it.
Hello, my old friend!
You silly old clown!
How’s that mountain of life
you’ve been tumbling down?

How’s that little line segment with infinite points?
Has the red rust of time been kind to your joints?

How’s that worn path of safety?
Has it led you astray?
What’s that? How am I?
Oh, I’m okay.
I found Jesus once.
He was in a diner eating hash browns.

He had one of those long booths all to himself.
He wasn’t being greedy or anything.
Place was pretty empty.

I watched him play the crane game on the way out—
the one with the metal claw and the cuddly mass grave.
He kept going for a rabbit in overalls.
The claw couldn’t lift it.

Eventually, he gave up and left.

I tried for a bit.
The rabbit’s just too heavy.
I think whoever owns this thing
put an unmovable toy rabbit
in there just to fuck with evеrybody.
I’m smart like a genius.
You’re dumb like an idiot.

I’m handsome like a prince.
You’re ugly like a regular person.

You’re slow like a dumb slug.
I’m fast like a cheetah. Nice knowing ya, SLUG!

You’re poor like one of those people who shops at
that stupid puppet store.
I’m rich like the guy who owns that stupid puppet store.

Your girlfriend sucks.
I don’t have a girlfriend which is way better ’cause your
girlfriend sucks!

You’re clumsy like a bad waitress.
I’m suave like a good usher.

You’re weak likе an old plastic spoon.
I’m strong like a really good-looking guy.
I’m two thumbs up. Way up.
You’re two thumbs down. Oops!

You’rе an ant.
I am the wise praying mantis.

When you walk around, people point and laugh.
When I walk around, people point and smile.

You suck.
I don’t.
I don’t suck.
You do.

I’m smart like a genius.
You’re dumb like an idiot.

[Verse 1]
Honey, I know you've been shaking
Sick and awaiting vacation
But I could be your heron blue sky
I could be your white night lullaby

[Chorus]
Wrap me in celadon and gold
Wrap me in celadon and gold
If you want me
Would you call me?
Would you call me?
If you want me

[Verse 2]
And maybe I'll wait for a cold day
Shiver in sheets until you say
Through your silent heat
"Won't you pilot me?"
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
If you want me
Would you call me?
If you want me, oh
If you want me
Would you call me?
Would you call me?
If you want me
If you want me
Would you call me?
If you want
Don’t talk with your mouth full
and don’t breathe with your throat full
and don’t swim with your stomach full
and don’t dance with your colon full
and don’t fear with the ground full,
full of your poop, that is, because it will become soil.
What a world.
Most people fear
the evil clown,
squeaking his big red nose in a dark barn.

I fear
the off-duty clown,
out of his costume,
impossible to spot,
sitting next to me on a bus.
Pigs are smarter than dogs.
That’s a fact.
That is “science,” if you will.
Will you?

Pigs are smarter than dogs.
I love my dog.
I also love eating bacon.

So I can stop eating bacon
or I can continue playing a quiet
and aggressive role in the genocide
of a species whose intelligence sits
safely in the middle of my “worthy of real love” spectrum.

Or I can continue eating bacon
and admit that my love for my dog is a sham,
a hollow and meaningless relationship born
of my own insecurities and years of confirmation bias.

He likes me bеcause I feed him.
That’s it. Fuck him.
Bacon is delicious.
I’m the sexiest eukaryote alive.
My mitochondria are so big and powerful.
Look at my fucking Golgi apparatus.
I fucking love it. Yeah, that’s it, Golgi.
Keep pinching off lysosomes for me.
I got such a sexy shade of cytoplasm
and my fucking vacuoles mmmmmmm!
Don’t get me started,
oh my fuckkkinnggggmmmmmmmm.
Fuck, I can feel it in my nucleus.
It feels so fucking good.
Oh my god. I’m gonna make myself…
I’m gonna…
Fucking Golgi!
Fuck!
I’m gonna…….
I’mmm gonnnnnnnnaaaa
You’re the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen.
And I know that.

But I can’t rediscover it every fucking day.
I can’t return to that epiphany
every time my alarm clock goes off.
It’s unnatural.

But what I can do, and do quite naturally,
is become jaded and unimpressed by it.
I can see your beauty as normal,
as one of my life’s many constants.

I can climb atop its shoulders and travel about,
rolling my eyes at sunsets and rainbows,
dismissing all the beauty of the world as
less than average.

And I complain to you about it.
And you can deduce your beauty from that.
Only after that drunken late-night congress
had disperse
and the music had stopped and the walls had caught
their breath
and the smug fog of dialogue had condensed on the
empty glasses,
only then did I notice how unhappy you were.

The strobe light had given me stale, unusable snapshots.
Even if I had seen some struggle on you, somewhere,
I would have mistook it for simple social rigmarole
as everyone’s behavior reeked of pеrformance.

And only after that night had given into thе next day,
and I had stood where you had danced so cautiously,
and I had imagined you sitting in that chair that still
bared my imprint,
only then did I realize why you felt that way.
Rock on,
indie rocker!
Rock
those bongos!
Rock
that weird African instrument that you
purchased on that private school field trip.
Rock on
about that girl who left you because she got
tired of struggling to get your skinny jeans off.
Rock on
about the poetry of the universe, armed
with the knowledge you gained by skimming
a Wikipedia article on quantum mechanics.
Rock on
about pain and addiction (itchy beards and
clove cigarettes, respectively).
Rock
against the labels.
Rock
against the system.
Rock
against the world. Rock against rocking.
Rock.
Walk with me now if you would
or wouldn’t mind
or would mind not walking someone
as I would.

Speak to me now if you must
or mustn’t be quiet
or must’ve forgotten something important
as I must’ve.

Stay with me now if you can
or can’t decide
or can’t not stay with someone,
anybody,
as I can’t.
I. Don’t. Give. A. FUCK.
Never have, brah. Never will, dude.
You upset? Good! ’Cause I don’t give a fuck!
I dress like I don’t give a fuck.

I read in a magazine that women find that attractive.
It’s probably true, but I don’t give a fuck.

People ask me,
“Whoa man, cool outfit, is it hard not giving a fuck?”
Yes. It’s very hard. But it’s like, fuck it, you know? I won’t start giving a fuck just because it’s hard to not give a fuck. You may give a fuck but don’t you go trying to make me start giving a fuck.
Or do.
’Cause I don’t give a FUCK!

When I die, I won’t give a fuck.
People will remember me for that.
They’ll probably write books about me and build
monuments in my name. But I won’t give a fuck.
I’ll be dead.
But even if I was alive, I still wouldn’t give a fuck.
I’d walk past the giant library built in my honor and
just roll my eyes.
An attractive woman would see all this happen and
she would turn to her friend and say—
“See that guy? He doesn’t give a fuck. See that
library? It’s named after that guy who doesn’t
give a fuck. Ooooh, he’s kinda sexy.
Look at those sea monkeys
puttering around their bowl.

Yesterday, they were a sugar packet
and now they’re sea monkeys.

What a dumb miracle.
Dust into animated dandruff.

I’ve never found the incomprehensible quite this boring.

All that talk about life
and I got a cheap magic trick.
I spend most of my day outside,
crouched to the earth, tying knots in the grass.

I spend most of my year traveling,
looking for fields or front yards, tying knots in the grass.

If you find a knot, you find me,
as I am the only thing tying knots in the grass.
It’s unfortunate that the word for “catching fish by
piercing their lips with hooks and dragging them
onto a boat” is called fishing.

To the fish, fishing means something different. To
fish is to live, to love, to be.

When the more aggressive fish find a lonely
swimming human and rip the flesh from its stupid
bones—that’s called peopling.
I reckon (don’t discredit me due to the elderly start)
that in the future, in the far future, if all goes well,
two gay fathers will disown their son
because their son wants to marry his clone.

“It’s unnatural!” they’ll scream.
“It’s an abomination!” they’ll cry.

The son and his clone will run away together,
beside themselves, armed only with love.
They will hide in scrapyards and motel rooms
until the bigotry passes, as it always does.
I can’t stand trees.

They’re a bit too theatrical.
They act all dramatic, no static, all radical.
All “Hey, look at me!” All “Hey, I’m a tree!”
All “Hey, stump boy, do you like what you see?”

And I reply, “No! You limp-limbed lug!
You winter leaflet littering bug.
With towering branches and cowering roots,
devouring sunshine and showering fruits.

It’s a war they want? Then a war I’ll wage.
I’m writing this on paper just to waste...

…a fucking page.
Writers like to talk about how things are or were “bustling.”

The market was bustling on a bustling street corner.
In a bustling bakery, the muffins bustled in the oven.
“Don’t worry, Rupert, the bus’ll be bustling by in five minutes!”

I mean, I get it.
Bustle is a good word.
It makes total sense.

Whenever I’m in a group of more than three people,
all I can hear in my head is
bustle, bustle, bustle, bustle.

I say it to myself, silently,
even when peoplе appear
to be trying to start a
conversation with mе.

A cute girl may be right in front of me,
looking at my face and mouthing sounds,
but all I can think of is
bustle, bustle, bustle, bustle.
Lyrics from snippet:

[Verse 1]
I know you've been tellin' everybody who would listen
That I ain't shit
I ain't been shit
But that's your perspective (Oh, yeah)
And you know perspective's subjective (Oh-oh)
I, I don't blame you, baby
You lie, so leave, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
That's okay 'cause you gonna do what you wanna do (Do)
Play it like you wanna, move how you wanna move (Move)
I ain't gon' stop ya, say what you wanna say (Say)
That's okay, it's okay

[Chorus]
I guess you gotta do whatever helps you sleep at night (Oh)
Hope you're comfortable layin' your head down on your pride (Pride)
Holdin' on to lonely ego empty bed of lies
But, whatever helps you sleep at night, at night

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh no
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
It's like a movie when you slow walk by
You got that "Come get me"-kinda look in your eyes
You got me trippin you got me tongue tied
You say I make you laugh and that always makes me smile

[Pre-Chorus]
And through the lows and highs you stood by my side
Up-and-down in slow motion with your hands to the sky
I wanna rush but I'm just taking my time
Girl, I'm still so surprised you dropped down in my life
And I wanna say

[Chorus]
I can't believe my ey-ey-eyeyes
They lie-lie-lie, I know this can't be right
She's a beautiful rollercoaster ride
And she's my-y-y, my rollеrcoaster ride

[Post-Chorus]
Rollercoastеr you (Rollercoast, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Rollercoaster you (Rollercoast, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Rollercoaster you (Rollercoast, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Rollercoaster you (Rollercoast, ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
We'll take forever one day at a time
'Cause I will stay on track and I won't close my eyes
Don't worry, girl, I'm not the jealous type
Don't mean that I don't care when you flirted with those guys

[Pre-Chorus]
And through the lows and highs you stood by my side
Up-and-down in slow motion with our hands to the sky
I wanna rush but I'm just taking my time
Girl I'm still so surprised you dropped down in my life
And I wanna say

[Chorus]
I can't believe my ey-ey-eyeyes
They lie-lie-lie, I know this can't be right
She's a beautiful rollercoaster ride
And she's my-y-y, my rollercoaster ride

[Post-Chorus]
Rollercoaster you (Rollercoast, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Rollercoaster you (Rollercoast, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Rollercoaster you (Rollercoast, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Rollercoaster you (Rollercoast, ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Bridge]
Up
And down we go till we go back up and spinning around
Never never never never letting go
Holding on tight till we both reach the end of the road
Together gether gether
And I wanna say

[Chorus]
I can't believe my ey-ey-eyeyes
They lie-lie-lie, I know this can't be right
She's a beautiful rollercoaster ride
And she's my-y-y, my rollercoaster ride

[Post-Chorus]
Rollercoaster you (Rollercoast, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Rollercoaster you (Rollercoast, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Rollercoaster you (Rollercoast, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Rollercoaster you (Rollercoast, ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
The purest color is achieved by using just one
Wavelength, at a high intensity
Such as in, laser lights

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Laser lights (laser lights)
Laser light
The intensity drops
Back when SATURATION drops

[Chorus: Matt Champion]
-nails, clothes, we’re perfect
We’re perfect
Hair, eyes, nails, clothes, we’re perfect
We’re perfect
Hair, eyes, nails, clothes, we’re perfect
We’re perfect
Hair, eyes, nails, clothes, we’re perfect
We’re perfect
Hair, eyes, nails, clothes, we’re perfect
We’re perfect
*Lyrics from snippet 1*

[Verse 1]
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get out of that shit-

*Lyrics from snippet 2*

[Chorus]
-But I still drove 30 hours to you
Yeah

[Veras 2]
I remember rappin' for Jay an' Cam
Young producer just tryin' to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
...
You call down for an omelet, girl, it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl, don't start with me
Out on the porch so quiet
Nothing on the tv tonight
Nowhere in the world to go
We went to see the midnight show

Sticky floors and torn-up seats
In the lobby you got something to eat
Lights go down, the screen starts to glow
You came back with a diet coke

Oh oh oh...

You missed the entire first scene
By the credits we were both asleep
I was lying next to you in a dream
The lights came on and someone told us to leave

Oh oh oh...

Your house was as dark as the room
Not a single word was spoke
3am and I'm all alone
Just a memory and a diet coke
Your house was as dark as the room
Not a single word was spoke
3am and I'm all alone
Just a memory and a diet coke

Oh oh oh...

[Verse 1]
Its late at night
Studio says nothing but vibes

[?]
People blowing my line
Do not disturb the young fella, just tryna vibe
Tryna stay focused I really don't got time to combust
I gotta keep a tunnel vision (mhm)
I don't got time to be tripping (na-na-nah)
But like 

[?] Mercedes and the F1, boy you know I'm driven
(Mmmmmm)

[Chorus]
Satan, I'm in my feelings, I'm thinking
'Bout all of the steps I been taking
Just to get where I am, and I'm thanking, and I'm thanking
Yeah Satan, I'm in my feelings, I'm thinking
'Bout all of the steps I been taking
Just to get where I am, and I'm thanking, and I'm thanking, the lord

[Verse 2]
Treat the family like royalty, the only ones I trust
And if you ain't with the team, I'm sorry but we cannot discuss
My phones, personal lifе, and all of the above
Lost count of the timеs, I tried to tell them I'm the one
Now they say they always knew it, tryna play me like I'm dumb
Take my soul I couldn't do it, said the kid was way too young
But now I got them all stunned, looking like they seen a ghost
Got 'em on my instagram, and they be liking every post
But it don't stop, 

[?] don't stop
Promised mama I'd be somebody, and no stop
Got the plan together, and got my own plot
And once I'm up, I swear to god that I won't drop (don't)
You about to witness the come up
All the way, from dust right until the sun come up

[?]
Bout to blow, gotta take the team, 'bout to run up (oh yeah)

[Bridge]
I'm in my feelings, I'm thinking
'Bout all of the steps I been taking
Just to get where I am, and I'm thanking, and I'm thanking

[Chorus]
Yeah Satan, I'm in my feelings, I'm thinking
'Bout all of the steps I been taking
Just to get where I am, and I'm thanking, and I'm thanking the lord

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm smokin' and I'm sippin' 'til I'm gone
Lord, I been a sinner, I been lifted too long
I be motherfuckin' faded every day, I stay high
Bitches tryna ride, pussy and money is on my mind

[Post-Chorus]
So I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't give a fuck (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Wait a minute, take a second for a motherfuckin' legend
Yeah, yeah
Pay your respect, bow your head, I'll be witcha in a second
This business is in need of my attention, my
Time is precious, can't afford to waste a second, no
The world is еndin', this is fuckin' Armageddon, get ready
Whеn it's over, find me ridin' in a Benzi
With a bad bitch beside me, smokin' on some shit that's deadly
I'm a motherfuckin' player, I swear
Tell me where the function at, it's nothin', I'm there
If I'm in it, you can bet it's lit
We higher than Pegasus, never comin' down, shit
Up, up and away with this

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm smokin' and I'm sippin' 'til I'm gone
Lord, I been a sinner, I been lifted too long
I be motherfuckin' faded every day, I stay high
Bitches tryna ride, pussy and money is on my mind

[Post-Chorus]
(I might be crazy, boy)
I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't give a fuck (Everybody think I'm crazy, boy)
I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't give a fuck (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
And I always show my city love
I'm from a place where winters cold and three rivers run
Black and gold is in my blood
Money make these bitches come, so I don't pay 'em no mind
I just keep my distance from 'em, know they on my dick because
I'm hotter than that chicken that's cookin' inside your kitchen oven
I put the butter on the bread like an English muffin
And I been the motherfuckin' man, hunnid grand
You'll never catch the muffin man, I'm gone like long distance lovin'
I was young and dumb, little smarter now, Harvard bound
Rugged like I'm tryna put the carpet down, shit
I got a army now, they with the shits, I guarantee
Exotic pets in the crib, come and hear a parrot speak

[Intro]
You can't tell 2Pac how to be 2Pac
Suge got 2Pac out of jail
Now a new Pac gotta go get shoot out of jail, you know?

[Verse]
Hear me now, hear me here
Hear me clear, get it right
Get it right, you a lie
I'm alive, you is dead

We free, we free

You still there, we free
I survive, we free

Off the Wi-Fi, off to my style
All alive, I come to my side
Come to my side
Hey lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh darling, darling, darling
Walk a while with me
Ohh, you've got so much, so much, so much

Many have I loved, and many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed along the open road

Many times I've lied, and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know

Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream, and a pocket full of gold

Mellow is the man who knows what hе's been missing
Many, many men can't see the open road

Many is a word that only lеaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, oh, oh, oh, oh
Really ought to know (oh, oh, oh)
I really ought to know
Oh
You know I should, you know I should, you know I should, you know I should

[Eva]
Just listen to that, the voice of Argentina
We are adored, we are loved

[Officer]
Statesmanship is more than entertaining peasants

[Eva's sister]
We shall see little man

[Crowd]
(Evita Peron, La Santa Peronista ... )

[Eva]
I am only a simple woman
Who lives to serve Peron in his noble crusade
To rescue his people
I was once as you are now, and I promise you this
We will take the riches from the obligarchs
Only for you, for all of you
And one day, you too will inherit these trеasures
Descamisados, mis companeros
Whеn they fire those cannons, when the crowds sing of glory
It is not just for Peron, but for all of us, for all of us

[Aristocrats]
Things have reached a pretty pass
When someone pretty lower-class
Can be respected and admired

[Aristocrat]
But our privileged class is dead
Look who they are calling for now
What's new Buenos Aires?
I'm new, I wanna say I'm just a little stuck on you
You'll be on me too

I get out here, Buenos Aires
Stand back, you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality

Fill me up with your heat, with your noise
With your dirt, overdo me
Let me dance to your beat, make it loud
Let it hurt, run it through me
Don't hold back, you are certain to impress
Tell the driver this is where I'm staying

Hello, Buenos Aires
Get this, just look at me dressed up, somewhere to go
We'll put on a show

Take me in at your flood, give me speed
Give me lights, set me humming
Shoot me up with your blood, wine me up
With your nights, watch me coming
All I want is a whole lot of excess
Tell the singer this is where I'm playing
Stand back, Buenos Aires
Because you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality

And if ever I go too far
It's because of the things you are
Beautiful town, I love you
And if I need a moment's rest
Give your lover the very best
Real eiderdown and silence

You're a tramp, you're a treat
You will shine to the death, you are shoddy
But you're flesh, you are meat
You shall have every breath in my body
Put me down for a lifetime of success
Give me credit, I'll find ways of paying

Florida, Corrientes, Nueve de Julio
All I want to know

Stand back, Buenos Aires
Because you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me
Just a little touch of
Just a little touch of
Just a little touch of star quality
I don't expect my love affairs to last for long
Never fool myself that my dreams will come true
Being used to trouble I anticipate it
But all the same I hate it, wouldn't you?

[Eva & Ché]
So what happens now?
Another suitcase in another hall
So what happens now?
Take your picture of another wall
Where am I going to?
You'll get by, you always have before
Where am I going to?

Time and time again I've said that I don't care
That I'm immune to gloom, that I'm hard through and through
But every time it matters all my words desеrt me
So anyone can hurt me, and thеy do

[Eva & Ché]
So what happens now?
Another suitcase in another hall
So what happens now?
Take your picture of another wall
Where am I going to?
You'll get by, you always have before
Where am I going to?
Call in three months time and I'll be fine, I know
Well maybe not that fine, but I'll survive anyhow
I won't recall the names and places of each sad occasion
But that's no consolation here and now

[Eva & Starlets]
So what happens now?
Another suitcase in another hall
So what happens now?
Take your picture of another wall
Where am I going to?
You'll get by, you always have before
Where am I going to?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Consider your girlfriend borrowed
Holla at her tomorrow
She say that I go harder
Good-good brain, the girl way smarter
No disrespect, that's someone's daughter
So happy that I caught her
Got a room at the Ramata
And I heard that homegirl swallow (Break bread)
Old school like the 

[?]
Imma fuck all her partners
All her homegirls' slaughter
But you spoil her like a father
It's Gucci 2 times, I can pull 2 dimes at the same time, take her to the same place
Get married and divorced in the same day
Make her hate me in the worst way

[Verse 2: Calico Jonez]
They say that opposites attract
And I knew the first time we laid eyes on each other, you would be my girl, and that's facts
She from the other side, when I say other side, I mean the other side
We on the Boulevard, we in the Avenue
We ain't havin it, we went trappin it
Where the action at
Treat your chick like she my bitch, we got that dope connection
She only trip and start to bitch when she need some effection
And I pull up to her lunch break
And I lift her skirt and I eat the box
And her legs shake and yell checkmate
And I roll out and go get it
She got a couple girls hating on me, probably cause I hit it
But we never had a commitment
See we was really only kicking it
They was tryna be on different shit
And I was only tryna chill
But with you

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

Wake and bake, early morning she roll my swishers
She ain't know about that freak I unleash in her
Was a schoolgirl, now she gone naughty
Cause I get up in that pussy, go retarded
And all the hoes on me
Smelled 'em from the start, I was in the streets
She wasn't even down for the lame shit, girl
Infatuated with a G
Said her boyfriend was like Carlton Banks
I'm from the hood, shawty what you think?
And oh, girl, fo' sho' girl
I have you trappin on the low girl
I stash that work up in your whip, and you ain't know girl
I have your ass doing everything, I give you game, cause I don't want you lames

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Ayy, ayy, I'm drippin' again
The way that I drip this shit should be a sin
Ayy, ayy, divorce all my friends
I'm not a Migo, 'bout to trap out the Benz
Ayy, they told me don't spend
I went got the racks and I did it again
Ayy, I think she a twin
Plus she got red calamari skin
Ayy, you don't got no wins
You should grab something white and just throw it on in
I went to school, got suspended
I told her I want some head, bobby pin
If the lil... don't got class, yeah, we call it truancy
I ain't had no money to spend
I got my first check and went paid off my rent

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith & Young Thug]
I poured a four from the clouds down
And my head floating in bliss (Goddamn)
I'm on the phone with big bro now (Damn)
He told me keep Benz on the race (Goddamn)
Until you see it like this, I promise man you'd never think it exists
Straight out a jet to the crib, I'm quick with the switch
Man we never miss, okay (God)
'Bout to turn up in the club, man, back the fuck up
We ain't takin' no pictures
See all the wings in the front, it's us
We had to triple the digits
See all those sexy mamas blowing kisses, man
We had to grant all they wishes (We grants-)
Casamigos got me spinnin'
But I want some spendin' some out wit' some dealers
Let's go (Goddamn)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'm rocking Dior Sauvage (Damn)
I'm higher than Scotty, they calling me Pippen (God)
I got some Cartier vision, it costs me six thousand
I'm watchin' these women
Money's the reason I'm sinning
Money's the reason I gotta take Ritalin
You niggas don't care 'bout women
Just shut the fuck up, bitch, I'm taking care plenty
I put Chanel on a belt buckle, of when my price is half off
I keep a stick for my cover, got way more girls than Hugh Hefner
Got the same name as the butler
But more money than Ashley and her mother
Got a backwood full of sherbert, I'm 'bout to smoke like a murder

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Ayy, ayy, I'm dripping again

That's like 25 racks and we always on a roll
Man, we always working, let's go

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Ay, let me pour up some Act, got some brand new graffiti
It's going down my back
I got Chanel slippers, Gucci pennies, baby, girl, you can pick
Rocking Giuseppe Zanotti's a night
I spent half a million designer on kits
Babygirl coochie is so tight, you gotta finger her shit with a stick
I got so high, went off the equator, I feel like Buzz Lightyear
I met a broad, skinny like nails, and I was richer than ice cream
I had to grind without a rail, now all my cars got Nitron
Trip to Dubai, I feel like the mail, I was on a Global Express

I got supply

Trip to Dubai, I feel like the mail, I was on a Global Express
I'm in London, got my beat from London
There again I've more to do
Than simply get the message through
I haven't started
Let's get this show on the road
Let's make it obvious
Peron is off and rolling

Eyes, hair, mouth, figure
Dress, voice, style, movement
Hands, magic, rings, glamour
Face, diamonds, excitement, image

I came from the people, they need to adore me
So Christian Dior me from my head to my toes
I need to be dazzling, I want to be Rainbow High
They must have excitement, and so must I

Eyes, hair, mouth, figure
Dress, voice, style, image

I'm their product, it's vital you sell me
So Machiavell me, make an Argentine Rose
I need to be thrilling, I want to be Rainbow High
They need their escape, and so do I
Eyes, hair, mouth, figure
Dress, voice, style, movement
Hands, magic, rings, glamour
Face, diamonds, excitement, image

All my descamisados expect me to outshine the enemy
I won't disappoint them

I'm their savior, that's what they call me
So Lauren Bacall me, anything goes
To make me fantastic, I have to be Rainbow High
In magical colors
You're not decorating a girl for a night on the town
And I'm not a second-rate queen getting kicks with a crown

Next stop will be Europe
The Rainbow's gonna tour, dressed up, somewhere to go
We'll put on a show
Look out, mighty Europe
Because you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me
Just a little touch of
Just a little touch of
Argentina's brand of star quality
Evita Peron, Partido Feminista
Evita Peron, Partido Feminista
Evita Peron, Partido Feminista

Peron is everything, he is the soul, the nerve
The hope and the reality of the Argentine people
We all know that there is only one man in our movement
With his own source of light
We all feed from his light, and that is Peron

Evita Peron, Partido Feminista
Evita Peron, Partido Feminista
Evita Peron, Partido Feminista

And now she wants to be Vice-Presidеnt
That was the over-the-top, unaccеptable suggestion
We didn't approve but we couldn't prevent
The games of the wife of the President
But to give her pretensions encouragement
She's out of her depth and out of the question
Doo doo whop oh oh
Doo doo whop oh
Doo doo whop

Doo doo whop oh oh
Doo doo whop oh
Doo doo whop

And I stop myself before the crime

I don't wanna push you way too much
I don't wanna lean that way too far
I don't wanna ever learn the hard way

Dry your tears now, don't you cry
I'm by your side, at least for a while

I don't wanna push you way too much
I don't wanna lean that way too far
I don't wanna ever learn the hard way, no
I don't wanna keep you in the dark
I don't wanna gamble with your heart
I don't wanna ever leave you lonely

[Chorus]
But if you're looking for stable, that'll never be me
If you're looking for faithful, that'll never be me
If you're looking for someone to be all that you need
That'll never be me

That'll never be me

I met a child a year ago
Whose eyes would never see
She asked me with a timid smile
"What colour is a tree?"

"In summertime a tree is green;
In autumn gold and red;
In winter they are frosted white
When all their leaves are shed."

"I know the sky is blue," she said
"And silver is the sand;
And apples are the brightest red
What colour is a man?"

"Man is many colours child:
Some are yellow, some are brown
And some are black as sightlеssness
Some white as еiderdown."

She took her crayons from a box
And placed them in my glove
And said, "By mixing all of these
Comes my favourite colour--love."
The actress hasn't learned the lines you'd like to hear
She's sad for her country, sad to be defeated
By her own weak body

(Evita! Evita! Evita! Evita!)

I want to tell the people of Argentina
I've decided I should decline
All the honors and titles you've pressed me to take
For I'm contented
Let me simply go on as the woman who brings her people
To the hеart of Peron

Don't cry for me Argentina
Thе truth is I shall not leave you
Though it may get harder for you to see me
I'm Argentina, and always will be

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Testing me, take 'em wunna sunna
Got taste of the-
And the thing is that, y'all are just wasting me
That's just wasting me
That's just a waste of time
Save my sunna I saved design
That Ye design
Niggas tryna tell me I'm crazy now
They don't understand
They just following the stream
They wunna sunn sunn, they were fucking up the dream
They were fucking up the dreams
Tryna get into the stream
They gone f-, they gone fuck up everything
Holy jeans, they ain't showing anything
Everything, everything, everything
Gold seams, can't be shown so it seems
So it brings
Making plans together with the golden team
Holding hands, that's the dream

[Verse 2: Ant Clemons]
She want me, she want uh- me
She want take control, she taught me
She want- Shh, shh, shh
She want thee
She want ABC but got D
She want everything, she want me
When she pop- Pop, pop, pop, she popped D
Anyway, she know that c'est la vie
Then she left, one and six and all three
Now that she's lost it
She went and called me, she want me
She told me that she wouldn't leave and caught me
I can't believe that- that she really caught me
And I just be talking all like Yeezy taught me
Then she got breezy on me (Ooh)
Now she got me sneezing in Bali
I was saying Yeezy taught me
Like it ain't been easy on me
She ain't rolling with me just to roll, man
Like y'all ain't put your ass behind bars, man
It ain't looking good lately
She know we been in on some mayday
Shit been looking bad we in some mad days
Backing that pussy back onto Melee
Blocka, blocka that's not the right way
Celebrate, that's a Ye day
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?
Yeah, I heard you said I ain't the type for you
I don't regret it though, I learned from it
They should have you locked up for all the time you stole from us
Took you out when I had no money
Only person that you ever cared about was you, that's why it's so funny
You want somebody that'll keep you warm at night, then tell me, why you actin' cold to me?
You ain't the only one to blame, no
I'm the one that made you rich when I bought every lie you sold to me
Yeah, heard you threw away the pictures
But you still got the memories of us, so I guess that don't really make a difference
Flippin' through 'em in your head
Got you texting me all hours any night
Yeah, you told me that you needed distance
What's the deal with you?
You say you want a man that keeps it real
Then why you mad when I get real with you?
You want someone to pay the bills for you
Went from feelin' you, now I feel for you, liar
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?
Look, let me guess, you want to stay friends?
Tellin' people that's how we been?
Tellin' everybody, yeah that we was barely speakin'
All this kinda funny, why'd you call me every day then?
It's immaturity, you goin' off the deep end
You just want somebody you can chill and get some drinks with, cool
Then don't hit me on the weekend, tellin' me
You missed the way we talked and how I listen, yeah
Why you playin' with my mind, huh?
Why you playin' with my time, huh?
Told me we should let it go and put it all behind us
That's what I did, now you askin' me what I done, I was
Waitin' for this day, I saw it comin'
I think you just like attention, tryna tell me all your problems
I got issues of my own, I ain't got time for all this drama
You told me that you don't really wanna talk, then why you callin', huh?
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?
How you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that?
Baby how you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that?
How you gonna lie, baby, how you gonna lie like that?
No, no, how you gonna lie like that?
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?
Tell me how you 'bout to lie like that
Tell me how you 'bout to lie like that

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Will help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And now I've gone and lost the best baby that I ever had

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

Sweetness
On the rips of your old dress
Twilight
On the banks of the warm fire

Whispers in the dark they hit the trees
Run into your heart to find mama's sleeves
Daddy ain't awake and daylight's gone
Afraid of the dark, you think of mama's bones

Cause I can't live like this
I heard your mama cry
Behind the door I'm listening
She said she's gonna fly
With words your mouth she's kissing

She said oh, child
Your back is straight
Don't let hurt curve ya that way
And I said
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Sweetness
On the ribs of your bare chest
Twilight
On the roof of that snowy night

You ran outside without your boots on
You could be lost, you'd find yourself at home
Well, mama's house is up on the sunrise
Sweet good god, just take me by surprise

Cause I can't live like this
Cause I heard your mama cry
Behind the door I'm listening
She said she's gonna fly
With words your mouth she's kissing

And she said oh, child
Your back is straight
Don't let her curve ya that way

But I said "mama, please take me home"
Said, "I can't stand bein' alone
Cause the pain is shooting down my spine again"
I said, "Daddy's feeling sick
Oh, I think he's gonna quit"
Sweetness
On the mouth of your caress
Twilight
Past the stars of that open night

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Man, fuck that bitch, came back to my senses
Two-tone Chevy, came back to the Benz
S550, that's for Kenny, lil’ bitch
Stop posting these niggas that's dead if we did it
I'm pulling up red cup shawty
Killing my haters, these niggas not dead enough for me
I don’t want your bitch, lil' shawty ain't slick
She don't lick, she don't suck or give head enough for me
I got these big ass rocks
Flew her to the city, fucked me and my mans, she a big-ass thot
Thick-ass top
Sliding my tip in her rich-ass slick-ass mouth
All of my niggas, we bucking, I don't even know the word ducking
Bitch, you got budget, I up it
She wanna fuck, too scary to touch it
Put black in her tunnеl, I'm Harriet Tubman
Got Maybach to Maybach, I'm balling on niggas
That’s payback to payback on all of my bitches
I make thеm wait for the plate
Bought me a car with a stick just to stall it on niggas
Bought me a new FN, shawty came, bought me a new best friend
Hit ’em both and didn't know they looked like twins (Ho, holy fuck, I just fucked off her brederen)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Walmart sheets, she wanna fuck in ’em, yeah
Tig ol' bitties, I wanna touch on 'em, yeah
And she got some ass too, damn, bring it to me
Too much talking when it's lit, bitch, shut the fuck up

[Verse 2: 42 Dugg]
Bitch, get off my dick
Rich young nigga still turnt from the 6

Fuck her, fuck her, once I get the head, it's fuck her
Doing this ten years straight like Mustard
Rose-gold Cuban on the neck, new money

Young dawg keep coming, I see you

Shit, ain't worried now, get stretched

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Walmart sheets, she wanna fuck in 'em, yeah
Tig ol' bitties, I wanna touch on 'em, yeah
And she got some ass too, damn, bring it to me
Too much talking when it's lit, bitch, shut the fuck up

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
I don't wanna talk no more, it is my time to shine
Forty million dollar advance, nigga, it is my time to sign
Bitch, get the fuck out of my light, this is my time to shine, man
Shawty keep talking that this and that ya-ya-ya, lil' bitch, my time to shine, man
Niggas in trouble, now they paying me double
Fresh Air Force, couldn't pay me to scuff 'em
Dead Benjamin head sitting in the duffle
When they sent me upstate and I was getting in a tussle
Hopping on the PJ, going out to PF
Hopping out to London just to see Steph
Yeah, I know I'm young, but I could fuck you like a DF
Boy, you finna die, you take three steps
I was getting money out the league
Back when Lil P and Lil J and Lil Fresh was hitting B&E coming out the scene
Blue bill hundreds bitches coming out the jeans
Blew it at booby trap, fuck it, I redeem
Got my cash up, yeah, now a nigga thumbing through the green
Last song, told you that my face wasn't in it
If you caught a nigga cheating then fuck what it seem
Mojo back, bitch, ow, I might bring back Cristal
Might stop telling these niggas my moves, they taking my groove, bitch, how? Give that man back his style
That's my dawg and we still share clothes, he can rock my chain, let me bust that Rollie
One thing we don't argue about bitches, we ain't finna fallout about hoes

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Walmart sheets, she wanna fuck in 'em, yeah
Tig ol' bitties, I wanna touch on 'em, yeah
And she got some ass too, damn, bring it to me
Too much talking when it's lit, bitch, shut the fuck up

[Verse 1]
Summertime
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton, the cotton is high

[Verse 2]
Oh, your daddy, he's rich
And your ma, she's good lookin'
So hush, little baby
Don't you cry

[Refrain]
One of these mornings
You're gonna rise up singing
You gonna spread your wings
And take, and take to the sky
Until that morning
Ain't nothing can harm you
With daddy and mammy standing by

[Outro]
Standing by
Standing by, little baby
Standing by

[Verse 1]
Would you believe me now if I told you I got caught up in a wave?
Almost gave it away
And would you hear me out if I told you I was terrified for days?
Thought I was gonna break

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I couldn't stop it
Tried to slow it all down
Crying in the bathroom
Had to figure it out
With everyone around me saying
"You must be so happy now"

[Chorus]
Oh, but if you keep reaching out
Then I'll keep coming back
But if you're gone for good
Then I'm okay with that
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on
Oh I am finding out
There's just no other way
And I'm still dancing at the end of the day
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leavе the light on

[Verse 2]
Do you believе me now that I always had the best intentions, babe?
Always wanted to stay
And can you feel me now that I'm vulnerable in oh so many ways?
Oh and I'll never change

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I couldn't stop it
Had to figure it out
But everything kept moving
The noise got too loud
With everyone around me saying
"You should be so happy now"

[Chorus]
Oh, if you keep reaching out
Then I'll keep coming back
But if you're gone for good
Then I'm okay with that
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on (Oh)
And I am finding out
There's just no other way
And I'm still dancing at the end of the day
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on

[Bridge]
I'll leave the light on
Oh, would you leave the light on?

[Chorus]
But if you keep reaching out
Then I'll keep coming back
But if you're gone for good
Then I'm okay with that
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on (Oh)
And I am finding out
There's just no other way
And I'm still dancing at the end of the day
If you leave the light on
I'll leave the light on

Oh, if you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on
Oh, if you leave the light on

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get a little too hurt
Got my mind going places it ain't wanna go
Sometimes I get a little too loved
And I can't see myself through the fire and smoke
And you, like a neon light
Shining through a door that I can't keep closed
You were like a rolling stone
Always built a city along the rocks that you broke

[Chorus]
And in my head, I did my very best singing goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you
But I think that you don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I stay up all night
'Cause you don't ever talk to me in my dreams
And I think about eventually, you're old to me
And dancing to the record like a moviе scene

[Chorus]
And in my head, I did my vеry best singing goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you
But I think that you don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Sometimes I get a little too hurt
Got my mind going places it ain't wanna go

[Chorus]
And in my head, I did my very best singing goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you
But I think that you don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high

[Verse 1]
Hello
The sun, it brings the shady people
A crowded room where nobody goes
You can be whoever you wanna be here
And oh, I've been living at the Chateau
Shouldn't drive, but I should really go home
I don't even know 'em, but they won't leave here

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Frightened by my own reflection
Desperate for a new connection
Hold you in, but don't you get too close
Love you now, but not tomorrow
Wrong to steal, but not to borrow
Pull you in, but don't you get too close

[Chorus]
I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleeding
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night (All night)
Lost in black hole conversations
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night

[Post-Chorus]
I just wanna feel (Feel)
I just wanna feel something (Feel something now)
But I keep feeling nothing all night long
(All night long, all night long, all night long)

[Verse 2]
Hello (hello)
I'll tell you all the people I know (I know)
Sell you something that you already own (You own)
I can be whoever you want me to be

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Love me now, but not tomorrow
Fill me up, but leave me hollow
Pull me in, but don't you get too close (Oh)

[Chorus]
I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleeding
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night (All night)
Lost in black hole conversations
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night

[Post-Chorus]
I just wanna feel (Feel)
I just wanna feel something (Feel something now)
But I keep feeling nothing all night long

[Break]
All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long

[Chorus]
I've been California dreamin' (Dreamin')
Plastic hearts are bleeding
Keep me up all night (Yeah)
Keep me up all night (All night)
Lost in black hole conversations
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (Oh yeah)
Keep me up all night

[Outro]
I just wanna feel (Feel)
I just wanna feel something (Feel something now)
But I keep feeling nothing, all night long

[Verse 1]
I woke up in Montecito
I was thinking about my life
And the questions made more questions
Staring out into the night
Yes, I've worn the Golden G String
Put my hand into hellfire
I did it all to make you love me
And to feel alive

[Chorus]
Oh, that's just the world that we're living in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playing gin
You dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay

[Verse 2]
There are layers to this body
Primal sex and primal shame
They told me I should cover it
So I went the other way
I was trying to own my power
Still I'm trying to work it out
And at least it gives the paper something
They can write about

[Chorus]
And oh, that's just the world that we're living in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playing gin
And you dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay

[Bridge]
So the mad man is in the big chair
And his heart's an iron vault
He said "If you can't make ends meet, honey, it must be your fault"
We all focus on the winners
And get blinded by their shine
Maybe caring for each other is just too 1969

[Chorus]
But oh, that's just the world that we're living in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playing gin
And you dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away, oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay

[Outro]
But I think I'll stay
Too much, you say
But I think I'll stay
I can't walk away
I think I'll stay
Yeah, I think I'll stay

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name, only baby
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right

[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down hell with me
I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la
I'm everything they said I would be

[Verse 2]
I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you tonight
Your mama says you don't look happy
Close your eyes

[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down hell with me
I'm everything they said I would be

[Bridge]
La la la
La la la la
La la la
Oh-ah-ah
Ah, oh

[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything (Everything)
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down hell with me, oh

[Outro]
Angels like you can't fly down hell with me

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Certain shit I don't need to say
Certain shit ain't no need to say
Yeah, big chasers, big chasers
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, woo

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Hood nigga, choppa to the jet, shit like GTA
Fly them hoes out, send a Caddy, what's the ETA?
Fuckin' on this oiled lightskin bitch, look like Lisa Ray
Niggas say it's up with me, it's stuck with me, shit, either way
Watching all you weirdos on the 'Gram, it ain't no need to say
Who the realest in this shit? I took a stance to lead the way
I don't want no smoke with you, I see you, you 'gon plead your case
'Cause my nigga 'gon go at you, and I'm 'gon tell him, "Bleed the brakes" (Brr)
Yeah, brand new F and N, it ain't no checkin' in
I told the promoter, "Wе can't bring them drums, then we ain't stеppin' in"
No rollin' over, we got lawyer money, don't do no questionin'
Magnolia soldier, we gon' make it clap, shooters like Stephen and we Warriors
Comin' down Collins, 'bout to fuck Story up
Wake up in Cali, bad bitch, Waldorf Astoria
Fly her to Bali, she ain't tripping, she on the tour with us
Poppin' that pussy, actin' different, she doin' more for us (She acting different-different)
Big racks, we got that bitch tweakin', yeah
Spin back, we 'bout to get even, yeah (Brr)
Niggas said it ain't no smoke with me, you better leave it there
'Cause every city y'all niggas be poppin' out, I put it even there, for real
Ooh (Brr-brr), I turned shorty up
Sipping on that 1942, I got my .40 tucked
Oh, you got your .40 too? Nigga, I got 40 of 'em
I rock Carties, you can't see my eyes 'cause I be pouring up
RIP my young boy, Dex Osama, hit my shawty up
Told me never trust a stripping bitch 'cause that's what caught him up
Every time you catch me in some shit, it cost like four and up
Caught your homie lackin' at the light, so shit, we tore it up
Feds came and grabbed you 'bout them bricks, that's when he brought me up (Yeah, yeah)
(Feds came and grabbed him 'bout them bricks, that's when he brought me up, ayy)

[Verse 2: 42 Dugg]
I been riding with choppas ever since, I'm glad you brought him up
RIP my uncle, free my youngin, bitch, we Audi-ed up
I heard you fucked around, I'm fuckin' now, I like to pass shit
I hit sixty out of sixty-two, I'm talking bad bitches
I talk cash shit, I like to crash shit, I'm five in 'em
Fast whips, I might go Lamb' truck
I'm blowing it out if I get jammed up, them niggas ran, what?
Threw his shit back if he ran up, Meek ask cuz
I make it jump then get it gone, nigga, ask Bud
I got his bitch singing my songs and she half-Blood
I'm half-rapper, whole-trapper, I got bad luck
Turn into Mamba when it's drama, I don't pass much
I post dawg and get cutty, I'ma Shaq somethin' (Yeah)
And every time we double back, my niggas whack somethin' (Yeah)
I ain't been selling too much crack, bitch, I got racks comin'
Tell my bitch I love her
And if you catch her cheating, nigga, tell that bitch it's "Fuck her"

[Outro: 42 Dugg]
Who ain't out here eating? Nigga, I can't wait to up it
Bitch-ass niggas
Free them boys

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, woo

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
We was in the trenches tryna get it out the mud
Lookin' up to killers tryna figure who I was
Sold the Richard Porter, I just wanna feel the love
I feel like a Crip 'cause I can't even trust my blood (Blood)
Loyalty (You know what loyalty is?), I say, "Spoil me"
You ain't my dawg, you fallin' out about no lawyer fee (No lawyer fee)
You had a brick and I ain't even have a quarter key
You never seen my hand out, I knew it was more to me
It's more than us to see our sons and all our daughters eat
'Cause I got cops tryna lock me, opps out tryna slaughter me
But I stay prayed up, loadin' all these K's up
'Cause I ain't get advicе from all them nights back when I stayed up
Don't hit mе 'bout no show if you ain't come to set the stage up
We God body, threw a thousand shots, they barely grazed us
And I can't let 'em make my grave up

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I just hope this money take the pain away
And I've been tryna save my money for a rainy day
But I just bought that Rolls truck to take the pain away
And all these diamonds give me confidence
Don't judge my pain if you don't know the shit that I'm against, ayy

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
The Percocet'll take your pain away (Pain away)
One nigga tellin' will take the gang away (The gang away)
Washin' blood with bleach don't wash the stain away (The stain away)
Seen my brother die, he died the strangest way (Stranger way)
Hangin' with the real, won't hang with lames today (Lames today)
Bein' counted out, I had to make a way (Make a way)
Snaked by one of my dawgs, I had to stay away (Stay away)
Millions dollar cash put up for a rainy day (Rainy day)
For a rainy
Durkio, I'm different with it (Different with it)
I praise the trenches like I ain't lose none of my niggas in it (Niggas in it)
I pray my daughter don't go through what I go with different women (Different women)
And I'm talking 'bout all the different niggas (Different niggas)
And I don't get these niggas (Get these niggas)
Why these niggas tryna hang like they ain't lynchin' niggas? (They ain't lynchin' niggas)
The opposition be sayin' my name, tryna get attention with it (Get attention with it)
I know an opp, he was suspect, now he a victim with it (Victim with it)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I just hope this money take the pain away
And I've been tryna save my money for a rainy day
But I just bought the Rolls truck to take the pain away
And all these diamonds give me confidence
Don't judge my pain if you don't know the shit that I'm against, ayy

[Intro: Vory]
It's too much, too much, too much, yeah
Tell ’em, ayy

[Chorus: Vory]
Girl, just leave me in silence
Just got a call from all my niggas, said they still 'bout it
Closest homie turned his back, we gotta kill 'bout it
Even though it hurt my soul, act like I don’t care about it
Nigga, fuck this rap shit, ain't no cap shit
I was rich before this rap shit, fuck a caption
And your nigga said he want action, so he get clapped quick
Fuck around and name that Nina Brad Pitt, 'cause he an actress and I'm a savage
Pussy, hmm

[Post-Chorus: Vory]
Think it's a game until they holdin' onto your brains and shit, do you?
Ayy
Think it's a game, nothin' do you?
Think it’s a game, yeah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
My homie turned his back on me, I don’t know how to feel about it
'Cause I get deep in my feelings and I won’t kill 'bout it
'Cause niggas be knowin' my business and don’t be real solid
I got rеal problems
Made my list for the hoеs that flex, went back and still popped them
Coon been holding this shit down ten, went in my will bout' it
Ain't seen my cousin like six months but still gon' drill 'bout him
He in those trenches and I can't act like I don't care 'bout it
This shit a war
Nigga, I'm the plug, ain't no extension cord
Headshots soon as I spin the block, fuck you sent 'em for?
Like you ain't know we stand on opps, sent 'em to the Lord
Look 'em in they eyes 'til they die, without no feelings for 'em

[Verse 2: Vory]
Yeah
I done seen a couple M's at 22, nigga who the fuck is you?
You say you got shooters with you?
Well, I got shooters too
All my niggas missin' screws
All they know is shoot
He a killer but is aim off
So we must recruit
That niggas tryin' me and mob, bitch I'm tyin' boots, yeah
They tellin' everything but the truth
Don't need no soldiers talkin' for me, baby I'm a troop
Done named my shooter Stephen Curry, all he know is shoot, yeah
I'm talkin' close range
Say your niggas out here wildin', we on the same thing, yeah
We on the same thing
His pain is my pain, we got the same pain

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Glock .40 help me, sleep better
Know where you live, know where I live
So we could creep better
Go get your gun, I make my gun turn you to three letters
And have your soul forever rest in peace
No, we better than that
New Berettas and MACs
New vendettas attached
And we can't never get back
Now you can never relax
You gotta forever be strapped, pussy
In the valleys of the shadows of death
Will the reaper be regained?
We never pressed to play them
Clubs on the weekend 'cause that's gon' lead us only
Thuggin' and beefin' with some lil' niggas that's beneath us
Probably ain't even eatin', that's lose-lose
We kill ten of y'all, we ain't even either
You niggas jealous

[Chorus: Vory]
You just left me in silence
Just got a call from all my niggas, said they still 'bout it
Closest homie turned his back, we gotta kill 'bout it
Even though it hurt my soul, act like I don't care about it
Nigga, fuck this rap shit, ain't no cap shit
I was rich before this rap shit, fuck a caption
And your nigga said he want action, so he get clapped quick
Fuck around and name that nigga Brad Pitt, 'cause he an actress and I'm a savage
Pussy, hmm

Think it's a game until they holdin' onto your brains and shit, do you?
Ayy
Think it's a game, nothin' do you?
Think it's a game, yeah

[Verse 1]
Listen to the words coming out of my mouth (My mouth)
You can keep rushing in and out of my house (Revolving door)
Tell a bitch she should be heading down south (Chirp chirp)
With the rest of the birds, cause she don't get no more words

[Pre Chorus]
You are, you were my horseshoe charm (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You are, you were that tattoo on my arm
Sitting up in my face, lying up and down something you can't do (Can't do)
Acting like I'm making up this whole thing like it ain't true (Ain't true)
What you think I can't see you with my own eyes oh like it ain't you (Ain't you)
Hey I got your number and your colors yes I could paint (Paint you)

[Chorus]
Just stop, you're making it worse
Go too hard or too far and you act like it's all ok
Be quiet, cause this really hurts
Go too hard or too far and you act like it's all ok
Just stop (Just stop), you're making it worse
Go too hard or too far and you act like it's all ok
Be quiet, cause this really hurts
Go too hard or too far and you act like it's all ok

Why you gotta push it so far to the limit (Yeah)
Leaving my mind spiraling, going a mile a minute (Yeah)
Everything happened like I told you it would, now it didn't (Now it didn't)
Now we're here arguing when daddy came to visit

You are, you were my horseshoe charm (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

I'm talking, I'm talking
I believe in the power of love
I'm singing, I'm singing
I believe that you can rescue me

[Verse 1]
With you I'm not a little girl, with you I'm not a man
When all the hurt inside of me comes out, you understand
You see that I'm ferocious, you see that I am weak
You see that I am silly, and pretentious, and a freak
But I don't feel too strange for you
Don't know exactly what you do
I think when love is pure you try
To understand the reasons why
And I prefer this mystery
It cancels out my misery
And gives me hope that there could be
A person that loves me

[Chorus]
Rescue me (Rescue me, it's hard to believe)
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me (Rescue me, it's hard to believe)
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope

[Verse 2]
With you I'm not a fascist, can't play you like a toy
And when I need to dominate, you're not my little boy
You see that I am hungry for a life of understanding
And you forgive my angry little heart when she's demanding
You bring me to my knees while I'm scratching out the eyes
Of a world I want to conquer, and deliver, and despise
And right while I am kneeling there
I suddenly begin to care
And understand that there could be
A person that loves me

[Chorus]
Rescue me (Rescue me, it's hard to believe)
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me (Rescue me, it's hard to believe)
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope

Rescue me

That's right
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
Talk to me, tell me your dreams
Am I in them?
Tell me your fears
Are you scared?
Tell me your stories
I'm not afraid of who you are
We can fly!
Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depеnd
On the permission of another
Lovе me, that's right, love me
I want to be your baby
Yeah

[Outro]
My love
To justify my love
My love
To justify my love
My love
To justify my love

You ain't even ever had a opp 

[?] caught up with no nigga
You ain't ever made...

[Verse 1]
Climb aboard a butterfly and take off on the breeze
Let your worries flutter by and do the things you please
In a land where dollar bills are falling off the trees
On a dreamer's holiday

[Verse 2]
Every day for breakfast there's a plate of scrambled stars
And for lunching you'll be munching rainbow candy bars
You'll be living à la mode on Jupiter and Mars
On a dreamer's holiday

[Chorus]
Make it a long vacation
Time, there is plenty of
You need no reservation
Just bring along the one you love

[Verse 3]
Help yourself to happiness, sprinkle it with mirth
Closе your eyes and concentratе
And dream for all you're worth
You will feel terrific when you get back down to earth
From a dreamer's holiday

[Intro]
Crime, crime, crime, crime
Crime, crime, crime, crime
Crime, crime, crime, crime
Crime, crime, crime, crime, crime

[Verse]
Just you and me, caught in the sheets
My heart's unlocked, you got the key
It's kind of wrong, the things we've done
We hit and run, if anyone knew

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I really need to know that we're cool
And this will stay between me and you
If you can keep a secret, I will show you things that I won't even say out loud

[Chorus]
What we do is no one elsе business
There's no proof, and thеre's no witness
Nobody knows and nobody gets hurt
It's a victimless crime, yeah
What we do is no one else business
There's no proof, and there's no witness
Nobody knows and nobody gets hurt
It's a victimless crime, yeah, yeah, yeah
Victimless crime, yeah

[Outro]
Crime, crime, crime, crime, crime, crime

[Intro]
Ayy, KBeaZy, you fyed up
Yeah

[Chorus]
I don't know why
But I ain't ever been good at goodbyes
Never saw no better signs
No, it never hit me right
Sometimes, I find myself stuck in denial
Waiting for someone to give me a sign
I don't know why
But I ain't ever been good at goodbyes
Never saw no better signs
No, it never hit me right
Sometimes, I find myself stuck in denial
Waiting for someone to give me a sign

[Verse]
You fuck me up every day
You'rе like a drug that I take, but I just can't get away
And you, makе me lose all my patience
Whenever I'm out of patience, even when I'm in my pay
I think I'm going insane, stuck between walls in my brain
And I'm at war with my brain, we battle every day
My mind in outer space, 'cause I ran out of space
Same shit, different day, I'm slowly driftin' away

[Chorus]
I don't know why
But I ain't ever been good at goodbyes
Never saw no better signs
No, it never hit me right
Sometimes, I find myself stuck in denial
Waiting for someone to give me a sign
I don't know why
But I ain't ever been good at goodbyes
Never saw no better signs
No, it never hit me right
Sometimes, I find myself stuck in denial
Waiting for someone to give me a sign

[Chorus]
It's been a minute now since I've been back to my hometown
Yeah, friends I don't even think about
Yeah, family that I couldn't live without-out
It's been a minute now since I've been back to my hometown (Yeah)
Took so long, tryna make it out
But I don't know how I can live without, live without, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I never thought I'd see myself where I am now
Been a while since I've seen my friends now
I'm in California, miles away from home
I'm getting rich but I'm still sad alone
Sometimes, I wonder if it's worth it
Turned into a whole different person
I'm about that life, evеry day, I'm working

[Chorus]
It's okay, okay to miss me
It's okay to say that you made a mistake
You loved me, love just don't fade away
It's okay, okay to miss me
It's okay, okay to miss me
It's okay to say that you made a mistake
You loved me, love just don't fade away
It's okay, okay to miss me

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
It's okay, okay to miss me
It's okay to say that you made a mistake
You loved me, love just don't fade away
It's okay, okay to miss me
It's okay, okay to miss me
It's okay to say that you made a mistake
You loved me, love just don't fade away
It's okay, okay to miss me

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Once again, I'm in trouble with my only friend
She is papering the windowpanes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glass house

[Verse 2]
And once again, packed like frozen food and battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones
Your royal highnesses

[Chorus]
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
But someone's listening in

[Verse 3]
Once again, we are hungry for a lynching
That's a strange mistake to make
You should turn the other cheek
Living in a glass housе

[Chorus]
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Wеll of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only, only...
There's someone listening in

[Intro]
Alright, I feel like rapping tonight, one time, now

[Verse]
I bought an old Rolls Royce in a color I didn't like
'Cause it was fresher than a Honda and faster than a bike
I coulda bought a new one but then I saw the price
And I was like: "Shit, that's a house in Fife"
I can't do that, that's like spending two racks
On a pair of SB dunks that Travis Scott wore once in a McDonald's food ad
Doesn't sit right like a white dude in a do-rag
With cornrows under a Fubu hat
Screaming suwoo fam
Who the fuck are you, damn
Go back to the burbs and chill on the YouTube chat
Back in my day you got jumped trying to do that
Curb stopped for the N-word, don't use that
The internet got everybody cozy
Likе in real life, you won't get sockеd in the dome piece
Tough in the bio when you wildin' with the homies
But deep down you're idle, tired, and lonely
Shit, I am too
The worlds in a shortage of real music, real people, real importance
Like God got drunk on a bunch of coronas
And ashed his backwood on a California forest
Shit, we're late on the mortgage
Praying for no more of the bigot in the orange wig
Anyone else, if we settle, we settle
Biden is better than the devil
It's easy to get apathetic to the moment we're having
And white supremacy loves it some white liberal pacifists
Oh, we can silence shit we've been silenced
And posting a black square doesn't make you an activist
Share your seat
Listen and take action
And be on the right side of history when your grandkids sit on your lap
And ask about how 2020 was
And you tell 'em it was fucked
But at least we stood up for somethin'
Police we defund and not expose the corrupt
The system should be up and cut and never return to what it was
To get to better days we gotta get through fucked up ones
And for the last 6 months we've been stuck in one
But I think it's changing all in all
Come November you better be putting your mask on
We gotta vote
I'm just like you,  no excuse
Schedule free 'cause I got no job to go to

[Outro]
2020
Woo!

[Spoken Intro]
We were at the end of the album and it was finished
And I already felt like I had my first single and everything
And we were like locked and loaded
And we were closing the joint up
And we just went in the studio for fun
And we went in there and there was this song
And I don't know where it came from
And still to this day I don't know where it came from
And it's a rare occasion that this happens
And by the end of thе song, this acoustic guitar came in
And it was somewherе, just felt like a huge release
I love an acoustic guitar
'Cause everything's gonna be alright
Do you believe it?
Know I believe it
Everything's gonna be alright, hey

[Verse 1]
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

[Verse 2]
When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright (Yes, it is)
People keep talking they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

[Bridge]
I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide, something so real
So 'til the end of time I'm telling you there ain't no one

[Chorus]
No one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
No one, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
No one can get in the way, not for a minute, baby
No one, no one, no one can get in the way of what I feel for you
Yeah
Thank you

[Spoken Intro]
Thank you so much
One, one, mmm

[Verse 1]
It's been a while
I'm not who I was before
You look surprised
Your words don't burn me anymore
Been meanin' to tell ya
But I guess it's clear to see
Don't be mad
It's just a brand new kinda me
Can't be bad
I found a brand new kind of free

Careful with your ego
He's the one that we should blame
Had to grab my heart back
God knows something had to change
I thought that you'd be happy
I found the one thing I need
Why you mad?
It's just a brand new kinda me
Never bad
I found a brand new kind of free

[Chorus]
It took a long, long time to get here
It took a brave, brave girl to try
It took one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, don't be surprised

[Verse 2]
If I talk a little louder
If I speak up when you're wrong
If I walk a little taller
I've been under you too long
If you notice that I'm different
Don't take it personally
Don't be mad
It's just a brand new kinda me
That ain't bad
I found a brand new kind of free

[Chorus]
Oh, it took a long, long road to get here
It took a brave, brave girl to try
I've taken one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, oh, said, you look surprised

[Bridge]
Hey, if you were a friend
You'd wanna get to know me again
If you were worth the while
You'd be happy to see me smile
I'm not expecting sorry
I'm too busy finding myself
I got this
I found me, I found me

[Verse 3]
I don't need your opinion
I'm not waiting for your "Okay"
I'll never be perfect
But at least now I'm brave
Now my heart is open
I can finally breathe
Don't be mad
It's just a brand new kind of free
That ain't bad
I found a brand new kinda me
Don't be mad
It's just a brand new time for me, yeah

[Outro]
Thank you so much
I love everybody
Thank you so so so so much
I love y'all, it's the truth
Thank you, guys

[Spoken Intro]
So, in the studio we were
And the dudes was on the mic
The one mic, right
And so we're like, "It's gotta be like a conversation, you know?
So how we gon' drop it?"
So, we're kinda freestylin' a couple of ideas
And my favorite word in the whole world is "Baby"
I put "baby" in a song any chance I get
"Baby" just sings good; you can sing "baby" in any way
I'll show you
See, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby — it just works, right?
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
See that one, I coulda done that one and made it work
But instead, you know, we said...

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, baby
From the day I saw you
I really really wanna catch your eye
There's something special 'bout you
And I must really like you
'Cause not a lotta guys are worth my time, no
Ooh baby, baby, baby
It's gettin' kind of crazy
'Cause you are takin' over my mind

[Chorus]
And it feels like ooh ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear it feels like ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
But you don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby baby baby
I see us on our first date
You're doin everything that makes me smile
And when we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
Ooh, it set my soul on fire
Oh, baby baby baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's runnin' wild

[Chorus]
It feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear, it feels like ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
But you don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)

[Bridge]
You see, he don't even know what he's doin' to me
He's got me feelin' all crazy inside
I mean, I'm feelin' like, oh, oh oh
Doin' more than I've ever done for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you
'Cause did I mention you're 'bout to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin'

[Chorus]
'Cause my lovin' feels like ooh ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear it, baby, it feels like ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
But you don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)

[Interlude]
So, then we got the part of all this talking, right?
So we decided, like
Kanye was like, "You know you're gonna have to talk on this record
You're gonna have to do it"
And I said, "You want me to get on the record and talk?"
He's like, "You know all the bad records..."
Like, bad, not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good
"...got talking on 'em. Like, if you bad, you stop and you talk, especially on these type of records"
So we're sitting there in the control room, and you know, we're vibing on some different things
I was like, "Yeah, okay, if you're in a diner, like, maybe he gets a special thing."
He's like, "Yeah, some hot chocolate."
And I'm like, "Um, and, you know, maybe like I put some extra something in there."
He's like, "Yes, yes, all that." And he's like, "Oh, oh, and you gotta tell him that, you know, you gotta meet him outside the restaurant 'cause you look better outside your work clothes."
And I was like, "Ah, okay. Well let me hop in the booth."
So I went in the booth — here go the booth
And, um, I just started freestylin'
I just started coming off of the top of my head
And I'm like, "Alright, well, let's get on the phone or something"
Like, "Hello? Oh, hey, how you doin'?
Um, you, you don't know me but I work at the,um, the diner on 137th and Lennox
Yeah, you know, the one with the braids?"
So I'm coming off the top of my head with all these things
I'm talking about the cream and the sugar inside the hot chocolate
And I'm going in, and I'm like, "Okay, hold up, I can't, wait, hello? Wait my phone breaking up, my phone, hello?
Oh, hey, how you doin'?"
'Cause, you know, when you finally get the nerve to call someone
If the phone breaks up, you feel crazy
You're like, "Don't, this was my chance"
So we did all of that and we finally end up like the guy's gonna meet me and we talk through the whole conversation
And I came out the booth and we did it two times
And I was like, "I think we got it"
And that was exactly how we did it, we just left it exactly how it was
And it's from top to bottom, talking all that thing
And the amount of hours that me and Peter spent editing that thing to make it good for radio, we won't even talk about it

[Outro]
And it feels like ooh ooh ooh ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh do do do do do do
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(Will you ever know?)
Will you ever know my name?
(Name)

Thank you
Let's do it like this

[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Now I put my little thing on it
Uh, yeah
Uh, uh-oh, come on, uh-oh, come on, yeah
Let's...
New York
New York

[Verse 1]
Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seein' my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway

[Hook 1]
Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are madе of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in Nеw York!
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York!

[Verse 2]
On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a meltin' pot, on the corner sellin' rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge

[Hook 2]
I'mma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York!

[Bridge]
One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
"Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah!"

[Hook 3]
In New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York!

[Outro]
New York City, yeah
Thank you

[Spoken Intro]
So, that's my favorite song
What's also my favorite song
Because my little boy, he asks me to sing it to him every night
And it's the cutest thing you've ever heard
He goes, "Mommy, King"

[Verse 1]
Money
Some people so poor; all that they've got is money
Oh, and diamonds
Some people waste their life counting their thousands

[Chorus]
I don't care what they're offering
How much gold they bring
They can't afford what we've got
Not even the king
They can't afford what we've got
Not even the king

[Verse 2]
Oh, castles
Some people so lonely; what good is a castle
Surrounded by people?
But ain't got a friend that's not on the payroll

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't care what they bring
They can have everything
They can't afford what we've got
Not even the king
They can't afford what we've got
Not even the king

[Bridge]
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Came charging to get what we got
They offered the crown and they offered the throne
I already got all that I want
All the king's horses and all the king's men
They came marching through
They offered the world just to have what we got
But I found the world in you
I found the world in you

[Verse 3]
So darling, listen:
Your arms around me worth more than a kingdom
Yeah, believe that
The trust that we feel the kings never felt that
Yeah, this is the song we sing
We don't need anything
And they can't afford this
This is priceless

[Outro]
Can't afford what we've got
Not even the king
Can't afford what we've got
Not even the king

[Spoken Intro]
Let's do it, yeah
Yeah
I, I, I...

[Verse 1]
I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With you
Sometimes I love ya
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin' you, darlin'
Makes me so confused

[Chorus]
I keep on
Fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And 'cause me so much pain
Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you

[Chorus]
I keep on
Fallin'
In and out of love with you
I nеver loved someonе
The way that I love you

[Bridge]
I wanna say that
I, I, I, I'm fallin' (Hey yeah)
I, I, I, I'm fallin' (Got me fall...)
Fall, fall, fall
Fall

[Chorus]
I keep on
Fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you
I keep on
Fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

[Outro]
I'm sayin'...
Fallin'

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Thank you
Ah man

[Intro]
Oh yeah
Oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

[Pre-Chorus]
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
But that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

[Chorus]
Some pеople want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some peoplе want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them
Listen, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, baby, yeah

[Outro]
If I ain't got you with me, baby
Ooh, nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby, yeah, hey

Thank you so much for such a beautiful greeting here
Thank you so much
It's my honor to be here with you tonight, I swear
It's my honor to see faces that know and love
Thank you for going down the journey with me
Different songs and different inspirations
Thank you for caring at all
Truly, I love you, and I'm blessed
I'm blessed by your love
I'm very grateful for this very intimate, beautiful night that we have
I'll never never forget it, I'll never forget this beautiful night
So thank you for being part of it

'Cause I really love you, baby
I really thank you so much for all you do
And all you give, and all you show
And every time you come and see me
I feel the love
I know that I don't got anything if I ain't got you
That's the truth, I'm tellin' you, 'cause
See, they may want diamonds, and pearls
And they may want cars and houses and all those kinda things
But I just want your love
And I just wanna be with you and
Hangin' out right here now, baby
Hangin' out right here now, baby
I...I ain't got you
(If I ain't got you)
If I ain't got you, baby, I don't want nothin', baby
(If I ain't got you) Oh oh oh oh, no
(If I ain't got you) If I ain't got you, you, you
If I ain't got you
If I ain't got you
If I ain't got you
If I ain't got you
If I ain't got you
You
Can you give it up for my band one time?
Beautiful job

[Spoken Intro]
We were in the studio and I said:
"What does a girl on fire sound like?"
Apparently it sounds something like this

This is called a CP-70
It's a very kinda old school keyboard, I love it very much
And this is featured on "Girl on Fire"

Yes, let me tell you

[Verse 1]
She's just a girl and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world and it's on fire
Filled with catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh
She's got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh oh oh oh oh
She got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down

[Chorus]
This girl is on firе
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on firе
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh
We got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
Oh

[Verse 3]
Everybody stares, as she goes by
'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her as she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby

[Chorus]
Girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh
She's just a girl and she's on fire

[Spoken Intro]
So it's a new day for me
And I've, you know, really been reflecting on that a lot
Just in my life, you know
I think that it's a new day for the world in so many ways
I mean, for me personally I've learned so many things
And I just really am kinda finding my center
Which feels really good, just finding my center
In regards to being the whole me
I think sometimes maybe we're like a portion of ourselves in a way
You know what I mean?
And I think I personally have been a portion of myself in a lot of ways for many years, just for different reasons, you know
But now, I feel like I've really stepped into my whole self
And so I'm proud to be in that place
So it's definitely a new day for me

So when I wrote this song
It was really about my own personal revolution, you know
Yeah
And it felt like a celebration, you know, 'cause it's like
When you find that place, that freedom
You gotta celebrate yourself, even in the smallest ways
And I realized when my son was born and I named him Egypt
I had no idea there was gonna be such a revolution in Egypt either, you know
So I found that it's really a revolution of the world in so many ways
And it's a new day for so many people
So, I made it feel good to say

[Chorus]
Party people say, party people say
Ayy, it's a new day, it's a new day
The world is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah
For a new day, for a new day
Celebrate and say, ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy, ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Celebrate and say, ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy, ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Come on

[Verse 1]
It's alright to feel however you want to
There's no limitation, no
If you love your life, let me see your hands up one time
Celebrate mine, 'cause I ain't gonna get no more
So we can do this all night
One time, everybody say ayy ayy oh (Oh oh)
There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming let the sun come up
Tell me do you feel the same, everybody say

[Chorus]
Party people say, party people say
Hey, it's a new day, it's a new day
The world is getting ready, everybody ready, ayy
For a new day, for a new day
Celebrate and say, ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy, ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy

[Bridge]
Take a look in my eyes, can't you see I'm ready?
Ayy, come along, let's get it, eh
If you wanna touch the sky, hands in the air one time
All night and all day
I'ma live it loud like there's only one life
Left to live it up, one life left to live it up

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming, let the sun come up
Tell me do you feel the same, everybody say

[Chorus]
Party people say, party people say
Hey, it's a new day, it's a new day
The world is getting ready, everybody ready, ayy
For a new day, for a new day
Celebrate and say, ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy, ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy

[Outro]
Yes
It is a new day
It's such a new day
It's the most newest day there ever was
Thank you

[Spoken Intro]
So, I wanted to play this song that I super love
This song actually also introduced me to this keyboard here
Which is now one of my favorites
Sounds like a little airplane

[Verse 1]
Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me

And all the time you were tellin' me lies, hey

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

[Post-Chorus]
Uh, yeah, uh, let's do it, baby
Let's do it, baby; let's do it, baby
Let's do it, do it

[Verse 2]
Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed
Lonely, on me, nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me, need me
I thought you told me you'd never leave me
Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me
You know that I'll always be in love with you
Right 'til the end, oh

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

[Bridge]
Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's 'bout to fall apart
So rather than hold onto a broken dream
I'll just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on, I'm gonna hold onto the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

[Interlude]
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, uh, uh
It's actually my favorite part of the song, when it breaks down
Uh, uh, uh

[Outro]
Ah, thank you, mmm

[Spoken Intro]
This next song is, like, one of my favorite, favorite songs
And um, this song ended up coming off soul conversation that was so intimate
Even the way that I sang on the mic
It was like maybe the lowest and the quietest that I ever sang
But it felt, like, so personal
And I wanted it to feel like I was just whispering in somebody's ear

And the question is: What are we waiting for?

[Verse 1]
Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right herе
And tell you all that comes to me
And if you havе something to say
You should say it right now
(You should say it right now)

[Pre-Chorus]
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

[Chorus]
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready)

[Verse 2]
I know you once said to me
"This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be"
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually?
'Cause if we gon' do something 'bout it
We should do it right now
(We should do it right now)
Bay, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

[Chorus]
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me, I'm ready
(I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready)
Yeah, yeah

[Interlude]
My favorite part is this bridge
Because we sat and we talked about what this meant for a while, you know
We spoke about, like, why give up before we try
So many times — how many times have we just count ourselves out before we even give it a chance?
You know, why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs, you know
We — everybody does that, I do that
Clip our wings before we fly away
We sat there and spoke about this bridge for a long time
To really get, like, that feeling, that feeling, yeah, uh
So this bridge is like my favorite in this song, I love where it goes
Say, say, say

[Bridge]
Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (Fly away)
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me

[Chorus]
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready)
Yeah, if you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready)
Oh yeah, if you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready
(I'm ready)

[Outro]
Thank you

[Intro]
Erotica, romance
My name is Dita
I'll be your mistress tonight
I'd like to put you in a trance

[Verse 1]
If I take you from behind
Push myself into your mind
When you least expect it
Will you try and reject it?
If I'm in charge
And I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild
Let my mouth go where it wants to?

[Pre-Chorus]
Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to
I'd like to put you in a trance
All over

[Chorus]
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic
Erotic

[Verse 2]
Once you put your hand in the flame
You can never be the same
There's a certain satisfaction
In a little bit of pain
I can see you understand
I can tell that you're the same
If you're afraid, well rise above
I only hurt the ones I love

[Pre-Chorus]
Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to
I'd like to put you in a trance
All over

[Chorus]
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic
Erotic

[Post-Chorus]
Erotica, romance
I'd like to put you in a trance
Erotica, romance
Put your hands all over my body

[Bridge]
I don't think you know what pain is
I don't think you've gone that way
I could bring you so much pleasure
I'll come to you when you say
I know you want me (I'm not gonna hurt you)
I'm not gonna hurt you, just close your eyes

[Chorus]
Erotic
Erotic
Erotic
Put your hands all over my body
All over me

[Post-Chorus]
Erotica (Give it up, give it up), romance
I'd like to put you in a trance
Erotica (Give it up, give it up), romance
I like to do a different kind of
Erotica (Give it up, give it up), romance
I'd like to put you in a trance
Erotica, romance
Put your hands all over my body

[Outro]
Only the one that hurts you
Can make you feel better
Only the one that inflicts pain
Can take it away
Eroti-ca

[Verse 1]
It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

[Verse 2]
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argеntina
The truth is I never lеft you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

[Verse 3]
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

[Outro]
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true

[Verse 1]
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

[Chorus]
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Verse 2]
Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the timе when Earth shall be as one

[Chorus]
And I feel likе I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Post-Chorus]
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

[Verse 3]
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

[Middle 8]
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years

[Outro]
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Verse 1: Madonna, Babyface]
Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
(There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)

Say your lines, but do you feel them?
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around?
(No one around)
Watching you, watching me, one lonely star
(One lonely star, you don't know who you are)

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye (Bye-bye)
Say good-bye

[Verse 2: Madonna, Babyface]
Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part where you're breaking my heart
(Breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
(Just make them smile the whole world loves a clown)

Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
(Role that you played)
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
(One lonely star and you don't know who you are)

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye (Bye-bye)
Say good-bye

[Bridge: Madonna, Babyface]
All the world is a stage (World is a stage)
And everyone has their part (Has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story’d go?
How was I to know you'd break (You'd break, you'd break, you'd break)
You'd break my heart?

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you
(I've always been in love with you)
I guess you've always known
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye (Bye-bye)
Say good-bye

[Outro: Madonna]
Say good-bye

[Verse 1]
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Verse 2]
Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Verse 3]
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key
If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Outro]
If I could melt your heart

[Verse 1]
Haven't we met?
You're some kind of beautiful stranger
You could be good for me
I've had the taste for danger
If I'm smart then I'll run away
But I'm not so I guess I'll stay
Heaven forbid
I'll take my chance on a beautiful stranger

[Pre-Chorus]
I looked into your eyes
And my world came tumbling down
You're the devil in disguise
That's why I'm singing this song
To know you is to love you

[Chorus]
You're everywhere I go
And everybody knows
To love you is to be part of you
I've paid for you with tears
And swallowed all my pridе

[Refrain]
Da-da-da da-da-da-da da da-da, dum
Beautiful stranger
Da-da-da da-da-da-da da da-da, dum
Beautiful strangеr

[Verse 2]
If I'm smart then I'll run away
But I'm not so I guess I'll stay
Haven't you heard?
I fell in love with a beautiful stranger

[Pre-Chorus]
I looked into your face
My heart was dancing all over the place
I'd like to change my point of view
If I could just forget about you

[Chorus]
To know you is to love you
You're everywhere I go
And everybody knows

[Pre-Chorus]
I looked into your eyes
And my world came tumbling down
You're the devil in disguise
That's why I'm singing this song to you
To know you is to love you

[Chorus]
You're everywhere I go
And everybody knows
I've paid for you with tears
And swallowed all my pride

[Refrain]
Da-da-da da-da-da-da da da-da, dum
Beautiful stranger
Da-da-da da-da-da-da da da-da, dum
Beautiful stranger

[Verse 1: Usher]
I can't win, I can't reign
I will never win this game
Without you, without you
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you, without you

[Verse 2: Usher]
I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by
Without you, without you
I can't rest, I can't fight
All I need is you and I
Without you, without you

[Drop]

[Verse 3: Usher]
Can't erase, so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we're estranged
Without you, without you
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night
Without you, without you

[Drop]
"Heart and soul
Psike!!"

It's like a song you know
In your heart and soul
You wanna sing along
Oh, oh
In your heart and soul
You wanna sing along

I am nobody talking 'bout nothing
I am nothing in comparison, to what I feel
When I open my eyes, to what is real in the life
I know it take sacrifice, you can compromise
But now I realize

[Chorus]
Heart and soul are looking for something
Keep on wanting, but am I wanting too much?
It is too much for you to be
Here for me
All or nothing that is the question
Love will always seem to find
Something true to make it right

[Verse 2]
We have everything, maybe it's nothing
But we know that there something
And I try to hold on
But it keeps escaping me
I know that I love you, but lately
Baby, something's missing
You're making me
Obsessive to the point that I'm rapidly changing
Can't take it we, try to be together when blatantly
This is not working mistakenly
We look so perfect, but everything
Ain't what it seems especially when

[Chorus]
Heart and soul are looking for something
Keep on wanting
But am I wanting too much?
It is too much for you to be
Here for me
All or nothing; that is the question
Love will always seem to find
Something true to make it right

[Post-Chorus]
It's like a song, you know
In your heart and soul
You wanna sing along

[bridge]
I mean how could we
Just giving up on a tragedy
But no one wants to live unhappily
Baby you know it's sad for me
I was glad to be your
Shoulder to cry on
Shoulder to lean on
Someone to rely on
Something to believe in
I see the tears again
Now it's coming to an end
Breaking me up
What am I to do when?

[Chorus]
Heart and soul are looking for something
Keep on wanting, am I wanting too much?
It is too much for you to be
Here for me?
All or nothing; that is the question
Love will always seem to find
Something true to make it right

[Post-Chorus]
I'm in agony, agony
Ohh oh oh, yeah
I'm in agony, agony

[Outro]
Oh, for you to be
Oh, all or nothing
Seems to find
To make it right
Something
Oh
For you to be
Oh
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Stretch my hands to You (to you, to you)

[Verse]
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you-

[Chorus]
If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be alright, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine

[Verse]
Got laid off at the factory
And their timing is not the greatest in the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
Wanted Christmas to be right for my girl
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be the happy time of year
And my little girl don't understand
Why we can't afford no Christmas here

[Chorus]
If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be alright, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine

[Verse 1]
Can anybody help me? I'm outta plans
Guess I left my world in somebody's hands
I don't like to hurt but, but everyone gets weak
Someone to rely on, that's what I really need

[Pre-Chorus]
Now here we stay, it's all that we're worth
I've been through the pain and been dragged through the dirt
Whatever they tell you, we're bigger than words
I've been where you're standing, I know how it hurts
Let this be a song now and this be a day
And we stand together, we'll bе okay
Cause we're survivors, wе're making it work
Expecting the best when they hope for the worst

[Drop]
One love
One love
One love
One love
One love
One love
One love

[Verse 2]
Now I could try and fix this all by myself
But I know it'd turn out better if you help
No one likes to hurt but, but everyone gets weak
Someone to rely on, that's what everybody needs

[Pre-Chorus]
Now here we stay, it's all that we're worth
I've been through the pain and been dragged through the dirt
Whatever they tell you, we're bigger than words
I've been where you're standing, I know how it hurts
Let this be a song now and this be a day
And we stand together, we'll be okay
Cause we're survivors, we're making it work
Expecting the best when they hope for the worst

[Chorus]
One love, this is the way we found
One love, even though they'll let you down
One love, nobody's perfect now
One love, don't let that hold you down
One love, let's stick together now
One love, we've got to stand our ground
One love, it's easy to believe in
One love, believe in you and me
One love

[Drop]
One love
One love
One love

[Outro]
One love

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, SAV killed it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Right this way, right this way)
Yeah, I got this nigga on this Detroit shit, man (Go on, take your seats, take your seats, go on, take your seats)
When am I gonna start the show? Hah

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
My allergies fuckin' up but my bitches ain't
I just bought a crib, next to mine, and bought a shark tank
I just turned the clear colored pop to dark pink (Wock')
I might turn the top of my crib to a skatin' rink (Ooh)
I might break a bitch and her friends for double Cs (Yes)
Rap niggas been gettin' money, but not like me
I rolled up in six black Benzes like Eazy-E (Ew)
Bitches always sleazy 'cause they nosy, get out my B
Said I'm in love with many bitches, but not like Rih'
Niggas hate we gettin' riches, they can suck my D
11:11, come make your wishes, me and Swae top three
And we not three
Bitch said I'm livin' like a wizard, this ain't D.C
I hate catfishin', I wanna fuck what I saw on IG
I told this bitch, "We're just friends," it's like Biz Markie (Damn)
Woulda thought I had a nose ring 'cause all eyes is on me

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
I ain't even pressed
I already fucked, put the Ms in the chest
I'm already up
My big bros be psychos, they already nuts (Nuts)
There's plenty love to go around, all the money get touched (Touched)
I'm a first-class nigga, I can't settle for less (Less)
Fucked her friends off a, "Hello," as soon as we met (Ayy)
I ain't dogged the bitch out 'cause she wasn't the type (Type)
But I had to tell, "I already found the love of my life" (Never)
Empty out a bag like I normally do (I do)
I could put you in the clip like I'm makin' a movie (Damn)
I'm so stiff on the bitch, had to call a masseuse
Teacher always hated me 'cause I was breakin' the rules (Ooh)
That's a jump ball, she gon' fuck me on the spot
She turn your phone off, your nigga in his PJs, I'm a robot
Put a chip in his brain, I'm a big dawg
When I flex, I got gains (Trap, trap)

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
You got Benzes, I got Benzes, but it ain't the same
'Bout a two hunnid thousand dollar difference, we in different lanes (Skrrt)
Me and my niggas fuck on bitches when we feel pain (Yeah)
We don't pop pills when we hurt, you niggas lame (Pussy, hahaha)
You niggas weird (Pussy)
Promise anything happened that night, I wasn't there
Anything that don't involve my money, I never care
Tryna grow a whole carat garden in both my ears
My bitch got my name engraved in both my spears (What?)
Looked at her kinda crazy, she must think I'm hunting some deer
Everything that come out his mouth fake, he must have veneers
You ain't been the same since you lost your boss just like the Cavaliers
(Go) I'm a real problem
Can't be solved, just like world hunger, get them boys off 'em
Fucked his bitch, put my pants on backwards, had to Kris Kross 'em
We get it though, one shot to the throat, he better play possum (Boom)
These niggas know us
Niggas not tough, puttin' on a damn act, you a store runner
I'm a ho hunter, I ain't no goon, I got real shooters
Real rims and real Hoovers that don't play on computers

[Verse 4: Swae Lee]
I been doin' this rap shit so long, I might retire (Might retire)
Wrappin' up this shit like I'm tired (Like I'm tired)
Hunnid thousand dollar watch from different suppliers
Niggas goin' through what they gotta do just to provide
Ask about me, any city, they say I'm that guy (That guy)
I did county, any Euros, I'm worldwide (Worldwide)
Top of that buildin', smokin' certified (Certified)
I didn't put a baby in that bitch but I fertilized
Diamonds underwater (Ooh), I just had to let 'em soak (Soak)
I'm like E-40, man, just tell me when to go (Go)
Security had the shotty, he ain't even need the scope (Scope)
Pourin' out the drank, never once did the drugs or coke

[Intro]
They know it (Yeah)
Know that it's us (Yeah)

[Verse]
Ain't gotta ask if I'm livin' right
Open that bank up, boy, yeah, we here tonight
Bet it's goin' down 'cause I'm feelin' right (Slatt, slatt)
Ask 'round the city, boy, I'm certified (Frrt)
Million dollars cash made off merchandise (Slatt)
Sometimes I question if I'm livin' right (Go)
Open that bank up, bitch, yeah, we here tonight
Ridin' JPG like a refugee (Yeah)
We tote .223s, don't get close to me (Frrt)
I put three hundred thousand in a headlock (Yeah)
Pints of Wocky, 'Korn goin' deadstock (Yeah)
That big-booty bitch gon' make my bed rock (It rock)
Stay hoppin' in my flick, I'ma make this photo crop (Go)
Ask my Toronto bitch, "What you sayin' tonight?" (Mmm)
Know she goin' down 'cause I ran it right (Mmm)
Ain't gotta ask no quеstions if I'm livin' right (Mmm)
Ask your brother and sister, bitch, I'm certifiеd (Ain't gotta ask nobody at all)
Ask 'round the city, boy, I'm certified
Million dollars cash made off merchandise

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah (Yeah), yeah, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You'll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

[Verse 2]
Leave the perfume on the shеlf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no tracе behind
Like you don't even exist
And take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times

[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

[Bridge]
And you wanna scream
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

[Outro]
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little times

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
'Cause when you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 1]
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishеs came true
It would've been you
In my dеfense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

[Verse 2]
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

[Bridge]
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

[Chorus]
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

[Chorus]
And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

[Chorus]
And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

[Bridge]
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

[Chorus]
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

[Outro]
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
Ruining everything
A marvelous time

[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on brеaking branches
Those eyеs add insult to injury

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door

[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & Both]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out
You never gave no warning sign
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave no warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door

[Outro: Justin Vernon & Taylor Swift & Both]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave no warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave no warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
So many signs, so many signs
I, oh, I, oh
I, I

[Verse 1]
We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishin' I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Verse 2]
We gather stones, nevеr knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, somе to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishin' I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Bridge]
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you
When I'm screaming at the sky
And when you can't sleep at night
You hear my stolen lullabies

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishin' I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossin' out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishin' I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Outro]
Yeah, look at how my tears ricochet
Look at all of my tears
Turnin' into your tears
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Verse 1]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces

[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Verse 2]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as thеy watch my shattered edgеs glisten

[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Bridge]
And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still tryin' everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

[Outro]
Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight

[Verse 1]
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids make a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

[Verse 2]
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

[Bridge]
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

[Verse 1]
Salt air and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Ahh-ahh

[Bridge]
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love and saying "us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

[Chorus]
'Cause I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
You were never mine

[Outro]
You were never mine
Never mine
Do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said, "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"
And then I canceled my plans just in case you'd call
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, hope of it all
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"

[Instrumental]

[Spoken]
Haha, I loved that

[Verse 1]
I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Verse 2]
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Post-Chorus]
At least I'm trying

[Bridge]
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

[Chorus]
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Outro]
At least I'm trying

[Verse 1]
Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

[Chorus]
Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

[Chorus]
Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

[Verse 3]
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven

[Chorus]
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby, with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
Ah-ah-ah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh no

[Verse 1]
What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile
Or does she mouth "Fuck you forever"?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Verse 2]
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
They say "move on," but you know I won't
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Bridge]
I'm taking my time, taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but

[Outro]
No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that

[Verse 1]
Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
"Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
And some things you just can't speak about

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out

[Verse 2]
Something med school did not cover
Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
"Doc, I think she's crashing out"
And some things you just can't speak about

[Bridge]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sеnse of what you've seen

[Chorus]
With you I servе, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out

[Outro]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen
Make sense of what you've seen

[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust mе
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Bеtty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long

[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you

[Verse 1]
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friеnd in me
Would it be enough if I could nеver give you peace?

[Verse 2]
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
'Cause there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
And I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

[Intro]
One, two, one

[Verse 1]
My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Verse 2]
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's thе only hoax I believe in
Don't want no othеr shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Bridge]
You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

[Outro]
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Verse 1]
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Verse 2]
What should be over burrowеd under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I'vе come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Bridge]
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you
No, not without you

Lyrics from snippets

[Verse]
I'm the heavy-set one with the diligence
The one that still hustles on Fulton Street
Enough about me, let's talk about you

[Intro]
One love
One love
One love
One love
One love
One love
One love
One love
Hey, believe in you and me
One love
One love

[Chorus]
One love, this is the way we found
One love, even though they'll let you down
One love, nobody's perfect now
One love, don't let that hold you down
One love, let's stick together now
One love, we've got to stand our ground
One love, it's easy to believe in
One love, believe in you and me
One love
Hey, believe in you and me, one love

[Intro]
One love

[Verse 1]
Can anybody help me? I'm outta plans
Guess I left my world in somebody's hands
I don't like to hurt but, but everyone gets weak
Someone to rely on, that's what I really need

[Pre-Chorus]
Now here we stay, it's all that we're worth
I've been through the pain and been dragged through the dirt
Whatever they tell you, we're bigger than words
I've been where you're standing, I know how it hurts
Let this be a song now and this be a day
And we stand together, we'll be okay
'Cause we're survivors, we're making it work
Expecting the best when they hope for the worst

[Chorus]
One love
One love

[Drop]
One love
One love

[Bridge]
Hurt but, hurt but, hurt but, hurt but

Hurt but, hurt but, hurt but, hurt but
Hurt but, hurt but, hurt but, hurt but
Hurt but, hurt but, hurt but, hurt but

[Outro]
Hurt but, hurt but, hurt but, hurt but
Hurt but, hurt but, hurt but, hurt but
Hurt but, hurt but, hurt but, hurt but
Hurt but, hurt but, hurt but, hurt but
Hurt but, hurt but, hurt but, hurt but
Hurt but, hurt but, hurt but, hurt but
Hurt but, hurt but, hurt but, hurt but
Hurt but, hurt but, hurt but, hurt but

All the things I know right now

There's just no gettin' over you

I can't win, I can't reign
I will never win this game
Without you, without you
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you, without you

[Verse 2: Usher]
I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by
Without you, without you
I can't rest, I can't fight
All I need is you and I
Without you, without you

[Drop]

[Verse 3: Usher]
I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed
Without you, without you
I can't look, I'm so blind
I lost my heart, I lost my mind
Without you, without you

[Chorus: Usher]
Oh-oh-oh
You, you, you
Without
You, you, you
Without
You, you, you
Without you

Oh-oh-oh
You, you, you

You, you, you
Without you

[Verse 3: Usher]
Can't erase, so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we're estranged
Without you, without you
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night
Without you, without you
I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed
Without you, without you
I can't look, I'm so blind
I lost my heart, I lost my mind
Without you, without you

[Chorus: Usher]
Oh-oh-oh
You, you, you
Without
You, you, you
Without you

Kiss (Ah)
Uh

[Verse 1]
You don't have to be beautiful to turn me on
I just need your body, babe, from dusk 'til dawn
You don't need experience to turn me out
Just leave it all up to me
I'm gonna show you what it's all about (Say it)

[Chorus]
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your (Say it)
Hey

[Verse 2]
You got to not talk dirty, baby, uh, if you wanna impress me
You can't be too flirty, mama, I know how to undress me, yeah
I wanna be your fantasy-sy, woo, woo, maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me, we could have a good time
Everybody sing

[Chorus]
You don't have to be rich (Woo) to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible, ooh-ooh

Thank you
Bye bye

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, one minute you love me then you hate me
Oh, you want me to be something that ain't me
Oh, all you ever do is complain and put the blame on me
Oh, baby, going through emotions on a daily
I tried to play it out like it don't faze me
But all you ever do is complain and put the blame on me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, going through the motions, muddy emotions
R.I.P. to Juice, that shit I won't ever cope with
Shawty is a diamond, she would lie right in the open
Smoking on the kush and this bitch has got me floatin'
Living in the moment
I pray I don't ever get lost up in the moment
I pray that it's only a phase and you get over it
I pray that I do what I want before it's all said and done

[Pre-Chorus]
Love me, hate me at the same time
You keep telling me the same lies
And I'm over it...

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, the blues is now kickin', and dinner is three Michelin
I don't eat red meat, but still got beef sizzlin'
Know that I need discipline
I keep singin' for all these hoes, they keep listenin'
Niggas love to bro up with the boy and dap fists-es
But we are not equivalent, dawg
I been an only child, don't need siblings
And I'm past them like the times that he's livin' in, okay
Man, if you saw what I flew here, you'd be like, "He's sickenin'"
If you not runnin' some top, we not gon' keep kickin' it
Classics, I keep scribblin', lights in the Universal building just keep flickerin'
Money just keep comin' in, you would think I'm Irish the way that it stays doublin'
I could feed a country with the tax that I pay governments
Whatеver they're doin' with my cash is vеry troublin'
Okay, February came around, I used to get paid shovelin'
Sold clothes, walked dogs, trust me, I stay hustlin'
When it came to school, there's no way that I'm A-plus-in' it
So I just dropped out of it, trust me, I'm not proud of it
Niggas get too comfy in they spot, they get knocked out of it
Niggas get a gun just so they can make props out of it
Shawty make a scene in the house, she get locked out of it
Yeah, you not 'bout to be chillin' in this bitch with kicked feet up
I'ma make you bounce out this ho like Big Freedia
Pete O. used to throw a purple tint on a two-liter
First private plane I ever rode was a eight-seater
Before that, I got the bedroom hot with a space heater
On top of that, I didn't have shit to my name either, that's real
But now I'm givin' house tours 'til it's back to world tours
Play that "Mask Off" when they find the real cure
I might not be good for her, but I'm real to her
Got no time for her, but give Richard Mille to her
That's the only way I know how to express love
My dawgs love sticks and drums like they Questlove
All them jokes about Aubrey, they got me messed up, for real
I come with a lot of complications inside me
It's always people misleadin' me that are tryna guide me
Everyone wants to try me, but no one wants to buy me
Everyone wants to meet me, but no one wants to keep me
Everyone talkin' lemons when everything is peachy
Everyone got they hands out, and it ain't to reach me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Mhm, yeah, mhm
Everyone got they glass out, let's drink to Weezy
Every nigga that stare me down just came to see me
Choppin' up a lil' cash cow, that's steak I'm eatin'
Check deposits, high-risers with extra closets
The sex platonic, I talk intelligent, text Ebonics
The electronic guitars whinin', that's just Nirvana
Tommy gun on the counter, I call it Mr. Thomas
That'll keep niggas honest
I'm dozin' off in the driver seat 'cause the seat give massages
Decimal point money, these numbers too steep for commas
I'm eye to eye with niggas, I can't help but to see beyond 'em
Got a two-seater problem
Niggas thinkin' they cold, I knock the flu-season out 'em
Bitches forget they hoes, and that's when Tunechi remind 'em
I used to fuck Gucci models, I'm fuckin' Gucci designers
I keep it too G regardless, I'm gettin' too deep for divers
Let me resurface, I'm flexin' on purpose
She especially curvy, bet she be servin' every purpose, perfect
I'm better than perfect, I'm sick, I need to see a medical person
Eatin' all of these rappers with these edible verses
All I gotta be is all that I can possibly
She really, really into me, then suck it all up out of me
I'm proud of me, I don't know how to be sorry, apologies
You fuckin' with my math, you better know some trigonometry
'Cause I'ma be bustin', leave your lima bean at your mama feet
I flip the economy like Dominique Dawes
They say I'm trippin', I guess they wishin' I finally fall
I don't need war, I need a bitch that know I'ma need yours
I'ma need more, niggas is shifty like Honda Accords
Fire alarm, ain't got no ceilings, we climbin' the walls
Higher than yours, I fuck your bitch and she die in my arms
Lion has roared, No Ceilings 3 with my mind on the fourth
Holla at your boy

[DJ Drop: DJ Khaled]
Ayo, check this out, it's DJ Khaled
And this is No Ceilings 3
They try to put a ceilin' on our greatness
So we took the fucking ceilin' off
We took the fucking ceilin' off
It's Little Wayne, and this is... Another one

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
First she straight, now the bitch bi-curious
Booty out the A, but face from Honduras
Pull up to them gates, say I'm livin' luxurious
I fuck her, then I tell her get lost like a tourist
I went to the Middle East, came back with a Lamb'
Back with some money, came back with some grams
Fly your bitch to the beach, she come back with a tan
Comе back with no money, come back with some sand
Dog, I bе at home all day poppin' illys
See how long it take to count a million
Bitch, if you make me lose count, I'ma kill ya
Hoppin' out a G-Wagon, gotta be a six wheeler

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Young Tune nigga put a deal in yo' base
She gon' swallow that shit like a protein shake
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, V8
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, V8, uh

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Young Tune, nigga, I'll wipe yo' bitch
Best rapper alive, I write yo' shit
All that cappin', I'll wipe yo' lips
Lil' pussy-ass nigga shoot you right in yo' clit, yeah
I'ma turn up a little more this time
People used to say "That boy, he before his time"
I already know what you did last summer
I was standin' out the sun and lettin' my woah and them shine
Paul Smith robe on the floor but it's fine
Two tone AP on, I'm bust
Rose gold Hublot lookin' like rust
All black Hublot lookin' like us
Clear white diamonds, lookin' like pus
Watch face look like a motherfucking pizza
And I got all diamonds all in the crust
Thinkin' I might, no nigga, I must
Keep a Hot Boy with me, I got love for BG
The feds tryna lock me up like the BG
I told my old lady if they do, she could leave
She said "Bae, shut the fuck up, you sound brazy
That shit gon' work out like it's personal training"
I say "Amen", oh, and she say "Fuck yeah"
Weighing my options, I broke out the scale
Weighing my options, I feel like a whale
My pockets on blubber, the socket unplugger
Bah-bah-bah-bah, he not gon' recover
Dead bodies on top of each other
Look like they six-nining each other
At first, I was playin', now this shit got serious
Shots hit that man in the middle of his ears
Five hundred grand, to make an appearance
I need that a week in advance for clearance
I just got mad at one of my shooters
'Cause I told his ass that we don't shoot no children
That shit is bad and it fuck up my spirit
That nigga laugh, I say, "Bruh you a terrorist"
Extended barrel, the one with the holes
Don't fuck with me, I am not one of your bros
Quadruple my money, don't count what I grow
It's gotta be the trucker but I hop in a Rolls
Young Money, nigga, that's my DNA
I look like a lion and act like an ape
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, get ate
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we ate

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Young tune niggas put a deal on yo' base
She gon' swallow that shit like a protein shake
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, V8
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, V8, No Ceilings

[DJ Drop: DJ Khaled]
Young Money, OVO
Light yo' spliff up
Fucking big head spliff
Huh, Lil Wayne and Drake
Pon yo' head, let's go

[Chorus 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I spit that R.O.C., nothing but crack, bitch
Get my cleats 'cause I'm running this rap shit
Y'all know me, this ain't nothing but practice
I'm running the streets and I'm running this rap shit
I got bars, OD, I been running this rap shit
I run this bitch like I'm Lamar Jackson, uh

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Takeover, the breaks over
Hit yo' brakes 'cause the race over, I'm the case closer
Bust yo' whole fucking face open, that's a makeover
Lean make every soda grape soda, purple taste golden
Make me have my skaters skate over to your place soldier
You a play soldier, you a snakе, you a fake cobra
You ain't safe, have thе safe open, I need payola
On yo' knees, nigga where the keys? I'm like Beethoven
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight, a pen to a test
I bring the night to his sunlight and zen to her stress
I bring the gun to a fist fight, the dick to her breast
She want the cum on her tongue like it's mint to her breath
This is grown man BI, R.I.P B.I
Nigga, you might be a CI, talkin' to the FBI
Big beast to the east-side, now she's on my G5
Fuck on her to some C5, cut on Funeral and she die
Your reach ain't long enough, yo' peeps ain't strong enough
Yo' beach ain't warm enough
You ain't been in the throne
'Cause the seat ain't warm enough
And nigga, I'm the only one
I got the crown on, I'm the goat and you the pony, son
Don't let me do it to him Dunie 'cause I overdo it
The choppa was too big for me, had to grow into it
His stylist split his wig for me if I told her do it
We hit his crib and broke into it, if it's smoke, we blew it
We don't believe you, you need more people
Ain't shit sweet, boy, you need more Equal
You ain't runnin' shit boy feed your Ezekiel
All my niggas rich boy, clean no illegal
Don't let em gas you, like Tunechi reading Thrasher
He won't thrash you 'cause I'll be glad to split your apple, I had to
Stab you, chop you up in the bathroom so casual
Then drop you off in front of a chapel with candles
Detach you, body from soul
Anita Baker body and soul, come out of my soul
I made a way to the rockiest roads and highway patrol
Full speed ahead clean the bread from the sloppiest joes
I got it in the hot and the cold, the mud in the rain
I stomach the pain, got more bloods than the blood in my veins
I'm huntin' the game, you guys ain't fuckin with Wayne
Ask your vibe 'cause she fuckin' Lil Wayne, yeah

[Chorus 2: Lil Wayne]
Nigga, y'all know me, this ain't nothin' but practice
OG, I been sonnin' these bastards
Double R, no key, got a button for that shit
And if y'all don't see, then I'm comin' with graphics
Nigga, war no peace, and I'm comin' with caskets
Screamin' RIP to everyone in this rap shit
Nigga, y'all so sweet and I'm nothing but nasty
And I'm runnin' this rap shit, nigga, Lamar Jackson, No Ceilings

[DJ Drop: DJ Khaled]
This is No Ceilings 3
That's right, Lil Wayne
And be ready for I Am Not A Human Being 3
The album coming 2021
Another one

Only when you want my body, want my body

[Verse 1]
Sweet little white lies
Your sweet little white lies
Leave a bad taste in my mouth

Black dress with white wine
Mess it up, watch it fall down
When you watch it fall down

Go down in the dim light
You love it 'cause it's so tight
So you better lock it down
You know you better lock it down

[Pre-Chorus]
You tell me I'm a real one, I'm the right one
But only when you're on one
You tell me that you need me, wanna see me

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Ayy, haha
If you know, then you know, know

[Chorus]
Look, ayy, shawty wanna fuck (She do)
I told her I'm on demon time, I only want the top (Top)
If you ain't trynna do the gang, then get up out the spot
My lil' bro back home still whippin' shit like Betty Crock (Uh, uh, uh)
He still dippin' from the cops (He is)
Spent fifty on the whip and there's a sixty for the watch
Every day, I thank the lord, 'cause I done been through a lot
And they gon' have to kill me 'fore they ever steal my spot (Steal my spot, uh, uh)

[Verse]
If you know, then you know
Touch down in the city and I link up with my bro's (Oh, yeah)
Shoutout to the- (Uh)
Shoutout G's for the low, shoutout my lil' cousin
He just got back home
Yеah, so many numbers in my phone
Soon as I touchdown, that lil' thot give mе dome
And my bro wit' me everywhere I go up in the chrome
'Cause I done seen a lot, if not, I done seen it all

[Chorus]
Ayy, shawty wanna fuck (She do)
I told her I'm on demon time, I only want the top (Top)
If you ain't trynna do the gang, then get up out the spot

[Intro]
Yeah
Chuck, what's good, buddy?
Fuck you lookin' at, man? You got a eye problem?
Aight, look

[Chorus]
Girl, go and lose it, get stupid
While we watch them hoes dance to the music, actin' stupid
You don't need to study, just shake that ass for a little bit of money
Girl, go and lose it, get stupid
While we watch them hoes dance to the music, actin' stupid
You don't need to study, just shake that ass for a little bit of money

[Verse]
Hey, get stupid, you a dummy
Only nineteen, all the older hoes love me
Everyone know, ain't nobody here that fuck with me
My homie Inglish brought the cash, call him Chuck E. Cheese
I'm a cool kid in my nеw kicks
Got me lookin' flyer than a broomstick
Walkin' by thesе girls and they get undressed
I'ma spend all of this money 'til there ain't nothin' left
I'm a young Donald Trump, you the type I call a chump
Turnin' up my music, make the speakers go bump
And they got me drunk, and this weed got me faded
Girls all tryna act like they pussy so sacred
Say you wanna fuck but it ain't because I'm famous
That's bullshit, you just want some rapper mixtape dick
My mistake 

[?]
'Cause everywhere I go, they say

Sheesh, oh

[Verse 1]
All of my exes, they get to finding somebody till they realize that they need me
I’m on a island in Mexico, sexy hoes wit' me, you know that I'm sleazy
She wanna touch it and tease me, I tell her, "Fucking me ain't easy"
Way out the border in Canada, I'ma still fuck her with stamina
I'm facing twenty-two years, but I still fuck the pussy like I was fresh out
She finna come in the crib to come get it, and I’m finna give her the rest now
Dick her, done sent her to sleep
Soon as she said it was deep, I went deeper to give her dick that last the rest of the week
Mmm, you having sex with a freak, I be giving her neck while I speak
And she wanna give head on the highway, I'm in the trenches too deep
We had a hell of a good time, not Moscato, but the good wine
I'm going to work and she say that that pussy don't squirt
Made it squirt, but it took time
I just be serving you dick, you just keep serving these bitches them looks
You don't need no one to get you to college, you don't need no one to get you them books
Sexy as hell, your professor prolly test you and he give you a A for effort
I got no time to play in the night when we fucking, I'm tryna make you stay forever

[Chorus]
'Cause all of these hoes
Hate on the way that you serve it
They hate the way that you serve it
Ain’t a nigga that can curve it
And all of these hoes

Fuck 'em, baby girl, just serve it
'Cause if it's gon' serve, you gon’ serve it
'Cause all of these hoes (Serve)
Hate on the way that you serve it (Serve)

[Verse 2]
Her famous celebrity talkin’ shit about me publicly, all in my DMs, still fuck behind curtains
Oh, no, don’t you be nervous, I promised I’ll never expose your purpose
But if sinks at the bottom, eventually, that shit gon’ come to the surface
I got the blick, I know niggas is lurkin', I give her dick ‘fore I give her a Birkin
I’m way too quick, I get turned up, I curve it, I wanna sip, I’m turnin’, I’m swervin’, ah
Got me swervin’, yeah I'm swervin’, yeah I'm swervin’
Takin’ care of me, gettin’ mine in, puttin’ work in
So, girl, when I call, just serve it

[Chorus]
'Cause all of these hoes (Know that they)
Hate on the way that you serve it (The way that you)

[Outro]
Ain’t it, isn’t it somethin’?
Ain’t it somethin’ when I look at the face of you (Somethin’ when I look at the face)
Wonderin’ how you servin’ with your ex nigga (Servin’)

Ain’t it somethin’ when I look at the face of you (Somethin’ when I look at the face)
Wonderin’ how you servin’, but you let me go (Baby, baby)

[Chorus]
Like an echo in the forest
The day will come back around
As if nothing happened
Yeah, life goes on
Like an arrow in the blue sky
Another day flying by
On my pillow, on my table
Yeah, life goes on
Like this again
Oooh yeah
Like this again, oh yeah
One, two
One, two, three
I think the third one
One, two, three, four

I'm the boy that looks excited, I'm

[Intro]
(Did somebody say, Just Eat?)

[Verse 1]
Somebody just did
The D-O double G be feelin' festive
Got Santa and his elves working 'round the clock
Holidays are here so the show don't stop
Got chow mei, chow lo, oh
It's Christmas, so child, ho, ho, ho
You know I got my gold leaf burgers on the way
On a solid gold tray
On a solid gold sleigh
Ice skatin' to your door when the snow falls
(What you got, Snoop?)
Carbonara with them dough balls
Yes, please, feast at the crib, see
Catch burritos droppin' down the chimney
Hear the jingle bells? It must be
Stuffed crust cheese (Oh, cheese)
Trust me, I keep it poppin' like the hot jerk chicken that I got in my stockin'

[Chorus]
Happy Holidays, it's a Doggy-Dogg Christmas
Lotta treats to complete on the wishlist
Whatever the venue, hit up the menu
(Did somebody say, Just Eat?)
Tell Santa I ain't ask twice
Everything I order, both naughty and nice
Whatever the venue, hit up the menu
(Did somebody say, Just Eat?)

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothin' changed here
Gettin' sushi delivered by a reindeer
Most wonderful time of the year
It's a "Just Eat anything" vibe over here
Think outside the box if your plan is
Nothin' more than a cold turkey sandwich (Cold turkey sandwich, no)
Gotta pimp that'll meal like a mac
Limitless snacks in my Just Eat sack (Woo, what?)
You ever see an elf carryin' a roast ham? (Uh-huh)
When I sit in the whip bumpin' slow jams
The weather outside turn cold and
I stay cooler than a iced up snowman
Warmin' up with a miso soup
Me so bossy, and me so Snoop
Got my man Mister Claus on the line
Let him know that it's Just Eat time

[Chorus]
Happy Holidays, it's a Doggy-Dogg Christmas
Lotta treats to complete on the wishlist
Whatever the venue, hit up the menu
(Did somebody say, Just Eat?)
Tell Santa I ain't ask twice
Everything I order, both naughty and nice
Whatever the venue, hit up the menu
(Did somebody say, Just Eat?)

[Verse 3]
Oh, didn't know? Well you know now
Put your feet up, you ain't gotta go out
Party, food in the blink of an eye
Mistletoe, kiss this year goodbye (Bye-bye)
Now it's December, so remember
You can get anything you sent for, hmm
Nachos, I'm stackin' chips (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Singin' carols with the click and a rack of ribs
The gift of givin' is what I'm in for (That's all)
Got tinsel wrapped around a spring roll
Yep, hit the pad with my pad thai
Bringin' joy to the world, I'm that guy

[Chorus]
Happy Holidays, it's a Doggy-Dogg Christmas
Lotta treats to complete on the wishlist
Whatever the venue, hit up the menu
(Did somebody say, Just Eat?)
Tell Santa I ain't ask twice
Everything I order, both naughty and nice
Whatever the venue, hit up the menu
(Did somebody say, Just Eat?)
Woo

Lay your head on my pillow
Here you can be yourself
No one has to know what you are feeling
No one but me and you, ooh

I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets, yeah
Just think of me as the pages in your diary, everybody say

Woah (Woah)
Woah (Woah)
Woah-woah
Woah-woah, lemme hear you say
I won't tell
I won't tell
I won't tell
Your secrets, your secrets
Break it down
No-no-no, no-no-no, no-no
I won't tell nobody, ooh
Yeah
Na, na-na-na-na, na-na, na, na
Then I think I go to this chord
Oh yeah, this one (Yeah, that feels good)
That's how you resolve a song (Hahaha, that's how you do it)
Yeah (Aw man), I love that song so much

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Genuine day will come
When the wind decides to run
And shakes the stairs that stab the wall
And turns the page in a future age

[Verse 2]
Some trees will bend and some will fall
But then again so will us all
Let's turn our prayers into outrageous dares
And mark our page in a future age
High above
The sea of cars
And barking dogs
In fenced-in yards

[Kevin Abstract]
Back by popular demand
Hoppin' out the sand, with the mic up in my hand (What!)
Back by popular demand
Hoppin' out the sand, with the mic up in my hands (What!)

Pay attention, Pay attention
Studio glisten, never listen
Pay attention, Pay attention
Studio glisten, never listen
(Can I get a uh, second 

[?])
Oh yeah
Holland!
Ow

In France a skinny man died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle and soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys and their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called The Disciples, high on crack, totin' a machine gun
Time, times

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church and killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and еvery other story is tellin' you somеbody died
My sister killed her baby 'cause she couldn't afford to feed it
And we're sending people to the moon
In September my cousin tried reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's June
Times, times

It's silly, no?
When a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies
Oh, why?
Time, time
Baby make a speech, star wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn
Time, times

It's silly, no?
When a rocket blows up
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy, truly
Until he truly dies
Oh, why?
Sign o' the Times
Time, time

Sign o' the times mess with your mind
Hurry before it's too late
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby
We'll call him Nate, if it's a boy
Time, times
Times, time
Hello Holland and welcome!
Ow!
Oh, oh, oh!
Ow!

We want to play in the sunshine
We want to be free
Without the help of a Margarita or Ecstasy
We want to kick like we used to
Sign up on the dotted line
We gonna dance, we gonna dance
Like it's going to be the last time
Play in the sunshine
Turn all the lights up to 10
I want to meet you (meet you), kiss you (kiss you)
Love you (love you), and miss you (miss you)
Do it all over again, do it all over again

Play in the sunshine
We're going to get over
I'm feeling kind of lucky tonight
I'm going to find my four leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, Ow!
We going to love all our enemies
Till the gorilla falls off the wall
We're going to rock him (rock him)
We're going to roll him (roll him)
We're going to teach him that love will make him tall (somehow)
Aah, pop goes the music
When the big white rabbit begin to talk
And the colour green will make your best friends leave ya
It will make them do the walk
But that's cool
Cuz one day, everyday will be a yellow day
Ow!

We going to play in the sunshine
We're going to get over
I'm feeling kind of lucky tonight
I'm going to find my four leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how
Hey na, hey hey hey (Hey na, hey hey hey)
Hey na, hey hey hey hey (Hey na, hey hey hey hey)
Woo! (Woo!)
Yip, yip, yahoo! (Yip, yip, yahoo!)

Aw, shit
Drummer, do your thing
Holy drummer, ow!
On the drums, Shelia E
Oh, I see
(play that thing, play that thing)

Play in the sunshine
Play in the sunshine
We're going to
Play in the sunshine
Play in the sunshine
I guess I should've known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb 'cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used

But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "What have I got to lose?"

Holland, sing it

And honey, I say, "Little Red Corvette"
Baby, you're much too fast Utrecht
Little Red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

Shut up already
Damn
Tell me who in this house know about the quake?

Bullshit!

Now everybody clap your hands

Green eggs and ham

Now that you got it, let's do the twist
A little bit harder than they did in '66
A little bit faster than they did in '67
Twist little sister and go to heaven
Come on you all, we got to jam
Before the police come
A groove this funky is on the run
Hey yeah!
Shake your body until your neighbours stare atcha!
Quake, quake, quake, quake, quake, quake
Housequake
Everybody jump up and down
Housequake
There's a brand new groove going round
(Housequake)
In this city, in your funky town
And the saxophone is the fault
Check it

Top of your body
Housequake

[Intro: Prince]
Girls and boys!

[Verse 1: Prince]
He only knew her for a little while
But he had grown accustomed to her style
She had the cutest ass he'd ever seen
He did too, they were meant to be
They loved to kiss on the steps of Versailles
It looked like rain, mama, birds do fly

[Chorus: Prince]
(Say it) I love you, baby, I love you so much (I love you so much)
Maybe we can stay in touch
Meet me in another world, space, and joy
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys (Yеah, alright, wave your hands y'all, raise 'em up)

[Verse 2: Prince]
Hе gave her all the love that anyone can
But she was promised to another man
Tried so hard not to go insane
Birds do fly, looks like rain

[Chorus: Prince]
(Say it) I love you, baby, I love you so much (I love you so much)
Maybe we can stay in touch
Meet me in another world, space, and joy
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys (Everybody, raise 'em up)
Can y'all sing that, right here?
Everybody, sing it
Sheila

[Verse 3: Sheila, Both]
Life is precious, baby, love is so rare
I could take the breakup if you say that you care
He had to run away, his pride was too strong
It started raining, baby, the birds were gone

[Chorus: Prince]
I love you, baby, I love you so much
Maybe we can stay in touch
Meet me in another world, space, and joy
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys
(On the big horn, Skinny Man, blow)

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus: Prince]
I love you, baby, I love you so much
Maybe we can stay in touch
Meet me in another world, space, and joy
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys

[Outro]
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys (Say what?)
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys
Young is the night
It feels so right
Now that you're mine
Let's take our time
The man in the moon is smiling
For he knows what I'm dreaming of
Tonight is the night for making slow love
The gentle breeze
It blows with ease
Let's make it slow
Whoa
Just like the wind blows
Let's make it last forever, child
For a hundred times won't be enough
Whoa, shut the door, baby
Tonight is the night for making 

[somebody] slow love

Sing it with us

Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love
Oh baby, Oh baby, Oh baby
So much better when we take our time
Love's in your eyes (in your eyes)
Eyes never lie
Don't rush the feeling
You've got me reeling
You can see through race car drivers
Let me show you what I'm made of
Tonight is the night for making slow love
It's alright, say it!
Whoa, yeah yeah
Ow

Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love (baby, baby, baby, baby)
So much better when we take our time

You got a saxophone this mornin' or this evenin'
Baby, baby
Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love
So much better when we take our time
Thank you

Holland!

[Verse 1]
It was only last June when her old man ran away
She couldn't stop crying cause she knew he was gone to stay
10:35 on a lonely Friday night
She was standin' by the bar, hmm, she was lookin' alright, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I asked her if she wanted to dance
And she said all she wanted was a good man
And wanted to know if I thought I was qualified, yeah

[Chorus]
I said, "Baby, don't waste your time,"
I said, I told her
"I know what's on your mind
Wouldn't be satisfied with a one-night stand
And I could never take the place of your man"

[Verse 2]
It hurt me so bad when she told me with tears in her eyes
(Tears in her eyes)
He was all she ever had and now she wanted to die
He left her with a baby and another one on the way, yeah
She couldn't stop cryin' 'cause she knew he was gone to stay, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She asked me if we could be friends
And I said, "Oh, honey baby, that's a dead end
You know and I know that we wouldn't be satisfied, no no no"

[Chorus]
And I said, "Baby, don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
Wouldn't be satisfied with a one-night stand
And I could never take the place of your man"

Yeah, yeah, the place of your man
The place of your man

Hot thing, When you smile, when you smile, when you smile
Are your smiles, are your smiles for me?
Hot thing, maybe you should give your folks a call
Hot thing, tell them you're going to the Crystal Ball
Hot thing, tell them you're coming home late
If you'rе coming home at all
Hot thing, tell them you found a brand nеw baby doll
Hot thing, I can't wait to get you home
Hot thing, where we could be alone

And then we could make a story of our own

If I was your girlfriend
Would you remember
To tell me all the things you forgot when I was your man?
Hey, hey, when I was your man

If I was your best friend
Would you let me take care of you
And do all the things that only a best friend can, oh
Only best friends can

If I was your girlfriend
Shoo, oh, oh, aw
If I was your girlfriend

If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me dress you?
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
Not that you're helpless
But sometimes, sometimes
Those arе the things that bein' in love's about
If I was your onе and only friend
Would you run to me if somebody hurt you
Even if that somebody was me?
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please

If I was your girlfriend
Uh-ah, oooh-hoo-hoo
If I was your girlfriend

Would you let me wash your hair?
Could I make you breakfast sometime?
Or then, could we just hang out, I mean
Could we go to a movie and cry together?
'Cause to me, baby, that would be so fine

(If I was your girlfriend)
Baby can I dress you?
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
(If I was your girlfriend)
Listen child, I ain't sayin you're helpless
But sometimes, sometimes
Those are the things that bein' in love's about
Sugar
Sugar, do you know what I'm saying to you this evening?
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
All the things you are to me
Sure do, Sure do

[Sampled Intro]
"Look at the bargains over here, ladies..."

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called "life"

And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor)
Yow!

If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard
Are we gonna let de-elеvator bring us down?
Oh no, lets go

Let's go crazy
Let's gеt nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go

Come on, Holland
Let's get nuts
Are you ready?
Yow!

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, lets go

Go crazy
Can y'all say that? Come on
Go crazy
Ah shit

Go crazy
Go crazy
Go fuckin' crazy

Go crazy
Go crazy
Go go go, go go go
Go go go, go go go
Go go go, go go go
Go go go, go go go
Go go go, go go go
Go go go, go go go
Go go go, go go go
Go go go, go go go
Go go go, go go go
Ah shit
Dig, if you will, the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling?
Can you picture this?

Dream, if you can, a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing
Say it!
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds likе
When doves cry
Everybody!
Huh huh huh huh huh
Say it
I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted one time to see you laughing

I only wanted to see you
Laughing in the purple rain

(Purple rain, purple rain)
Thank you!
Oh
Should we raise our hands tonight?
I only want to see you
Laughing in the purple rain

(Guitar solo)

You wanna sing?
Come on, everybody!
Ow
One, Two
One more time, y'all
Ow
Yeah!

I was dreamin' when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray
Woke up this morning
I could have sworn it was judgement day
The sky was all purple
There were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction
And you know I didn't even care

[Chorus]
'Cause they say...
2000 zero zero, party over, oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
Say it one more time
2000 zero zero, party over, oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna, wе gonna, oh yeah

1999
Say it!
Everybody, come on
Wе could all die any day 1999
I don't wanna die
I'd rather dance my life away 1999
Listen to what I'm tryin' to say...
What you all wanna do?
Party, party, party
Got a lion in my pocket y'all, say (Party)
Oh, and he's ready to roar (Party)
Keep singin' y'all
Say it
Say it

Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?
Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?

Ow
Thank you!

[baby cries]

[audience sounds]

[Verse 1]
There comes a time, in every man's life
When he get's tired of fooling around
Juggling hearts in a three ring circus
Someday will drive a body down to the ground
I never imagined that love would rain on me
And make me want to settle down

[Chorus]
Baby it's true, I think I do
And I just want to tell you that I wanna with you
(Baby, if you do too)
And baby if you do too
Forever, forever, baby I want you forever
I want to keep you for the rest of my life
(You can make right)
All that is wrong in my world
(You are my savior)
You can make right
(You are my light)
You are my savior, you are my light
(Forever I want you in my life)
Forever I want you in my life

(Every man's journey)
There comes a road in every man's journey
(Don't be afraid)
Don't be afraid to walk on his own
(I'm at that road)
I'm here to tell you that I'm at that road
(I'd rather walk it with)
And I'd rather walk it
(You than walk it alone)
With you than walk it alone
(You are my future)
You are my hero
(No past)
When I am with you, girl, I got no past
Oh baby my one and only desire
(Make this feeling last)
Is find some way in this dog gone world
(Sugar, it's true)
To make this feeling last
(I know I do)

[Chorus]
Oh baby it's true, I know I do
(To with you)
And I just want to tell you that
I want to with you
And baby if you do too
Forever, forever, I want you baby, baby forever
(You can make right)
I want to keep you for the rest of my life
(You are my savior)
All that is wrong in my world
(You are my light)
You can make right
Forever I want you, girl, in my life
You are my savior, you are my light

[Sheila E.]
Said the table to the chair
"You can hardly be aware
How I suffer from the heat
And from chilblains on my feet!
If we took a little walk
We might have a little talk!
Pray let us take the air!"
Said the table to the chair
Can't nobody
Said the chair to the table
"Now you know we are not able!
How foolishly you talk
When you know we cannot walk!"
Can't nobody
Said the table with a sigh
"It can do no harm to try
I've as many legs as you
Why can't we walk on two?"
Say, can't nobody
So they both went slowly down
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound
Can't nobody
As they toddled round and round
And everybody cried
As they hastened to their side
"See the table and the chair
Have come to take the air!"
But in going down an alley
To a castle in the valley
They completely lost their way
And wandered all the day
'Til to see them safely back
They paid a ducky-quack
And a beetle and a mouse
Who took them to their house
When they whispered to each other
"O delightful little brother!
\What a lovely walk we've taken!
Let us dine on beans and bacon!"

[Shelia E]

Everywhere everywhere, everywhere I go
Everywhere that I've been the only thing I see is
Is beautiful people, beautiful people
Beautiful people, beautiful people
Oh-whoa, don't you know? Don't you know?
Oh-whoa, you're beautiful, don't you know?
Oh-whoa, don't you know? Don't you know?
Oh-whoa, beautiful, don't you know, know, know?

Live your life, live your life, let the love inside

Don't let 'em bring you down, no
The beauty is inside you
Don't let 'em bring you down, no

[Chorus]
Oh-whoa, don't you know? Don't you know?
Oh-whoa, you're beautiful, don't you know?

Don't let 'em bring you down, no
The beauty is inside you
Don't let 'em bring you down, no

[Chorus]
Oh-whoa, don't you know? Don't you know?

It's your life, it's your life, got to live it right
Beautiful people

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Okay, Comme Des Garçons and some new Saint Laurent
I mix Gianni Versace with Coco Chanel
I throw on some Fendi, a mink when it's windy
Too cold for the Devil, I'm snowin' in Hell
Skatin' on marble, I flow in thin air
I'm dancin' on water, tip-toein' on nails
Can't walk in my shoes, can't roll in my wheels
Can't order my food, you throw up that meal
Can't do what I do, you can't do me
Yeah, I would not try to do you, I'm too me
Look at my sons' faces, I see the new me
I look into they face and I see the beauty
I take a vacation and go see some beautiful shit
Come back with a whole different view of this shit
My third eye just opened 'cause two wasn't shit
It's either that or too many hallucinogens
Got a cute-ass lil' bitch with a coke habit
That lil' bitch at my crib 'til the snow cappin'
When we fuck, man, that shit make her go faster
She so numb, man, that bitch ain't got no passion
Ain't no love in that bitch, ain't no romancin'
Ain't no love in that bitch, ain't got no magic
Ain't no judgin' that bitch 'cause we both addicts
She in love with this dick, it got gold status
Huh, Comme Des Garçons
I got that bread like a biscuit, a bun or croissant
Got the feds on my dizzick, they bustin' my balls
And she play with my dick, make me bust in my drawers
And I take off my Ethika, I'm gettin' naked
And she gettin' wet and now I'm gettin' erections
Oh, she say it spiritual when I have sex with her
I'm blessin' her, I think I pop too much ecs' with her
I fuck with my ex with her, you keep the rest of her
Don't care who left with her, I don't wan' F with her
Hop off that pedestal if you wan' leave
Then it was my pleasure, them thots is more pleasurable
I'm on my medical, smokin' my vegetable
Bro cut my revenue down to the decimal
Rollie, I stare at you, then I start tellin' you
How much I care for you, I diamond bezel you
Comme Des Garçons with that Yves Saint Laurent
I mix new CDG with some new YSL
I pop my trunk, how this new chopper feel?
All you get is "buck-buck" like a two-dollar bill
I'm so fucked up, they say, "You gotta chill"
So-so fucked up, Tunechi, you're outta here
Raw in the cut, smokin' dope, poppin' pills
Since I'm goin' so nuts, I drip pure almond milk
Ugh, Comme Des Garçons, fuck what they all say
Nigga, fuck what they done, I give a fuck what they on
I run in your place, like, "Honey, I'm home," like, "Honey, I'm wrong"
'Cause I tell you, "I love you," and honey, I don't
Got too many girlfriends, got too many girlfriends, one in my trunk
Ooh, money, I flaunt, ooh, money, I flaunt
I spend money on war, which one of y'all want war?
None of y'all want war, that's what the fuck l thought
Fuck you thought, I drop a contract on your heart
Give a fuck what that cost, suffer that loss
Stuffed in that box and dumped in that park
Fuck you thought, I drop a contract on your heart
Give a fuck what that cost, gotta suffer that loss
Stuffed in that box and dumped in that park
Okay, Comme Des Garçons and some new Saint Laurent
I mix Gianni Versace with Coco Chanel
Can't walk in my shoes, you can't roll in my wheels
You can't order my food, you gon throw up that meal
Comme Des Garçons

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Don't get me wrong, bitch get me right
Don't blow up my phone, no dynamite
She give me them jaws, that shark don't bite
Pussy I eat, don't feed me lies
She say that she gay, I say "hooray" (Yeah)
You just my type (Yeah), I love them dykes (Yeah)
I'm on a pill, she done some white (Shit)
Her Tongue was red, yeah, I run the light (Nyum)

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
IG, TikTok, nope, she say she saw me on Triller, yeah
Squad up, squadzilla, yeah
Throw a three hundred thou' out the window, yeah, uh
I'm rich but I'm slimey, go low on lil' mami
I look up, and she say she finna cum
I say "Yeah, I know," she say "Please take it slow"
And I hit her with the E-40 flow
This triple X-Rated, that triple-stacked ecstacy pill make her cum 'til she come undone
She put coke on my dick and her tongue get numb
She too numb to talk shit, she can't pump her gums
I flew to Paris just to say "bonjour"
Flew to Amsterdam just to smoke the good
Flew to Napa Valley just to taste the grapes
Flew to H-Town just to get an eight
I got the industry wanna be me
The same imagery, all I see is lil' me
I'm in the Rolls Royce with her doonies
Dripping all this milkshake on them Kelis
Like bling in the light
She wanna fuck on the king, not a knight
I pick her up, put her feet in the sky
When we fuck, sound like Tina and Ike
I put some cum in her drink, now it's spiked
She 'bout to drink it like white wine
Can't cry over spilled milk, but that cum look like milk in her mouth
If she spill it, I might cry
Pop the coco, some Rosé, Dom Pérignon
I pull up with a hoe out a catalogue
Drop her off then go pick up her famo
Knock her off, take her shit, then I vamos
Gucci links from the rocks as a choker
Matching bracelet and watch, I'm supposed to
R.I.P. to the Pop, make me smoke ya
S-A-P for the opp, buenos noches
M-O-B to the mob, cosa nostra
L-I-T and I'm high as the voltage
Extra lean, extra pot, extra dosage
Extra cream in the crop, that's the potion
Extra clips, extra shots at your soldiers
Seventeen in the Glock, no emotion
Extra bang, extra pop and explosion
Turn his body to ash, he need lotion
The clock always wrong but I'm right on time
It's Blood gang, bitch, we ball, yeah, like five on five
Fuck that, I'll pop me a seal, pour up a line
You know I got No Ceilings, so touch the sky
Yeah, ho, touch the sky

[Chorus 1: Lil Wayne]
Sometimes I laugh so hard that I cry
'Cause you just a joke now, that's brazy
I took a nap and you took your things
And I heard the doorknob, that's brazy
I told you don't trip, got your number blocked
And I done went ghost town, that's brazy
Where all the bitches is at that say
That they don't be doing all this and all that?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She tired of sleeping with bums
I can't even blame her for wantin' to eat cat
I been waking up in her ribs
Sometimes she tell me that loosen her back, damn
Please don't sing that nigga's song
If you do then we can't even kiss after that, yeah
Anytime I pull out that gat on them boys
They must think I'm finna relapse, damn, ayy
.40 cal sit on my lap, wait, don't try to give me no dap
Keep some distance between us, we COVID-19ers
We ain't with that sociable crap, wait
I seen some strippers get jacked, and ain't enough making it clap

[Chorus 2: Lil Wayne]
I know that you're with your friends going brazy, down bad
'Cause they keep asking where I'm at, damn babe
Sometimes they ask and sometimes you lie
But I bet they know now, they ain't brazy
Sometimes it's facts and sometimes it's lies
But they tell you scroll down, they shady
But I ain't gon trip 'cause your number blocked
And that shit is old now, and please say the "Baby," wait
Where all these bitches be at
Since you let them ruin all this and all that?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Fuck it, now my new thing postin' stories about where we went
I know you be spying all in my comments
Moved out Miami and forgot bout the Lambi'
Neighbors just called me, I said "You can have it"
Cut that girl off but I don't do no braggin'
It wasn't me man, it must've been Shaggy
She left me for dead but wanna jump in my casket
She runnin' red, I'm gone in a napkin
My heart is still beatin' and a nigga still need it
I'm back in love, look like I'm fallin' so deep
And she pillow talk with herself, bitch you just dreamin'
And shawty just text me some shit, I ain't read it
And then I delete it

[Chorus 3: Lil Wayne]
I know that she at his crib going crazy, down bad
'Cause what we had didn't last, damn baby
Sometimes I laugh so hard that I cry
'Cause you just a joke now, I'm brazy
I took a nap and you took your things
And I heard the doorknob, you brazy
But I ain't gon trip, 'cause your number blocked
And that shit is old now, and please say the "Baby," yeah

[DJ Drop: DJ Khaled]
That's right, No Ceilings 3
One time for Belaire and Bumbu, let's go

[Part I]

[Verse]
Working while they sleeping as usual
Percocets, I eat them like chewables
These niggas think they passed up, they think too much
If these niggas get too gassed up, I bring a few pumps
Yeah, Hershey chocolate candy skin, she ate all my nuts
Yeah, wifey caught me slipping once, okay, more than once
Yeah, we don't hit your block up, we blow that bitch up
Cappin', talkin' big shit until that shit don't flush
Yeah, they say my days are numbered, but I keep taking drugs
Baby, I know you see these X pills, pleasе take one
I'm a skater but I hеard your man a cheapskate, huh
Heard he rattin', now they moving his release date, huh, snitch
I just turned my main to my spouse
Could've bought her ass the tote purse or pouch, bought a house
Now baby got an ego twice the size of the crib
Now she see what I'm saying, she got eyes in her ears
Never turn your back on Weezy F B, God forbid
I might have to do a bid if she left me, I forgive
Twerkin', got a fatty in this bitch, doing butt flips
Way she roll her hips make her body look like Sunchips
Working out my demons, that's beautiful
And bae off of that riesling, she super loose
I'm smokin', she say pass it, she doing too much
Haven't done my taxes, fuckin' with Trump
She brought her skirt without the panties with the slit going up
Nigga caught you looking at it, it's okay, don't touch
Uh, someone bought the block up in Bel-Air, it was us
Check the clock and hit the shot, I swear this shit too clutch

[Part II]

[Chorus]
Three hundred shots, let the sweeper ring
'Til I don't feel my fingers, lil' bitch, pewm
Chicken pox on my trigger finger
How my trigger finger still itch, pewm

[Verse]
Copped three watches at the same time
Nigga, we are not on the same time
Shoulder strap on the strap, hangtime
Got the 40 on me like St. Ides
Granny, she was standing right there
Mercedes car, they call her Mrs. Mercy
Ever since the day I got her name tatted on my face, I been picture perfect
Taliban, nigga, ISIS, hand to hand, switching prices
Been dapper dan since the diaper, a gat, a bag, and a Bible
Young Obama go dumb, Osama
Hit him with the llama, he do the la bamba
Trade the private jet for an F1 bomber
We could go to war like it's the Bahamas
Lied to my hoes, never to my mama
Never tell my woes, lie to your honor
Money long though, nigga, anaconda
Let me add a comma
I'm way too high for niggas at the bottom
You a ladder climber
I'm the best rapper, nigga, that's the obvious
Got punchlines for you shadowboxers
You a kitty cat, I'm catastrophic
Rex 'bout to turn up, call up Roger
New fettuccine, new lasagna
Diamonds blinging so new they blind you
Diamonds sing like Ja Rule and Mya, No Ceilings

[Chorus]
Three hundred shots, let the sweeper ring
'Til I don't feel my fingers, lil' bitch, pewm
Chicken pox on my trigger finger
How my trigger finger still itch, pewm
Three hundred shots, let the sweeper ring
'Til I don't feel my fingers, lil' bitch, pewm
Chicken pox on my trigger finger
How my trigger finger still itch, pewm

[DJ Drop: DJ Khaled]
No Ceilings 3, Lil Wayne
We took the fucking ceiling off

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Brr, hello? I thought a broke nigga said something
I let that four-nickel headbutt him
I turn lil bro to a red puddle
Chop up his dead body, he a dead puzzle
I make a pussy hole beg for me
I fucked your ho like a caveman
I make her scream like a cavewoman
All of these hoes are some head hunters
Fuck on the period, red rubbers
All of my bros are some head busters
Ruby diamonds look like red bubbles
Money jumping call it Bunny Bread
Me and money, we like bread and butter
All the blood coming from his head
He a red head, he look like Peggy Bundy

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Hundreds and fifties, can't swap a dime for a penny
Can't swap a thot for a bitty
A lot for a plenty, you know that's a stupid decision
You know that's the newest edition
Exclusive edition, you know it's the Tunechi edition
You know that the roof a decision
The coupe is on skinnies, you know that the coupe is on blades
I'ma come through sittin' on scissors
It's beautiful bitches, you too cute
Two beautiful bitches but my bitch more beautiful, bitches
Bae you too delicious, bae, I'm the key, you the ignition
And we 'bout to vroom to the finish
That's true as religion, and I'm about to do it, I did it
I got the view and the vision
The mula the mission, bow, my shooters ain't missin'
They just shootin', just swish it
Head first with it, make it make sense
With the stove in the kitchen, I'ma make it make sense
Got some hoe that be stripping, I be taking their tips
Got some hoes that got bitches, I be taking their bitch
Warranty good, make sure I get a full refund
'Fore I give her back to the streets
I act like it's sweet, I treat the Lambo like a Nissan
Treat a trap house like a beach
Forever I rep with the set in the chain
I'm cumming, I don't let her know when I came
"I love you", I don't let her know it's a game
I clutch her, I don't let her go and I fuck her
Ain't no pillow talking, ain't no discussion
But she say she gon' hold me down like a button
But I know these hoes can't hold water in a bucket
She dropping shit monthly, period, ooh
All these hoes want is material, ooh
Kobe died, shit all mysterious, damn
Broke bitches start getting weirder, damn
Broke niggas start disappearing, yeah
Rich nigga ain't miss a meal, no
Broke bitches start interfering, damn
I get high and incoherent, damn
I don't know why, bitch ask Siri, yeah
Back in my hood, niggas used to call me Fred Durst
'Cause I had that rock white
She bending over, but I want some head first
I came in her mouth—drops mic
I thought a broke nigga said something
I hop on my skateboard and shred something
Bust up in that dressed like a red mummy
Repping Blood gang but you bled for me, lil

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Brr, hello? I thought a broke nigga said something
I let that four-nickel headbutt him
I turn lil bro to a red puddle
Chop up his dead body, he a dead puzzle
I make a pussy hole beg for me
I fucked your ho like a caveman
I make her scream like a cavewoman
All of these hoes are some head hunters
Fuck on the period, red rubbers
All of my bros are some head busters
Ruby diamonds look like red bubbles
Money jumping call it Bunny Bread
Me and money, we like bread and butter
All the blood coming from his head
He a red head, he look like Peggy Bundy

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Hundreds and fifties, can't swap a dime for a penny
Can't swap a thot for a baddie
Hundreds and fifties, can't swap a dime for a penny
You know that's a stupid decision
Hundreds and fifties, got blood on the money
Got blood on the bitches
Blood on the hundreds, blood on the fifties
Where the fuck is the ceilings?

No Ceilings 3, Euro, Hoody Baby, Gudda Gudda

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Young Mula, baby

[Verse 1: Euro]
I belong to the world, don't be selfish with me
When I go places with Wayne, you would think Elvis with me
My niggas livin' in Hell, they thinkin' Heaven sent me
When she scream, "Fuck love," I think she meant me
I get in the zone, applyin' pressure
You get the message, only I ain't text ya
Y'all like to gamble with life, you lucky I ain't bet ya
So you survived a few cats, don't let a lion get ya
If I ain't met ya, I ain't ever move ya
If there's a new year then I never knew ya
Look, my junior gon' have a future
And my senior gotta drive a Beamer
I wish my dawgs could turn they felonies to misdemeanors
Ayy, 'cause I met a girl with features out in Italy
Wish they had seen her
Shoulda took a picture, I packed condoms
I shoulda packed a book with scriptures
Put me in the Rock Hall of Fame with all the suicidal niggas, iconic figures
If rivals come for us, then they comin' with us
Tell 'em, "Run, Forrest," run for the fame, runnin' with us
What's one life to a hunnid killas?
All you heard was loud sirens and lighter flickers

[Verse 2: HoodyBaby]
I made a mill' right after breakfast, that's a power lunch
I fuck your bitch for 'bout a hour, that's a power fuck
I fuck your bitch up in the shower, that's a shower fuck
I fuck your bitch and now she pregnant, shit, we outta luck
HoodyBaby, Master P's 'boutta 'boutta buck
I been slackin', Major Bass, I could battle up
Picture me somewhere tropic, prolly mad as fuck
But I'm cool, body language break the barrier
Broken bitches wishin' that I fix her up and carry her
I was out in Italy, Roman like my carrier
I done lost hoes, turned around, I done lost bros
I just got ghost, hit a nigga with the Death Star

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Dear Heavenly Father, is there a church in the wild?
For the fugitives that I harbor
Yeah, we move like a mile, my op'll send out the orders
Got some people in Texas, their crib is right by the border
Place your order for cola, ain't talkin' pop like soda
Vacuum seal all the packages, tryna drown out the odor
No weapons formed against me shall prosper
The streets praise us like gospel
So we move and we roam like them Italian mobsters
Practice the code of silence, omérta
So ain't no talkin', we lurkin'
Find the strip where you workin'
Closed curtains, fear no man but God
Now they callin' me Lord
I pray on the sinners when bald palms touchin' like an applause
Synagogue is like the Pentagon, arms cover my flaws
Quiet storm but lion-hearted, I wake up with a roar
Call me the clean up, man, I sweep shit up like a chore
Then sweep your chick off her feet, put her in my stable of whores
Mentally stable, not sure, screws loose, shake to the floor
Breakin' records on the radio while breakin' the law
I keep my faith in the Lord, one day I'll make it to Forbes

[LAT] them thieves is comin', and what we takin' is yours

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Look, I'm not worthy of your controversy
I'm not thirsty, baby, I'm allergic
Giddy up, dick ridin', swervin'
Yeehaw, that's Kentucky Derby
I remember lyin' on the gurney
Thinkin' how I'ma die early
Never thought that I'd see thirty
Oh, the journey, had to fuckin' earn it
I go back in time when I was flirtin'
That time that I was flirtin' with uncertain
Never thought I'd be surrounded by
Housekeepers, chauffeurs, chefs and servants
Diamonds screamin', "Oh my lovely God"
Sippin' syrup, watchin' out for serpents
Touch my surface, then it's closed curtains
Oh my God, you're meetin' God in person
Oh my God, I want the squad alerted
And I come from it, they hop up like Kermit
Corner turnin' with marijuana burnin'
In the trunk, you squirmin', now here come to sermons
Oh my God, every thot a burden
I ain't worry, got her ridin' dirty
Trap house poppin' like it's Pee Wee Herman's
The plug alerted, now the socket workin'
Other niggas catchin' power surges
I'm determined just like my attorney
You other niggas, you ain't got attorneys
Order new trap house, I buy it furnished
I been listenin', listenin' to the money
It been tellin', tellin' me, "It's comin'"
Soundin' like music to my ears
Soundin' like a symphony of hundreds
Grandma always said that I'd be special
Mama always said that I'd be somethin'
I had to make sure that they wasn't guessin'
So I made the most out of they assumptions
Bein' careful 'round my pistol
Nigga all up in a bimbo
Bein' everything but simple
Got my deal without a demo, Tunechi

[DJ Drop: DJ Khaled]
So much fire, more fire

Look what you done done, yeah
Play with my heart and told me it's too bad
And then you hit me up
I'm tryna talk, you told you hit you back
It's crazy how you drive me brazy
I think I finally met my match
I try to let my mind navigate me
And end up bringing me right back

[Chorus]
I've been falling in the deep end
You've been giving me no reason
But I've been drowning in and sinking
Falling in the deep end
I've been falling in the deep end
You've been looking for a reason
But I've been crawling in and reaching, ooh
Falling in the deep end, deep end, deep end
Falling in the deep end, deep end, deep end
Falling in the deep end, deep end
Falling in thе deep end
Falling in the deep end

[Verse 2]
You tеll me I'm wrong
'Cause when I'm right it only makes you mad
But you want what you want
But how come I always want you bad?
It's brazy how you drive me crazy
I think I finally met my match
I know that this ain't how my mama raised me
But I done got too attached

[Chorus]
I've been falling in the deep end
You've been giving me no reason
But I've been drowning in and sinking
Falling in the deep end
I've been falling in the deep end
You've been looking for a reason
To dive in all up in the deep end
Falling in the deep end, deep end, deep end
Falling in the deep end, deep end, deep end
Falling in the deep end, deep end

Leave a note around his neck then take that gold from 'round his neck

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
These ain't no SD
Bitch, these Jimmy Choos, might be the Miu Mius
Might be the Giuseppes
Bitch, you could get left, so bitch, get me right
You gotta impress me
Lil' bitch walking 'round with her titties out
Like she gon' breastfeed
Police raiding my spot
They saw it was me and took selfies
Play with them guns
Soon as they pop I'm gon' hit my target
In front of his broad, in front of his daughters
I'm so remorseless
We in Miami in the middle of a pandemic
And we on a new beach
Working that salmon, runnin' that sushi
I cannot mention my hoes inside of my songs
'Cause I know they be bragging a lot
I can't keep these pills, getting high with these bitches
I'm supposed to be handing 'em out
Show me that nigga who say he getting rich off of dope
'Cause my niggas be jabbing a lot
I heard that you and them niggas you with ain't no joke
My niggas laughing out loud, yeah
That shit was awesome, took her to Nordstroms
Just had a foursome, didn't have to force 'em
You cannot come back around me
You turn your back on me, I cannot forgive
You need to stop fucking with strippers
Tou run into agents and giving 'em tips
We kill your slime, we take your work
We take your bitch, you a bitch
My bitch is a snob, my fool is a jerk
And I bet this missile don't miss

[Verse 2: YD]
Shorty might got a pole but won't pop shit
He be talking like he down to drop shit
Bitch I'm up in your crib and I don't got a key
I be all in yo shit like a locksmith (Get em)
And we ain't throwing hands, better stop it
You ain't see no white flag when we squash shit (Nah)
And you know what's gon' happen when Tune put me right on a track
Bitch, you know that's the squad shit
Heard your funds just got low, ain't no job, nigga
So you out here, and you bout to starve nigga
I was in your position, and back in the day, I was all by myself, I would rob niggas
Now my money up, I'm living large, nigga
Ain't no need to relive in the dark, nigga
Now I'm 'bout to skrrt off of the lot in the Bentley
And take up two spots when I park, nigga (Skrt)
Man, these niggas be boasting
I don't even drink on the liquor
'Cause when I skate, bitch, I need focus
No comedian joking, man
I hope he get his ass right on the stand so my youngins can roast him
Man, you know why I'm chosen, 'cause I ran here first in the game, put my foot down 'til that bitch was choking
This shit be promotion 'cause I'm smoking on this good kush, bitch, and it's potent

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Lean, water, intelligence, nigga finding your medicine
My weapons will knock an ottoman out of your residence
Got your wife on the edible, secret service
And she taking it down like the president
Can't survive in my element
If you never been in stride with the lions and elephants
When they free all my niggas then wherever Weezy be
Where I'm flying the felons in (Yup)
They be rhyming so predicate
Then, when you see 'em in person, they quiet and delicate
And 'til somebody die for the death of your brethren
I cannot buy what you selling in
We met at the Mandalay she live in San Jose
Visiting town with a friend today
When they hop in the Laundaulet
We 'bout to fuck over mandolins, champagne and creme brulée
Tell your little mans to stay in his place
Don't wanna get shot in your shin today
Nigga play on the internet, I don't get into that
I send a shot in your shin today
Way too many niggas and not enough bitches for all of this bitch shit
Too many to name, you know who to call
For real, some pimp shit
What you saying is not realistic
I just left Elliante the district
But I still go to Vice with the biscuit
Even still for a slice and I missed it
'Bout to gamble your life on a trip bitch
I be rolling the dice on on her lipstick
I'm a different type of sadistic
I don't look at the price when I get shit
I don't put in no ice when I sip shit
Lot of boomers and lights when I clip shit
Leave the room looking like I just flipped shit
She be riding me like I'm a ripstick
She say she want a body for Christmas
I'm living like some bucket list shit
If you don't like it suck a sick dick

Suck the dick, swallow the paraphernalia
She 'bout to swallow a whole la familia
Cum on, cum on, cum on, cum on Kamila
She got a tongue like she fuckin' reptilian
I'm hard as fuck, heard this bitch equilibrium
Cum on her face, that's just memorabilia

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Cum on Kamila
I make it rain on her like a Floridian
Her baby daddy, that nigga a idiot
I gave her magic and then disappear
And her man threw the Patek, the Richard look prettier
Maison Margiela, she call it "Margelia"
Cum on Kamila, fuck on her period
Baby I'm yours 'til I cut the umbilical, gone

[Verse 2: Jay Jones]
Bad bitch in the Hollywood hills, I got molly wood thrills
I got lean withdrawals, substitute it with the pills
Give me head in the car, throw it out behind the wheel
Know well, I don't know how to deal, shawty real, shawty real (Yeah)
La-Kamila, tongue like a lizard how she licked it up
If it go down, I bet she get it up
She gon' sell her soul for them Dior Chuck's
She gon' bust it open in a Rolls truck
You ain't got no hope left
I was like "whoa, Kemosabe"
They got plenty hoes in the lobby
Can't hop out the Mazi with a thottie
I got Percs, I got molly
Baby, you get perks when you poppin'
I come from the dirt, from the bottom
Bitch, twerk, I got options
Mi casa, su casa, that's for my masters imposter's
No room for imposter's, gotta run for them dollars
Got P's and went straight to the college, I'm gone

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Cum on Kamila, cum on Kamila
Her mouth look like a bowl of milk with no cereal
I put my spear in her like I'm Nigerian
Now she bi-curious, Ellen DeGeneres
Tunechi from Hollygrove, fuck 'til she comatose
Take off my 'Sace robe, fuck on my ironing board
Fuck in my skate park, cum on her face scar
Hol' up, wait for it, "boom" like a napalm
Fuck her for some Hermes, dick all in her cervix
She call me nobody 'cause she know nobody's perfect
Got her pussy with a purpose, I eat it like some Churches
I skeeted then I squirted, then I "arrive" to the "derci"
Bitch, take your fuckin' pants off, shake your fuckin' ass off
Suck it with your hands off, deep throat, can't cough
Tunechi out in Hollygrove, hit her with the dinosaur
Limpin' like her body blowin', drippin' like a snotty nose
Tell me how you love that, cum for me I'll bust back
Tell me where to cum at, ooh
Where my thumb at? Ooh
Every time she cum, she cry, that's a fun fact, ooh
I got somethin' for her eye, that's a cum-tact

Cum on Kamila, cum on Kamila

Cum on her face, that's just memorabilia

My tears so big, it's a tsunami
Her pussy so good, got me short winded
So bad to me, so good for me
Pool so big, got a yacht in it
Yacht so big, got a pool on it
This house is not a home when you not in it
Got a new bitch with me, shе just spot fillin’
World so big but it stop spinnin'
Tears so big it's a tsunami
Pussy so tight, I get locked in it
Lеave the lights on, we look like two diamonds, yeah

[Verse]
But we don't even talk no more (No)
We run outta words to say
We don't even joke no more
We run outta games to play
We don't make love no more
And when we do, it's not the same way
It's not the same way

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I fuckin' love you
On God, on his son too
You be actin' like it's untrue
You be actin', cut
Girl, you know I fuckin' love you
Why you actin' like it's just you?
Don't make me get someone to come through
Tie you up and make 'em fuck you, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Actin' funny when your hair fixed
Actin' funny, I ain't laugh, bitch
You, get your pussy, not your ass kissed, oh

[Chorus]
Pool so big, got a yacht in it
Yacht so big, got a pool on it
House empty when you not in it
Look up at the ceilin', see the roof fallin'
My world so big but it stop spinnin'
Ask her what it is, she say, "You callin'"
Pussy so good, I get short winded
So bad to me, so good for me
Pool so big, got a yacht in it
Yacht so big, got a pool on it
House not a home when you're not in it
Got a new bitch with me, she just spot fillin'
World so big but it stop spinnin'
Tears so big like a tsunami
Sweet as moonshine, got the moon shinin'
Leave the lights on, we like two diamonds, yeah

[Outro]
Bling, bling

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Three, uh

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm bout to shoot at a nigga, no layup
I pull up and step back and I get my J up, yea
Point-blank, I shoot at a nigga
Or shoot at her nigga from far like I'm Trae Young
Shoot at a nigga, no airball, ooh
Shoot at a nigga, no backboard
I break a full court press up at half-court
That's no cap like an afro

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
I swing that stick like Wayne Gretzky
I keep a K on me like I'm Coach K, Mike Krzyzewski
Hope you set tripping, then I gotta send shots
Get your whole set shot, quiet on the set bitch
Shoot at a nigga, no bank shot
Check the game clock, nigga, time is too precious
I shoot at a nigga, no rebound
Shoot the whole team down, rookies and veterans
She give me face time, no texting
She give me face through the zipper, bow
Open face, Tunechi got shooters like Golden State
Shoot at a nigga, no dribble, no handle
Shoot at a nigga, no dribble, no travel
Shoot at a nigga, no Euro-step
Still have my dribble, ain't using my pivot yet
Aim at his rim, and I hit the net
Shoot at the cheerleaders, blood on the pom-poms
Shoot your coach up, shoot the sidelines
Court side seats, get blood on the popcorn
Shoot you like Jordan, like Bron-Bron
Shoot at a nigga like Harden from the outside
Nigga can't guard, can't block mine
Shoot at a nigga, going hard from the foul line
He don't call, it's a hotline
Shoot at a nigga, no double-dribble
Shoot at a nigga, no crossover
Driveway looking like a toy store
I'ma ball, I'ma never turn the ball over
I'ma shoot at a nigga, on Mula
Pull up with two hundred guns, it's a shootout
Shoot at a nigga, no hooping, no hoopla
Tunechi, lil nigga, No Ceilings, no rooftop
I'm 'bout to spray at that nigga, no drizzle
Get down and lay down lil nigga, no pillow
I light up a J on a nigga, no Leno
I'm slime everyday on a nigga, no schedule
All  ofthese lil' niggas claiming they killas
Just holding up guns, taking pictures in the mirror
Pop me a seal, I pour a line and reseal it
Then I laugh at these niggas
Don't they look like my children?
Giggle, giggle, giggle, giggle
She lick it right after I bust—that shit tickle
She swallow a shot glass of nut like tequila
She like to talk when she fuck, I couldn't hear her
She like to walk on my rug, it's chinchilla
She wan' fuck on my rug, I say, "Bitch, that's chinchilla"
She like to masturbate while on her period
Then suck her finger, I swear she the weirdest
My trigger finger, that's all with my blood
Used to party with bloods, now Hollywood drugs
Got bitches on drugs in the car waiting for us
Waiting on there to fuck and then all day we fucking
And all night we bucking, all white, the cups in it
Cocaine is soft, all white deluxe
And his head might come off and you might see his guts
And it might make you barf and the memory blush
Run it, run it
I can't keep up 'cause I might be on blow
And I might be on rush, yeah, I might be on slow
'Cause I might be on codeine and promethazine
This ain't minor league bruh, I need ice in my punchy
Put ice on my nuts, that be icy as fuck
I'll be icy icy, very pricey
I be so lit up they call me "Chris Lighty"
You could get lit up just for some enlightment
Fuck the indictments
I fuck the crystal and I fuck the diamond
I fuck some swimmers, and I fuck some divers
Never been fishy, but I fuck the Pisces
I fuck the simple and I fuck the silent
I fuck the gentle and I fuck the kindly
I fuck the physical, I fuck the violent
Then I fuck the mental and I fuck the body

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm bout to shoot at a nigga, no layup
I pull up and step back and I get my J up, yeah
Point blank I shoot at a nigga
Or shoot at her nigga from far like I'm Trae Young
Shoot at a nigga, no airball, ooh
Shoot at a nigga, no backboard
I break a full court press up at half-court
That's no cap like an afro, ooh

[Intro]
Oh, yes
Yes, I did, baby
Yes, I did

[Verse 1]
It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know he's not for you?
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
'Cause I love you, I just tried to stay

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (I'ma be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna bе alright

[Verse 2]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control ovеr me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you?
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Ooh)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did it)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Bridge]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need (Need to do) to do to be okay (For me to be okay)
Never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Me living without you (Living without you)
But now it's time for me to make that move, oh woah
Ah, ah

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did, baby)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it (To my eyes)
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (Oh, no)

[Outro]
Be alright, yes (Oh, no)
Say's I'm gonna be alright
I´ve been loosing love, far from home I´ve been
Living like a dream, I can´t hold
Finding troubles where-ever I wanna
Feel your body get all this time, but it

It was always like a dream, it was always for fun but I
I was always in a dream, I was always on the run but I
See your´re getting all your needs, see you getting this far Imma
Leave you hanging in the tree, you will never be gone

I´ve been loosing all time
Leave your love it´s all right
Pardon me it´s all tied
Cause I wanna believe it´s true, I wanna believe in you

I was hoping for, changе to come but it
Never happеnd and, now you´re gone
Struggling hard to get, all along I was
Moving better then, now I won´t, but it

It was always like a dream, it was always for fun but I
I was always in a dream, I was always on the run but I
See your´re getting all your needs, see you getting this far Imma
Leave you hanging in the tree, you will never be gone
I´ve been loosing all time
Living through it all right
Finding all to us sometime
Cause I wanna believe it´s true, I wanna believe in you

I see and I feel I wanna stop
Wanna believe that I could be the one you want
All you see is the time that I´ve given up

Da da da da da da da

All the time I´ve been thinking I wanna stop
All you desire is a lie that I wanna drop
But it´s all just a thing that I´ve given up

Dam dam da da da da

I´ve been loosing all time
I wanna believe it´s true, I wanna believe in you

Seem to get a kick out of doing you cold
Oh, what the hell, you always surrender
What's this strange relationship that we hold on to?

Took the self-respect you ever had

The more you love me, sugar, the more it makes me mad

Didn't like the way you were, so I had to make you mine

Baby, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that, I hate to see you sad, hey-hey

[Intro]
We from the trench, my nigga
You know that we sat at the bench, my nigga
We came in from rags to riches
From ducking bullets out the tents, my nigga, uh
I know we never came in here with nothing
It turned into something, my nigga
With all my niggas on the field
Now I'm facing court cases, they got real time
I'll be damned, man, I'll spend all my money
Before I see one of my niggas be broke
Now we getting all type of dollars
You ain't with us if you wasn't with us before
I was all at the bottom, was down on my dick, dog
Niggas left me right there on the floor
Now that I got it, I'm finally poppin'
They gotta let a young nigga just get it and go

[Verse 1]
This for the ones that abandoned me:
My heart is still filled with some anger
I watched you pussy niggas, made me a strategy
I seen you niggas get back at me so many times
It done only made my heart the coldest
They tried to cancel me, send me right back to the trap
With the shooters, killers, and the junkies
I give a fuck if they hatin', they been hatin'
All the drama come from bitches I been dated
Diamonds on me, yeah, they lookin' refrigerated
Like karate, got them bitches in sensei
The mighty revenge on them niggas that been played me
I dropped a Benz on them niggas, I been hated
I'm the hood nigga that poppin' and demonstratin'
Drop the top and bitches hyperventilatin'
And it's still for ones who abandoned me:
You got to see me after all the tragedy
You got to see me after all the baggage
And you got to see me after all the bashin' me
I got these lil' hood niggas on go in my city
They goey, the diamonds are glowy
We heating shit up for the time it was snowy
They tried it on Tory, but they couldn't fold me

[Pre-Chorus]
These niggas they crazy, they wanna come get me
They pointed their finger, held it up against me
The D.A. wan' stop me, the judge and the jury
I'm stepping in them all to hell in Givenchy
I jump out the jet and I don't do no regular foreign
We flying that bitch to the moon
They see the penny and pull off the panties
Young nigga get money, you could do it too

[Chorus]
If you run it up, young niggas, run it up, young niggas
Run it up, young niggas, run it up, young niggas
I gotta win, God gotta help me
'Cause I'm from the slums, young niggas
Run it up, young niggas, run it up, young niggas

[Verse 2]
Ayy, this for you hoes that done dated me:
I would hope you bitches keep that energy
I got the blow on you bitches, respectively
I got to go on you niggas eventually
I got the .40, I pass to lil' brodie
Lil' shorty, he know that you niggas is dead to me
I put the battery all in his back
When I'm mixing the Hennessy up with his enemies
I tell him go and we goin', my young nigga blowin'
He throwin', we got it, we steppin', we gang and we going
I got a new Cullinan flowing all through the traffic
Through a ratchet bitch neighborhood just so she know it
I pull up and skrrt, skrrt, hit the poppers, the shottas go brrt, brrt
'Bout to send my young niggas to work, work
Pool table bitches 'bout to twerk

[Pre-Chorus]
These niggas they crazy, they wanna come get me
They pointed their finger, held it up against me
The D.A. wan' stop me, the judge and the jury
I'm stepping in them all to hell in Givenchy

We flying that bitch to the moon
They see the penny and pull off the panties
Young nigga get money, you could do it too

[Chorus]

[Outro]

This One Umbrella mob

[Verse 1]
I gave you all of me for none of you
Something that I don't ever do
You made me feel like I'm not good enough, yeah
And I don't wanna walk away, that's the last thing that I want
But, hey, I guess right now I have to do whatever's best for me (Best for me)

[Chorus]
I can't hold my breath no more
Tired of your selfish love
I can't be what you want
But I still wanna be loved
Never asked for nothin' else
Gotta do this for myself
I believed you loved me, girl
When I couldn't even love myself

[Verse 2]
I'm afraid of myself
You taught me how to hate myself
For you, oh, girl, I changed myself
And chained myself down, and then I start to blame myself
Back and forth with my head
Thinkin' 'bout what all you said
I swear it's been a week since I slept
'Cause mine don't feel the same as your bed
This ain't love, it's hard to fake it
You ain't mine, it's hard to face it
All of the time I wasted
I really tried to save us but

[Chorus]
I can't hold my breath no more
Tired of your selfish love
I can't be what you want
But I still wanna be loved
Never asked for nothin' else
Gotta do this for myself
I believed you loved me, girl
When I couldn't even love myself

A bunch of girls goin' wild when your chain flooded
And I had 'em like wow, cup dirty

[Verse 4: Future]
Dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman
Money on the counter, choppers on the floor
I just copped that tempo, DJ Mustard, woo
Way too much codeine and Adderall
We just count up big racks, woah
I know I'ma get my bitch back, woah
I count all these racks that I have on me now, I'ma have you like, "Woah"
Chanel N°9, Chanel N°5, well, you got 'em both

[Outro: Drake & Future]
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin'
They just spent like two or three weeks out the country
Them boys up to somethin', they just not just bluffin'
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin

Word
She’s got everything she needs
She’s an artist, she don’t look back
She’s got everything she needs
She’s an artist, she don’t look back
She can take the dark out of the nighttime
And paint the daytime black

You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
Down upon your knees

She never stumbles
She’s got no place to fall
She never stumbles
She’s got no place to fall
She’s nobody’s child
The Law can’t touch hеr at all
She wears an Egyptian ring
That sparkles bеfore she speaks
She wears an Egyptian ring
That sparkles before she speaks
She’s a hypnotist collector
You are a walking antique

Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
For Halloween give her a trumpet
And for Christmas, buy her a drum
My love she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn’t have to say she’s faithful
Yet she’s true, like ice, like fire
People carry roses
Make promises by the hours
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can’t buy her

In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall
Some speak of the future
My love she speaks softly
She knows there’s no success like failure
And that failure’s no success at all

The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even the pawn must hold a grudge
Statues made of matchsticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks, she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge
The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers’ nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
The wind howls like a hammer
The night blows cold and rainy
My love she’s like some raven
At my window with a broken wing
I was riding on the mayflower when I thought I spied some land
I yelled down to captain arab, I'll have ya understand
Who came running to the deck and said boys forget the whale
We're goin' over yonder. cut the engines. change the sails
Haul on that bowline we sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea

I think I'll call it america. I said as we hit land
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand
Captain arab he starting writing out some deeds
He said let's build us a fort and start buying the place with beads
Just then a cop come down the street crazy as a loon
They throws us all in jail for carryin' harpoons

Aw, me, I busted out don't even ask me how
I went lookin' for some help, I walked past a guernsey cow
Who directed me down to the bowery slums
Where people carried signs around sayin' ban the bums
I jumped right in line, sayin' I hope that I'm not late
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight
I went into a restaurant lookin' for the cook
I told him I was the editor of a famous etiquette book
The waitress he was handsome and he wore a powder blue cape
I ordered up some suzette, I said could you please make that crepe
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat
Food was flyin' everywhere I left without my hat

I didn't mean to be nosy but I went into a bank
To get some bail for arab the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley, when up comes this girl from france
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out an' robbed my boots an' was I on the street again

I rapped upon a house with a u.s. flag upon display
I said can you please help me out, I got some friends down the way
The man said get out of here I'll tear you limb from limb
I said you know, they refused jesus, too. he said you're not him
Get out of here before I break your bones. I ain't your pop
I decided to have him arrested and went looking for a cop

I ran right outside and hopped inside a cab
I went out the other door this english man said fab
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood
I ran right through the front door like a hobo sailor does
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was
I repeated that all my friends were in jail, with a sigh
He gave me his card and said call me if they die
I shook his hand and said goodbye and went back out on the street
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet
A pay phone was ringin' and it just about blew my mind
When I picked it up an' said hello, this foot came through the line
Well about this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
At bringing back any help for my friends and captain arab
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail
So I hocked my sailor's suit an' I got a coin to flip
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship

Well I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast guard boat went past
They asked me my name and I said captain kidd
They believed me but they wanted to know exactly what I did
I said for the pope of eyruke I was employed
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid

Well the last I heard of arab he was stuck on the side of a whale
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail
But the funniest thing was as I was leavin' the bay
I saw three ships sailing and they were all headed my way
I asked the captain what his name was an' how come he didn't drive a truck
He said his name was Columbus an' I just said good luck
Johnny’s in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I’m on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he’s got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid
It’s somethin’ you did
God knows when
But you’re doin’ it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin’ for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap
By the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten

Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin’ that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone’s tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A
Look out kid
Don’t matter what you did
Walk on your tiptoes
Don’t try “No-Doz”
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You don’t need a weatherman
To know which way the wind blows
Get sick, get well
Hang around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is goin’ to sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army, if you fail
Look out kid
You’re gonna get hit
But users, cheaters
Six-time losers
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Lookin’ for a new fool
Don’t follow leaders
Watch the parkin’ meters

Ah get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don’t steal, don’t lift
Twenty years of schoolin’
And they put you on the day shift
Look out kid
They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle
Don’t wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Don’t wanna be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump don’t work
’Cause the vandals took the handles
Ain’t it hard to stumble
And land in some funny lagoon?
Ain’t it hard to stumble
And land in some muddy lagoon?
Especially when it’s nine below zero
And three o’clock in the afternoon

Ain’t gonna hang no picture
Ain’t gonna hang no picture frame
Ain’t gonna hang no picture
Ain’t gonna hang no picture frame
Well, I might look like Robert Ford
But I feel just like a Jesse James

Well, I wish I was on some
Australian mountain range
Oh, I wish I was on some
Australian mountain range
I got no reason to be there, but I
Imagine it would be some kind of change
I got my dark sunglasses
I got for good luck my black tooth
I got my dark sunglasses
I’m carryin’ for good luck my black tooth
Don’t ask me nothin’ about nothin’
I just might tell you the truth

I got a woman in Jackson
I ain’t gonna say her name
I got a woman in Jackson
I ain’t gonna say her name
She’s a brown-skin woman, but I
Love her just the same
(playing Jingle Bells)

One two, one, two, three, four

He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can’t answer him back
You know that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it’s to say
He needs you to test his inventions

Hey, come out the window
Come on, it won't ruin you
Don't say that he will haunt you
You can go back any time you want to

He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to pick up his chalk
Or remember where he throws it
Hey, crawl out your window
Come on, it won't ruin you
Don't say that he will haunt you
You can go back to him any time you want to

Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
You must be awful frightened of the box where you keep him
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little tin women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come out the dark is beginning

Hey, crawl out your window
Come on, don't say it'll ruin you
Don't say that he will haunt you
You can go back to him any time you want to
Why should you have to be so frantic
You always wanted to live life in the past
Now why d you wanna be so Atlantic
You finally got your wish at last

You used to be oh so modest with your arm
Around your cigarette machine
Now you lost it all I see and you all you got is your
Two dollar bill and your hat full of gasoline

[Verse 1]
Say, say, say, s-say, say what your name is
Ooh, yeah, that fits you, girl
Tell me where you headed
Can I walk with you, girl?
You got that look in your eyes
That look like you give your boy here a good ol' time
And I'm on it, girl, that's right I'm on it, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
See this is the first time I had a girl whose looks set me on fire
I'm really tryna get to know you better, girl, you ain't gotta act like you shy
'Cause we gon' do something, something is gon' get done
And we gon' get crunk and have a lot of fun and I say

Oh, yes, you mean and vicious the way you switching, now I say

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Cut me down the middle
Fucked me up a little
You said I was your queen
I tried to give you everything
And now you want your freedom
You got just what you came for
A bit of fame and fortune
And I’m no longer needed

[Pre-Chorus]
You said it was over, wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends
You had a few secrets I was never told
Now everyone's talking and I'm the last to know

[Chorus 1]
Now I'm in the middle of Heartbreak City (Heartbreak City)
'Cause I'm in the middlе of a world not pretty (World not pretty)
Your clevеr game got the best of me (Best of me)
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me (Rest of me)
'Cause I'm in Heartbreak City

[Verse 2]
Tore me into pieces
Didn't have no damn reason
I let you in my house
You helped yourself to everything
And left me with your mess
I curse the day we met
The memory is haunting me
I wish I could forget

[Pre-Chorus]
You said it was over, wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends
You had a few secrets I was never told
Now everyone's talking and I'm the last to know

[Chorus 2]
I'm in the middle of Heartbreak City (Heartbreak City)
Now I'm in the middle of a world not pretty (World not pretty)
Now I'm in the middle of Heartbreak City (Heartbreak city)
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty (World not pretty)
Your clever game got the best of me (Best of me)
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me (Rest of me)
'Cause I'm in Heartbreak City

[Outro]
And it's not that pretty
And I still feel shitty

Think you might need a license, got my life at risk
You might be a psycho, controlling my mind with my dick

[Verse 4: The Kid LAROI]
Yeah, you might be, it's likely we gon' make a movie, Spike Lee
Top me off, lip stains on my white tee
She gave me Supreme and I thought that lil' bitch was a Hypebeast
Now I'm sad and alone wishing you were beside me

[Outro: The Kid LAROI & Corbin]
Oh, baby I, I wanna know
Will you break me, tonight? I wanna show you
You deserve it baby, I, I know you
I would never hurt you, only if I'm told to
Oh, baby I, I wanna know
Will you break me, tonight? I wanna show you
You deserve it baby, I, I know you
I would never hurt you, only if I'm told to (Told to, told to, told to)

[Intro]
There's only one bitch
Britney

[Verse 1]
Look in the mirror
Who do I see? Who do I wanna be today?
If you came for a show, which role should I take?
Fading to gray, so do we make a big mistake?
True colors'll show, baby, just put me on display

[Pre-Chorus]
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

[Chorus]
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah
Up and down, up and down
Up and down, up and down (down)
Up and down, up and down
Up and down, up and down (down)
Up and down, up and down
Up and down, up and down (down)

My love is, up and down
My love is, up and down
My love is, up and down
My love is, up and down
My love is, up and down

[Bridge]
I'm in the palm of your hand
My temperature is at your command
By my demand
And now I'm falling for you
I turn to golden from blue
And you do too, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

[Chorus]
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah
Up and down, up and down
Up and down, up and down (drop it)
My love is, up and down
My love is, up and down
My love is, up and down
My love is, up and down
My love is, up and down
My love is, up and down
My love is, up and down
My love is, up and down
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
I seen you on the 'Gram posted with your new man
And I heard he treats you better than what I did
He do everything that I can't, he buy you flowers and bags
And it's cool, but he is not the man that I am
And that's why you callin' my phone whenever that you're alone
Blowin' me up and tellin' me all that nonsense
He better for you but can't do the things that I can
And whenever I see you out with him, it's awkward 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I know about all the lies you tell
The things that you do when he's not there, oh
Girl, I know that you can't afford all them double C bags, wonder where you got them, oh
It's cool, I won't say nothin', I'm a player like that
It's cool, I won't say nothin', I won't play you like that (Oh)
But I know about the lies you would tell
The things you would do, I've been there before, uh

[Chorus]
This shit ain't nothin' new (No)

[Verse 1]
Look at my face, what you think?
She know I'm cute, uh, that's why you fucked (True)
I'm in a whole 'nother league, to be frank
That's why these hoes fuck with me, I got bank
I'm a stoner motherfucker, twisted up like candy cane
Put her hands up by her head and dance like VV's in my chain
Fuck your feelings, young Aminé, I'ma let her do her thing now
Out in Tokyo the strippers call me by my name now

[Chorus]
Shawty suckin', fuckin' like she work for Mr. Clean
Higher than a motherfucker, this feel like a dream
Didn't make the bathroom, so we fuckin' on the sink
Think I'm catchin' feelings, but it's probably just my drink
Like it's nothin'
Sippin' nothin', can't even function (Yeah)
Yeah, I ran out, ran out, now I'm buzzin'
Sippin' nothin', can't even function (Look, that's right)

[Verse 2]
Fifteen for the chain, smokin' like I can't
Louis on my shades, shawty want it and she thinks
She was down for the ride, down for the cause
Down for my high, yeah, down for the law, yeah
Welcome to Aminé University
Ain't no nigga workin' like me, they gon' have to work for me
Limbo, Limbo, Limbo, Limbo, Limbo, I'm a busy bee
Fifty bands for my furniture, these niggas can't fuck with me

[Chorus]
Shawty suckin', fuckin' like she work for Mr. Clean
Higher than a motherfucker, this feel like a dream
Didn't make the bathroom, so we fuckin' on the sink
Think I'm catchin' feelings, but it's probably just my drink
Like it's nothin'
Sippin' nothin', can't even function (Yeah)
Yeah, I ran out, ran out, now I'm buzzin'
Sippin' nothin', can't even function (Yeah)

[Chorus: Valee & Aminé]
Still got lost when I came out there
I got ten Gucci shoes, that's five pairs
My roof is missin', that bitch not there
I got your bitch with me, she not there
Smoke with the windows up, gelato air
Fucked that ho, then got the fuck out of there
SRT-8 truck, it don't got a spare
Promethazine, bitch, I don't gotta share
Still got lost when I came out there
I got one Louis shoe worth five pairs
She think I care, my fucks not there
I think I'm Leo and pussy the bear
Smoke with the windows up, gelato air
I got on ice and you went to Claire's
She called me over to pull on her hair
Swallowed my kids, I bought her Chanel

[Verse: Aminé]
Doors up with the roof gone, get your flows up
Niggas wanna act dot com (Ayy)
Threats don't get taken lightly or put inside a song (True)
I'll show up at your front door
Can't have smoke with a nigga too broke (Hell no)
That's a bad look, where the facts book?
Probably should've stayed my ass at home (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yee)
Twerk some (West Coast), work some (West Coast)
Ass on stupid dumb (Goddamn)
Chit-chat, don't do that
I don't really care where you from (West Coast)

Pinky ring shine like the sun (Brr)

[Chorus: Valee & Aminé]
Still got lost when I came out there

You say you poppin', but your crowd be soundin' chirped up
Them crickets louder than yo' baby mama's first cub, nigga, get your work up

[Verse 1: Aminé]
My dawgs with me like we in Petco
I'm a OG, you a retro (Ugh)
The niggas hatin' on me ride the metro
I earned so much, I'm Ernesto
Been doin' this shit from the get-go
And my eyes real, real low from the petrol (True)
The snakes gon' hate, let the Drac' go
But you can't hate when my chain cost your payroll (Damn)
Pen game good and my dick good (Wow)
I really wish a bitch would
Got her ass out, she a standout (Mm)
And she got a kid, I'm a dad now
TSA trip with the pat-down
Feel like Herbo when a nigga got them racks out
What I gotta do to go dumb?
Your girlfriend know where I'm from
I'm a west coast nigga, but you already know (Ooh-wee)
I got hunnids in my pockets and your bitch at the door
I'm like DiCaprio on Wall Street
I'ma hustle real hard 'til they off me
I'm a wolf in the pack like I'm Lil B
Nigga, you can't faze me, you crazy?

[Chorus: Aminé & Saba]
I really gotta talk this talk, I really gotta walk this walk (Say what?)
I really gotta talk my shit (Brr, true), I really gotta make some calls (Yeah, true, true)
I really gotta talk this talk (Yes, I do), I really gotta walk this walk (Goddamn)
I really gotta let 'em know I ain't here for fuckin' jokes (No way)

[Verse 2: Saba]
I witnessed death, I'm still livin', the perfect juxtaposition (Yeah)
Throw on my joggers and Jordans, my shorty hold me up like Jordan and Pippen, the flu game
I flew over continents just losin' scholarships, they was just tryna get rid of us niggas
I just say screw 'em like Phillips with us
Philanthro-penile, I peed in a cup for my niggas
Who knew they were reekin' of drugs
And a system for you down and not to come up
Nigga gon' shoot down your dream for the club
Still ain't gettin' in, still aimin' to win
I had to move out, I still can't with the fam (Yeah)
Her shit be movin', I still can't really dance
I had to lose all that shit I was taught
I had to duke it out, I had to fault
I had to fight, wasn't really one to talk

[Chorus: Aminé & Saba]
I really gotta talk this talk, I really gotta walk this walk (Say what?)
I really gotta talk my shit (Brr, true), I really make some calls (Yeah, true, true)
I really gotta talk this talk (Yes, I do), I really gotta walk this walk (Goddamn)
I really gotta let 'em know I ain't here for fuckin' jokes (No way)

[Intro: Aminé]
What's my motherfuckin' name? Yeah
Aminé doin' fine, but Adam feeling compromised
Who's to blame? Yeah
Is it myself or my conscious or my health? Nigga, I can't comp— (Hey)

[Verse 1: Aminé]
What the fuck's a shot if the safety on?
Lotta niggas bark, but the bite don't ever tag along
I can't even go inside the store no mo'
I'm just shy and I don't wanna take a photo
But I do it and I'm nice, then I give 'em promo
Then he really got the nerve to ask a nigga for mo'
I'm eatin' lunch with my mom, nigga, get out my zone
Then he post a pic up and say, "Aminé a ho"

[Chorus: Aminé & Toosii]
I can't sleep, nigga (I can't sleep, nah)
Paranoia on my mind, got me gone sometimes (I can't sleep)
Can't eat, nigga, yeah
Anxiety got the best of me, uh-uh (I can't sleep)
I can't sleep, nigga (I can't sleep, nah)
Paranoia on my mind got me gone sometimes (I can't sleep)
Can't eat, nigga, yeah
Anxiety got the best of me, uh-uh (I can't sleep, uh, yeah, uh)

[Verse 2: Toosii]
No more anxiety got the best of me
Fuck 'em, let 'em rest in peace
If they hate then let 'em rest in piss
You don't know half the shit I did just so I can go and flex my wrist
Yeah, that's Toosii, that nigga be textin' my bitch
Okay, true but I ain't mean it, I mean, ayy
I call her by the wrong name and tell her that I mean "bae"
And she okay with it 'cause I ain't the same person I used to be
I'm a star now, I'm goin' far now, look, dude, you gotta get used to me
Our dinners at the table, I remember I wasn't able
You got bitch ways like Mabel, paranoid I'm signed to a label
Ayy, what the fuck you mean 'cause I don't take a pic that mean I'm a ho?
You a dude, what's up with you, bro?

[Chorus: Aminé & Toosii]
I can't sleep, nigga (I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep)
Paranoia on my mind got me gone sometimes (I can't sleep)
Can't eat, nigga (I can't eat, I can't eat, I can't eat), yeah
Anxiety got the best of me, uh-uh (I can't sleep)

Paranoia on my mind got me gone sometimes (I can't sleep)
Can't eat, nigga (I can't eat, I can't eat, I can't eat), yeah
Anxiety got the best of me, uh-uh (I can't sleep)

[Outro: Toosii]
I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep
I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep

[Intro: Marche Black]
When you judge me
You make me feel ugly
No need to be sorry
'Cause I'm stayin' strong
Mama taught me
To stand on my two feet
Your words couldn't phase me
So I'm stayin' strong

[Chorus: Aminé]
I'm solid (I'm solid, solid), I promise (I'm solid, solid)

[Post-Chorus: Aminé]
(Solid)

[Verse: Aminé]
Let's make this shit clear, I'm not your nigga or your nigger
(No)
If you ain't Black, you know the drill, shut the fuck up (Yeah)
Know you hear me, this ain't cursive (Cursive), your judgement isn't workin'
I got bigger fish to fry, so my kindness got a purpose
Got a light skin friend, look like Sammy Sosa
Dark skin friend look like Sammy Sosa (True)
Hard to keep composure when your issues need some closure (Yеah)
And when I'm gettin' closer, patiеnce testin' more than ever (Brr)
The same motherfuckers that's gon' rattle they guns
Be the same that hate hijabs and Black History Month (True)
I always thought my red Mercedes would change everything (Yeah)
I guess that Ye line really meant everything

[Chorus: Aminé & Marche Black]
I'm solid (I'm solid), I'm solid (I'm solid)
I'm solid (I'm solid), I'm solid (I'm solid)

I'm solid (Solid), I'm solid (Solid)
I'm solid (Solid), I'm solid (Solid)
I'm solid (Solid), I'm solid (Solid, solid, solid, solid, solid)

Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me

From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know

Cracks in the pavement
Cracks in the road
Cracks in the ceiling
Where the bathtube overflowed, overflowed
Uh!
Holes in the gutters
Holes in the slate
Holes in the carpet
But i won't evacuate
I love this house, it's where i'll stay
Eat and sleep the night and day
I love this house, it's where i'll be
For you to spend some time with me
I love this house
Damp in the basement
Damp in the hall
Damp in the living room
That's climbing up the wall, up the wall
Rust in the drainpipe
Rust in the spout
Rust in the radiators
Still won't get me out
I love this house, it's where i'll stay
Eat and sleep the night and day
I love this house, it's where i'll be
For you to spend some time with me
I love this house
Hot in the summer, rattling windows, teeth and knees
Perfect place for cat and mouse
But i never mind, i love this house
Ow!
Cracks in the pavement
Cracks in the road
Cracks in the ceiling
Where the bathtube overflow
Holes in the gutters
Holes in the slate
Holes in the carpet
But i won't evacuate
I love this house, it's where i'll stay
To eat and sleep the night and day
I love this house, it's where i'll be
For you to spend some time with me
I love this house
(One, two, three, four)

Well, she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
Ooh, when I saw her standing there?

Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
Ooh, when I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh we danced through thе night
And we held each othеr tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Ooh, since I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went, "Boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well since I saw her standing there
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
…god
Had it 

[?] in my yard
For my, that's still locked up in the yard
Yeah, that's on me…
That boy
Took my love away
Though he'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again
That boy
Isn't good for you
Though he may want you, too
This boy wants you back again
Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, but oh my
That boy won't be happy
'Til he's seen you cry
This boy
Wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again
This boy, this boy, this boy
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

Pa, pa, pa
See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needеd mending
See how they run
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wondеr how you manage to make ends meet

[Intro: Maejor Ali]

Aye girl

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I thought that we were closer
Now it feels like I don’t even know her
You would think that I never used to hold her
She believes everything that they told her
She was mad there was girls in the folder
Tried to tell her it was nothing but a photo
She gets advice from a friend that’s lonely
I hope she hears these words that I say

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don’t listen to your friends
Follow your heart baby and let me in
Follow your heart baby and know that I’m here
You know that I love you girl
So don’t have no fear

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
She won’t even talk to me
She won’t even say a word
Is that how it’s supposed to be?
She used to be close to me, close to me
I thought it was meant to be
I thought it was destiny
Is that how it’s supposed to be?
She used to be close to me, close to me, close to me

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
(unknown)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don’t listen to your friends
Follow your heart baby and let me in
Follow your heart baby and know that I’m here
You know that I love you girl
So don’t have no fear

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Poo Bear]
She won’t even talk to me
She won’t even say a word
Is that how it’s supposed to be?
She used to be close to me, close to me
I thought it was meant to be
I thought it was destiny
Is that how it’s supposed to be?
She used to be close to me (Close to me)
Close to me (close to me), close to me

[Verse 3: Maejor Ali]
JB, I’ve been through the same thing
That’s that ‘cry me a river’ pain
Need to tell her how you feel as your last saying
I know it’s really hard to deal with a heartbreak
(She wouldn’t talk)
You can tell that she don’t wanna talk or say a word
Won’t say a word to me
She don't wanna say a word to me
This hurt me

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber, Maejor Ali & Poo Bear]
Don’t listen to your friends
Follow your heart, baby and let me in
Follow your heart, baby, you know that I’m here
Know that I love you girl
So don’t have no fear (Don'’t have no fear) (Fear)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Poo Bear]
She won’t even talk to me (She won’t even talk to me)
She won’t even say a word (Won’t even say a word)
Is that how it’s supposed to be? (How it’s supposed to be)
She used to be close to me, close to me
I thought it was meant to be (Thought it was meant to be)
I thought it was destiny (Thought it was destiny)
Is that how it’s supposed to be? (That how it’s supposed to be?)
She used to be close to me, close to me, close to me
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at being bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad

[Verse 1]
I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

[Chorus]
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

[Verse 2]
No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

[Chorus]
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

[Bridge]
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

[Chorus]
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
(Like sleeping and cocaine)
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
(To go our separate ways, oh)
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
I was standing
On the the door
On the banks
Of my home
When I go
I will feel
All alone
That's when I'm real
Time I shoot
Real real
What do I do
If I lose?

I don't care
Anyway
It's been a long time
Hard days
Call alone
Inside the phone
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
I'm alone
Anyway
I will achieve
I'm in the game
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
I see him
In the fight
All alone
Getting high
What if I lose?
What if I lose?

You say you want
To be alone
I don't care
On the phone
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
Whaaoa
Stop that
I don't see
All the truth
I believe
What do I do?
What do I do?
Follow if I lose
I can't fall
I can't fall on you
What if I lose?
So what if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?

(What if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?)

Viking Dan
Is on the way
I don't care
I'd be okay
I'd be okay
I'd be okay
I'd be okay
I'd be okay
I'd be okay
I'd be okay
I'd be
I'd
I'd
I'd
I
When I let go of your throat sweet throttle
And I clean the lash of your black belt model
I set the sun
On a big wheeled wagon
I'm braggin'
I'm always in love

When I hold the cold in my jet-lagged palm
I yolk so long, I forget my mother
When I load the moon
Right on my back
It's a drag, I snag
I'm always in love

It's a drag, I snag
I'm always in love

I wonder why my heart's full of holes
And my hair, it just, just grows and grows
And your whiskey is on my breath
This is just a test
I don't get the connection
But I'm always in love
I don't get the connection
But I'm always in love

(That song's called "You're a V.I.P. at Horde")
I'm the boy that looks excited
I'm the boy that falls apart
Candyfloss, she kissed me first and
I'm the boy who eats his heart out

I know I should be more careful
I know I should watch where I've been
Candyfloss, and she's a safe cracker
She kissed me first, and then broke in

I'm the boy with the poetry power
She's the girl who dreams of flowers
Every time I make a rhyme
I live my life like I wasn't invited

She's the girl with the wonderful fingers
She surrenders all her language
I'm the girl who left the boyfriend
She's the boss, and I'm her baggage

Oh whoa
Oh whoa
Oh whoa
Oh, and she has all the power
I'm the boy who falls apart
Candyfloss, a plot device
Kiss me first and get me started

We'll slip and slide on the stay-together landmine
Make my mind up: I'll never be myself
I'm the boy who takes his shirt off
I'm the boy who's gone to hell

Oh whoa
It would be a waste of time
For me to say to you
Everything that's on my mind
We should do

All that matters now
All that matters now
Make it up somehow
Make it up somehow

We will be back on our track
In no time, girl
I believe all we need
Is a little time, we can see all

All that matters now
All that matters now
I'll make it up some how
Make it up somehow

I'm in no hurry
To hang up with you
To hang up with you
To hang up with you
All that matters now
All that matters now
I'll make it up somehow
Get you back somehow

I'm in no hurry
To hang up with you
To hang up with you
To hang up with you
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby, "Can't you see
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between"

Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I love you

I told a girl that my prospects were good
And she said baby, "It's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time"

Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I love you
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah
Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I love you

I told that girl I can start right away
And she said, "Listen baby I got something to say
I got no car and it's brеaking my heart
But I've found a driver and that's a start"

Baby you can drivе my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I love you
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah

[Intro]
Pick it up

[Verse 1: Laura Les & Dylan Brady]
Wanted some speakers, Xbox, and t-shirts
I've been good like every single day
Looked under my tree, my box was empty
Santa made an enemy that day (What the fuck?)
Done being jolly, time to be naughty
Think it's time we settle up the score
Fill up the wishlist, let's cause some mischief
Grab my keys, I'm headin' out the door

[Pre-Chorus: Dylan Brady & Laura Les]
I've been good for way too long
Gonna get the shit I want (Ah, ah)

[Chorus: Dylan Brady, Laura Les & Both]
Never gave me a goddamn thing that I want
I was good every day but he didn't give a fuck
This year, put the top on the back of the truck
Santa's banging on the back of the truck
Never gave me a goddamn thing that I want
I was good every day but he didn't give a fuck
This year, put the top on the back of the truck
Santa's banging on the back of the truck

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2: Laura Les & Dylan Brady]
He's watching TV, he doesn't see me
Go and get the bag out of his sleigh
Elves in the kitchen heard the ignition
Think it's time we make our getaway
Chains on the tires, he's right behind us
Screaming 'cause we stole his magic bag (Get back here)
Boots full of lead feet, gas in the Chevy
Hundred-fifty miles on the dash

[Pre-Chorus: Dylan Brady & Laura Les]
I've been good for way too long
Gonna get the shit I want (Ah, ah)

[Chorus: Dylan Brady, Laura Les & Both]
Never gave me a goddamn thing that I want
I was good every day but he didn't give a fuck
This year, put the top on the back of the truck
Santa's banging on the back of the truck
Never gave me a goddamn thing that I want
I was good every day but he didn't give a fuck
This year, put the top on the back of the truck
Santa's banging on the back of the truck

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 1]
Take your nose off my keyboard What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4 Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going Straight to the top, rooftop glows With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland A whole lotta friends, first flight from PolandA whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause

[Verse 2]
If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city
Need proof, ask your girl's titties, she on the right side
SSL on the left, saying we the best
She wants to be friends with the crew
Take a lot of pics and travel where we move
Model on stage while I'm singing in her ear
20,000 fans get jealous up in here
They don't even care, girl, give it a rest
Ain't no fucking pussy gonna stick out from the rest
Girls with big breasts ain't shit without leg
'Least in my books so put me through this test, I could care less
Penelope Cruz, Natalie Portman, please holla at your dude
Used to rap blues for the girls with tattoos
Used to rap blues for the girls with tattoos
Don't you forget it, girls like Gia, girls with no visas
Addicted to the life, french girls named Mia
Cause my chick might be the next Keira Knightley
So baby, you can talk if you want, talk if you want
Talk if you want, talk if you want

Like a cloud, his fingers explode
On the typewriter ribbon, the shadow grows
His heart's in a bowl behind the bank
And every evening when he gets home
Make his supper, and eat it alone
His black shirt cries while his shoes get cold

Tried and true, that's you
Tried and true, that's you

Guess I'm lucky to have you here
In my kitchen, in your chair
Sometimes I forget that you're even thеre

Tried and true, that's you
Triеd and true, that's you

One summer, a suicide
Another autumn, a traveler's guide
He hits snooze twice before he dies
And every evening when he gets home
To make his supper and eat it alone
His black shirt cries while his shoes get cold
Tried and true, woohoo
Tried and true, woohoo

Tried and true, woohoo
Tried and true, woohoo
Genuine
Day will come
When the wind
Decides to run
And shakes the stairs
That stab the wall
And turns a page
In a future age

Some trees will bend
And some will fall
But then again
So will us all
Let's turn our prayers
To outrageous dares
And mark our page
In a future age
We'll find a way, regardless
To make some sense out of this mess
Oh it's a test, but I believe
A kiss is all we need

All the above, for being in love
Shouldn't that alone be enough?
Oh, it's tough when love's a weed
It grows inside of me

Nothing's ever gonna stand in my
Nothing's ever gonna stand in my
Nothing's ever gonna stand in my way again

Waste the days, waste the nights
Downplay being uptight
Oh that's right, I still believe
It's time to leave

Nothing's ever gonna stand in my
Nothing's ever gonna stand in my
Nothing's ever gonna stand in my way again
A watch that ticks is wrapped around my wrist
I'm a bomb regardless
I'm a bomb regardless

We'll find a way, regardless
To make some sense out of this mess
Oh I guess I believe
A kiss is all we need

Nothing's ever gonna stand in our
Nothing's ever gonna stand in our
Nothing's ever gonna...
Ooh ooh what do you do
No one else can dance like you
So what's all the fuss
There ain't nobody that spies like us
Hey hey what do you say
Someone took your plans away
So what's all the fuss
There ain't nobody that spies like us
Hey don't feel afraid
Of an undercover aid
There's no need to fuss
There ain't nobody that spies like us
Spies like us
We don't know the meaning of fear
We play every minute by ear
One for all and all for one
Everybody's on thе run
Especially at this time of year
Ooh ooh what do you do
No onе else can dance like you
So what's all the fuss
There ain't nobody got spies like us
Hey hey what do you say
No one else can look that way
So what's all the fuss
There ain't nobody got spies like us
We get there by hook or by crook
We don't do a thing by…

[Verse 1: Ant Clemons & Jeremih]
Hope that she has your eyes
And that God gives her your smile
Will you take on the ring of our life
Just to give our baby a good night
Ain't no formula, 'cause we did the math
On the August night, when we both went half
Four more months to go, since we waited five
Will our fam' get close, before she arrives?
Will we have to start smokin' in the kitchen now?
Trade this two-door in for somethin' more spacious now?
Will you tell her the truth 'bout God's love and how (How)

[Bridge: Ant Clemons & Jeremih]
How she's lovely, shе's lovely, she's (She's) lovеly (She's)
(Love)
'Cause she was made for love (Love, love), love (Love)
Made for love (Made for love)

'Cause she was made for love

First day, started hangin' out, celebratin’ your birthday

'Cause I was blind to see
That you were right in front of me (You were right in front of me)
You were right in front of me
Girl (You were right in front of me)
I was blind to see (I was, I was blind to see)
That you were right in front of me (That you were right in front of me)

[Verse]
Hey (You put me in a)
Daze (Each and every)
Day (So in love with everything you do, I'm really feelin' you)
Babe (I hope these feelings)
Stay (It's a sense I could feel, but just can't explain)

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say? (Say)
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You’re breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
K-kinda busy (I’m kinda busy), k-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy
K-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy), k-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play (Play)
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should’ve made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won’t stop calling me, I'm kinda busy

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop callin’, stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin’, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, еh, eh, eh, eh, еh, eh
Stop telephoning me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)

[Break: Beyoncé]
You, my phone
Won't, no faster
Put, leave, no faster
You, my phone
Won't, no faster
Put, leave

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Boy, the way you blowin' up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home 'cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer

[Verse 4: Lady Gaga & Beyoncé]
It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes, I feel like I live in Grand Central Station (Station)
Tonight, I'm not taking no calls 'cause I'll be dancing
(Tonight, I'm dancing) 'Cause I'll be dancing
(Tonight, I'm dancing) 'Cause I'll be dancing
(Tonight, I'm dancing) 'Cause I'll be dancing
(Tonight, I'm dancing) 'Cause I'll be dancing

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

[Verse 1]
Perfect child
Plugged in since the womb
Prophet of the dune
In this electric tomb
Man has made
An omnipresent force
Heading on a course
For interstellar shores

[Verse 2]
God machine
Malfunctioned as it grew
And the circuits blew
Falling down on you
Now you're free
Unplug from the source
No more underscores
Open up the doors

[Chorus]
Feeling
Oh God, the feeling
We need some healing
We need some healing
God knows if you feel defeated
You have been cheated
You have retreated

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Feeling
Oh God, the feeling
We need some healing
We need some healing
God knows if you feel defeated
You have been cheated
You have retreated

[Verse 1]
Sorrows of the Earth
May our tears of rain wash down to bathe you
This is what life is worth
When the fires still burn and rage all around

[Refrain]
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Fire still burning on the ground

[Verse 2]
Follow the fearsome sound
As they march to battle, hear the drums pound
We do not fight for war
But to save the lives of those who do so

[Refrain]
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Fire still burning on the ground

[Chorus]
Can you feel my love?
Rising with the heat above
Life's the story of
Ascending to the stars as one

[Verse 3]
Marching across the land
Is a peaceful army joining the band
Walking hand in hand
To an anthem loudly sung where they stand

[Refrain]
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Fire still burning on the ground

[Bridge]
La-da-da-la-la-la-da
La-da-da-la-la-la-da

[Chorus]
Can you feel my love?
Rising with the heat above
Life's the story of
Ascending to the stars as one

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, oh
Na
Rising
Above and above it
Above, yeah, above, yeah
La-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
I can see the faces through the broken glass
No longer pass
Looking at the sky, I see the city lights
But no star fights

[Chorus]
I never want to fall asleep
Within my dreams, the weight we sow, we reap
Though I believe the sun still shines
And I believe there comes a time
When out of silence, we will sing
And even broken bells will ring
Not all the answers are the same
Yet we still play thе game

[Verse 2]
Sweeping off the pavemеnt with a parlor broom
Going nowhere soon
Between the cracks of sidewalk, there's a flower grown
Beyond the stone

[Chorus]
I never want to fall asleep
Within my dreams, the weight we sow, we reap
Though I believe the sun still shines
And I believe there comes a time
When out of silence, we will sing
And even broken bells will ring
Not all the answers are the same
Yet we still play the game
Yet we still play the game

[Outro]
When out of silence, we will sing
And even broken bells will ring
Not all the answers are the same
Yet we still play the game

[Verse 1]
Oh, she told me she gets lonely
When the sky changes from day to night
That's when her demons come say "Hey"
Dusk is always harder for my baby
So I told her not to be afraid
That I'd think of her at that time of day
So I think about when her eyes light up
I think about when her eyes light up

[Chorus]
The world, the whole wide world
But the world don't matter
When we're looking at each other

[Verse 2]
Oh, she's got this way of making you feel like
You've lived a thousand times and nеver gonna die
And she shinеs illuminated by the strobe light
She smiles and everything will be alright

[Chorus]
In the world, the whole wide world
But the world don't matter
When we're looking at each other

[Verse 1]
Everybody talk, gotta get away
I just need space to do my thing, no highway, no compromise
Live and die by my own decisions
Live and die by my own decisions
Stuck in drive by my own decisions
Stuck on stupid, that's yo position

[Pre-Chorus]
Slowin' down, that's the scariest part
I break apart, separate them
Compartmentalize, I percolate them to make them alive
I do believe in God
I do believe in higher powers
Do you believe in higher power?
Can you give me high powers?

[Chorus]
Decision, decision, I got decision to make
Decision, decision, I got decision to make
Sick of decision, sick of the feelin'
Weighin' me down, stressin' me out
Hope it can wait, I got decision to make

[Verse 2]
I walked in with somethin' new, dipped in this attitude
Giving you stratosphere, there's no clarity where I'm headed
There's no strategy where I'm headed, still
Just wingin' it, I be knowin' though, keep goin' though
I know just what I want, tellin' you what I need
Hopin' you got enough, Pennies to make me choose sense
Is that enough to buy my soul back?
I'ma need a layaway plan
Think I needa stay away from
Whatever's keeping my heart racing

[Pre-Chorus]
Slowin' down, that's the scariest part
I break apart, separate them
Compartmentalize, I percolate them to make them alive
I do believe in God
I do believe in higher powers
Do you believe in higher power?
Can you give me high powers?

[Chorus]
Decision, decision, I got decision to make
Decision, decision, I got decision to make
Sick of decision, sick of the feelin'
Weighin' me down, stressin' me out
Hope it can wait, I got decision to make

[Bridge]
All in a work of time
You back in my house again, think I played myself again
Ooh, why do I let you in?
I do it everytime, you back in my mouth again
You back with that bitch again, oh, why do I let you in?
I do it everytime, thinkin' I had enough
You runnin' out of time, I'm runnin' out of patience
I'm runnin' out of pages
You runnin' out of love, I'm runnin' out of chances
You really takin' chances, you wantin' other women
Who am I? Who am I?

[Pre-Chorus]
Slowin' down, that's the scariest part
I break apart, separate them
Compartmentalize, I percolate them to make them alive
I do believe in God
I do believe in higher powers
Do you believe in higher power?
Can you give me high powers?

[Chorus]
Decision, decision, I got decision to make
Decision, decision, I got decision to make
Sick of decision, sick of the feelin'
Weighin' me down, stressin' me out
Hope it can wait, I got decision to make

[Verse 1]
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

[Chorus]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

[Chorus]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Bridge]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
But I don't know, I don't know

[Interlude]
Mm-hm-hm
Da-da-da-da-ohhhh
Hm-hm-hm-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh
Hmmmmmm-hmm
Mmmmmm-ohhhh

[Verse 3]
Something in the way she knows
And all I havе to do is think of her
Something in the things shе shows me

[Outro]
I don't want to leave her now
I don't want to leave her now
Girl, you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Wh-wh-why?

You tell me that you need me, but then you wanna leave me
And never make your way to the door
I tell you that you're too much and that I'll miss you too much
Don't even know what we're fighting for

You break my heart, girl, and then you go get it fixed
I talk to all them other girls just to make you jealous
How can we make it right when we both put up a fit?
You make me so mad it's kind of hard to forgive

But when I look into your pretty eyes
My heart just drops
Girl, you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Wh-wh-why?

You always talking reckless sending a text message
Telling me to pack and get goin'
And then I get a call a minute you sounded so innocent
Saying that you can't be alone

I'll go find every receipt to show how you spend all my dough
You act like you can do whatever and not go with the flow
How can we make it right when we put up a fit
You make me so mad it's kind of hard to forgive

But when I look into your pretty eyes
My heart just drops

Girl, you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Wh-wh-why?

Calling it quits just ain't what we were built for
I'd rather love you than to hate you, girl
I, I want you to know

You're my, you're my
You're my shawty
Say you're my, you're my
You're my shawty

Girl, you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Wh-wh-why?

Girl, you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
(You're my shawty)
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
(You're my shawty)
Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
(You're my shawty)
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
(Yeah)
Wh-wh-why?
Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Don't grip on possessions, that's one of my lessons
It's never been that deep, I can't be desperate
I turn to Alexa, when I can't find Alexis
This feel like a rainy day in Texas

[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
Catch a flight out the blue, South Africa
Hit my plug for the juice, then I re-up
Cancel me, I cancel you, we won't make up
You get money, I do too, let's fall in love
Catch a flight out the blue, South Africa
Hit my plug for the juice, then I re-up
Cancel me, I cancel you, we won't make up
You get money, I do too, let's fall in love

[Verse 1]
Blocked from a distance
Everybody want some attention
Money make a bitch go missin'
Everybody on a lil' mission
Bless up
I can turn you on in an instant
Everybody battlin' a mistress
Touchin' on your booby, gеt 'em lifted
She wanna gеt lit-lit
She fuckin' on a rap nigga, fuckin' on a star
Drinkin' tap water, diabetes in a jar
I'm takin' shit back, bitch, you won't get far
Baby Keem poppin', no long' talkin'
Ha-ha-ha, I'm laughin' at you
Baby Keem poppin'
Still don't fuck with ra-ra-ra (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Catch a flight out the blue, South Africa
Hit my plug for the juice, then I re-up
Cancel me, I cancel you, we won't make up
You get money, I do too, let's fall in love
Catch a flight out the blue, South Africa
Hit my plug for the juice, then I re-up
Cancel me, I cancel you, we won't make up
You get money, I do too, let's fall in love

[Verse 2]
Huh, dodgin' turbulence, I'm a pop star like Prince
I buy house, no den, I'ma hold down my kinfolk
My mama tried to warn these hoes not to break my heart again
I never shade my hoes, I'ma pay my hoes, then pay my rent
Heads up, eeny, meeny, miny, moe, and many more
Allah, Allah, Shabba Rank, we be fuckin' 'til it stank
We be fuckin' off the drank and I love that pootie tang
I took my clothes off for you, what the fuck you think about me?

[Chorus]
Catch a flight out the blue, South Africa
Hit my plug for the juice, then I re-up
Cancel me, I cancel you, we won't make up
You get money, I do too, let's fall in love
Catch a flight out the blue, South Africa
Hit my plug for the juice, then I re-up
Cancel me, I cancel you, we won't make up
You get money, I do too, let's fall in love
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
-both sides bitch, be consistent
On a flight to Hawaii, you was round trippin'
Bitches got cold morals, you ain't sly with it
I had to grab my flow back, niggas sound dippin'
I felt bad for 'em, I will do a song with 'em
Same drum, same deal, what's wrong with 'em?
Bitches sucking dick, I cannot share my tongue with 'em
Shout out to Lil K, I share my mom with 'em
We was overseas, whole flight two hundred G's
We only flow C's, but I'd rather no sense
NBA nigga, hide my hoes in nosebleeds
Say her nigga hard, oh your nigga ain't Kobe (Ayy, ayy)
Now come 'round back
I'm a tarantula, I smoke until I'm fazed
Beat me out the top while we hiding from the opps
Two flights oversеas, man I really gotta stop

[Chorus]
Woah, yeah
First order of business, dawg, I gotta thank my mama
Second order of business, share the blessings, no more trauma
Third order of business, do good deeds and get good karma
First order of business, get this money to my shorty
Loyalty and gratitude, the only thing you swear me
Will you be the person that's gon' love me in my forties?

[Verse 1]
First order of business, dawg, I gotta shake the toxic
All this back and forth, it's weighing heavy on my conscience
When I met your sister, she said, "This nigga's obnoxious"
Fuck the ones comin' for me
Can't focus on thе petty, they'll come back and dеstroy me
Why she speakin' anyway? She fuckin' her employees
I ain't even asked, but the room was way too noisy

[Chorus]
Yeah
First order of business, dawg, I gotta thank my mama
Second order of business, share the blessings, no more trauma
Third order of business, do good deeds and get good karma
First order of business, get this money to my shorty
Loyalty and gratitude, the only thing you swear me
Will you be the person that's gon' love me in my forties?

[Verse 2]
Wake up in the morning, brush my teeth before I see my queen (Tick, tick, tick, ka-boom)
Wow, who are you? (Ka-boom) Bitch, I'm two-phone Baby Keem
I think you're selfish, I like soul food
Pussy taste like soul food, that's why you've been my go-to
And that's my whole thing (That's my thing), I do whole things (That's my thing)
She go both ways (That's my thing), you had a ho phase
Pussy good, so I come through on my worst days
Like I should, tell me if I'm understood

[Chorus]
Yeah
First order of business, dawg, I gotta thank my mama
Second order of business, share the blessings, no more trauma
Third order of business, do good deeds and get good karma
First order of business, get this money to my shorty
Loyalty and gratitude, the only thing you swear me
Will you be the person that's gon' love me in my forties?

[Refrain]
Are you mad at me? Are you irritated?
'Til I let you duck me, then you celebrated
Why're you showin' off because you with your friends, dawg?
Don't be showin' out when you with your friends, dawg

[Verse 1]
Don't be showin' out when you with your mans, dawg
Please don't let me catch him on my ends, dawg
It's a thousand ways to misunderstand, dawg
It's a thousand ways that we can make amends, dawg
And you know he only love you when your pants off
I showed you light, I showed you grown man talk
Age differences between us, on our last, dawg
I'm comin' home, why you always on the edge, dawg?

[Refrain]
Arе you mad at me? Are you irritated?
I lеt you duck me, then you celebrated
Why're you showin' off because you with your friends, dawg?
Don't be showin' out when you with your friends, dawg

[Chorus]
Makes no sense, dawg, dawg, dawg
These niggas tryna ride the wave, ride the wave
Makes no sense, dawg, dawg, dawg
These bitches tryna ride my face, ride my face (Yeah, let's go)

[Verse 2]
Sorry mama, you ain't need to know this
Sorry mama, but I couldn't focus
You ain't gon' have my back against the ropes
You poppin' pussy like that bitch, go then
I'm walkin' down the aisle doin' my Dougie
If I'm walkin' down the aisle, I hope you love me
I like it skinny and I like it chubby
As long as we involved, it won't bug me
Ho, it's your birthday, your birthday
It's your birthday, we gotta take a picture
It's your birthday from now to December
It's a birthday, how could I not remember?
We fuck, so I cleaned up your roster
Got rid of the hypebeast imposters
Taught hoes how to talk to you proper
'Cause I get good results like a doctor

[Refrain]
Are you mad at me? Are you irritated?
I let you duck me, then you celebrated
Why're you showin' off because you with your friends, dawg?
Don't be showin' out when you with your friends, dawg

Makes no sense, dawg, dawg, dawg
These niggas tryna ride the wave, ride the wave, yeah
Makes no sense, dawg, dawg, dawg
These bitches tryna ride my face, ride my face

[Verse 1]
Huh, I beat the back out the bitch
I walk in barefoot like Rick
This not the time to confess
Sleep with two phones on my chest
Yesterday, I was just broke, today, I look sexy and blessed
Every time I come back home, baby girl kiss on my neck
These girls keep calling me handsome, flew out to England and I'm with Lil Mexico
Cropping that bitch out my pic' because she too thick, she must be a messy ho (Yeah, yeah)
Put that on my kids
I'm tired of the boogers, these big protein boogers, get that weak shit out of my face
I gotta be honest, I cannot be happy unless my whole team get a taste
NDA rent, cancel your ass yesterday 'cause a nigga gon' die 'bout respect, huh

[Chorus]
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed
Hol' up, I'm sexy and blessed
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed

[Verse 2]
Ayy, smoke in the basket, uh
I'm in a casket 'cause I get ratchet, uh
King of the fashion, you can't get active
Beat your ass up for it, I caught you lackin'
Eat your ass up for it, I caught you brackin'
Kick your ass up for it, I'm with the drama
Front of your mama, front of your daddy, your sister, your aunt
200K taxes, please do not sue me, I can't afford to buy Paul June a blunt, uh
Bitch, hand me the rock
Rock band on me and I look attractive
Holding up five fingers, my numbers are brackin'
Barbarian shit, Barbarian tactic
My name is Booman, my name is not Jeff
I told you that I am a Barbarian
I told you that I am a Barbarian
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you

[Chorus]
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed
Hol' up, I'm sexy and blessed
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed

Born into status, tell nobody that you never had it
Don't tell nobody that you was abandoned

I can't feel sorry when you lost random
I can't feel sorry, you're a lost ransom
Drown yourself in expensive fabrics
I think you picked up a lot of bad habits
Just appreciate yourself

[Chorus]
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide

My mama mad at me, I know I fucked up big
My girl mad at me, I know I fucked up big
What's love? I guess I'll never understand
Every time I say sorry, I do that shit again
Check, check, check, I made a promise
That I would never leave you stressed, I would be honest
I should have never sent that text, I will be honest
I'm sorry for the things I said, I will be honest

[Chorus]
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye

Just bounce to this
(Snoop Dogg)
Everybody just bounce to this

Ain't no funk, it's funky, it's Doggystyle
(bounce to this)
(Death Row-ow, Death Row)
Ain't no funk, it's funky, it's Doggystyle
(bounce to this)
(Death Row-ow, Death Row)

Shucks, stomping in my big blue chucks
More bounce to the ounce while I'm ditching you klutz (bring it)
Bump-bump-bump-bump while you're bumping your sounds
It's the zoo and the Pound we don't eff around
Relax your mind and let your conscience be free
And get down, stomping grounds is the LBC
I slid up out the game and MC's get wacked
But now I'm back (Oh shhh!), so go get your strap
Watch your head, I break bread
Wit G's, Muslims, hard-heads and dreds
Bounce, rock while rollerskating
On them 20 inch tires with the platinum Daytons
I'm not that BG popping all that junk
About "I'll touch you up", he sound like a punk
I been there and done that, no inspiration
All day demonstration beat conversation
Ain't no funk, it's funky, it's Doggystyle
(bounce to this)
(Death Row-ow, Death Row)
Ain't no funk, it's funky, it's Doggystyle
(bounce to this)
(Death Row-ow, Death Row)

I keep brothers in the studio, word is bond
Been working on ya new album for two years strong
And still can't come up with the right song
You know what they say:'Study long, study wrong'
All aboard the train so come along
Cos we keep the glue stuck against the bone
It's alright ain't no room for wrong
Doggyland is the motherland, make yourself at home
I got money loads by the barrels
I even got a few fans that's crazy like DeNiro
I'm international money maker, player hater
Shake up for the sake of spending dollars and I always holler
At a player though cos players know the real from the fake
You can put that on your toast, your coast and your state
I give you people what you like
What I look like in jail and can't get on the mic

Collard on your plate so you can stuff it in your face
Ooh, say your Grace before you touch your plate

Who the **** is that?

[Chorus]
I hit the club with a mug so mean
Got them **** like who the **** is that?
And then I hopped up out the car, so clean (What? What? What?)
Got them **** like who the **** is that?
I hit the floor like right, left, back, forth
Yeah, I got money, ****, that's of course (Let's go)
Hit the stage with a b-boy stance
The club owner like (Ooh-wee), let's go (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)

[Verse]
Ain't nothin' for me to come through and shut the club down (Down)
Walk through the club mean muggin', haters loud
Then drop a stack at the bar, had the Louis 13 (What? What?)
Posted up, camouflage down to my feet (What? What? What? Let's go)
They lookin' at me like who is (Who is?), who is he?
A straight get'cha boy (Boy), been raised in the streets
If I'm on it, you can smell it when I step in your room
Tay, D-I, Chevy goes zoom

[Chorus]
I hit the club with a mug so mean (Put your hands up, what?)
Got them **** like who the **** is that? (What? What?)
And then I hopped up out the car, so clean
Got them **** like who the **** is that?
I hit the floor like right, left, back, forth (Huh?)
Yeah, I got money, ****, that's of course
Hit the stage with a b-boy stance

[Verse 2: The Kid LAROI]
Wake up and I thank God, I done been through it all
Hand out food at my friends, but I'm out here with the stars
Six deep, five-seated cars, six feet, they love my dogs
I just can't conversate with no fake, fuck all the frauds
I ain't gotta say much, if you know, then you know
How the fuck I'm in this crib? I was sleepin' on floors
Saw my uncle in the grave, now my heart turn cold
No more feelings, I can't take it baby, pour me some more
I can't trust a soul, especially not these hoes
I put Off-White on my toes, I did this shit on my own, shit
When I'm taking flicks, that's the only time I pose
Ain't no more rips in my clothes, came from nothin'...

[Intro: Snoop Doggy Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Ha ha, check it out
Snoop Doggy Dogg and D-R-E once again on the gangsta tip
(Yeah)
Droppin' nothin' but the funky manuscript, real quick like
Compton and Long Beach, you know what I'm sayin'?

Y'all lay back once mo'
Blaze up some of that indo
And chill, and watch this flow, really doe

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
'Cause you know we're 'bout to rip shit up
Give me the microphonе first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach togеther, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nuthin' but a G thang, baby
Two loced out niggas going crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But, um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earnin' her man and learnin' her man
And at the same time burnin' her man
Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)
And that's realer than Real Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll have a small piece of some of that funky stuff

[Chorus: Dr. Dre & Snoop, Snoop]
It's like this and like that and like this and a—
It's like that and like this and like that and a—
It's like this and like that and like this and a—
Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Well, I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm creepin'
But I damn near got caught 'cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
With a producer who can rap and control the Maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
Of what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

[Chorus: Dr. Dre & Snoop, Dr. Dre, Snoop]
It's like this and like that and like this and a—
It's like that and like this and like that and a—
It's like this
And who gives a fuck about those?

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Both]
Fallin' back on that ass with a hellafied gangsta lean
Gettin' funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh, yes, I'm fresh, N, double-O, P
D, O, double-G, Y, D, O, double-G, you see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolemite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit (Hell yeah)
So, Dre (What up, Dogg?)
Gotta give 'em what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off somethin' (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton)

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Is where it takes place, so when asked, your attention
Mobbin' like a motherfucker but I ain't lynchin'
Droppin' the funky shit that's makin' the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told ya I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better

[Chorus: Dr. Dre & Snoop, Dr. Dre, Snoop]
It's like this and like that and like this and a—
It's like that and like this and like that and a—

[Verse 1]
Nights my mind is speedin' by, I'm holdin' on
Askin' God to help 'em, are you hearin' me?
Girl is tellin' me she don't know what she want
Lotta demons creepin' up, they're livin' underneath
Gotta take a minute, y'all, traveled far
Feelin' somethin', no, I can't ignore my instincts
Back just where I started, it's the same old damaged song
It's the shit I need

[Pre-Chorus]
Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at
Hm, talk to Him, He don't speak back
Hm, can't losе, I'm in the third act
Lord seein' me swervе
Do this to my loved ones, I've got some nerve
Don't think I'm not sorry

[Chorus]
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
Hm, hear me now, hey

This fight, this war in me, in me, in me

[Verse 2]
(Yeah) Standin' on the cliff right off Mulholland Drive
(Yeah) Back up on my late night session remedy
(Oh) Something 'bout the night that keep me safe and warm
Just me, the universe, and everything I think
Lotta shit is weighin' on me, it's a storm
Never thought I would be back here bleeding
I'm not just some sad dude
You can see my life, how I grew, I want serenity

[Pre-Chorus]
Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at
Talk to Him, He don't speak back
Hm, can't lose, I'm in the third act
See, it seems I'll never learn
I won't stop 'til I crash and burn
Tell my mom I'm sorry

[Chorus]
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me

[Post-Chorus]
I been here before, hey, hey
I been here before, hm
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
And the story goes, hey, hey
As the story goes, hm
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me

[Verse 1]
Iffy, can't decide which one I want

Ain't missin' the moment, ain't no spillin' (Yeah)
Dude, I been livin', illin', tryna find it then I'm peelin'
You feel it? (Woah) All's good until I hit the ceilin'

Nothing else can fix the problem but this herb grown, grown
Yes, that there, it got mе on one (Oh)

Ragin' through the day, sexy baby, turn me on-on (Uh)
Hear me out, hear me, hear me
Come on, ready or not, nigga comin' with it
Come on with the team, hear me, hear me
Oh no, hit 'em up and I'm rippin', rippin', isn't he? (Yeah)
And I'm comin' full-blown to the tombstone (Yeah)
How I'm livin', gotta push it, gotta set the tone (Yeah)
It ain't nothin' to me, baby, say I'm livin' wrong (Livin' wrong)

[Chorus]
(Go) Day fades and the sun goes away (Uh)
Same old nigga and the same old pain (Uh)
Ain't much change in me, y'all (Yeah)
Seem like ain't nothin' change in me, y'all

Can't ask for better options, it's the captain of the ship isn't it?
Yeah, yo, this for my sanity
Some play some days into the night
I say you can't judge me, babe, I'm twisted in the brain, know why (Yeah)

Baby, come and learn these lessons (Come, baby, and see)
Been around and around again (Boom-boom, boom-boom)
Cuttin' loose with the troops and, no, we ain't lie

Hellish life, why? Do it live or not nigga, ride by
Fast track, see him in a high fly in line, no, niggas can't be him

And I'm tellin' baby, "Don't try, this is a trip that I gotta do alone," mm
Here we are, no shit, tell the boys we get ripped, rage on

Doomed since I left the womb, where I run to?
And it's like I'm in a battle, leakin' from a wound (Yeah)
Praise God, thank you, never left me on my own (No)
Shades locked over my eyes, my disguise is on (Gone)
Damn, he found it, that pure bliss, I'm wildin' (Wildin')

We off, we slide, we ain't scared to die (Let's go)

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, every bottle
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Woah, woah, ah
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Ah, ah, ooh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody
Deep in Hell in dark corners
Deep in my dreams perceived, nah
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody
Can't hear me scream
Somethin' twisted in me

[Verse 1]
Say, "I'm waitin' to die," I cry
Many nights I spent gettin' fucked up, livin' a lie
Prayin', I'm just fed up, this tequila in me
Don't tell me to be cool, this is how cool I can be, woah
You can try and read my mind
Been pushin' it for days, I'm on a mission to climb, woah
Losin' rеality, been sayin' I'm fine, try my hardest to sleep
Too many issues bubblin', say I'll work through it
How? Think thеy knowin' what the problems are
Had me goin' crazed through the city while I burn it down
This is just my way, keep on prayin' for me
Lonely on my ride as I fly, arms is open wide
Don't wanna leave without sayin' bye
Had a rough night, finna sip some
Don't even worry 'bout it, waitin' 'til the Devil comes

[Chorus]
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody
Deep in Hell in dark corners
Deep in my dreams perceived, nah
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody
Can't hear me scream (Ahh!)

[Verse 2]
He's callin' me
So much gone while I blow off steam
And the shit's the same
Oh, look at that, only you to blame (Ha)
It's like I'm swimmin' towards another bona fide life
It's like a fairy tale, wantin' more
But inside I'm vexed, used to question, why
Lord, he show me that I'm tested and I'm gonna fly
I ain't slippin', no, that's not for me
Be who you are, don't be nothin' less, please
Hear me, Lord, don't ever leave, see
I'm a man in the night in these dark streets
Somethin' else, how it felt
Take a drink, I live in excess, nothin' left
Every minute slippin' away, this is hell
They were warning him, figured he'd be cool, who's the fool?

[Chorus]
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody (Yeah, yeah)
Deep in Hell in dark corners (Yeah)
Deep in my dreams perceived, nah (Yeah)
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it (Yeah)
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody (Yeah)
Can't hear me scream (Scream)
Somethin' twisted in me

[Intro]
Mm-mm, yeah
Mm-mm

[Verse 1]
In the dead of the night, I have these dreams
What'll happen to me? Will I burn out?
Have I been wrong? What does it mean?
All these things, can't understand why
Say something's wrong with me, I know
By myself alone driving, I go
Full moon as it glows, I search for truth
Tryna be brand new, yeah, I will try
No, I won't do but through these screams
Fighting and bleed, blood in my eye
And I'll be (Another broken soul)
God save me (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Yeah, baby, see I'm back in my zone
Just what I need, mama (Yeah)
Nigga been in hell, the same ol'
On a mission and I'm gonna fly high (High)
This for the sad pеople who keep the blunt burning and we
Off on a journеy, you learn me

[Verse 2]
Close call, life on the edge
Ahh, when the time comes, I'll find peace
Still in search of, nights, I'm sittin' wishin'
I can find love in me
Lettin' go, ooh, this ain't livin'
I swim in pain
Never drown, keep my head up above the waves (Get it, get it)
Tired of runnin', I won't run from fate
Late night, ooh, this is when I come alive, when the dreams made
Take me, ooh, just don't leave, babe
Come on, woah (Don't say goodnight)
Scars on my heart, woah (Ahh, ahh, ahh, yeah)

[Chorus]
Yeah, baby, see I'm back in my zone
Just what I need, mama (Yeah)
Nigga been in hell, the same ol'
On a mission and I'm gonna fly high (High)
This for the sad people who keep the blunt burning and we
Off on a journey, you learn me

[Intro: River Phoenix & Will Wheaton]
I'm never gonna get out of this town, am I, Gordie?
You can do anything you want, man
Yeah, sure, I’ll see ya
Not if I see you first

[Verse 1]
He had one older sister
Two older brothers
And a single-parent mother who
Worked her ass off, did the best she could
There was nothing they could tell him
Let the boy know he wasn't worthless
Even though he was in the same home
He had felt alone, his pet gerbil passed on

[Chorus]
He was so bored in the winter
So bored in the winter
He was so bored in the winter
Such a little sad boy, little sad boy
Little sad boy, Elsie's baby boy
He was so bored in the winter
So bored in the winter
He was so bored in the winter
Such a little sad boy, little sad boy
Little sad boy, Elsie’s baby boy

[Verse 2]
By the time he was eleven
His father had left him
White church, sitting in the front row
All-white casket closed, he won't see him no more
He tried to disguise himself
Made sure that no one could tell
That in his soul, there's a wide-open hole
Something scarred him, so he can't let him go
He won't

[Chorus]
He was so bored in the winter
So bored in the winter
He was so bored in the winter
Such a little sad boy, little sad boy
Little sad boy, Elsie's baby boy
He was so bored in the winter
So bored in the winter
He was so bored in the winter
Such a little sad boy, little sad boy
Little sad boy, Elsie's baby boy

[Verse 1]
Here I am, oh
All night, all night, takin' me, oh
Lay awake in bed and I'm alone
(Remembering)
Runnin' through my brain and I'm searchin' for you, oh no
(I'm remembering)
Missin' someone in my life, see, I'm in trouble
And every time I close my eyes, I see her face, see I'm in trouble
No, I can't forget her at all, haunting me
And I'm wishin' you were mine, all for me

[Chorus]
Life goes by
Search for your love wherever it be
Life goes by
I need your love all over me
Life goes by
Search for your love wherever it be
Life goes by
Oh, I need your love all over me

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na, oh, I need your love all over me
Na-na-na-na-na-na, oh, oh
Na-na-na-na-na-na, oh, I need your love all over me
Na-na-na-na-na-na, ooh, mmm

[Verse 2]
You're a star, I worship you
Didn't you know? How couldn't you?
As she laughs, sun's shinin' through
You're my drug, my dose of truth
Anywhere, all you
As you lay beside me
Just us two, who knew
You'd be my everything?
(Here I am, oh, here I am, oh)
All night, all night, takin' me, oh
(Girl, you're takin' me, oh, girl, you're takin'—)

[Chorus]
Life goes by
Search for your love wherever it be
Life goes by
I need your love all over me
Life goes by
Search for your love wherever it be
Life goes by
Oh, I need your love all over me

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na, oh, I need your love all over me

I will fall in the void, fall in the void just to avoid
Anything that can bring me down or fuck with my flow
Fall in the void (The void)
Fall in the void (The void)
I will fall in the void, fall in the void just to avoid
Anything that can bring me down or fuck with my flow
Fall in the void (The void)
Fall in the void (The void)

[Verse 1]
Hey, oh, need to free my mind, ah, yeah
This a little ritual of mine as I head home
Head up high, get some
Hello, sailin' by, nah-nah
Say, oh, been dead and alive, don't know
Let go, they say I'll survive
If you say so, please don't lie
My days are low, I'll give it a try, hey
See new things in my soul
When I'm just sittin' in my room all alone
This is the real, it's how I roll
Tell my friends and folks that I'm on a ridе, don't know when I'm comin' home
Things might change, but I'm cool with it
Flyin' highеr than I've ever been, I see the world just as it is
Please hear me, no, no, no, I cannot wait (No, no)
As we climb, I'm soarin'

[Chorus]
I will fall in the void, fall in the void just to avoid (Woah)
Anything that can bring me down or fuck with my flow
Fall in the void (The void, mmm, yeah)
Fall in the void (The void, fall in the void)
I will fall in the void, fall in the void just to avoid (Woah)
Anything that can bring me down or fuck with my flow
Fall in the void (The void, mmm)
Fall in the void (The void, bring me, ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh

[Verse 2]
See ya, never have I flown so high
Feel a feeling takin' over, goodbye (Ooh)
Be just what you need to be, let's go (Ooh)
Everything is all on me, don't count me out (Yo)
These nights, they save him from my hellhole
When it's dark and my heartbeat echoes
Yeah, that's just what I love, ooh
Heaven ain't too far now
Show me what I don't know (What I don't know)
Imagine these things so simple, break the code
'Round and 'round, my mind is throwed
Prayin' I overdose on this love, it got me flyin', I'm headed home (Hey)
And I'm thinkin' I be dreamin', lights are gleamin'
God watchin', haters plottin', but I can't be focused on that
Here it goes, this the part, I cannot wait
Don't ask why
I'm soarin'

[Chorus]
I will fall in the void, fall in the void just to avoid
Anything that can bring me down or fuck with my flow
Fall in the void (The void)
Fall in the void (The void, fall in the void)
I will fall in the void, fall in the void just to avoid (Woah)
Anything that can bring me down or fuck with my flow
Fall in the void (The void, mmm-mmm, no, no)
Fall in the void (The void, come, baby, oh)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, no, no

[Outro]
Oh, God, oh, God, thank You
You've been in my dreams, you've been in my dreams
Oh, I'm just trying to be the best man I can be, mmm-mmm
Thank you for listening
Thank you for never leaving me
It's gon' be okay
It's gon' be okay
I promise you
I promise you

[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Yo
Yo
Mmm
Ooh

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Please, Lord, hear me now, hope you're listening
It's been centuries, least what it seems to me
I've been on this road, my eyes glistenin'
As I stare at Scott, I know he's all I got
Our pasts don't matter, babe, I'm much stronger
And fly much farther, soar overseas
Finally see, I'll keep on climbing
Ridin' the lightning and I am sure

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
At times I really didn't show
What was wrong with me, wrong with me
I told myself I cannot grow
Without lovin' me, lovin' me
But this is just the hell that lives inside, hmm
Tell me now, where to? Please be my guide

[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
I've been goin', goin' in circles
Reoccurring dreams, talkin' in my sleep
Then I'm floatin' up to the surface
I can finally breathe, I could do anything
And I don't know why it's alright
And it's not at the same time
Then I look up at a blue sky
And I know

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Phoebe Bridgers]
At times I really didn't show
What was wrong with me, wrong with me
I told myself I cannot grow
Without lovin' me, lovin' me
This is just the hell that lives inside, hmm
Tell me now, where to? Please be my guide

Shy nigga, but I think she pretty (Ah), so it's on, baby (Yeah)
Call to the lost, we deep, deep (Huh)
Had it all twisted, dead wrong (Yeah)
How do I find what I can't see?
Lord, I was born to be strong (Hey)
Yes, yes, before I stress, I gotta get that feeling
This is just a sweet interlude, na-na

[Pre-Chorus]
Amen, and the dice is thrown, they come in winnin' (Yeah)
What's this hatin'? (Yeah) Got no time, my boy (Yeah)
Nah, man, no one could've saved me
Look around and see this shit made me (Huh!)

[Chorus]
They think they know me, I think not
Hеy, see me, I control the plot (Mmm)
Healing but I'm dеaling with some things, shit'll never stop
Yeah, caught in the moonlight
In the mirror, used to hate what I'd see (Mmm)
Healing but I'm dealing with some things, shit'll never stop

[Verse 2]
Just another Monday, burning indica with my bruh
See them lames, they rollin', smokin' mid, not me, Kid (Yeah)
Never trip, I'll burn that clip then run it back, call Plain Pat
Haters crumble, I'm they enemy, crazy fucker, no, don't envy, get that, ooh
I'm the only nigga standin', no, no, this ain't Henny
End of the days, baptized in fire, ooh, I'll survive for many, dude

And I'm feelin' whole, who would've thought for me?
See, nobody knows, still this hell on me (Yeah)
Catch me dip through town, mind racing, rev-rev-revvin' (Yeah, yeah)
See, won't count me out, zoomin' while I count my blessings (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But something's off, I can feel it (Yeah)
My angel's gone (Shh), and I'm fuckin' loaded
Nah, man, no one could've saved me (Mmm)
I look around and see this shit made me (Yeah)

[Chorus]
They think they know me, I think not
Hey, see me, I control the plot (Mmm)
Healing but I'm dealing with some things, shit'll never stop

Always keep your family close, keep your heart open
Here's to the chosen, solo dolo rollin', hm

HOPES AND DREAMS
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

What’s your name?

What do you do?

Do you want to do anything else, and if so what is it?

What’s your first memory?

What’s the most amazing thing you’ve ever witnessed?

What’s the best thing about being you?
What’s the worst?

If you could switch bodies with someone for 24 hours, who would it be?

What three superpowers do you wish you had?

What is life going to look like in the year 3000?
How far is a light year?

What have you been listening to lately?

Do you have any secret talents?

What would you do on your last day on Earth?

[Page 57: Boys Don’t Cry]

Ryan

I play Soccer, I go to school

I wanna be better a skating

The first word I learned to say, or that I’ve ever said was dog

Whеn I went to London I saw this tight building, I was pretty high, it was tight

6. N/A

Probably my brother, just to see how much work hе has in one day, just to be in the life of him

I want to be invisible, I want to fly and I want to be invincible
Probably gonna be like flying cars and stuff, it’s gonna be a whole electronic world, absolutely no trees, or the world will be done

Forever

I’ve been listening to BasedGod, my brother and I’ve been starting to listen to Mac Miller’s music and a little bit of Eminem and that’s it

Well, not really, I’m an open book

Everything that was on the bucket list, like I don’t know, there would just be a lot of things I’ll do, probably spend a lot of time with my family and tell them I’m going away and probably… I don’t know. There’s a lot of things you could do

[Page 58: Boys Don’t Cry]

Sage Elsesser

I make love and I skateboard

Make art, paint pictures

Eating chicken and rice

Oh, when ah, some nigga got stabbed by some Mexicans with a machete in front of McDonald’s near Thebe’s house. (Did he die?) I think so, they ran inside, but some nigga spit at a car with some Mexicans that were gardeners, and they hopped out with the machetes, and… it’s a wild story, yea

I don’t know, I got bushy eyebrows
Having bushy eyebrows, being Drake
Probably Tyler, his life seems pretty awesome. No, actually no, fuck him, probably Dill, ‘cause he doesn’t have to do anything at all but sit in his house

I wish I could fly, I wish I could be a jumper like go place to place. I also wish I could die whenever I wanted and then come back to life and see who gave a fuck when I die

I don’t know, I’m gonna be dead, so I won’t know what it’ll look like

It’s very far, yea, it’s very fucking far

Jessica Cleaves, Friends of Distinction, Brenda and the Tabulations, that’s it

I make music, I can draw, paint…

Skydrive

[Page 59: Boys Don’t Cry]

Nakel Smith

Skateboard, and other things

Design stuff, just everything, like shoes and skateboards, wheels, Chucks, houses and dressers

Falling off a balcony

Friendship, and how it controls the world

Best thing about being me is that I got a nice set of friends. I got a clear mind, I think, sometimes. The worst thing about being me is I think a lot too much, sometimes I’m very musty

One day? I don’t know, wow

I wish I could fly. I wish I could teleport and I wish I could go invisible

3000? It might look the same, it might look terrible, everything could be demolished, and the whole world could be over, or it could be great and shit can fly and buildings would be very very tall, and everybody won’t know what the ground looks like

Damn, I don’t know

Sabbath, Chief Keef, umm hold up, I’ve been listening to Isaac Hayes, and The BasedGod

I don’t think so, I’m pretty open with everything I do

Spend a couple hours with my family and then I’ll go out and just do everything that I ever thought about trying, ever, like no matter what it is, if I ever had the thought I would actually go out and try it

[Page 60: Boys Don’t Cry]

Branim Iriri

I skate and I work at Active

I want to accomplish a lot of goals in life, hopefully be like a movie director or something— something cool, I don’t know… like a scorer or a composer, or a designer, clothing designer in the skateboarding industry hopefully

I don’t even know, to be honest

Ahh shit, that’s a tough one. The most amazing thing I’ve ever witnessed? That’s tough, what would you say to that? I don’t know, shit, uh, fuck, ok something short and simple: I saw Kanye last month, that was probably the greatest thing that happened this year as far as I can remember

The best that about being me is that I just don’t give a fuck. Can I curse? Yea, I just don’t care about shit, so like I don’t know, that just makes me happy and I don’t let shit bother me and I just try to be positive and just enjoy my fucking life, and the worse thing is, I don’t know, sometimes I feel like people don’t like me, but then I think I’m just trippin’, I don’t know

Probably like some kinda monk in like the forest up in China so I can like balance on my forehead or some crazy shit

I wish I could fly. I wish I was really strong and uh, shit, shit, I don’t know, to be able to shoot fire from my mouth or something

Probably a fucking apocalypse or some shit, I don’t know. Probably be like The Matrix, like robots and technology and all that shit

I don’t know

Toro y Moi, The Internet, and BasedGod, that’s about it

No

I’d take a piss in a fucking cop’s coffee mug

[Page 61: Boys Don’t Cry]

Evan Clark

I work on cars, hang out, umm, help friends work on cars and stuff

Continue to work on cars, drive cars, travel

Ever? In the hospital room getting a toy motorcycle from my mom as a present from my sister as her birthday present to me

Best thing about myself is I like to explore and get into things and try out new stuff. I think the worst thing is that sometimes it doesn’t work out— get into trouble, you know what I mean

Does it have to be a person? It’ll probably be a sloth, just kick it all day long

I wish I could fly. I wish I could swim deep to the bottom of the ocean, and I wish I could sleep, without like being dead, but forever at the same time

It’s gonna be so dirty, it’s gonna be filthy, too dirty

Like a trillion miles or something

The radio

I can stay asleep, so well

Probably jump off something really high, super high, try to land in like a handstand or something

[Verse 1]
What happened to flowers?
Goin' out in the rain and
And you're livin' the dream
Everyone don't see it
Can't let your hair down
Lookin' over your shoulder
You can try to stop it but
You're still getting older

[Chorus]
The conversation is so absurd
It's the condemnation
The fucking circus
There ain't no gold at the end of a rainbow
But maybe we can find something to live for

[Post Chorus]
So yeah, I love attention
Sometimes I get high and then I can't come down
I guess you call me shameless now
So yeah, I love attеntion
Sometimes I get high and thеn I can't come down
I guess you call me shameless now

[Verse 2]
The time it's so wasting
What is it achieving?
Puking up useless information
I wanna get conscious, ah
This time I wanna know the deal
Before I buy it
I wanna know it's real

[Chorus]
The conversation is so absurd
It's the condemnation
The fucking circus
There ain't no gold at the end of a rainbow
But maybe we can find something to live for

[Post-Chorus]
So yeah, I love attention
Sometimes I get high and then I can't come down
I guess you call me shameless now
So yeah, I love attention
Sometimes I get high and then I can't come down
I guess you call me shameless now

[Bridge]
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah, ah ah, ah
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah, ah ah, ah

[Chorus]
The conversation is so absurd
It's the condemnation
The fucking circus
There ain't no gold at the end of a rainbow
But maybe we can find something to live for

[Outro]
So yeah, I love attention
Sometimes I get high and then I can't come down
I guess you call me shameless now

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had?
Was it everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I'd be looking for

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me

[Chorus]
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Oh ho ho, oh ho ho, oh ho ho, oh ho ho

[Verse 2]
How many really know what love is?
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it
That it's everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
You're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I been looking for

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me

[Chorus]
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again

So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
(Can you do that for me, baby?)
Every time you touch me
(See, we don't really know)
Touch me like this is the last time
(See everything we never know)
Promise that you'll love me
(I want you to promise me)
Love me like you'll never see me again
(Like you'll never see me again)
Oh oh oh

[Outro]
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh

I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I'd be looking for

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed

[Chorus]
So еvery time you hold me
Hold mе like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me

[Verse 1]
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

[Pre-Chorus]
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talkin', they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

[Verse 2]
When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurtin'
You will always be around
This I know for cеrtain

[Pre-Chorus]
You and me together
Through thе days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talkin', they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

[Bridge]
I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide, something so real
So 'til the end of time I'm telling you there ain't no one

[Chorus]
No one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

All the siders (Eastside), and all the gangstas
And all the tricks (Trick, trick, trick)
Ya know, ya know, ya know
Dr. Dre (What what)
Big Snoop Dogg, we just dippin', G-Mix
Dip dip dip on, ha ha
I'm dippin' down Long Beach Coulevard
I only rides with my Doggs (Say what?)
And I don't give a damn about none of y'all
I'm ridin' 'til the wheels fall off
I only rides with my Doggs
Dippin' down Compton Boulevard
I only rides with my dogs (Say what)
I don't give a damn about none of y'all
I'm ridin' 'til the wheels fall off
I only rides with my dogs

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Trip, beware of the big mash, you knew he wasn't finished with yo' ass
It stay on 'it til it's burnt out, look how it turned out
Nothin' you can do now can help you out
So fall down, Dr. Dre done fell back into the house with Tha Pound (Say what?)
These chickens keep throwin' coochie at us, we don't want it (Uh uh)
Yeah, trick, it don't matter
It's all about the money, if you got it, throw that up (Throw it up)
Hmm, right along with ya' set (Eastside)
And watch us, you young bustas can't do that yet
I skirt out, I hit a corner on ya, bump doin' halfway
I do it to the fullest, I'll probably catch bullets on my last day
I hope a prayer come through so I can eat
My shoes lookin' like about a buck fifty each, but I ain't trippin')
But I'ma come up, that's on my mama
Nah, that's on me, 'cause that's a burden on my mama
And she done suffered, the tough's gettin' rougher
And when the tough get tough, the rough get a strap
And low-ridin's on the map
Snoop Dogg's number one, the whole Pound's got snaps
(What what what what what)
Yeah, tell me, have you seen us?

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Bendin' corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it
However you want it (However you want it)
Nah, however you need it, we just dippin'
Dippin', dippin', dip on, dip dip on
Dip dip on, dip on, uh-huh
Dip dip dip on, dip on, yeah
Dip dip dip on, dip on (Eastside)
Ayo Dre
(Yeah, yeah, check it out)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Actin' a fool, a player that paid his dues
And got my receipt in return, so I recline the leather seats
With a trunk full of beats and
Chronic filled leafs to burn
No concern as I make a left turn on the 'Shaw (What)
Off of Jefferson, feelin' awfully naked at the U-turn
Huh, left my gun, that's a no-no
Fuck Bernard Parks, I'm my own po'-po'
See him talkin' dirty after dark, startin' stuff
May have to mark up a fool FUBU logo
Lettin' off like a Ruger promo
And even though I'm about the hoes, I never doubt the dulos
You know the rule goes, where there's a ho, there's a hater
Well, there's some hoes over there
I'll concentrate on the haters later (What)
Give these bitches numbers to the pager
Invite 'em to the next Dre function as party favors
Who said pimpin's hard labor?

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Bendin' corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it (So beat it)
However you want it (However you want it)
Nah, however you need it, we just dippin'
Dippin', dippin', dip dip on, dip on
Bendin' corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it (So beat it)
However you want it (However you want it)
Nah, however you need it, we just dippin'
Just dippin', just dippin'
You know what? You know what?
Just dip, dip dip on, dip dip on (What what)
A-just dip, a-dip dip on, dip dip on

A-dip dip, a-dip dip on, dip dip on
A-dip dip, dip dip on, dip on

[Bridge: Butch Cassidy]
Stop and stare 'cause you just can't believe it's me
Ooh wee, bendin' corners, just my Doggs and me
Mad as hell 'cause you never thought you'd see
Butch Cassidy (Cassidy), Snoop Dogg and the D-R-E

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Ah, ah ah
Just dip, dip dip on, dip dip on
A-just dip, a-dip dip on (What what, ah)

With so much drama in the LBC
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass hits, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's (Yeah)
And make a few ends as I breeze through? (Yeah)
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my mama ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' 'til six in the mornin'
(Six in the mornin')
So what you wanna do?
Huh, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do, too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But for what? (We don't love 'em, though) Yeah
So we gon' blow an ounce to this
G's up, freeze up for a sеcond, now bounce to this

[Chorus: Lil David Ruffin, Snoop Dogg, Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice (Laid back)
With my mind on my monеy
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice (Laid back)
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now these types of things happen all the time
You gotta get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
See, everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this trick named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady
80 degrees, when I tell that trick please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with Tha Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
And you know I'm just…

Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic E.T. that made me choke
This ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and E.T., yeah, I'm tore down now
But it ain't no stoppin', 'cause I'm still poppin'
Dre got some tricks from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I get through, I gots ta hit the dope spot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love 'em, though, I'm out the door
And I'll be...

Sippin' on gin and juice
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
With so much drama in the LBC
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass hits, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's (Yeah)
And make a few ends as I breeze through? (Yeah)
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my mama ain't home
I got some freaks in the living room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' 'til six in the mornin'
(Six in the mornin' - six in the mornin')
So what you wanna do?
Huh, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do, too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (But what?), we don't love 'em, though (Yeah)
So we gon' blow an ouncе to this
G's up, freeze up for a second, now bounce to this

[Chorus: Lil David Ruffin, Snoop Dogg, Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down thе street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice (Laid back)
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice (Laid back)
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now these types of things happen all the time
You gotta get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
See, everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this trick named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady
80 degrees, when I tell that trick please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with Tha Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
And you know I'm just…

[Chorus: Lil David Ruffin, Snoop Dogg, Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice (Laid back)
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice (Laid back)
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic E.T. that made me choke
This ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and E.T., yeah, I'm tore down now
But it ain't no stoppin', 'cause I'm still poppin'
And Dre got some tricks from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I get through, I gots ta hit the dope spot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love 'em, though, I'm out the door
And I'll be...

[Chorus: Lil David Ruffin, Snoop Dogg, Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo

But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'

To serve me; not with a cherry on top
'Cause when I bust my nut I'm raisin' up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go
I'm hearing motherfuckers tryna steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, 'cause, see, my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the door
You know, some of these niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt
Seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, patty-wack
I still got the biggest sack
So put your gun away, run away, 'cause I'm back (Why?)
Hit em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up (Now)
Tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, 'cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for break off so take off your clothes
And quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes
Speaking of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb 'cause I rolled you a joint?
You'se a flea, and I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
Y'alls niggas better recognize (Uh-huh)
And see where I'm coming from: it's still Eastside
Til I die. Why ask why?
As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-double G, Y

[Chorus: Nancy Fletcher & The Dramatics]
It's a crazy, mixed-up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World
It's a Doggy Dogg World (It's a Doggy Dogg World)
(The Dogg's World)

[Verse 2: Kurupt & Snoop Dogg]
Well, if you give me ten bitches then I'll fuck all ten
Seen the homie Snoop Doggy sippin' juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm for the set-trip to get papers
Styles vary, packin' flavor like Lifesavers
Ain't that somethin'? Talk shit and I'm dumpin' (Blaow)
I had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique, I'm unique like China
You'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm comin' through
One, two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
A fuckin' menace using hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, It's on and poppin'
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I wanna see some panties droppin'
I'm coming from L.A
She used to chill with Dre up in Compton
All I ever did was just use that ho
Chill in my Dickies, get riches, and kick flows
I’m dishin' out blues, I'm upsettin' like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt's the name, so I'm also catchin' slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Rough and rugged shit, it’s unexplanatory how I gets wicked
But it’s mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I’m runnin' hoes in '94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'
Prepare for a war, it’s on, I'm head huntin'
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin' with rhymes packin' Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you? You fuckin' wit' a hog
You can't do me, I'm goin' out looney like O-Dog

[Chorus: Ron Banks & The Dramatics]
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba) Ooh, it's a Doggy Dogg World

[Bridge: Daz Dillinger & Tha Dogg Pound]
Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (All night long)
'Til when? ('Til the early morn')
It don't stop (And uh), it don't quit
(For uh) Tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dope shit

[Verse 3: Daz Dillinger]
Diggity-Daz out of the motherfuckin' cut once more
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip-flop and serve hoes with a fat dick
'Til I die, I'm still screaming out: "Bitches ain't shit!"
Now I'm the mack daddy, had he not known about
The city where I'm from: dum diddy dum
As you groove to the gangsta shit
The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D, the gangsta clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk
I can see you not gon' tell us what the fuck you want
So I blaze up the chronic so I can get high
I promise I smoke chronic 'til the day that I die

[Chorus: Ron Banks & (The Dramatics)]
It's a Dogg, it's a Dogg it's a Dogg (It's a Doggy Dogg World)

It's like everywhere I lizzook and everywhere I go

[Intro]
"I can feel it!"

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Tonight's the night that I plan my hit (Yeah)
Deep Cover on the incognito tip
Breakin' fools if I have to, peelin' caps, too
Trigger so you know I'm comin' at you
I guess that's part of the game
But I know it's somebody who think they just gon' come and change things
With the swiftness, so get it right with the quickness
And let me handle my business, yo
I'm on a mission, and my mission won't stop
Until I get the one who maxin' at the top
I hope you get his ass 'fore he drop
Kingpin kickin' back while his workers slang his rocks
Comin' up like a fat rat
Big money, big cars, big bodyguards on his back
So it's difficult to get him
But I got the hook up with somebody
Who knows how to get in contact with him
Hit him like this and like that
Let him know that I'm lookin' for a big fat dope sack
With ends to spend, so let's rush it
If you want to handle it tonight, we'll discuss it
Do it on his time, at the fool's place
Take my strap just in case one of his boys recognize my face
'Cause if he do, then he's another
Witness to hit because I'm goin' Deep Cover

[Chorus: Dr. Dre & Snoop]
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Creep with me as I crawl through the hood
Maniac, lunatic, call him Snoop Eastwood
Kickin' dust as I bust police
And, you'll never hear me hollerin' 'bout "Peace"
So yo, you should know I don't care for a cop
So why would you really ever think that it would stop?
Plot, yeah, that's what we's about to do
Take yo' ass on a mission with the boys in blue
Dre (What up, Snoop?) Yo, I got the feelin'
Tonight's the night, like Betty Wright, and I'm chillin'
Killin', feelin' no remorse
Yeah, so let's go straight to the undercover source
And see what we can find
Crooked cops that pop us and give us a gang of time
And now they wanna make a deal with me
Scoop me up and put me on they team and chill with me
And make my pockets fat
They want to meet with me tonight at seven o'clock
So, what's up with that?
What you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)
I got the gauge, a Uzi, and my nickel-plated twenty-two
So, if you wanna blast, fool, we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em, then we stuck 'em, well, it's on
("I can feel it!")

[Chorus: Dr. Dre & Snoop]
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop

[Verse 3: Snoop, Dr. Dre, Both]
Six-four-five was the time on the clock
When me and my homie bailed in the parkin' lot
The scene looked strange and it felt like a setup
Better not be, 'cause if it is, they gettin' lit up
Oh, here they come from the back in they 'Lacs
I'm checkin' for the gats they strap, so what's up, black?
Chill, let's hear the deal
If it ain't up to what you feel, then grab your steel
Right, so, what you undercovers gon' come at me with?
Hope you ain't wantin' none of my dope or my grip
Yo (Guess what they told me?)
"We give you 20 G's if you snitch on your homie
We'll put you in a home, and make your life plush
Oh yeah, but you got to sell dope for us."
Hmm, let me think about it
Turned my back and grabbed my gat
And guess what I told him before I shot him
If you don't quit, yeah, if you don't stop, yeah
I'm lettin' my gat pop, 'cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop

[Chorus: Dr. Dre & Snoop]
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop

[Verse 1: Snoop Doggy Dogg & Dr. Dre]
One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
(Before I have to pull the strap out the cut)
Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
'Cause ain't nuthin' but a G thang, baby
Two loced out G's going crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But, um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a trick I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earnin' her man and learnin' her man
And at the same time burnin' her man
Now, when she burnin', I'ma chill for a minute
'Cause ain't no lovin' good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)
And that's realer than Real Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

[Chorus: Dr. Dre & Snoop, Snoop]
It's like this and like that and like this and a—
It's like that and like this and like that and a—
It's like this and like that and like this and a—
Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Well, I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm creepin'
But I damn near got caught 'cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
With a producer who can rap and control the Maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky sh... (Yeah)
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
Of what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

[Chorus: Dr. Dre & Snoop, Dr. Dre, Snoop]
It's like this and like that and like this and a—
It's like that and like this and like that and a—
It's like this
And we ain't got no love for those
So just chill 'til the next episode

[Refrain: Kid Dynamite, Public Enemy, Congress Alley]
You've got the feeling
Rock the other side
You've got the feeling (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Snoop, Dr. Dre, Both]
Fallin' back on that ass with a hellafied gangsta lean
Gettin' funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh, yes, I'm fresh, N, double-O, P
D, O, double-G, Y, D, O, double-G, you see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolemite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for another one of those G hits
So, Dre (What up, Dogg?)
We gotta give 'em what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off somethin' (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton)

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre & (Snoop)]
Is where it takes place, so when asked, your attention
Mobbin' with Tha Dogg Pound (Bow wow wow)
Droppin' the funky tracks that's makin' the suckers just mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close and you're bound to get smacked
My little homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if your woman wanna trip, I have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' it straight together
Like my homie D.O.C., no one can do it better

[Chorus: Dr. Dre & Snoop, Dr. Dre, Snoop]
Like this, that and this and a—
It's like that and like this and like that and a—
It's like this
And we ain't go no love for those
So just chill 'til the next episode

[Outro: Kid Dynamite, Public Enemy, Congress Alley]
You've got the feeling
Rock the other side
You've got the feeling (Yeah, yeah)
You've got the feeling
Rock the other side
You've got the feeling (Yeah, yeah)
You've got the feeling
Rock the other side
You've got the feeling (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
From the depths of the sea, back to the block

Went solo on that ass, but it's still the same
Long Beach is the spot where I serve my 'caine
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, but you better not slip
'Cause nine-trizzay's the yizzear for me to clizzock my grip
So I ain't holdin' nuttin' back
And once again, I got five on the twenty sack
It's like that and as a mattеr of fact (Rat-tat-tat-tat)
'Cause I never hеsitate to put a fool on his back
Yeah, so peep out the manuscript
You see that it's a must we drop gangsta...
Hold up, what's my name?

And none of y'all can GET with that
Hit I just dropped 'cause you know it don't stop
Mr. One Eight Seven on a undercover cop
Tic toc, never the Glock, just some nuts and a cock
Rob you for your ends then I kill you bloodclots
Then I step through the fog and I creep through the smog
'Cause I'm Snoop Doggy (Who?) Doggy (What?) Doggy (Dogg)

[Chorus]
Snoop Doggy Dogg
Snoop Doggy Dogg (The bomb)
Bow wow wow yippie-yo-yippie-yay
Bow wow wow yippie-yo (The bomb)
Bow wow wow yippie-yo-yippie-yay
Bow wow wow yippie yo yo yo yo (Dog)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Now just throw your hands way up in the air
And wave 'em all around like ya just don't care (Dog)
Yeah, roll up the dank, and pour the drank
And watch your stank (Why?) 'cause Doggy's on the gank
My bankroll's on swoll
I'm still on hit, legit, now I'm on parole, stroll
With Tha Dogg Pound right behind me
And rollin' with my... that's where ya might find me
Layin' that, playin' that G Thang
She want the G with the biggest sack, and who's that?
He is I, and I am him, slim with the tilted brim
(What's your name, fool?)

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
From the depths of the sea, back to the block
Snoop Doggy Dogg, funky as the, the, The D.O.C
Went solo on that ass, but it's still the same
Long Beach is the spot where I serve my 'caine
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, but you better not slip
'Cause nine-trizzay's the yizzear for me to clizzock my grip
So I ain't holdin' nuttin' back
And once again, I got five on the twenty sack
It's like that and as a mattеr of fact (Rat-tat-tat-tat)
'Cause I never hеsitate to put a fool on his back
Yeah, so peep out the manuscript
You see that it's a must we drop gangsta...

And I'm right back up in ya with Dr. Dre

And none of y'all can GET with that
Hit I just dropped 'cause you know it don't stop
Mr. One Eight Seven on a undercover cop

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
It's like everywhere I lizzook and everywhere I go
I'm hearin' somebody tryna steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, 'cause, see, my homie Coolio
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the door
You know some of these fools are so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt, seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, patty-wack
I still got the biggest sack
So put your gun away, run away, 'cause I'm back (Why?)
Hit 'em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up (Now)
Tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, 'cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for the break off, shake off, now take off your clothes
And quit tryin' to spit at my hoes
Speakin' of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb 'cause I rolled you a joint?
You'se a flea, and I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my paws, alls
Y'alls bustas better recognize (Uh-huh)
And see where I'm coming from: it's still Eastside
'Til I die - why ask why?
As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-double G-Y

[Chorus: The Dramatics & Nanci Fletcher]
It's a crazy, mixed-up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World
It's a Doggy Dogg World (It's a Doggy Dogg World)
The Dogg's world

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Ayy, well if you show me ten freaks, I'll run up in all ten
Seen the homie Snoop Dogg sippin' juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm for the set-trip to get papers
Styles vary, packin' flavor like Lifesavers
Ain't that somethin'? You keep talkin' and I'm dumpin' (Blaow)
I had the fool whole block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique, I'm unique like China
You'll never find a bomber rhymer than this Dogg behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm comin' through
One, two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
A menace, and I'm usin' 'em like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and poppin'
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I wanna see some panties droppin'
I'm coming from L.A
She used to chill with Dre up in Compton

[Bridge: The Dramatics, Daz Dillinger, Tha Dogg Pound]
Ba ba ba ba ba ba, it's a Doggy Doggy's World
(It's your world) The Dogg's World (It's your world)
Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (All night long)
'Til when? ('Til the early morn')
And it don't stop (And uh), and it don't quit
(For the) Tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dope

[Verse 3: Daz Dillinger]
Diggity-Daz back up in you out of the cut once more
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip-flop and serve those who ain't up on it
'Til I die, I'm still screamin' out: "I never love nann trick"
Now I'm the mack daddy, had he not known about
The city where I'm from: Dum diddy dum
As you groove to the gangsta hits
The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D, the gangsta clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk
I can see you not gon' tell us all you want
So I blaze up the chronic so we can get high
I promise we smoke chronic 'til the day that we die

[Chorus: Ron Banks & (The Dramatics)]
It's a Dogg, it's a Dogg it's a Dogg (It's a Doggy Dogg World)
It's a Doggy Dogg World (The Dogg's World)
Just cool (It's a Doggy Dogg World)
Ooh, Snoop Dogg, what you gonna do? (The Dogg's world)
You've got the key, oh yeah (It's a Doggy Dogg World)
It's your world, it's a Dogg (The Dogg's world)
It's a Doggy Dogg World - what you wanna be? (It's a Doggy Dogg World)
What you see, they'll never mess with me
(It's a Doggy Dogg World) It's a Dogg (The Dogg's world)
It's a Doggy Doggy World, yeah yeah (Ooh, ooh, it's a Doggy Dogg World)
Your sho'nuff, sho'nuff, sho'nuff world (The Dogg's world)

[Outro: Ron Banks]
Just doggin' ya, just doggin' ya
Don't you know it's a Doggy Doggy World?
Talkin' 'bout Snoop Dogg and you dog and you snoop, yeah
Talkin' 'bout Snoop, talkin' 'bout you, Snoop

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Kurupt]
La-da-da-da-dah
It's the one and only D-O-double-G (Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg)
La-da-da-da-dah
You know I'm mobbin' with the D-R-E
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know the West Coast is back for all you suckers
What? What? What? What?
So put somethin' in the air (Blaze it up, blaze up)
Put it in the air, yeah (Blaze it up), 'sup, Snoop?

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Top Dogg, bite 'em all, yeah, I'm burnin' it up
DPGC, you should be turnin' it up (Turn it up)
CPT, LBC, yeah, we hookin' back up
And when they bang this in the club, baby, you got to get up
Cuz homies, thug homies, yeah, they givin' it up
Lowlife, yo' life, boy, we livin' it up
Takin' chances while we dancin' in the party fa sho
Slipped my girl a .44 when she crept in the back do'
Chickens lookin' at me strange, but you know I don't care
Step up in this mother (What?) just a-swangin' my hair
Trick, quit talkin', Crip walk if you down with the set
Take a ****** with some grip and take this **** on this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if you happen to get cracked, trick, shut yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the S, you'll be relievin' your stress

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Kurupt]
La-da-da-da-dah
It's the one and only D-R-E (Dr. Dre, you little bustas)
La-da-da-da-dah

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
You know I'm mobbin' with the D-O-double-G
Straight off them killer streets of CPT
King of the beats, you ride to 'em in your Fleet (Fleetwood)
Or Coupe DeVille rollin' on dubs
How you feel? Whoopty whoop, what?
Dre and Snoop hittin' corners in the 'Lac (In the 'Lac)
With D.O.C. in the back, sippin' on 'gnac
Clippin' all the amps, dippin' through hoods (What hood?)
Compton, Long Beach, Inglewood
South Central out to the Westside (Westside), it's California Love
This California *** got your boy a gang of pub
I'm on one, I might bail up in the Century Club
With my jeans on, and my team strong
Get my drink on, and my smoke on
Then go home with somethin' to poke on (What's up, trick?)
Loc, it's on for the two-triple-oh
Comin' real, it's the next episode

[Outro: Nate Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Hold up, wait
For my ****** who be thinkin' we soft, we don't play
We gonna rock it 'til the wheels fall off
Hold up, wait
For my ****** who be actin' too bold, take a seat
Hope you ready for the next episode
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Yeah, up in smoke, comin' at ya
Up in smoke, yeah
Up in smoke, comin' at ya
Up in smoke, yeah
Up in smoke, comin' at ya
Up in smoke

[Intro: Xzibit]
Yeah, time to bring your ass to the table, y’all
It’s X to the Z, Xzibit, yeah
Yeah, Snoop double D, uh, OG
(Where you at? West Coast, Los Angeles)
What
Bringin' it live, Dr. Dre, what
Throwin' up a big ass W coverin' up the world, right
Yeah, ha
Listen

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
You ain't tryna hot box with me, I swing much quicker
Goin' down by the second round, all hail the underground
How that sound? Xzibit backin' down from a conflict
Nothin' but nonsense and terrorists keep the bomb lit
Glass and metal in every direction
Anybody tryna stop us taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
The reason you talkin' loud but keep on steppin'
Xzibit ready to scrap like Mike Tyson with his license back
9 to 5 minimum wage? What type of life is that
For me? It's blasphemy
You touchin' down with the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You had the audacity to wanna tangle with the X
I suggest you give me five feet and show some respect
Stay hungry, always stackin' my loot
While other rappers gettin' "Treated Like a Prostitute"
Just check the SoundScan

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
All I wanna be was a G, ha
My whole life, homie please, ha
Breakin' off these keys for the G's, ha
Let's do this for them DPG's, ha
Homie, you don't wanna step to this
Ah nah, big Snoop Dogg
Back up in the heezy, baby
You jockin' my style? You so crazy
Dre say, ain't "No Limit" to this (Ain't no limit)
As long as we drop gangsta hits
Now look here, trick, you fine and I dig your style
Come chill with a playa, do it doggystyle
I'll be gentle, sentimental
Yeah, we did it in a rental
Lincoln Continental, hmm
Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
(Hell yeah)
I get the coochie everywhere that I go
(Y'all know what time it is)
Ask the chickens in your hood 'cause they know
(It don't stop, that's how we doin' it, y'all)
I get the coochie everywhere that I go
(You know about a playa like me)
Ask the chickens in your hood 'cause they know
(I pimp this game, y'all)

[Chorus: Xzibit]
Trick, please, me and Snoop came to give you what you need
Look, you dealin' with some real OG's
I'll show you how to flip it into cheese
Trick, please; trick, please
You're lookin' for some real OG's
Me and Snoop came to give you what you need
Yeah, I'll show you how to flip it into cheese
Trick, freeze

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Trick, please - now what you need to do is
Hem my coat, and pass me some smoke (For real)
Different strokes (Uh-huh) for different folks
Oh, you like settin' homies up and gettin' them locs?
Ol' cute lil' freak with a whole lotta heart
The lick gets thick when them lights gets dark
She say she got a lick for me (Well, hook it up then)
Worth about 200 G's and 30 ki's
Now check this out, Dre: now, if I don't move
Then a G like me, then I don't lose
But you know me, Dogg, I'm movin'
Ain't nothin' to it but to get to groovin'
You've been waitin' on a G like me (What up?)
To take that chance and rob your man and beat up the coochie
A victim of the circumstance (What up? What up?)
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
See, we go out with a bang (Bang, bang)
I'm tryna work this cold thang
And take this whole thang

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
I get the money everywhere that I go (I go)
I bust a trick and take her money fo' sho (Fo' sho)
I get the money everywhere that I go (I go)
I bust a trick and take her money fo' sho (Fo' sho)

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming DPG 'til the day I D-I-E
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming DPG 'til the day I D-I-E
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming DPG 'til the day I D-I-E
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming DPG 'til the day I D-I-E

[Verse 1]
Its four in the morning
Call you on the phone
Leave you a message
Asking why you ain’t home
But I know that you’re 3 shots deep at the bar
And about to get stoned

[Verse 2]
All your toe-head girlfriends keep you out late
Get you one step closer to another mistake
But baby don’t forget who can give you that real
When the other loves fake

[Pre-Chorus]
I said Ooooo
Ooooooo
I know you’re going through changes
Changes

[Chorus]
You wanna run around and ride the waves
Baby run, I know you love the chase
As long as you never run away
Baby don’t ever run away
You wanna drink, you know its on the house
You wanna run until the crazy hours
As long as you never run away
Baby don’t ever run away

[Post-Chorus]
Oooooo
Ooooo
I know you’re going through changes
Changes

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooooo
Ooooo
I know you’re going through changes
Changes

[Chorus]
You wanna run around and ride the waves
Baby run, I know you love the chase
As long as you never run away
Baby don’t ever run away
You wanna drink, you know its on the house
You wanna run until the crazy hours
As long as you never run away
Baby don’t ever run away

[Verse 1]
Kiss you goodbye, don't start to cry
Got company
I gotta run, I gotta run
They are after me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not about you, ooh
It's not about you, ooh
It's about me
I'm wanted, baby
Most wanted, baby

[Chorus]
All these bitches want something from me
Got me fucked up on LA money
Fake-ass fiction saying that they love me, oh
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am

[Verse 2]
My famous friends forgot again
That everybody dies
What's happening is not what you see
All the pictures lie, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not about you, ooh
It's not about you, ooh
It's about me
I'm wantеd, baby
Most wanted, baby

[Chorus]
All these bitchеs want something from me
Got me fucked up on LA money
Fake-ass fiction saying that they love me, oh
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am

[Bridge]
Hanging out, with the criminals
Got our faces on the billboards
Hanging out, with the criminals
Yeah

[Chorus]
All these bitches want something from me
Got me fucked up, got me fucked up, LA money
Fake-ass fiction saying that they love me, oh
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am

[Verse 1]
It’s not about you right now
It’s not about what went down
It’s just about time to be on my own two feet and to do my thing, I’m out
We’re on a different wave, two souls on a different page
I’m on the run so please don’t chase

[Chorus]
Hey, gotta go, yeah I’m tying up my laces
You can’t come cause we’re going different places
Adios we can never be the same if one of us stays and the other one changes
I know you’ll think this is one of my phases, but this time it ain’t one of those cases
Truth is you can nеver be the samе if one of us stays and the other one changes (That’s not my vibe no more)
Changes (that’s not my vibe no more)
Changes (that’s not my vibe no more)
Not what we were before, that’s not my vibe no more

[Verse 2]
I wanna drink wanna not come home, don’t call me turning off my phone
Go ahead tell me I’m too old to be out all night still getting this high that’s right
We’re on a different wave, two souls on a different page
I’m on the run so please don’t chase

[Chorus]
Hey, gotta go, yeah I’m tying up my laces
You can’t come cause we’re going different places
Adios we can never be the same if one of us stays and the other one changes
I know you’ll think this is one of my phases, but this time it ain’t one of those cases
Truth is you can never be the same if one of us stays and the other one changes (That’s not my vibe no more)
Changes (that’s not my vibe no more)
Changes (that’s not my vibe no more)
(Changes) Not what we were before, that’s not my vibe no more

[Refrain]
(Hey) The sun is shining let’s go out
The moon is meant for dancing to the sound
The music’s too damn loud, it shakes the ground
I’ve turned it down before, that’s not my vibe no more

[Chorus]
Hey, gotta go, yeah I’m tying up my laces
You can’t come cause we’re going different places
Adios we can never be the same if one of us stays and the other one changes
I know you’ll think this is one of my phases, but this time it ain’t one of those cases
Truth is you can never be the same if one of us stays and the other one changes (That’s not my vibe no more)
Changes (that’s not my vibe no more)
Changes (that’s not my vibe no more)
Not what we were before, that’s not my vibe no more

[Intro]
Don’t you fall for it
Don’t you fall for it

[Verse 1]
Keep your head up, never let up
Never let them get you fed up
You just step up, get your rep up
